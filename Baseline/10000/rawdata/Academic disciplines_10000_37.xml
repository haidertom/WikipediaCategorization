He was found dead under unexplained circumstances in April 2018.

Aaron Traywick was a resident of [[Elmore, Alabama|Elmore]], Alabama, and a graduate of [[Stanhope Elmore High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooksidefuneralhomeal.com/obituaries/Aaron-Traywick/#!/Obituary|title=Mr. Aaron James Traywick: Obituary &amp; Service Information|last=|first=|date=|website=Brookside Funeral Home {{!}} Memorial Services|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Montevallo]] in Alabama with a degree in interdisciplinary studies; he held no background in the sciences or formal training in clinical medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/05/01/dc-spa-confirms-controversial-ceo-aaron-traywick-died-premises/|title=DC Spa Confirms Controversial CEO Aaron Traywick Died on Its Premises {{!}} Washingtonian|date=2018-05-01|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 2016 he worked to advocate investment in radical approaches towards [[Life extension|anti-aging]] at the [[Edwina Rogers#Global Healthspan Policy Institute|Global Healthspan Policy Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2016/01/global-healthspan-policy-institute-launches/ Jan. 25, 2015: New Thinktank to Promote Research, Innovation for Treatment of Underlying Causes of Aging-Related Disease]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he founded Ascendance Biomedical in Washington, D.C. with the mission to “make cutting edge biomedical technologies available for everyone”. 

Traywick's self-administered [[Do it yourself|DIY]] homemade gene therapies received substantial media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/02/08/biohackers-injecting-themselves-internet-homemade-drugs-thing-12535|title=Biohackers Injecting Themselves on the Internet with Homemade Drugs is a Thing {{!}} American Council on Science and Health|website=www.acsh.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42989077|title=Bodyhackers: Bold, inspiring and terrifying|last=Lee|first=Dave|date=2018-02-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41990981|title=Why I injected myself with an untested gene therapy|last=Lussenhop|first=Jessica|date=2017-11-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a16691487/fda-gene-therapy-concern-crispr/|title=People Are Treating Themselves With DIY Gene Therapies and the Government Is Getting Worried|date=2018-02-08|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16973432/biohacking-aaron-traywick-ascendance-biomedical-health-diy-gene-therapy|title=A biohacker injected himself with a DIY herpes treatment in front of a live audience|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://futurism.com/bad-idea-biohacker/|title=Surprise!

The door was closed although unlocked. The room was dark, though its automatic lights should have been activated when the tank's lid was opened. Traywick was discovered in the tank, which had automatically drained by that point. Emergency responders arrived within four minutes of the spa's 911 call.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/05/02/aaron-traywick-dc-spa-says-police-found-drug-paraphernalia/|title=Police Reportedly Found Drug Paraphernalia Among Aaron Traywick's Belongings|date=2018-05-02|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traywick’s body was taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for an autopsy. A spokesperson for the spa told reporters that DC police twice told her they found drug paraphernalia among Traywick's belongings;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/05/02/aaron-traywick-dc-spa-says-police-found-drug-paraphernalia/|title=Police Reportedly Found Drug Paraphernalia Among Aaron Traywick's Belongings|date=2018-05-02|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC police did not confirm this point. Toxicology reports were said to be expected six to ten weeks following autopsy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

An autopsy report provided to Bloomberg News on June 28 by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner showed that he accidentally drowned with the drug [[ketamine]] in his system. Ketamine, a [[Dissociative|dissociative anesthetic]], is sometimes used as a [[Ketamine#Recreational use|recreational drug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-29/autopsy-reveals-biohacker-traywick-died-from-accidental-drowning|title=It Wasn't Biohacking That Killed the Biohacker: He Drowned|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Transhumanism|Transhumanist Party]] issued an official statement about his death, saying it was, as far as they were aware, a "tragic accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transhumanist-party.org/2018/05/02/ustp-traywick-statement/|title=U.S. Transhumanist Party Official Statement on the Death of Aaron Traywick – U.S. Transhumanist Party – Official Website|website=transhumanist-party.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apotropaic pentagram at Niemala.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Apotropaic marking on a farmhouse from Niemelä Tenant Farm, now exhibited at [[Seurasaari|Seurasaari Open Air Museum]] in [[Finland]]]]

'''Apotropaic marks''' are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building [[Apotropaic magic|to keep witches out]]. They are sometimes called witches' marks, a term also used to denote [[witches' mark|identifying marks once thought to be found on the bodies of witches]].

==Marks on buildings==
Apotropaic marks (from Greek ''apotrepein'' "to ward off" from ''apo-'' "away" and ''trepein'' "to turn") are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building with the intention of keeping witches out through [[apotropaic magic]].&lt;ref name=Kennedy2016&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |title=Witches' marks: public asked to seek ancient scratchings in buildings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/31/witches-marks-historic-england-evil-spirits |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=31 October 2016 |date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil was thought to be held at bay through a wide variety of apotropaic objects such as [[amulet]]s and [[talisman]]s against the [[evil eye]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11843">'''Artifact-centric business process model'''  represents an operational [[business process model|model of business processes]] in which the changes and evolution of [[business data]], or [[Business entity (computer science)|business entities]], are considered as the main driver of the processes. The artifact-centric approach, also called activity-centric or process-centric business process modeling, focuses on describing how business data is change/updated, by a particular action or task, throughout the process.

== Overview ==
In general, a process model describes activities conducted in order to achieve business goals, informational structures, and organizational resources. [[Workflow]]s, as a typical [[process modeling]] approach, often emphasize the sequencing of activities (i.e., [[control flow]]s), but ignore the informational perspective or treat it only within the context of single activities. Without a complete view of the informational context, business actors often focus on what should be done instead of what can be done, hindering operational innovations.

Business process modeling is a foundation for design and management of business processes. Two key aspects of business process modeling are a formal framework that integrates both control flow and data, and a set of tools to assist all aspects of a business process life cycle. A typical business process life cycle includes at least a design phase, concerned with the “correct” realization of business logic in a resource-constrained environment, and an operational phase, concerned with optimizing and improving execution (operations). Traditional business process models emphasize a procedural and/or graph-based paradigm (i.e., control flow). Thus, methodologies to design workflow in those models are typically process-centric. It has been argued that a data-centric perspective is more useful for designing business processes in the modern era.

Intuitively, business artifacts (or simply artifacts) are data objects whose manipulations define the underlying processes in a business model. Recent engineering and development efforts have adopted the artifact approach for design and analysis of business models. An important distinction between artifact-centric models and traditional data flow (computational) models is that the notion of the life cycle of the data objects is prominent in the former, while not existing in the latter.

== Research and history ==
Artifact-centric modeling is an area of growing interest. Nigam and Caswell&lt;ref&gt;Nigam, A. and N.S. Caswell, Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification. IBM Syst. J., 2003. 42(3): p. 428-445.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of business artifacts and information-centric processing of artifact lifecycles. Kumaran et al.'s further studies on artifact-centric business processes can be found here.&lt;ref name="BH2005"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., A model-driven approach to industrializing discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL, 2005. CCCT CCCEC(1): p. 145-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BH2007"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., et al., Towards Formal Analysis of Artifact-Centric Business Process Models, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 288-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIU2007"&gt;Liu, R., K. Bhattacharya, and F. Wu, Modeling Business Contexture and Behavior Using Business Artifacts, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2007. p. 324-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhattacharya&lt;ref name="BH2005" /&gt; described a successful business engagement which applies business artifact techniques to industrialize discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. Liu et al.&lt;ref name="LIU2007"/&gt; formulated nine commonly used patterns in information-centric business operation models and developed a computational model based on Petri Nets. Bhattacharya, K., et al.&lt;ref name="BH2007"/&gt; provides a formal model for artifact-centric business processes with complexity results concerning static analysis of the semantics of such processes. Kumaran et al.&lt;ref&gt;Kumaran, S., R. Liu, and F. Wu, On the Duality of Information-Centric and Activity-Centric Models of Business Processes, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2008. p. 32-47.&lt;/ref&gt; presented the formalized information-centric approach to discovering business entities from activity-centric process models and transforming such models into artifact-centric business process models. An algorithm was provided to achieve this transformation automatically.

Other approaches related to artifact-centric modelling can be found in,.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"&gt;[[Van der Aalst, W.M.P.]], [[Mathias Weske|M. Weske]], and D. Grünbauer, Case handling: a new paradigm for business process support. Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering, 2005. 53(2): p. 129-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WANG2005"&gt;Wang, J. and A. Kumar, A Framework for Document-Driven Workflow Systems, in Business Process Management. 2005. p. 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Aalst et al.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"/&gt; provides a case-handling approach where a process is driven by the presence of data objects instead of control flows. A case is similar to the business entity concept in many respects. Wang and Kumar&lt;ref name="WANG2005"/&gt; proposed the document-driven workflow systems which is designed based on data dependencies without the need for explicit control flows. Muller et al.&lt;ref name="MULLER2007"&gt;Müller, D., M. Reichert, and J. Herbst, Data-Driven Modeling and Coordination of Large Process Structures, in On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2007: CoopIS, DOA, ODBASE, GADA, and IS. 2009. p. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced the framework for the data-driven modelling of large process structures, namely COREPRO. The approach reduces modelling efforts significantly and provides mechanisms for maintaining data-driven process structures.

Another related thread of work is the use of state machines to model object lifecycles. Industries often define data objects and standardize their lifecycles as state machines to facilitate interoperability between industry partners and enforce legal regulations.&lt;ref name="RYNDINA2007"&gt;Ryndina, K., J. Küster, and H. Gall, Consistency of Business Process Models and Object Life Cycles, in Models in Software Engineering. 2007. p. 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding et al.&lt;ref name="REDDING2008"&gt;Redding, G., et al., Generating business process models from object behavior models. Information Systems Management, 2008. 25(4): p. 319-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and Küster et al.&lt;ref name="KUSTER2007"&gt;Küster, J., K. Ryndina, and H. Gall, Generation of Business Process Models for Object Life Cycle Compliance, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 165-181.&lt;/ref&gt; give techniques to generate business processes which are compliant with predefined object lifecycles. In addition, event-driven process modelling, for example, Event-driven Process Chains (EPC), also describes object lifecycles glued by events.

More recent and closely related work on artifact-centric process model can be found in.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"&gt;Gerede, C. and J. Su, Specification and Verification of Artifact Behaviors in Business Process Models, in Service-Oriented Computing – ICSOC 2007. 2009. p. 181-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"&gt;Gerede, C.E., K. Bhattacharya, and J. Su, Static analysis of business artifact-centric operational models. Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications, SOCA 2007, 2007: p. 133-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"&gt;Fritz, C., R. Hull, and J. Su, Automatic construction of simple artifact-based business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"&gt;Deutsch, A., et al., Automatic verification of data-centric business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerede and Su&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"/&gt; developed a specification language ABSL to specify artifact behaviours in artifact-centric process models. The authors showed decidability results of our language for different cases and provided key insights on how artifact-centric view can affect the specification of desirable business properties. Gerede et al.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"/&gt; identified important classes of properties on artifact-centric operational models focusing on persistence, uniqueness and arrival properties. They proposed a formal model for artifact-centric operational models to enable a static analysis of these properties and showed that the formal model guarantees persistence and uniqueness.

Fritz, Hull, and Su&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"/&gt; formulated the technical problem of goal-directed workflow construction in the context of declarative artifact-centric workflow, and develop results concerning the general setting, design time analysis, and the synthesis of workflow schemas from goal specifications. The work is among the important initial steps along the path towards eventual support for tools that enable substantial automation for workflow design, analysis, and modification. Deutsch et al.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"/&gt; introduced the artifact system model, which formalizes a business process modelling paradigm that has recently attracted the attention of both the industrial and research communities. The problem of automatic verification of artifact systems, with the goal of increasing confidence in the correctness of such business processes is also studied.

Sira and Chengfei&lt;ref name="YONGCHAREON2010"&gt;Yongchareon, S., Liu, C.: Process View Framework for Artifact-Centric Business Processes, in R. Meersman et al. (Eds.): OTM 2010, Part I. LNCS, vol. 6426, pp. 26–43. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel view framework for artifact-centric business processes. It consists of artifact-centric process model, process view model, a set of consistency rules, and the construction approach for building process views. The formal model of artifact-centric business processes and views, namely ACP, is defined and used to describe artifacts, services, business rules that control the processes, as well as views. They developed a bottom-up abstraction mechanism for process view construction to derive views from underlying process models according to view requirements. Consistency rules are also defined to preserve the consistency between constructed view and its underlying process. This work can be considered as one approach to the abstraction, i.e., generalization of artifact-centric business processes. The framework has also been extended to address modelling and change validation of inter-organizational business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yongchareon|first1=Sira|title=A view framework for modeling and change validation of artifact-centric inter-organizational business processes|journal=Information Systems|date=2015|volume=47|pages=51–81|doi=10.1016/j.is.2014.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biofilm may also be considered a hydrogel, which is a complex polymer that contains many times its dry weight in water. Biofilms are not just bacterial slime layers but biological systems; the bacteria organize themselves into a coordinated functional community. Biofilms can attach to a surface such as a tooth, rock, or surface, and may include a single species or a diverse group of microorganisms. The biofilm bacteria can share nutrients and are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as desiccation, antibiotics, and a host body's immune system. A biofilm usually begins to form when a free-swimming bacterium attaches to a surface.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Iridescent biofilm on a fishtank.JPG|thumb|300px|An [[iridescence|iridescent]] biofilm on the surface of a fish tank.]]

The formation of a biofilm begins with the attachment of free-floating microorganisms to a surface.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first colonist bacteria of a biofilm may adhere to the surface initially by the weak [[van der Waals force]]s and hydrophobic effects.&lt;ref name="pmid11397632"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Briandet R, Herry J, Bellon-Fontaine M | title = Determination of the van der Waals, electron donor and electron acceptor surface tension components of static Gram-positive microbial biofilms | journal = Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–310 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11397632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20438621"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi H, Suda T, Tanaka Y, Kimura B | title = Cellular hydrophobicity of Listeria monocytogenes involves initial attachment and biofilm formation on the surface of polyvinyl chloride | journal = Lett.

[[Hydrophobicity]] can also affect the ability of bacteria to form biofilms. Bacteria with increased hydrophobicity have reduced repulsion between the substratum and the bacterium.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Donlan RM | year = 2002 | title = Biofilms: Microbial Life on Surfaces | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 9| pages = 881–890 | doi=10.3201/eid0809.020063 | pmid=12194761 | pmc=2732559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteria species are not able to attach to a surface on their own successfully due to their limited motility but are instead able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to other, earlier bacteria colonists. [[Non-motile bacteria]] cannot recognize surfaces or aggregate together as easily as motile bacteria.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt;

During surface colonization bacteria cells are able to communicate using [[quorum sensing]] (QS) products such as [[N-acyl homoserine lactone]] (AHL). Once colonization has begun, the biofilm grows by a combination of cell division and recruitment. [[Polysaccharide]] matrices typically enclose bacterial biofilms. In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt; The final stage of biofilm formation is known as dispersion, and is the stage in which the biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size.

The development of a biofilm may allow for an aggregate cell colony (or colonies) to be increasingly [[antibiotic resistance|resistant to antibiotics]]. Cell-cell communication or [[quorum sensing]] has been shown to be involved in the formation of biofilm in several bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;Quorum-Sensing Regulation of the Biofilm Matrix Genes (pel) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal ==
[[File:Honors Option-MMG.svg|thumb|Biofilm Dispersal]]
Dispersal of cells from the biofilm colony is an essential stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|biofilm extracellular matrix]], such as [[dispersin B]] and [[deoxyribonuclease]], may contribute to biofilm dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Ramasubbu N, Fine DH |title=Detachment of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells by an endogenous beta-hexosaminidase activity |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=185 |issue=16 |pages=4693–8 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896987 |pmc=166467 |doi=10.1128/JB.185.16.4693-4698.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Izano EA, Amarante MA, Kher WB, Kaplan JB |title=Differential roles of poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide and extracellular DNA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=470–6 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18039822 |pmc=2223269 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02073-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enzymes that degrade the biofilm matrix may be useful as anti-biofilm agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Velliyagounder K, Fine DH, Ramasubbu N |title=Enzymatic detachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=2633–6 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15215120 |pmc=434209 |doi=10.1128/AAC.48.7.2633-2636.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Xavier JB, Picioreanu C, Rani SA, van Loosdrecht MC, Stewart PS |title=Biofilm-control strategies based on enzymic disruption of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix--a modelling study |journal=Microbiology |volume=151 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3817–32 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16339929 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.28165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, [[Cis-2-Decenoic acid|''cis''-2-decenoic acid]], is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies.

It is generally assumed that cells dispersed from biofilms immediately go into the planktonic growth phase. However, recent studies have shown that the physiology of dispersed cells from ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' biofilms is highly different from those of planktonic and biofilm cells.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Chua SL, Liu Y, Yam JK, Tolker-Nielsen T, Kjelleberg S, Givskov M, Yang L |title=Dispersed cells represent a distinct stage in the transition from bacterial biofilm to planktonic lifestyles |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |doi=10.1038/ncomms5462 |pmid=25042103 |pages=4462|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4462C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26158442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua SL, Hultqvist LD, Yuan M, Rybtke M, Nielsen TE, Givskov M, Tolker-Nielsen T, Yang L | title = In vitro and in vivo generation and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-dispersed cells via c-di-GMP manipulation | journal = Nat Protoc | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 1165–80 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26158442 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2015.067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the dispersal process is a unique stage during the transition from biofilm to planktonic lifestyle in bacteria. Dispersed cells are found to be highly virulent against macrophages and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', but highly sensitive towards iron stress, as compared with planktonic cells.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Properties ==

Biofilms are usually found on solid [[wikt:substrate|substrates]] submerged in or exposed to an [[aqueous]] [[solution]], although they can form as floating mats on liquid surfaces and also on the surface of leaves, particularly in high humidity climates. Given sufficient resources for growth, a biofilm will quickly grow to be macroscopic (visible to the naked eye). Biofilms can contain many different types of microorganism, e.g. [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[protozoa]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]]; each group performs specialized [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions. However, some organisms will form single-species films under certain conditions. The social structure (cooperation/competition) within a biofilm depends highly on the different species present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nadell|first=Carey D.|author2=Xavier, Joao B. |author3=Foster, Kevin R. |title=The sociobiology of biofilms |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |date=1 January 2009|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=206–224|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00150.x |pmid=19067751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extracellular matrix ===

The EPS matrix consists of [[exopolysaccharides]], proteins and nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danese|first=P. N.|last2=Pratt|first2=L.

This matrix encases the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals as well as gene exchange. The EPS matrix also traps extracellular enzymes and keeps them in close proximity to the cells. Thus, the matrix represents an external digestion system and allows for stable synergistic microconsortia of different species (Wingender and Flemming, Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 8, 623-633). Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute [[nutrient]]s and signalling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Paul|author2=Dirk deBeer |author3=Zbigniew Lewandowski |title=Liquid Flow in Biofilm Systems |journal=Appl.

Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vlamakis|first=Hera|last2=Aguilar|first2=Claudio|last3=Losick|first3=Richard|last4=Kolter|first4=Roberto|date=2008-04-01|title=Control of cell fate by the formation of an architecturally complex bacterial community|journal=Genes &amp; Development|volume=22|issue=7|pages=945–953|doi=10.1101/gad.1645008|issn=0890-9369|pmc=2279205|pmid=18381896}}&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to [[detergent]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community.

However, biofilms are not always less susceptible to antibiotics. For instance, the biofilm form of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the biofilm is compared to logarithmic-phase planktonic cells, the biofilm does have greater resistance to antimicrobials. This resistance to antibiotics in both stationary-phase cells and biofilms may be due to the presence of [[persister cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Spoering AL, Lewis K |title=Biofilms and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have similar resistance to killing by antimicrobials |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=183 |issue=23 |pages=6746–51 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11698361 |pmc=95513 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.23.6746-6751.2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacteria mats near Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|thumb|Mats of bacterial biofilm color the hot springs in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The longest raised mat area is about half a meter long.]]

Biofilms are ubiquitous in organic life. Nearly every species of microorganism have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other. Biofilms will form on virtually every non-shedding surface in [[Asepsis|non-sterile]] aqueous or humid environments. Biofilms can grow in the most extreme environments: from, for example, the extremely hot, briny waters of [[hot spring]]s ranging from very acidic to very alkaline, to frozen [[glacier]]s.

Biofilms can be found on rocks and pebbles at the bottoms of most streams or [[river]]s and often form on the surfaces of [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pools of water. Biofilms are important components of [[food chains]] in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic [[invertebrate]]s upon which many fish feed. Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, as in the case of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots, exist symbiotically with the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|title=Introduction to Biofilms: Desirable and undesirable impacts of biofilm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622002657/http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|archivedate=2008-06-22|df=}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include Citrus Canker, [[Pierce's Disease]] of grapes, and Bacterial Spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=September 2007|title=Influence of xylem fluid chemistry on planktonic growth, biofilm formation and aggregation of Xylella fastidiosa|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=274|issue=2|pages=210–7|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00827.x|pmid=17610515|vauthors=Andersen PC, Brodbeck BV, Oden S, Shriner A, Leite B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies in 2003 discovered that the immune system supports bio-film development in the large intestine. This was supported mainly with the fact that the two most abundantly produced molecules by the immune system also support bio-film production and are associated with the bio-films developed in the gut. This is especially important because the appendix holds a mass amount of these bacterial bio-films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Barbas|first2=Andrew|last3=Bush|first3=Errol|last4=Lin|first4=Shu|last5=Parker|first5=William|date=24 June 2007|title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix|url=http://sciences.surgery.duke.edu/files/BillSection1SecondInsert.pdf|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=249|issue=4|pages=826–831|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032|pmid=17936308|last1=Bollinger|first1=Randal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery helps to distinguish the possible function of the appendix and the idea that the appendix can help reinoculate the gut with good gut flora.

In the human environment, biofilms can grow in [[shower]]s very easily since they provide a moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and [[Sanitary sewer|sewage]] [[pipe (material)|pipes]] and cause clogging and [[corrosion]]. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. Biofilm in soil can cause [[bioclogging]]. Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to reduce heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/01457638108939572 |title=Influence of Fouling Biofilms on Heat Transfer |year=1981 |last1=Characklis |first1=WG |last2=Nevimons |first2=MJ |last3=Picologlou |first3=BF |journal=Heat Transfer Engineering |volume=3 |pages=23–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schwermer CU, Lavik G, Abed RM |title=Impact of nitrate on the structure and function of bacterial biofilm communities in pipelines used for injection of seawater into oil fields |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=2841–51 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18344353 |pmc=2394879 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02027-07|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that are attached to the metal subsurface (i.e., [[Microbial corrosion|microbially influenced corrosion]]).

Bacterial adhesion to boat hulls serves as the foundation for [[biofouling]] of seagoing vessels. Once a film of bacteria forms, it is easier for other marine organisms such as barnacles to attach. Such fouling can reduce maximum vessel speed by up to 20%, prolonging voyages and consuming fuel. Time in dry dock for refitting and repainting reduces the productivity of shipping assets, and the useful life of ships is also reduced due to corrosion and mechanical removal (scraping) of marine organisms from ships' hulls.

[[Stromatolites]] are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial biofilms, especially of [[cyanobacteria]]. Stromatolites include some of the most ancient records of life on Earth, and are still forming today.

=== Dental plaque ===

Within the human body, biofilms are present on the [[teeth]] as [[dental plaque]], where they may cause [[tooth decay]] and [[gum disease]]. These biofilms can either be in an uncalcified state that can be removed by dental instruments, or a calcified state which is more difficult to remove. Removal techniques can also include [[antimicrobial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandki|first=Rita|last2=Banthia|first2=Priyank|last3=Banthia|first3=Ruchi|date=2011|title=Biofilms: A microbial home|journal=Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=111–114|doi=10.4103/0972-124X.84377|issn=0972-124X|pmc=3183659|pmid=21976832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dental plaque]] is an oral biofilm that adheres to the [[teeth]] and consists of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''Candida albicans''), embedded in salivary [[polymers]] and microbial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subjects the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial [[metabolite]]s which results in dental disease.&lt;ref name="RevistaOMF"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Dec 2010|title=Microbial biofilms in dental medicine in reference to implanto-prostethic rehabilitation|url=http://www.revistaomf.ro/(8)|journal=Revista de chirurgie oro-maxilo-facială și implantologie|language=ro|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–13|issn=2069-3850|id=8|author1=Augustin Mihai|author2=Carmen Balotescu-Chifiriuc|author3=Veronica Lazăr|author4=Ruxandra Stănescu|author5=Mihai Burlibașa|author6=Dana Catrinel Ispas|accessdate=2012-06-03}}(webpage has a translation button)&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilm on the surface of teeth is frequently subject to oxidative stress&lt;ref name="pmid8519478"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1995|title=Oxygen metabolism, oxidative stress and acid-base physiology of dental plaque biofilms|url=|journal=J.

The dental plaque biofilm can result in the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from balanced populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an [[acidogenic]], aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary [[carbohydrate]]. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues ([[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and then [[dentin]]), the sign and symptom being a [[carious lesion]]. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathology of dental caries.

Competence can lead to genetic transformation, a form of sexual interaction, favored under conditions of high cell density and/or stress where there is maximal opportunity for interaction between the competent cell and the DNA released from nearby donor cells. This system is optimally expressed when ''S. mutans'' cells reside in an actively growing biofilm. Biofilm grown ''S. mutans'' cells are genetically transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than ''S. mutans'' growing as free-floating planktonic cells suspended in liquid.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

Research has shown that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics induce biofilm formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus''. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result from the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy.

=== ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' ===

''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of septicemia in HIV-infected persons. When ''S. pneumonia'' grows in biofilms, genes are specifically expressed that respond to oxidative stress and induce competence.&lt;ref name="pmid16925554"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oggioni MR, Trappetti C, Kadioglu A, Cassone M, Iannelli F, Ricci S, Andrew PW, Pozzi G |title=Switch from planktonic to sessile life: a major event in pneumococcal pathogenesis |journal=Mol.

CSP also functions as a quorum-sensing peptide. It not only induces biofilm formation, but also increases virulence in pneumonia and meningitis.

It has been proposed that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of ''S. pneumoniae'' to survive the defenses of the host.&lt;ref name=Michod /&gt; In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22706053"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wei H, Håvarstein LS |title=Fratricide is essential for efficient gene transfer between pneumococci in biofilms |journal=Appl.

=== In industry ===
Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many [[sewage treatment]] plants include a [[secondary treatment]] stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter ([[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]), while [[protozoa]] and [[rotifer]]s are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. [[Slow sand filter]]s rely on biofilm development in the same way to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate [[petroleum]] oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the [[microbial biodegradation|hydrocarbon-degrading]] activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCB).&lt;ref name="chapter9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|vauthors=Martins dos Santos VA, Yakimov MM, Timmis KN, Golyshin PN|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-17-2|pages=1971|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx6v3TIkzXUC&amp;pg=PA1971#v=onepage|editor=Díaz E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food industry ===
Biofilms have become problematic in several food industries due to the ability to form on plants and during industrial processes.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Srey S | year = | title = Biofilm formation in food industries: A food safety concern | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria can survive long periods of time in water, animal manure, and soil, causing biofilm formation on plants or in the processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;T. Tarver, "Biofilms: A Threat to Food Safety – IFT.org", Ift.org, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The buildup of biofilms can affect the heat flow across a surface and increase surface corrosion and frictional resistance of fluids.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kumar C | year = | title = Significance of microbial biofilms in food industry: a review | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can lead to a loss of energy in a system and overall loss of products.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt; Along with economic problems, biofilm formation on food poses a health risk to consumers due to the ability to make the food more resistant to disinfectants&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; As a result, from 1996 to 2010 the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimated 48 million foodborne illnesses per year.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; Biofilms have been connected to about 80% of bacterial infections in the United States.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;

In produce, microorganisms attach to the surfaces and biofilms develop internally.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; This problem is also found in ready-to-eat foods, because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt; The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is [[Salmonella]].&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mizan F | year = | title = Microbial biofilms in seafood: A food-hygiene challenge | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of salmonella contamination can be found in the poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt; Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt; The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;

New forms of cleaning procedures are being tested in order to reduce biofilm formation in these processes which will lead to safer and more productive food processing industries. These new forms of cleaning procedures also have a profound effect on the environment, often releasing toxic gases into the groundwater reservoirs.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

=== In aquaculture ===
[[File:Screen Shot 2017-12-13 at 1.40.19 PM.png|thumb|A bioflim from the [[Dead sea]]]]

In shellfish and algae farms, biofouling microbial species tend to block nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Marine biofouling on fish farms and its remediation|url=|journal=Advances in Marine Biology|volume=47|issue=|pages=215–252|author=Braithwaite R, McEvoy L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that are more favorable for biofouling species. In the marine environment, biofilms could reduce the hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliances deployed in seawater.&lt;ref name="pmid17497196"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qian PY, Lau SC, Dahms HU, Dobretsov S, Harder T | title = Marine biofilms as mediators of colonization by marine macroorganisms: implications for antifouling and aquaculture | journal = Mar.

== Eukaryotic biofilms ==
{{See also|Phototrophic biofilms}}
Along with bacteria, biofilms are often initiated and produced by eukaryotic microbes. The biofilms produced by eukaryotes is usually occupied by bacteria and other eukaryotes alike, however the surface is cultivated and EPS is secreted initially by the eukaryote.&lt;ref name="pmid16897306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Colen 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cooksey K, Wigglesworth-Cooksey B | year = 1995 | title = Adhesion of bacteria and diatoms to surfaces in the sea: a review | url = | journal = Aquatic Microbial Ecology | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.3354/ame009087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[microalgae]] are known to form biofilms in such a way. Biofilms of fungal origin are important aspects of human infection and fungal pathagenicity, as the fungal infection is more resistant to antifungals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fanning S, Mitchell AP | year = 2012 | title = Fungal Biofilms | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = e1002585 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11514524"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra J, Kuhn DM, Mukherjee PK, Hoyer LL, McCormick T, Ghannoum MA | title = Biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans: development, architecture, and drug resistance | journal = J. Bacteriol. | volume = 183 | issue = 18 | pages = 5385–94 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11514524 | pmc = 95423 | doi =10.1128/jb.183.18.5385-5394.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the environment, fungal biofilms are an area of ongoing research. One key area of research is fungal biofilms on plants. For example, in the soil, plant associated fungi including [[mycorrhiza]] have been shown to decompose organic matter, protect plants from bacterial pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications {{cite book|last1=Burmølle|first1=Mette|last2=Kjøller|first2=Annelise|last3=Sørenses|first3=Søren|editor1-last=Lear|editor1-first=Gavin|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Gillian|title=Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications|date=2012|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|isbn=1904455964|pages=61–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofilms in aquatic environments are often founded by [[diatom]]s. The exact purpose of these biofilms is unknown, however there is evidence that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress.&lt;ref name="pmid27009999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25268215"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steele DJ, Franklin DJ, Underwood GJ | title = Protection of cells from salinity stress by extracellular polymeric substances in diatom biofilms | journal = Biofouling | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 987–98 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25268215 | pmc = 4706044 | doi = 10.1080/08927014.2014.960859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the [[phycosphere]], but importantly are the bacteria associated with diatoms, as it has been shown that although diatoms excrete EPS, they only do so when interacting with certain bacteria species.&lt;ref name="pmid26986529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Windler M, Leinweber K, Bartulos CR, Philipp B, Kroth PG | title = Biofilm and capsule formation of the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum are affected by a bacterium | journal = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2965">In [[fishery|fisheries]] and [[conservation biology]], the '''catch per unit effort''' ('''CPUE''') is an [[Proxy (statistics)|indirect measure]] of the [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of a target species. Changes in the catch per unit effort are inferred to signify changes to the target species' true abundance. A decreasing CPUE indicates [[overexploitation]], while an unchanging CPUE indicates [[sustainability|sustainable harvesting]].&lt;ref name="Puertas"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kirsten M.

CPUE has a number of advantages over other methods of measuring abundance. It does not interfere with routine harvesting operations, and data are easily collected. The data are also easy to [[analysis|analyse]], even for non-specialists, in contrast to methods based on [[transect]]s. This means that decisions about [[stock management]] can also be made by the people doing the harvesting.&lt;ref name="Puertas"/&gt; The [[best practice]] is to standardise the effort employed (''e.g.'' number of traps or duration of searching), which [[Controlling for a variable|controls for]] the reduction in catch size that often results from subsequent efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William J.

A '''cosmid''' is a type of hybrid [[plasmid]] that contains a [[Lambda phage]] ''cos'' sequence
. Cosmids (''cos'' sites + plasmid = cosmids) DNA sequences are originally from the [[lambda phage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohn|first1=Barbara|last2=Murray|first2=Kenneth|title=Packaging recombinant DNA molecules into bacteriophage particles in vitro|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|date=August 1977|volume=74|issue=8|pages=3259–3263|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.8.3259|pmc=431522}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often used as a [[cloning vector]] in [[genetic engineering]]. Cosmids can be used to build [[Library (biology)|genomic libraries]]. They were first described by Collins and Hohn in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=John|last2=Hohn|first2=Barbara|title=Cosmids: a type of plasmid gene-cloning vector that is packageable in vitro in bacteriophage lambda heads|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=September 1, 1978|volume=75|issue=9|pages=4242–4246|doi=10.1073/pnas.75.9.4242|pmc=336088}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cosmids can contain 37 to 52 (normally 45) [[base pair|kb]] of DNA, limits based on the normal bacteriophage packaging size. They can [[DNA replication|replicate]] as plasmids if they have a suitable [[origin of replication]] (ori): for example [[SV40]] ori in mammalian cells, [[ColE1]] ori for double-stranded DNA replication, or [[F1 phage|f1]] ori for single-stranded DNA replication in [[prokaryote]]s. They frequently also contain a gene for selection such as [[antibiotic resistance]], so that the transformed cells can be identified by plating on a medium containing the antibiotic. Those cells which did not take up the cosmid would be unable to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc731/cloning/cloning4.htm | title=Cosmids | publisher=Phillip McClean | accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike plasmids, they can also be packaged in [[phage]] [[capsid]]s, which allows the foreign genes to be transferred into or between cells by [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]]. Plasmids become unstable after a certain amount of DNA has been inserted into them, because their increased size is more conducive to [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. To circumvent this, phage transduction is used instead. This is made possible by the ''cohesive ends'', also known as ''cos'' sites. In this way, they are similar to using the lambda phage as a vector, except ''all'' the lambda genes have been deleted with the exception of the ''cos'' sequence.

==''Cos'' sequences==
''Cos'' sequences are ~200 base pairs long and essential for packaging. They contain a ''cosN'' site where DNA is nicked at each strand, 12 bp apart, by [[terminase]]. This causes linearization of the circular cosmid with two "cohesive" or "sticky ends" of 12bp. (The DNA must be linear to fit into a phage head.) The ''cosB'' site holds the terminase while it is nicking and separating the strands. The ''cosQ'' site of next cosmid (as [[rolling circle replication]] often results in linear [[concatemers]]) is held by the terminase after the previous cosmid has been packaged, to prevent degradation by cellular [[DNase]]s.

==Cosmid features and uses==
[[File:Cosmid (English).svg|thumb|400 px|right|Scheme of DNA cloning in a cosmid vector.]]
Cosmids are predominantly plasmids with a bacterial ''oriV'', an antibiotic selection marker and a cloning site, but they carry one, or more recently two, cos sites derived from bacteriophage lambda. Depending on the particular aim of the experiment broad host range cosmids, shuttle cosmids or 'mammalian' cosmids (linked to SV40 oriV and mammalian selection markers) are available. The loading capacity of cosmids varies depending on the size of the vector itself but usually lies around 40–45 kb. The cloning procedure involves the generation of two vector arms which are then joined to the foreign DNA. Selection against wild type cosmid DNA is simply done via size exclusion. Cosmids, therefore, always form colonies and not plaques. Also the clone density is much lower with around 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Colony-forming unit|CFU]] per µg of ligated DNA.

After the construction of recombinant lambda or cosmid libraries the total DNA is transferred into an appropriate ''E. coli'' host via a technique called in vitro packaging. The necessary packaging extracts are derived from ''E. coli'' cI857 lysogens (red- gam- Sam and Dam (head assembly) and Eam (tail assembly) respectively). These extracts will recognize and package the recombinant molecules ''in vitro'', generating either mature phage particles (lambda-based vectors) or recombinant plasmids contained in phage shells (cosmids). These differences are reflected in the different infection frequencies seen in favour of lambda-replacement vectors. This compensates for their slightly lower loading capacity. Phage libraries are also stored and screened more easily than cosmid libraries.

Target DNA: the genomic DNA to be cloned has to be cut into the appropriate size range of restriction fragments. This is usually done by partial restriction followed by either size fractionation or dephosphorylation (using calf-intestine phosphatase) to avoid chromosome scrambling, i.e. the ligation of physically unlinked fragments.

[[File:Horizontalsperre nirostahl.jpg|thumb|A metal damp-proof course between the stone foundation and brick wall]]
'''Damp proofing''' in [[construction]] is a type of moisture control applied to building walls and floors to prevent [[Damp (structural)|moisture]] from passing into the interior spaces. Dampness problems are among the most frequent problems encountered in residences.

==Overview==
[[File:FlexibleRainPipe.JPG|thumb|right|250px|DPC visible between concrete foundation and brickwork.]]
''Damp proofing'' is defined by the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) as a material that resists the passage of water with no [[Hydrostatics#Hydrostatic pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] and ''waterproof'' as a treatment that resists the passage of water under pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Greenlaw, Bruce. "Moisture-Proofing New Basements", ''Foundations and concrete work''. Newtown, Connecticut: Taunton Press, 2003. 93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, damp proofing keeps moisture out of a building where [[vapor barrier]]s keep interior moisture from getting into walls. Moisture resistance is not necessarily absolute; it is usually defined by a specific [[test method]], limits, and [[engineering tolerance]]s.

Damp proofing is accomplished several ways including:
* A '''damp-proof course''' (DPC) is a barrier through the structure designed to prevent moisture rising by [[capillary action]] such as through a phenomenon known as [[Damp (structural)#Rising damp|rising damp]]. Rising damp is the effect of water rising from the ground into property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timberwise.co.uk/damp-proofing/|title=Damp Proofing {{!}} Providing The Best Damp Treatments|date=2015-08-06|work=Timberwise|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damp proof course may be horizontal or vertical.&lt;ref name="Punmia"&gt;Punmia, B. C., A. K. Jain, and Arun Kumar Jain. ''Building construction''. 10th ed. New Delhi: Laxmi Pub., 2008. 631. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A DPC layer is usually laid below all masonry walls, regardless if the wall is a [[Load-bearing wall|load bearing wall]] or a [[Wall#Partition wall|partition wall]].
* A '''damp-proof membrane''' (DPM) is a [[membrane]] material applied to prevent moisture transmission. A common example is [[polyethylene]] sheeting laid under a concrete slab to prevent the [[concrete]] from gaining moisture through capillary action.&lt;ref&gt;"Damp-proof membrane (dpm, DPM)" def. 1. Gorse, Christopher A., and David Johnston. ''A dictionary of construction, surveying, and civil engineering''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A DPM may be used for the DPC.
* '''Integral damp proofing''' in concrete involves adding materials to the concrete mix to make the concrete itself impermeable.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;
* '''Surface coating''' with thin water proof materials for resistance to non-pressurized moisture such as rain water or a coating of cement sprayed on such as [[shotcrete]] which can resist water under pressure.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;
* '''Cavity wall construction''', such as [[rainscreen]] construction, is where the interior walls are separated from the exterior walls by a cavity.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;
* '''[[Pressure grouting]]''' cracks and joints in masonry materials.&lt;ref name="Punmia" /&gt;

==Materials==
Materials widely used for damp proofing include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=P.C. Varghese|title=Building Materials|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year=2005|ISBN=81-203-2848-5|page=230|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBamtq45OykC&amp;pg=PT248&amp;lpg=PT248#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexible materials like [[butyl rubber]], hot bitumen ([[asphalt]]), plastic sheets, [[Bituminous waterproofing#Roofing felt|bituminous felts]], sheets of [[lead]], [[copper]], etc.
* Semi-rigid materials like [[Asphalt concrete#Mixture formulations|mastic asphalt]]
* Rigid materials, like impervious [[brick]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[slate]], [[Cement-mortar lined ductile iron pipe|cement mortar]], or cement concrete painted with bitumen, etc.
* Stones
*[[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] with waterproofing compounds
* Coarse [[sand]] layers under floors
* Continuous plastic sheets under floors

==Masonry construction==
A DPC is a durable, impermeable material such as slate, [[Bituminous waterproofing#Roofing felt|felt paper]], metal, plastic or special engineered bricks&lt;ref&gt;Curtin, William George. Structural masonry designers' manual. 3rd ed. revised Oxford: Blackwell Science, 2008. 314. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; bedded into the mortar between two courses of bricks or blocks. It can often be seen as a thin line in the mortar near ground level. To create a continuous barrier, pieces of DPC or DPM may be sealed together. In addition, the DPC may be sealed to the DPM around the outside edges of the ground floor, completely sealing the inside of the building from the damp ground around it.

In a masonry [[cavity wall]], there is usually a DPC in both the outer and inner wall.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In the outer wall it is normally {{convert|150|mm}} to {{convert|200|mm||abbr=on}} above ground level (the height of 2-3 brick courses). This allows rain to form puddles and splash up off the ground, without saturating the wall above DPC level. The wall below the DPC may become saturated in rainy weather. The DPC in the inner wall is usually below floor level, (under a suspended timber floor structure), or, with a solid concrete floor, it is usually found immediately above the floor slab so that it can be linked to the DPM under the floor slab. This enables installation of skirting boards above floor level without fear of puncturing it. Alternatively, instead of fitting separate inner and outer DPCs, it is common in commercial housebuilding to use a one-piece length of rigid plastic, (albeit an angled section), which fits neatly across the cavity and slots into both walls (a cavity tray). This method requires the need for weep vents to enable rainwater ingress to drain from the cavities otherwise rising dampness could occur from above the DPC.

==Concrete walls and floors==
[[Concrete]] normally allows moisture to pass through so a ''vertical damp proof barrier'' is needed. Barriers may be a coating or membrane applied to the exterior of the concrete. The coating may be [[asphalt]], asphalt emulsion, a thinned asphalt called cutback asphalt, or an [[elastomer]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenlaw, Bruce. "Moisture-Proofing New Basements", ''Foundations and concrete work''. Newtown, Connecticut: Taunton Press, 2003. 93-101. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Membranes are rubberized asphalt or [[EPDM rubber]]. Rubberized products perform better because concrete sometimes develops cracks and the barrier does not crack with the concrete.

==Remedial damp proofing==
Until the 20th century, masonry buildings in Europe and North America were generally constructed from highly permeable materials such as stone and [[Lime (material)|lime]]-based mortars and renders covered with soft water-based paints which all allowed any damp to diffuse into the air without damage. The later application of impermeable materials which prevent the natural dispersion of damp, such as [[tile]], [[linoleum]], cement and [[gypsum]]-based materials and synthetic paints is thought by some to be the most significant cause of damp problems in older buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Society of the Protection of Ancient Buildings|title=Technical Q&amp;A 20: Rising Damp|url=http://www.spab.org.uk/advice/technical-qas/technical-qa-20-rising-damp/|accessdate=16 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228182147/http://www.spab.org.uk/advice/technical-qas/technical-qa-20-rising-damp/|archive-date=2014-02-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many solutions for dealing with dampness in existing buildings, the choice of which will largely be determined by the types of dampness that are affecting the building, ''e.g.'', rising damp, hygroscopic damp, condensation, [[Damp (structural)#Rain penetration|penetrating damp]], etc. 

The leading trade Association for contractors in this industry is the Damp Proofing Association (DPA) with over 300 approved local contractors. They can be found at www.dampproofingassociation.com

==Health and safety==
Some DPC materials may contain [[asbestos]] fibres. This was more commonly found in the older, grey sealants as well as flexible tar boards.

"'''Dark as a Dungeon'''" is a song written by singer-songwriter [[Merle Travis]]. It is a lament about the danger and drudgery of being a coal miner in a [[shaft mine]].  It has become a rallying song among miners seeking improved working conditions.

The song achieved much of its fame when it was performed by [[Johnny Cash]] in his [[Folsom Prison]] concert (''[[At Folsom Prison]]''). During this live performance, one of the prisoners in the background was laughing, and Cash started to chuckle. He gently admonished the man, "No laughing during the song, please!" The man yelled something about "Hell!" and Cash answered, "I know, 'hell'!" When he finished the song, Cash made a comment that was largely repeated, somewhat out of context, by [[Joaquin Phoenix]] in the 2005 film ''[[Walk the Line]]'': "I just wanted to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album released on Columbia Records, so you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Jason|title=Prisoners Are the Best Audience: The Challenge of 'At Folsom Prison'|url=https://www.popmatters.com/65735-prisoners-are-the-best-audience-the-challenge-of-at-folsom-prison-2496102536.html|accessdate=January 2, 2018|work=PopMatters|date=November 18, 2008|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial shock wave is visible on the water surface, and a shock condensation cloud is visible overhead.]]

'''Detonation''' ({{ety|la|detonare|to thunder down}}) is a type of [[combustion]] involving a [[supersonic]] exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a [[shock front]] propagating directly in front of it.  Detonations occur in both conventional solid and liquid explosives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fickett|last2= Davis|title=Detonation|publisher= Univ. California Press|year=1979|isbn= 978-0-486-41456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in reactive gases.  The [[detonation velocity|velocity of detonation]] in solid and liquid explosives is much higher than that in gaseous ones, which allows the wave system to be observed with greater detail (higher [[Image resolution|resolution]]).

A very wide variety of fuels may occur as gases, droplet fogs, or dust suspensions.  Oxidants include halogens, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and oxides of nitrogen.  Gaseous detonations are often associated with a mixture of fuel and oxidant in a composition somewhat below conventional flammability ratios.  They happen most often in confined systems, but they sometimes occur in large vapor clouds.  Other materials, such as [[acetylene]], [[ozone]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]] are detonable in the absence of [[dioxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stull|title=Fundamentals of fire and explosion|publisher=A.I.Chem.E.|series=Monograph Series|volume=10|page=73|year=1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcBTAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards|publisher=Butterworths|location=London|year=2006|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123725639|isbn=978-0-12-372563-9|first1=Peter |last1=Urben |first2= Leslie|last2= Bretherick|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detonation was discovered in 1881 by two pairs of French scientists [[Marcellin Berthelot]] and P. Vieille&lt;ref&gt;6 M. Berthelot and P. Vieille, “On the velocity of propagation of explosive processes in gases,” Comp. Rend. Hebd. Séances Acad. Sci., Vol. 93, pp. 18-21, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernest-François Mallard]] and [[Henry Louis Le Chatelier]].&lt;ref&gt;5 E. Mallard and H. L. Le Chatelier, “On the propagation velocity of burning in gaseous explosive mixtures,” Comp. Rend. Hebd. Séances Acad. Sci., Vol. 93, pp. 145-148, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical predictions of propagation were carried out first by [[David Chapman (chemist)|David Chapman]] in 1899&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, D. L. (1899). VI. On the rate of explosion in gases. The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 47(284), 90-104.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Émile Jouguet]] in 1905&lt;ref&gt;Jouguet, E. (1905). On the propagation of chemical reactions in gases. J. de mathematiques Pures et Appliquees, 1(347-425), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;, 1906&lt;ref&gt;Jouguet, E. J. (1906). Mathem. Pures Appl. 1. 1905. P. 347-425. And 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Jouguet, É. (1917). L'œuvre scientifique de Pierre Duhem. Doin.&lt;/ref&gt; The next advance in understanding detonation was made by [[Zel'dovich]], [[von Neumann]], and [[W. Doering]] in the early 1940s.

== Theories ==
The simplest theory to predict the behaviour of detonations in gases is known as [[Chapman-Jouguet condition|Chapman-Jouguet]] (CJ) theory, developed around the turn of the 20th century.  This theory, described by a relatively simple set of algebraic equations, models the detonation as a propagating shock wave accompanied by exothermic heat release.  Such a theory confines the chemistry and diffusive transport processes to an [[infinitesimal]]ly thin zone.

A more complex theory was advanced during World War II independently by [[Zel'dovich]], [[von Neumann]], and [[W.

Both theories describe one-dimensional and steady wave fronts.  However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

Experimental studies have revealed some of the conditions needed for the propagation of such fronts. In confinement, the range of composition of mixes of fuel and oxidant and self-decomposing substances with inerts are slightly below the flammability limits and for spherically expanding fronts well below them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nettleton|first=M.

== Applications ==

When used in explosive devices, the main cause of damage from a detonation is the supersonic blast front (a powerful [[shock wave]]) in the surrounding area. This is a significant distinction from [[deflagration]]s where the exothermic wave is subsonic and maximum pressures are at most one eighth{{Citation needed|date = February 2010}} as great. Therefore, detonation is most often used for explosives and the acceleration of projectiles.  However, detonation waves may also be used for less destructive purposes, including deposition of coatings to a surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nikolaev, Yu.A. |author2=Vasil'ev, A.A. |author3=Ul'yanitskii |author4=B.Yu. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gas Detonation and its Application in Engineering and Technologies (Review)|journal=Combustion, Explosion, and Shock Waves|volume= 39|issue= 4|pages=382–410|year= 2003|doi=10.1023/A:1024726619703}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cleaning of equipment (e.g. slag removal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Huque, Z. |author2=Ali, M.R. |author3=Kommalapati, R. |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Application of pulse detonation technology for boiler slag removal|journal=Fuel Processing Technology|volume= 90|issue= 4|pages=558–569|year= 2009|doi=10.1016/j.fuproc.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and even [[explosive welding|explosively welding]] together metals that would otherwise fail to fuse. [[Pulse detonation engine]]s use the detonation wave for aerospace propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kailasanath, K.|title=Review of Propulsion Applications of Detonation Waves|journal=AIAA Journal|volume=39|issue= 9|pages=1698–1708|year= 2000|doi=10.2514/2.1156|bibcode = 2000AIAAJ..38.1698K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first flight of an aircraft powered by a pulse detonation engine took place at the [[Mojave Airport &amp; Spaceport|Mojave Air &amp; Space Port]] on January 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first= G.|title=Pulse Power: Pulse Detonation Engine-powered Flight Demonstration Marks Milestone in Mojave|journal=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology|volume= 168|issue=7|page= 60|year=2008|url=http://archive.aviationweek.com/issue/20080218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In engines and firearms ==
Unintentional detonation when [[deflagration]] is desired is a problem in some devices.  In internal combustion engines it is called [[engine knocking]] or pinging or pinking, and it causes a loss of power, excessive heating, and eventual engine failure in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Engine knocking#Abnormal combustion]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hpacademy.com/technical-articles/dont-waste-your-time-listening-for-knock/&lt;/ref&gt; In firearms, it may cause catastrophic and potentially lethal failure.

== Etymology ==
In classical Latin, ''detonare'' means "to stop thundering", as in weather. The modern meaning developed later.

== Mission ==

The mission of Earth Expeditions is to build an alliance of people with direct knowledge of inquiry-driven, community-based learning for the benefit of ecological communities, student achievement, and global understanding.
The image of people who merely transmit and receive knowledge from books is of limited usefulness in an era of rapid social, environmental and technological change. This program envisions each person as an ambassador who creates and transmits knowledge and who promotes authentic dialogue at all levels of society, inspiring others to do the same. With the adoption of participatory models of education, schools become centers of investigation, students engage more deeply in their studies, and communities achieve higher levels of self-determination.

== Project ''Dragonfly'' ==

Since its inception nearly 20 years ago, '''Project ''Dragonfly''''' has reached millions of children, parents and educators through [[science learning]] media, exhibits, and graduate programs. The project began in 1994 with the creation of the award-winning ''Dragonfly'' magazine, the first national magazine to feature the investigations and discoveries of children.  Created in 1994 at [[Miami University]], ''Dragonfly'' magazine was funded by NSF and published by the [[National Science Teachers Association]]. Through mid-2000, the magazine published young investigators alongside such adult researchers as Dr. [[Jane Goodall]].

Project ''Dragonfly'' pioneered the "Real Kids, Real Science" approach to learning and continues to work for inquiry-driven reform to increase public involvement in science and global understanding. In addition to Earth Expeditions, Project ''Dragonfly'' worked with [[Twin Cities Public Television|TPT]] Public Television to launch the Emmy-Award winning PBS children's television series ''[[DragonflyTV]]'', which led to the 2010 launch of the spinoff series ''[[SciGirls]]'', both produced by TPT Public Television.  Project ''Dragonfly'' also oversees two national exhibit projects: Wild Research and iSaveSpecies, which are creating public research stations at zoos and aquariums nationwide to engage families in science inquiry and conservation action. The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) has called ''Dragonfly'' "A true innovation and a model of what active learning should be."

==  Founding partners ==

===  Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden ===

[[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]] opened in 1875 and is the second oldest zoo in the nation. This national historical landmark hosts more than 500 animal species and 3,000 plant species. More than 1.2 million people visit the Cincinnati Zoo annually. A non-profit entity, the zoo is internationally known for its success in the protection and propagation of plants and animals in danger and engages in research and conservation projects around the world.

'''Earthquake-resistant structures''' are [[structure]]s designed to protect buildings from  [[earthquake]]s. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of [[Earthquake engineering|earthquake-resistant construction]] is to erect structures that fare better during seismic activity than their conventional counterparts.
According to [[building code]]s, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location.This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of the functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.&lt;ref name=RecommendedLateralForce&gt;{{cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively [[stiffness|stiff]] and [[strength of materials|strong]].

Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be [[strength of materials|strong]] and [[ductility|ductile]] enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with [[base isolation]] or using structural [[vibration control]] technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] and the [[Acropolis Museum]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Trends and projects ==
Some of the new trends and/or projects in the field of earthquake engineering structures are presented.

===Building materials===
Based on studies in New Zealand, relating to [[Christchurch]] earthquakes, precast concrete designed and installed in accordance with modern codes performed well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precastnz.org.nz/precast-concrete-and-seismic-issues/#damage Precast New Zealand Inc: Precast concrete and seismic issues]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]], precast panel buildings had good durability during the earthquake in Armenia, compared to precast frame-panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eeri.org/1988/12/spitak/armenia_spitak_concrete/|title=Precast concrete panel building damage, comparing the performance of precast frame-panel (collapsed in foreground) and precast panel buildings (standing in background)|website=www.eeri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquake shelter===
One Japanese construction company has developed a six-foot cubical shelter, presented as an alternative to earthquake-proofing an entire building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4965895.html|title=Earthquake shelter with bed support and canopy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurrent shake-table testing ===
Concurrent shake-table testing of two or more building models is a vivid, persuasive and effective way to validate [[earthquake engineering]] solutions experimentally.

Thus, two wooden houses built before adoption of the 1981 Japanese Building Code were moved to E-Defense&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/node/12697 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927091751/http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/node/12697 |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for testing (see both pictures aside). The left house was reinforced to enhance its seismic resistance, while the other one was not. These two models were set on E-Defense platform and tested simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=182|title=Shaking Table Test on Conventional Wooden House (1)|last=neesit|date=17 November 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined vibration control solution===
[[File:Municipal Services Building-1.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of abutment of [[w:en:Seismic retrofit|seismically retrofitted]] Municipal Services Building in [[Glendale, California]]]][[File:Municipal Services Building.jpg|thumb|[[w:en:Seismic retrofit|Seismically retrofitted]] Municipal Services Building in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]]]]Designed by architect Merrill W. Baird of Glendale, working in collaboration with [[Albert C. Martin, Sr.|A. C. Martin]] Architects of Los Angeles, the Municipal Services Building at 633 East Broadway, [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] was completed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/planning/MSB+EIR/AppendixB.pdf|title=Planning Division - City of Glendale, CA|website=www.ci.glendale.ca.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominently sited at the corner of East Broadway and Glendale Avenue, this civic building serves as a heraldic element of Glendale's civic center.

In October 2004 [[Architectural Resources Group]] (ARG) was contracted by [[Nabih Youssef]] &amp; Associates, Structural Engineers, to provide services regarding a historic resource assessment of the building due to a proposed seismic retrofit.

In 2008, the Municipal Services Building of the City of Glendale, California was [[w:en:seismic retrofit|seismically retrofitted]] using an innovative combined vibration control solution: the existing [[v:Elevated building foundation|elevated building foundation]] of the building was put on [[w:en:base isolation|high damping rubber bearings]].

===Steel plate walls system===
[[File:Pages from Kharrazi 0002.jpg|thumb|left|Coupled steel plate shear walls, [[Seattle]]]][[File:LA LiveTower05.jpg|thumb|The [[Ritz-Carlton]]/[[JW Marriott]] hotel building engaging the advanced steel plate shear walls system, [[Los Angeles]]]]A [[steel plate shear wall]] (SPSW) consists of steel infill plates bounded by a column-beam system. When such infill plates occupy each level within a framed bay of a structure, they constitute a SPSW system.&lt;ref&gt;Kharrazi, M.H.K., 2005, "Rational Method for Analysis and Design of Steel Plate Walls," Ph.D. Dissertation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada,&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most earthquake resistant construction methods are adapted from older systems, SPSW was invented entirely to withstand seismic activity.&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=356–357|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPSW behavior is analogous to a vertical [[Plate (metal)|plate]] [[girder]] cantilevered from its base.  Similar to plate girders, the SPSW system optimizes component performance by taking advantage of the post-[[buckling]] behavior of the steel infill panels.

The Ritz-Carlton/JW Marriott hotel building, a part of the [[LA Live]] development in [[Los Angeles, California]], is the first building in Los Angeles that uses an advanced steel plate shear wall system to resist the lateral loads of strong earthquakes and winds.

===Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant is partially upgraded ===
The  [[Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant]], the largest nuclear generating station in the world by net [[electrical power]] rating, happened to be near the epicenter of the strongest [[moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] 6.6 [[2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake|July 2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/corporate/Profits_shaken_at_Tepco_310707.shtml |title=Profits shaken at Tepco |date=31 July 2007 |publisher=''World Nuclear News'' |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224605/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/corporate/Profits_shaken_at_Tepco_310707.shtml |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This  initiated an extended shutdown for structural inspection which indicated that a greater earthquake-proofing was needed before operation could be resumed.&lt;ref&gt;Asahi.com. [http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200707180144.html Quake exposes nuke-plant danger]. July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2009, one unit (Unit 7) was restarted, after the [[seismic retrofit|seismic upgrades]]. The test run had to continue for 50 days. The plant had been completely shut down for almost 22 months following the earthquake.

===Seismic test of seven-story building===
A destructive earthquake struck a lone, wooden condominium in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do|title=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute News &amp; Events|date=12 October 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030742/http://news.rpi.edu/update.do|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was webcast live on July 14, 2009 to yield insight on how to make wooden structures stronger and better able to withstand major earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/newsmedia/neeswood|title=Home - Standing Strong: 2009 NEESWood Capstone Test|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miki, Hyōgo|Miki]] shake at the Hyogo Earthquake Engineering Research Center is the capstone experiment of the four-year NEESWood project, which receives its primary support from the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program.

"NEESWood aims to develop a new seismic design philosophy that will provide the necessary mechanisms to safely increase the height of wood-frame structures in active seismic zones of the United States, as well as mitigate earthquake damage to low-rise wood-frame structures," said Rosowsky, Department of Civil Engineering at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. This philosophy is based on the application of seismic damping systems for wooden buildings. The systems, which can be installed inside the walls of most wooden buildings, include strong metal [[:wikt:Frame|frame]], [[Timber framing|bracing]] and [[Tuned mass damper|damper]]s filled with [[viscous]] fluid.

===Superframe earthquake proof structure===
The proposed system is composed of core walls, hat beams incorporated into the top level,  outer columns and viscous dampers vertically installed between the tips of the hat beams and the outer columns. During an earthquake, the hat beams and outer columns act as outriggers and reduce the overturning moment in the core, and the installed dampers also reduce the moment and the lateral deflection of the structure. This innovative system can eliminate inner beams and inner columns on each floor, and thereby provide buildings  with  column-free  floor  space  even  in  highly  seismic  regions.&lt;ref&gt;"A Survey on concepts of design and executing of Superframe RC Earthquake proof Structures" (2016) by Kiarash Khodabakhshi {{ISBN|9783668208704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/0744.pdf | title=Seismic Design of a Super Frame | publisher=Kajima Corporation | accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecoleasing''' is a system in which goods (mainly from the [[Cradle-to-cradle design|technical cycle]], i.e. appliances, ...) are rented to a client for a certain period of time after which he returns the goods so the company that made it can recycle the materials.

==Terminology==
The term ecoleasing has been used by [[William McDonough]] and [[Michael Braungart]] in their book Cradle_to_Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.&lt;ref&gt;Term found in Dutch version of the book&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to distinct itself from regular [[Lease|leasing]] in that:

* the operation is similar to regular [[Purchasing|purchasing of goods]], so not requiring a contract to be made up as with leasing
* it is done with appliances and other products used for the household, rather than with land or very expensive products (cars, ...)
* the period of time the product is rented would be about the same as the lifespan of the product, so it can only be rented once before it is taken back by the company to recover the materials (and to create another product with it)

==Examples==
Ecoleasing can for instance be done with TV's. Instead of the consumer purchasing the TV, by ecoleasing it, he is entitled to say 10 000 service hours. After this, he can send the TV back to the company.

==Advantages==
* Since materials are reclaimed, fewer or no materials end up in landfills, or require other forms of waste disposal. As such, it is quite environmental.
* Materials are recovered by which the company can make new products, so the material costs for this new product are much lower for the company.
* Since new products can be made at a lower expense, the sale price of these products can also be comparatively lower than similar products made by the competition (if they use a system of purchasing the goods)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21759">'''Educational robotics''' is a broad term that refers to a collection of activities, instructional programs, physical platforms, educational resources and pedagogical philosophy. There are many schools which are using the robot teacher. 

== Definition ==
The primary of objective of educational robotics is to provide a set of experience to facilitate the student's development of knowledge, skills and attitudes for the design, analysis, application and operation of robots.  The term robot here is used quite broadly and may include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles of any scale.   The rigor of the approach can be scaled based on the background of the target audience and may be suitable for students across the entire educational spectrum—from elementary school or graduate programs.

An alternate, or secondary, objective is to use robotics as a tangible and exciting application to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design.

==Education and training==
[[File:ER4u.jpg|thumb|The [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]] – educational robot.]]
Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=139 | title = Career: Robotics Engineer | accessdate = 2012-01-27 | year = 2012 | work = Princeton Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students. First-year computer science courses at several universities now include programming of a robot in addition to traditional software engineering-based coursework.&lt;ref name=MKG12&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://romisatriawahono.net/lecture/rm/survey/software%20engineering/Software%20Construction/Major%20-%20teaching%20novices%20programming%20using%20robots%20-%202012.pdf |title=Systematic Literature Review: Teaching Novices Programming using Robots |first1=L |last1=Major |first2=T |last2=Kyriacou |first3=O.P. |last3=Brereton |format=pdf |journal=IET Software |publisher=IEEE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=502-513 |doi=10.1049/iet-sen.2011.0125 |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SG13&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/9656489/Enhancing_Practice_and_Achievement_in_Introductory_Programming_with_a_Robot_Olympics |title=Enhancing Practice and Achievement in Introductory Programming with a Robot Olympics |first1=Michael |last1=Scott |first2=Steve |last2=Counsell |first3=Stasha |last3=Lauria |first4=Stephen |last4=Swift |first5=Allan |last5=Tucker |first6=Martin |last6=Shepperd |first7=Gheorghita |last7=Ghinea |format=pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Education |publisher=IEEE |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=249–254 |doi=10.1109/TE.2014.2382567 |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives in schools===
[[File:Rero-robots.jpg|thumb|rero reconfigurable robots, designed as easy to assemble and easy to program]]
Since 2014, companies like Cytron Technologies has been making inroads into schools and learning centers with their rero reconfigurable robot.  Designed to be easy and safe to assemble and easy to program, robotics became very accessible to young children with no programming skills and even up to advance users at tertiary level.  Robotics education was heavily promoted via roadshows, science fairs, exhibitions, workshops, camps and co-sponsored classes, bringing robotics education to the masses.

===Post-secondary degree programs===
From approximately 1960 though 2005, robotics education at post-secondary institutions took place through elective courses, thesis experiences and design projects offered as part of degree programs in traditional academic disciplines, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering or computer science.

Since 2005, more universities have begun granting degrees in robotics as a discipline in its own right, often under the name "Robotic Engineering".  Based on a 2015 web-based survey of robotics educators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7970162/ |title=The State of Robotics Education: Proposed Goals for Positively Transforming Robotics Education at Postsecondary Institutions |first1=Joel M. |last1=Esposito |journal=IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine  |publisher=IEEE |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=157-164 |doi=10.1109/MRA.2016.2636375 |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the degree programs and their estimates annual graduates are listed alphabetically below.  Note that only official degree programs where the word "robotics" appears on the transcript or diploma are listed here; whereas degree programs in traditional disciplines with course concentrations or thesis topics related to robotics are deliberately omitted.

===Certification===
The [[Robotics Certification Standards Alliance|Robotics Certification Standards Alliance (RCSA)]] is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry- and educational-related robotics certifications.

===Summer robotics camp===
Several summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum. In addition, youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 Education at American Museum of Natural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102072036/http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]] in Silicon Valley, CA, just to name a few.

===Robotics afterschool programs===
Many schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum. Two main programs for afterschool robotics are [http://www.botball.org Botball] and [http://www.usfirst.org FIRST Robotics].

==Energy management==
[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|thumb|Thermal energy is the amount of random molecular [[kinetic energy]].]]

Energy accounting is a system used in [[energy management system]]s to measure and analyze energy consumption to improve [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] within an organization.&lt;ref name=Acc /&gt; Organisations such as Intel corporation use these systems to track energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various [[energy transformation]]s are possible. An energy balance can be used to track energy through a system. This becomes a useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts. How much energy is needed at each point in a system is measured, as well as the form of that energy. An accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within a system. Sometimes, non-useful work is what is often responsible for environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml Science Notes: Energy Accounting and Balance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |date=2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy balance==
[[Energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) is the ratio of energy delivered by an energy technology to the energy invested to set up the technology.

'''Episodic storytelling''' is when a story is narrated through [[episode|episodes]], as opposed to chapters, which are typically seen in novels. The term used in [[literature]] to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. [[episodic fiction|Serials]] are also known as [[episodic fiction]]. 

Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a [[Serial (radio and television)|series]] through a unifying [[story arc]]. Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same [[story world]].

'''The Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences''' recognizes excellence in the execution of [[operations research]] on the organizational level.

==About==
The award is presented annually by the [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] (INFORMS).

The international competition pits six teams from industry, government, healthcare, and the non-profit sectors. The competition takes place at the INFORMS Business Analytics Conference and concludes with the announcement of the winner at a gala dinner at the conference. It began in 1971 as the TIMS Prize and was named for Franz Edelman, the operations research director of [[RCA]], shortly after his death in 1982. It carries a cash award of $10,000. Since its inception, nearly $250 billion in benefits have been tabulated among Franz Edelman Award finalist teams. Following the competition, INFORMS publishes papers by the Edelman finalists in the January issue of the INFORMS journal [[Interfaces (journal)|''Interfaces'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubsonline.informs.org/loi/inte Interfaces, All Volumes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''GigaMesh''' Software Framework is a modular [[software]] for display, editing and visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|3D]]-data typically acquired with [[structured light]] or [[structure from motion]].

It provides numerous functions for analysis of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] objects like [[clay tablet|cuneiform tablets]], [[ceramics]]&lt;ref name="Thaller_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Survey_3D" /&gt; or converted [[Lidar|LiDAR]] data&lt;ref name="LiDAR_processing" /&gt;. Typically applications are [[unwrapping]]s (or rollouts)&lt;ref name="Abrollung_Silberbecher" /&gt;, [[profile cuts]] (or [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sections]])&lt;ref name="CVA_Beiheft_Wien_1_3D" /&gt; as well as visualizations of [[distance]]s and [[curvature]], which can be exported as [[raster graphics]] or [[vector graphics]].

The retrieval of text in 3D like damaged cuneiform tablets or [[Weathering|weathered]] medieval [[headstones]]&lt;ref name="Spiegel_Heiliger_Sand" /&gt; using [[Multi-scale approaches|Multi Scale]] Integral Invariant (MSII)&lt;ref name="Dissertation_Mara" /&gt; [[Digital_image_processing#Filtering|filtering]] is a core function of the software. Futhermore small or faint surface details like [[fingerprints]] can be visualized.&lt;ref name="GigaMesh_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mara_Vortrag_2017" /&gt; The [[Polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]] of the 3D-models can be inspected, cleaned and repaired to provide optimal filtering results. The repaired datasets are suitable for [[3D printing]] and for [[Electronic publishing|digital publishing]] in a [[dataverse]].&lt;ref name="IWR_Dataverse" /&gt;

== Name and Logo ==
The name "GigaMesh" refers to processing of large 3D-datasets and relates intentional to the mythical [[Sumer|sumerian]] king [[Gilgamesh]] and his heroic epic described on a set of clay tablets.{{r|Dissertation_Mara|p=115}} The central element of the logo is the [[cuneiform]] sign [[wikt:𒆜|𒆜 (kaskal)]] meaning street or [[road junction]], which symbolizes the intersection of the [[humanities]] and [[computer science]]. The surrounding circle refers to the integral [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] computation using a [[sphere|spherical]] [[Domain of a function|domain]]. The color [[red]] is used by the Heidelberg University, where GigaMesh is developed.

== Development and application in research projects ==
The development began in 2009 and was inspired by the edition project ''Keilschrifttexte aus [[Assur]] literarischen Inhalts'' (KAL, cuneiform texts with literary content) of the [[Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref name="GigaMesh_2010" /&gt; In parallel it was applied within the Austrian [[Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum]] of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] for documentation of [[red-figure pottery]].&lt;ref name="CVA_Beiheft_Wien_1_3D" /&gt; Current projects are funded by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] and the [[Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung|BMBF]] for contextualization and analysis of [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and sealings of the [[Corpus der minoischen und mykenischen Siegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DFG - GEPRIS - Minoische Siegelglyptik zwischen corpusartiger Erfassung und 3D-Forensik.

An example is the application within the [[Text Database and Dictionary of Classic Mayan]].&lt;ref name="GCH17_Maya" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5177">'''Human interface guidelines''' ('''HIG''') are [[software development]] documents which offer application developers a set of recommendations.  Their aim is to improve the experience for the users by making application interfaces more intuitive, learnable, and consistent.  Most guides limit themselves to defining a common [[look and feel]] for applications in a particular [[desktop environment]].  The guides enumerate specific policies. Policies are sometimes based on studies of [[human–computer interaction]] (so called [[usability study|usability studies]]), but most are based on conventions chosen by the platform  developers preferences. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The central aim of a HIG is to create a consistent experience across the environment (generally an [[operating system]] or [[desktop environment]]), including the [[application software|applications]] and other tools being used. This means both applying the same visual design and creating consistent access to and behaviour of common elements of the interface – from simple ones such as [[button (computing)|button]]s and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s up to more complex constructions, such as [[dialog box]]es.

HIGs are recommendations and advice meant to help developers create better applications. Developers sometimes intentionally choose to break them if they think that the guidelines do not fit their application, or [[usability testing]] reveals an advantage in doing so.  But in turn, the organization publishing the HIG might withhold endorsement of the application.  [[Mozilla Firefox]]'s user interface, for example, goes against the [[GNOME]] project's HIG, which is one of the main arguments for including [[GNOME Web (web browser)|Epiphany]] instead of Firefox in the GNOME distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web/Docs/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Mozilla_and_Firefox Epiphany Project FAQ: Mozilla and Firefox - GNOME Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==
Human interface guidelines often describe the visual design rules, including icon and window design and style.  Frequently they specify how user input and [[Human–computer interaction|interaction]] mechanisms work.  Aside from the detailed rules, guidelines sometimes also make broader suggestions about how to organize and design the application and write user-interface text.

HIGs are also done for applications.  In this case the HIG will build on a platform HIG by adding the common semantics for a range of application functions.

== Cross-platform guidelines ==
In contrast to platform-specific guidelines, [[cross-platform]] guidelines aren't tied to a distinct platform. These guidelines make recommendations which should be true on any platform. Since this isn't always possible, cross-platform guidelines may weigh the compliance against the imposed work load.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">The '''Institute on Religion in an Age of Science''' (IRAS) is a [[non-denominational]] society that promotes and facilitates the ongoing dialectic between religion and science. The Institute has held annual week-long conferences at [[Star Island (New Hampshire)|Star Island]] in [[New Hampshire]] since 1954. The conference attracts about 250 members and non-members each year.

==Mission==
In its Constitution, the IRAS purpose is stated as follows: "The Institute on Religion in an Age of Science is established
* to promote creative efforts leading to the formulation, in the light of contemporary knowledge, of effective doctrines and practice for human welfare;
* to formulate dynamic and positive relationships between the concepts developed by science and the goals and hopes of humanity expressed through religion; and
* to state human values in such universal and valid terms that they be understood by all peoples, whatever their cultural background or experience, in such a way as to provide a basis for world-wide cooperation.

The IRAS Council adopted the following statement in 2003:
“We at IRAS take the natural world seriously as a primary source of meaning. Our quest is informed and guided by the deepening and evolving understandings fostered by scientific inquiry.

“From here, our quests for meaning take us in divergent directions. For some, the natural world and its emergent manifestations in human experience and creativity are the focus of exploration. Some go on to encounter and celebrate the sacred in such explorations. For some, understandings of the natural world are interwoven with understandings inherent in various religious traditions, generating additional paths of exploration and encounter. As a result, we articulate our emerging orientations with many voices that are harmonious in that we share a common sense of place and gratitude.

“We acknowledge as well a shared set of values and concerns pertaining to peace, justice, dignity, cultural and ecological diversity and planetary sustainability. Although we may differ and hence debate as to how these concerns are here addressed, we are committed to participating in their resolution.”

==History==
IRAS evolved from the ideas of two pioneer groups. The first was a group of scientists from the Committee on Science and Values of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. The second group was an interfaith, religious coalition which hoped to revitalize religion for today's needs. Members of both groups saw what some perceived as a battlefield of conflicting ideologies to be a place of opportunity for a constructive relationship to emerge.

In 1954 the scientists accepted an invitation to present their views to the religious group at a seven-day conference on Religion in an Age of Science on Star Island. On November 9, 1954, members of the two groups established the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science to work toward these goals.

Presidents of the Institute have included [[Harlow Shapley]], [[Philip Hefner]], [[Ursula Goodenough]], and [[Varadaraja V. Raman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6517">The notion of '''institution''' has been created by [[Joseph Goguen]] and [[Rod Burstall]] in the late 1970s. In order to deal with the  "population explosion among the [[logical system]]s used in [[computer science]]". The notion tries to capture the essence of the concept of "logical system".&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Goguen and R. M. Burstall, Institutions: Abstract Model Theory for Specification and Programming, Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery 39, pp. 95–146, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of institutions makes it possible to develop concepts of [[specification language]]s (like structuring of specifications, parameterization, implementation, refinement, development), [[proof calculi]] and even [[tool]]s in a way completely independent of the underlying logical system. There are also [[morphism]]s that allow to relate and translate logical systems. Important applications of this are re-use of logical structure (also called borrowing), heterogeneous specification and combination of logics. 

The spread of [[institutional model theory]] has generalized various notions and results of [[model theory]] and institutions themselves have impacted the progress of [[universal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Razvan Diaconescu, "Three decades of institution theory" in Universal Logic: An Anthology edited by Jean-Yves Béziau 2012 Springer
{{ISBN|978-3-0346-0144-3}} pp 309-322&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;T. Mossakowski, J. A. Goguen, R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", '. In Jean-Yves Beziau (Ed.), [https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/mathematics/book/978-3-7643-8353-4 Logica Universalis: Towards a General Theory of Logic],  pp.&amp;nbsp;113–133. Birkhäuser, Basel, 2005, 2nd Edition 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The theory of institutions does not assume anything about the nature of the logical system. That is, [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]s and [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] may be arbitrary objects; the only assumption is that there is a '''satisfaction relation''' between models and sentences, telling whether a sentence holds in a model or not. Satisfaction is inspired by [[T-schema|Tarski's truth definition]], but can in fact be any binary relation.
A crucial feature of institutions now is that models, sentences and their satisfaction are always being considered to live in some vocabulary or context  (called '''signature''') that defines the (non-logical) symbols that may be used in sentences and that need to be interpreted in models. Moreover, '''signature morphisms''' allow to extend signatures, change notation etc. Nothing is assumed about signatures and signature morphisms except that signature morphisms can be composed; this amounts to having a 
[[Category (mathematics)|category]] of signatures and morphisms. Finally, it is assumed that signature morphisms lead to translations of sentences and models in a way that satisfaction is preserved. While sentences are translated along with signature morphisms (think of symbols being replaced along the morphism), models are translated (or better: reduced) '''against''' signature morphisms: for example, in case of a signature extension, a model of the (larger) target signature may be reduced to a model of the (smaller) source signature by just forgetting some components of the model.

Formally, an institution consists of

* a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;Sign&lt;/math&gt; of '''signatures''',
* a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;sen:Sign \to &lt;/math&gt;[[Category of sets|Set]] giving, for each signature &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the set of '''sentences''' &lt;math&gt;sen(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, and for each signature morphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\Sigma\to\Sigma'&lt;/math&gt;, the '''sentence translation map''' &lt;math&gt;sen(\sigma):sen(\Sigma)\to sen(\Sigma')&lt;/math&gt;, where often &lt;math&gt;sen(\sigma)(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;,
* a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;Mod:Sign^{op}\to&lt;/math&gt;[[Category of small categories|Cat]] giving, for each signature &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the category of '''models''' &lt;math&gt;Mod(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, and for each signature morphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\Sigma\to\Sigma'&lt;/math&gt;, the '''reduct functor''' &lt;math&gt;Mod(\sigma):Mod(\Sigma')\to Mod(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, where often &lt;math&gt;Mod(\sigma)(M')&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;M'|_{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;,
* a satisfaction [[Binary relation|relation]] &lt;math&gt;{\models_{\Sigma}}\subseteq|{Mod(\Sigma)|\times sen(\Sigma)}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\in Sign&lt;/math&gt;,

such that for each &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\Sigma\to\Sigma'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Sign&lt;/math&gt; the following '''satisfaction condition'''  holds:

&lt;math&gt;M'\models_{\Sigma'}\sigma(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;M'|_{\sigma}
\models_{\Sigma} \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

for each &lt;math&gt;M'\in Mod(\Sigma')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi\in sen(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;.

The satisfaction condition expresses that truth is invariant under change of notation 
(and also under enlargement or quotienting of context).

Strictly speaking, the model functor ends in the "category" of all large categories.

'''Laurel forest''', also called '''laurisilva''' or '''laurissilva''', is a type of [[Subtropics|subtropical]] forest found in areas with high [[humidity]] and relatively stable, mild temperatures. The forest is characterized by [[broadleaf]] tree [[species]] with [[evergreen]], glossy and [[wikt:elongated|elongated]] leaves, known as "laurophyll" or "lauroid". Plants from the laurel family ([[Lauraceae]]) may or may not be present, depending on the location.

== Setting ==
[[File:Laurazeen wood madeira hg.jpg|thumb|Laurel forest in [[Madeira]]]]
Laurel forests are specific to wet forests from sea level to the highest mountains, but are poorly represented in areas with a pronounced [[dry season]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
They need an [[ecosystem]] of high humidity, such as [[cloud forest]]s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} with abundant rainfall throughout the year. Laurel forests typically occur on the slopes of tropical or subtropical [[mountain]]s, where the [[moisture]] from the ocean condenses so that it falls as rain or fog and soils have high moisture levels.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;[http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci_team/pubs/abstract.php?id=04300 Abstract] at NASA – MODIS: Izquierdo, T; de las Heras, P; Marquez, A (2011). Vegetation indices changes in the cloud forest of La Gomera Island (Canary Islands) and their hydrological implications". ''Hydrological Processes'', 25(10), 1531–41: "[R]esults prove the absence of summer drought stress in the laurel forest implying that the fog drip income is high enough to maintain enough soil moisture".&lt;/ref&gt; Some evergreen tree species will survive short [[frost]]s, but most species will not survive hard freezes and prolonged cool weather. They need a mild climate with annual temperature oscillation moderated by the proximity of the ocean. These conditions of temperature and moisture occur in four different [[Geography|geographical]] regions:

* Along the eastern margin of [[continent]]s at [[latitude]]s of 25° to 35°.
* Along the western [[Continental climate|continental]] coasts between 35° and 50° latitude.
* On islands between 25° and 35° or 40° latitude.
* In humid [[montane]] regions of the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2352394 Resumen], Aschan, G., María Soledad Jiménez Parrondo, Domingo Morales Méndez, Reiner Lösch (1994), "Aspectos microclimaticos de un bosque de laurisilva en Tenerife / Microclimatic aspects of a Laurel Forest in Tenerife".

Some laurel forests are a type of [[cloud forest]]. Cloud forests are found on mountain slopes where the dense moisture from the sea or ocean is precipitated as warm moist air masses blowing off the ocean are forced upwards by the terrain, which cools the air mass to the [[dew point]]. The moisture in the air condenses as rain or fog, creating a habitat characterized by cool, moist conditions in the air and soil. The resulting climate is wet and mild, with the annual oscillation of the temperature moderated by the proximity of the ocean.

== Characteristics ==
Laurel forests are characterized by evergreen and hardwood trees, reaching up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} in height. Laurel forest, laurisilva, and laurissilva all refer to plant communities that resemble the laurel bay.

Some species belong to the true laurel family or [[Lauraceae]], but many have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to [[convergent evolution]]. As in any other rainforest, plants of the laurel forests must adapt to high rainfall and humidity. The trees adapted in response to these ecological drivers by developing [[analogous structures]], leaves that repel water. '''Laurophyll''' or [[lauroid]] leaves are characterized by a generous layer of [[wax]], making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed oval shape with an ''apical mucro'' or "[[drip tip]]", which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing perspiration and respiration. The scientific names ''laurina'', ''laurifolia'', ''laurophylla'', ''lauriformis'', and ''lauroides'' are often used to name species of other plant families that resemble the Lauraceae.&lt;ref name="ebooksread.com"&gt;Otto E. (Otto Emery) Jennings. "Fossil plants from the beds of volcanic ash near Missoula, western Montana" ''Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum'', 8(2), [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/otto-e-otto-emery-jennings/fossil-plants-from-the-beds-of-volcanic-ash-near-missoula-western-montana-volu-nne/1-fossil-plants-from-the-beds-of-volcanic-ash-near-missoula-western-montana-volu-nne.shtml p. 417].&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Lucidophyll'', referring to the shiny surface of the leaves, was proposed in 1969 by Tatuo Kira.&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998" /&gt; The scientific names ''[[Daphnidium]]'', ''[[Daphniphyllum]]'', ''[[Daphnopsis hellerana|Daphnopsis]]'', ''[[Daphnandra]]'', ''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; from Greek: Δάφνη, meaning "laurel", ''[[Bay Laurel|laural]]'', ''[[Laureliopsis philippiana|Laureliopsis]]'', ''[[Skimmia laureola|laureola]]'', ''[[laurelin]]'', ''[[Laurelindorinan]]'', ''[[Malosma|laurifolia]]'', ''[[Cistus laurifolius]]'' (Laurel Rockrose), ''[[Cistus laurifolius|laurifolius]]'', ''[[Viburnum tinus|lauriformis]]'', ''[[Hakea laurina|laurina]]'', ''[[Banyan|laurophylla]]'', ''[[Prunus laurocerasus|laurocerasus]]'', ''[[laurus]]'', ''[[Prunus laurocerasus]]'' (English laurel), ''[[Prunus lusitanica]]'' (Portugal laurel), ''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'' (New Zealand Laurel), and ''[[Corynocarpus rupestris]]'' designate species of other plant families that resemble Lauraceae.&lt;ref name="ebooksread.com" /&gt; The term "lauroid" is also applied to climbing plants such as [[ivy|ivies]] whose leaves resemble those of the Lauraceae.

Mature laurel forests typically have a dense [[canopy (biology)|tree canopy]] and low light levels at the forest floor.&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Box, Elgene O.|author2=Chang-Hung Chou|author3=Kazue Fujiwara|year=1998|title=Richness, Climactic Position, and Biogeographic Potential of East Asian Laurophyll Forests, with Particular Reference to Examples from Taiwan|url=http://kamome.lib.ynu.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10131/7114/1/biest241061.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Environmental Science, Yokohama National University|volume=24|pages=61–95|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226034538/http://kamome.lib.ynu.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10131/7114/1/biest241061.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some forests are characterized by an overstory of [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] trees.

Laurel forests are typically multi-species, and diverse in both the number of species and the genera and families represented.&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998" /&gt; In the absence of strong environmental selective pressure, the number of species sharing the arboreal stratum is high, although not reaching the value of tropical forests; nearly 100 tree species have been described in the laurisilva rainforest of [[Misiones]] ([[Argentina]]), about 20 in the Canary Islands. This species diversity contrasts with other temperate forest types, which typically have a canopy dominated by one or a few species. Species diversity generally increases towards the tropics.&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tagawa | first1 = Hideo | year = 1995 | title = Distribution of lucidophyll Oak – Laurel forest formation in Asia and other areas | url = | journal = Tropics | volume = 5 | issue = 1/2| pages = 1–40 | doi=10.3759/tropics.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional type between temperate forests and tropical rainforests.

== Origin ==
Laurel forests are composed of [[vascular plant]]s that evolved millions of years ago. Lauroid floras have included forests of [[Podocarpaceae]] and [[southern beech]].

This type of vegetation characterized parts of the ancient [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]] and once covered much of the [[tropics]]. Some lauroid species that are found outside laurel forests are [[relict]]s of vegetation that covered much of the mainland of [[Australia]], Europe, South America, Antarctica, Africa, and North America when their climate was warmer and more humid. Cloud forests are believed to have retreated and advanced during successive geological eras, and their species adapted to warm and wet conditions were replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] plant communities. Many of the late Cretaceous – early Tertiary Gondwanan species of flora became extinct, but some survived as relict species in the milder, moister climate of coastal areas and on islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/newcaledonia/|title=MBG: DIVERSITY, ENDEMISM, AND EXTINCTION IN THE FLORA AND VEGETATION OF NEW CALEDONIA|work=mobot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Tasmania and New Caledonia share related species extinct on the Australian mainland, and the same case occurs on the [[Macaronesia]] islands of the Atlantic and on the [[Taiwan]], [[Hainan]], [[Jeju-do|Jeju]], [[Shikoku]], [[Kyūshū]], and [[Ryūkyū Islands]] of the Pacific.

Although some remnants of archaic flora, including species and genera extinct in the rest of the world, have persisted as endemic in such coastal mountain and shelter sites, their biodiversity was reduced. Isolation in these fragmented habitats, particularly on islands, has led to the development of [[vicariant]] species and genera. Thus, fossils dating from before the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]]s show that species of ''[[Laurus]]'' were formerly distributed more widely around the Mediterranean and [[North Africa]]. Isolation gave rise to ''[[Laurus azorica]]'' in the Azores Islands, ''[[Laurus nobilis]]'' on the mainland, and ''[[Laurus novocanariensis]]'' in the Canary Islands.

== Laurel forest ecoregions ==
Laurel forests occur in small areas where their particular climatic requirements prevail, in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Inner laurel forest ecoregions, a related and distinct community of [[vascular plant]]s, evolved millions of years ago on the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], and species of this community are now found in several separate areas of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], including southern [[South America]], southernmost [[Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]] and [[Biodiversity of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]]. Most Laurel forest species are evergreen, and occur in tropical, subtropical, and mild temperate regions and [[cloud forest]]s of the northern and southern hemispheres, in particular the [[Macaronesia]]n islands, southern [[Japan]], [[Madagascar]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Tasmania]], and central [[Chile]], but they are pantropical, and for example in Africa they are endemic in [[Congo (area)|the Congo region]], [[Cameroon]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]], in lowland forest and [[Afromontane]] areas.
Since laurel forests are archaic populations that diversified as a result of isolation on islands and tropical mountains, their presence is a key to dating climatic history.

=== East Asia ===
Laurel forests are common in subtropical eastern Asia, and form the climax vegetation in far southern Japan, [[Taiwan]], southern China, the mountains of [[Indochina]], and the eastern [[Himalayas]]. In southern China, laurel forest once extended throughout the Yangtze Valley and Sichuan Basin from the [[East China Sea]] to the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. The northernmost laurel forests in East Asia occur at 39°&amp;nbsp;N. on the Pacific coast of Japan. Altitudinally, the forests range from sea-level up to 1000 metres in warm-temperate Japan, and up to 3000 metres elevation in the subtropical mountains of Asia.&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995" /&gt; Some forests are dominated by Lauraceae, while in others evergreen laurophyll trees of the beech family ([[Fagaceae]]) are predominant, including ring-cupped oaks (''[[Quercus]]'' subgenus ''Cyclobalanopsis''), chinquapin (''[[Castanopsis]]'') and tanoak (''[[Lithocarpus]]'').&lt;ref name="Box, Elgene O. 1998" /&gt; Other characteristic plants include ''[[Schima]]'' and ''[[Camellia]]'', which are members of the tea family ([[Theaceae]]), as well as [[magnolia]]s, [[bamboo]], and [[rhododendron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0118|name=Jian Nan subtropical evergreen forests|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subtropical forests lie between the temperate deciduous and conifer forests to the north and the subtropical/tropical monsoon forests of Indochina and India to the south.

Associations of Lauraceous species are common in broadleaved forests; for example, ''[[Litsea]]'' spp., ''[[Litsea cupola]], [[Persea odoratissima]], [[Persea duthiei]],'' etc., along with such others as ''[[Engelhardtia spicata]], [[Rhododendron arboreum]], [[Lyonia ovalifolia]], [[Pyrus pashia]], [[Rhus]]'' spp., ''[[Acer oblongum]], [[Myrica esculenta]], [[Michelia kisopa]]'', and ''[[Betula alnoides]]''. Some other common trees and large shrub species of subtropical forests are ''[[Semecarpus anacardium]], [[Cretaeava unilocularis]], [[Trewia nudiflora]], [[Premna interrupta]], [[Ulmus lancifolia]], [[Ulmus chumlia]], [[Glochidium velutinum]], [[Callicarpa arborea]], [[Toona ciliata]], [[Ficus]]'' spp., ''[[Mahosama similicifolia]], [[Trevesia palmate]], [[Xylosma longifolium]], [[Boehmeria rugulosa]], [[Scheffera venulosa]], [[Michelia]]'' spp., ''[[Casearia graveilens]], [[Rhus wallichii]], [[Actinodaphne reticulata]], [[Sapimum insegne]], [[Alnus nepalensis]], [[Ardisia thyrsiflora]], [[Ilex]]'' spp, ''[[Macaranga pustulata]], [[Trichilia cannoroides]], [[Celtis tetranda]], [[Wenlendia puberula]], [[Saurauia nepalensis]], [[Ligustrum confusum]], [[Quercus glauca]], [[Zizyphus incurva]], [[Camellia kissi]], [[Hymenodictyon flaccidum]], [[Maytenus thomsonii]], [[Zanthoxylum armatum]], [[Rhus succednea]], [[Eurya acuminata]], [[Myrsine semiserrata]], [[Slonea tomentosa]], [[Hydrangea asper]], [[Symplocus]]'' spp., ''[[Cleyrea]]'' spp. and ''[[Quercus lamellose]]''.

In the temperate zone, the cloud forest between 2,000 and 3,000&amp;nbsp;m altitude supports broadleaved evergreen forest dominated by plants such as ''[[Quercus lamillosa]]'' and ''[[Quercus semicarpifolia|Q. semicarpifolia]]'' in pure or mixed stands. ''[[Lindera]]'' and ''[[Litsea]]'' species, ''[[Tsuga dumosa]]'', and ''[[Rhododendron]]'' spp. are also present in the upper levels of this zone. Other important species are ''[[Magnolia campbellii]], [[Michelia doltsopa]], [[Pieris ovalifolia]], [[Daphnephyllum himalayanse]], [[Acer campbellii]], [[Acer pectinatum]]'', and ''[[Sorbus cuspidata]]'', but these species do not extend toward the west beyond central Nepal. ''[[Alnus nepalensis]]'', a pioneer tree species, grows gregariously and forms pure patches of forests on newly exposed slopes, in gullies, beside rivers, and in other moist places.

The common forest types of this zone include ''[[Rhododendron arboreum]], [[Rhododendron barbatum]], [[Lyonia (plant)|Lyonia]]'' spp., ''[[Pieris formosa]]; [[Tsuga dumosa]]'' forest with such deciduous taxa as ''[[Acer (plant)|Acer]]'' and ''[[Magnolia]]''; deciduous mixed broadleaved forest of ''[[Acer campbellii]], [[Acer pectinatum]], [[Sorbus cuspidata]]'', and ''[[Magnolia campbellii]]''; mixed broadleaved forest of ''[[Rhododendron arboreum]], [[Acer campbellii]], [[Symplocos ramosissima]]'' and Lauraceae.

This zone is habitat for many other important tree and large shrub species such as ''[[Abies pindrow]], [[Betula utilis]], [[Buxus rugulosa]], [[Benthamidia capitata]], [[Corylus ferox]], [[Deutzia staminea]], [[Euonymus tingens]], [[Abies spectalbilis]], [[Acanthopanax cissifolius]], [[Acer campbellii]], [[Acer pectinatum]], [[Betula alnoides]], [[Coriaria terminalis]], [[Fraxinus macrantha]], [[Dodecadenia grandiflora]], [[Eurya cerasifolia]], [[Hydrangea heteromala]], [[Ilex dipyrena]], [[Ligustrum]]'' spp., ''[[Litsea elongata]], [[Juglans regia]], [[Lichelia doltsopa]], [[Myrsine capitallata]], [[Neolitsea umbrosa]], [[Philadelphus tomentosus]], [[Osmanthus fragrans]], [[Prunus cornuta]], [[Rhododendron companulatum]], [[Sorbus cuspidate]]'', and ''[[Viburnum continifolium]]''.

In ancient times, laurel forests (''shoyojurin'') were the predominant vegetation type in the [[Taiheiyo evergreen forests]] ecoregion of Japan, which encompasses the mild temperate climate region of southeastern Japan's Pacific coast. There were three main types of evergreen broadleaf forests, in which ''[[Castanopsis]]'', ''[[Machilus]]'', or ''[[Quercus]]'' predominated. Most of these forests were logged or cleared for cultivation and replanted with faster-growing [[conifer]]s, like [[pine]] or [[hinoki]], and only a few pockets remain.&lt;ref&gt;Karan, Pradyumna Prasad (2005).

=== Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines ===
Laurel forests occupy the humid tropical highlands of the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Greater Sunda Islands]], and [[Philippines]] above {{convert|1000|m}} elevation. The flora of these forests is similar to that of the warm-temperate and subtropical laurel forests of East Asia, including oaks ''([[Quercus]])'', tanoak ''([[Lithocarpus]])'', chinquapin ''([[Castanopsis]])'', Lauraceae, [[Theaceae]], and [[Clethraceae]].

[[Epiphyte]]s, including orchids, ferns, moss, lichen, and liverworts, are more abundant than in either temperate laurel forests or the adjacent lowland tropical rain forests. [[Myrtaceae]] are common at lower elevations, and conifers and rhododendrons at higher elevations. These forests are distinct in species composition from the lowland tropical forests, which are dominated by [[Dipterocarp]]s and other tropical species.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0103|name=Borneo montane rain forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurel forests are found in the islands of [[Macaronesia]] in the eastern Atlantic, in particular the [[Azores]], [[Madeira Islands]], and [[Canary Islands]] from 400 to 1200&amp;nbsp;metres elevation. Trees of the genera ''[[Apollonias]]'' ([[Lauraceae]]), ''[[Ocotea]]'' ([[Lauraceae]]), ''[[Persea]]'' ([[Lauraceae]]), ''[[Clethra]]'' ([[Clethra]]ceae), ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' ([[Ruscaceae]]), and ''[[Picconia]]'' ([[Oleaceae]]) are characteristic.&lt;ref name="Madeira Laurel Forest"&gt;[http://www.madeirabirds.com/madeira_laurel_forest Madeira Laurel Forest], Madeira Wind Birds 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Madeira Islands laurel forest was designated a [[World Heritage site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1999. The paleobotanical record of Madeira reveals that laurissilva forests has existed in this island for at least 1.8 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Góis-Marques|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Madeira|first2=José|last3=Menezes de Sequeira|first3=Miguel|title=Inventory and review of the Mio–Pleistocene São Jorge flora (Madeira Island, Portugal): palaeoecological and biogeographical implications|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|date=7 February 2017|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/14772019.2017.1282991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millions of years ago, laurel forests were widespread around the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The drying of the region since the [[Pliocene]] and cooling during the [[Ice Ages]] caused these rainforests to retreat. Some relict Mediterranean laurel forest species, such as sweet bay ''([[Laurus nobilis]])'' and European holly ''([[Ilex aquifolium]])'', are fairly widespread around the Mediterranean basin.

In the Mediterranean there are other areas with species adapted to the same habitat, but which do not form a laurel forest. The most important is the [[Hedera|ivy]], a climber or vine that is well represented in most of Europe, where it spread again after the glaciations. The "loro" (''[[Prunus lusitanica]]'') is the only tree that survives as a relict in some [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] riversides, especially in the western part of the peninsula, particularly the [[Extremadura]], and to a small extent in the Northeast. In other cases, the presence of Mediterranean laurel  (''[[Laurus nobilis]]'') provides an indication of the previous existence of laurel forest. This species survives natively in [[Morocco]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Greece]], the Mediterranean islands, and some areas of [[Spain]], including the [[Parque Natural Los Alcornocales]] in the province of [[Cádiz]] and in coastal mountains, especially in the [[Province of Girona|Girona Province]] of [[Catalonia]], which keeps the best "lauredales", and isolated in the [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] area. [[Cortegada Island]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] is famous for its vast forest of laurels, but this forest is not indigenous to the island, but originated in plantings after the native vegetation had been destroyed. The [[Myrtaceae|myrtle]] spread through North Africa. [[Tree Heath]] ''(Erica arborea)'' grows in southern Iberia, but without reaching the dimensions observed in the temperate evergreen forest or North Africa. The subspecies ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]] baeticum'' and/or ''[[Rhamnus frangula]] baetica'' still persist in humid microclimates, such as stream valleys, in Spain's [[Baetic Cordillera]], in the Portuguese mountains of [[Monchique]], and the [[Rif Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpretation Manual of European Union Habitats|year=2007|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/docs/2007_07_im.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2013}}

Although the Atlantic laurisilva is more abundant in the Macaronesian archipelagos, where the weather has fluctuated little since the [[Tertiary]], there are small representations and some species contribution to the oceanic and Mediterranean ecoregions of Europe, [[Asia minor]] and west and north of Africa, where microclimates in the coastal mountain ranges form inland "islands" favorable to the persistence of laurel forests. In some cases these were genuine islands in the Tertiary, and in some cases simply areas that remained ice-free. When the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] reclosed, the species repopulated toward the Iberian Peninsula to the north and were distributed along with other African species, but the seasonally drier and colder climate, prevented them reaching their previous extent. In Atlantic Europe, subtropical vegetation is interspersed with taxa from Europe and North African in bioclimatic enclaves such as [[Monchique Islet|Monchique]],  [[Sintra]], and the coastal mountains from [[Cadiz]] to [[Algeciras]]. In the Mediterranean region, remnant laurel forest is present in some islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], on the [[Black Sea]] coast of Iran and Turkey, including the laurifolia castanopsis and true laurus forests, associated with ''[[Prunus laurocerasus]]'', and conifers such as ''[[Taxus baccata]]'', ''[[Cedrus atlantica]]'', and ''[[Abies pinsapo]]''.

In Europe the laurel forest has been badly damaged by timber harvesting, by fire (both accidental and deliberate to open fields for crops), by the introduction of exotic animal and plant species that have displaced the original cover, and by replacement with arable fields, exotic timber plantations, cattle pastures, and [[golf]] courses and tourist facilities. Most of the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] is in serious danger of extinction. The laurel forest flora are usually strong and vigorous, so the forest regenerates easily; its decline is due to external forces.

=== Nepal ===
In the Himalayas, in Nepal, subtropical forest consists of species such as ''[[Schima wallichii]]'', ''[[Castanopsis indica]]'', and ''[[Castanopsis tribuloides]]'' in relatively humid areas. Some common forest types in this region include ''Castanopsis tribuloides'' mixed with ''[[Schima wallichi]], Rhododendron'' spp., ''[[Lyonia ovalifolia]], [[Eurya acuminata]]'', and ''[[Quercus glauca]]''; ''Castanopsis''-Laurales forest with ''Symplocas'' spp.; ''[[Alnus nepalensis]]'' forests; ''Schima wallichii-Castanopsis indica'' hygrophile forest; ''Schima-Pinus'' forest; ''[[Pinus roxburghii]]'' forests with ''[[Phyllanthus emblica]]. [[Semicarpus anacardium]]'', ''Rhododendron arboreum'' and ''[[Lyoma ovalifolia]]; Schima-Lagestromea parviflora'' forest, ''[[Quercus lamellosa]]'' forest with ''[[Quercus lenata]]'' and 'Quercus glauca; ''Castanopsis'' forests with ''[[Castanopsis hystrix]]'' and Lauraceae.

=== Africa ===
{{Main|Afromontane}}
The [[Afromontane]] laurel forests describe the plant and animal species common to the mountains of [[Africa]] and the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The afromontane regions of Africa are discontinuous, separated from each other by lowlands, resembling a series of islands in distribution. Patches of forest with Afromontane floristic affinities occur all along the mountain chains. Afromontane communities occur above {{convert|1500–2000|m}} elevation near the equator, and as low as {{convert|300|m}} elevation in the [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests]] of [[South Africa]]. Afromontane forests are cool and humid. Rainfall is generally greater than {{convert|700|mm/year|in/year}}, and can exceed {{convert|2000|mm}} in some regions, occurring throughout the year or during winter or summer, depending on the region. Temperatures can be extreme at some of the higher altitudes, where snowfalls may occasionally occur.

In [[Subsaharan Africa]], laurel forests are found in the [[Cameroon Highlands forests]] along the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], along the East African Highlands, a long chain of mountains extending from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] around the [[African Great Lakes]] to [[South Africa]], in the Highlands of [[Madagascar]], and in the montane zone of the [[São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón moist lowland forests]]. These scattered highland laurophyll forests of Africa are similar to one another in species composition (known as the [[Afromontane]] flora), and distinct from the flora of the surrounding lowlands.

The main species of the Afromontane forests include the broadleaf canopy trees of genus ''[[Beilschmiedia]]'', with ''[[Apodytes dimidiata]]'', ''[[Ilex mitis]]'', ''[[Nuxia congesta]]'', ''[[Nuxia floribunda|N. floribunda]]'', ''[[Kiggelaria africana]]'', ''[[Prunus africana]]'', ''[[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'', ''[[Halleria lucida]]'', ''[[Ocotea bullata]]'', and ''[[Xymalos monospora]]'', along with the emergent conifers ''[[Podocarpus latifolius]]'' and ''[[Afrocarpus falcatus]]''. Species composition of the Subsaharan laurel forests differs from that of Eurasia. Trees of the [[lauraceae|Laurel family]] are less prominent, limited to ''[[Ocotea]]'' or ''[[Beilschmiedia]]'' due to exceptional [[Biology|biological]] and [[Paleoecology|paleoecological]] interest and the enormous [[biodiversity]] mostly but with many endemic species, and the members of the beech family (Fagaceae) are absent.&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995" /&gt; &lt;!-- This last sentence is unclear. --&gt;

Trees can be up to {{convert|30|or|40|m|ft}} tall and distinct strata of emergent trees, canopy trees, and shrub and herb layers are present. Tree species include: Real Yellowwood (''[[Podocarpus latifolius]]''), Outeniqua Yellowwood (''[[Podocarpus falcatus]]''), White Witchhazel (''[[Trichocladus ellipticus]]''), ''[[Rhus chirendensis]]'', ''[[Curtisia dentata]]'', ''[[Calodendrum capense]]'', ''[[Apodytes dimidiata]]'', ''[[Halleria lucida]]'', ''[[llex mitis]]'', ''[[Kiggelaria africana]]'', ''[[Nuxia floribunda]]'', ''[[Xymalos monospora]]'', and ''[[Ocotea bullata]]''. Shrubs and climbers are common and include: Common Spikethorn (''[[Maytenus heterophylla]]''), Cat-thorn (''[[Scutia myrtina]]''), Numnum (''[[Carissa bispinosa]]''), ''[[Secamone alpinii]]'', ''[[Canthium ciliatum]]'', ''[[Rhoicissus tridentata]]'', ''[[Zanthoxylum capense]]'', and ''[[Burchellia bubalina]]''. In the undergrowth grasses, herbs and ferns may be locally common: Basketgrass (''[[Oplismenus hirtellus]]''), Bushman Grass (''[[Stipa dregeana]]'' var. ''elongata''), Pigs-ears (''[[Centella asiatica]]''), ''[[Cyperus albostriatus]]'', ''[[Polypodium polypodioides]]'', ''[[Polystichum tuctuosum]]'', ''[[Streptocarpus rexii]]'', and ''[[Plectranthus]]'' spp. Ferns, shrubs and small trees such as [[Cape Beech]] (''[[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'') are often abundant along the forest edges.

=== USA Southeast States ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
According to the recent study by Box and Fujiwara (Evergreen Broadleaved Forests of the Southeastern United States: Preliminary Description), laurel forests occur in patches in the southeastern United States from southeast [[North Carolina]] southward to [[Florida]], and west to [[Texas]], mostly along the coast and coastal plain of the Gulf and south Atlantic coast. In the southeastern United States, evergreen [[Hammock (ecology)]] (i.e. topographically induced forest islands) contain many laurel forests. These laurel forests occur mostly in moist depression and floodplains. In many portions of the coastal plain, a low-lying mosaic topography of white sand, silt, and [[limestone]] (mostly in [[Florida]]), separate these laurel forests. Frequent fire is also thought to be responsible for the disjointed geography of laurel forests across the coastal plain of the southeastern United States.

Despite being located in a humid climate zone, much of the broadleaf Laurel forests in the Southeast USA are semi-[[sclerophyll]] in character. The semi-sclerophyll character is due (in part) to the sandy soils and often periodic semi-arid nature of the climate. As one moves south into central Florida, the sclerophyll character slowly declines and more tree species from the tropics ([[Caribbean]]) increase as the temperate species decline. As such, the southeastern laurel forests gives way to [[tropical savanna]].

There are several different broadleaved evergreen canopy trees in the laurel forests of the southeastern United States. In some areas, the evergreen forests are dominated by species of Live Oak (''[[Quercus virginiana]]''), Laurel Oak (''[[Quercus hemisphaerica]]''), Southern Magnolia (''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]''), Red Bay (''[[Persea borbonia]]''), Cabbage Palm (''[[Sabal palmetto]]''), and Sweetbay Magnolia (''[[Magnolia virginiana]]''). In several areas on the barrier islands, a stunted ''[[Quercus geminata]]'' or mixed ''Quercus geminata'' and ''Quercus virginiana'' forest dominates, with a dense evergreen understory of scrub palm ''[[Serenoa repens]]'' and a variety of vines, including ''[[Bignonia capreolata]]'', as well as ''[[Smilax]]'' and ''[[Vitis species]]'''. ''[[Gordonia lasianthus]]'', ''[[Ilex opaca]]'' and ''[[Osmanthus americanus]]'' also may occur as canopy co-dominant in coastal dune forests, with ''[[Cliftonia monophylla]]'' and ''[[Vaccinium arboreum]]'' as a dense evergreen understory (Box and Fujiwara 1988).

The lower [[shrub layer]] of the evergreen forests is often mixed with other evergreen species from the palm family (''[[Rhapidophyllum hystrix]]''), Bush palmetto(''[[Sabal minor]]''), and Saw Palmetto (''[[Serenoa repens]]''), and several species in the Ilex family, including ''[[Ilex glabra]]'', [[Dahoon Holly]], and [[Yaupon Holly]]. In many areas, ''[[Cyrilla racemiflora]]'', ''[[Lyonia fruticosa]]'',  Wax Myrtle ''[[Myrica]]'' is present as an evergreen understory. Several species of ''[[Yucca]]'' and ''[[Opuntia]]'' are native as well to the drier sandy coastal scrub environment of the region, including ''[[Yucca aloifolia]]'', ''[[Yucca filamentosa]]'', ''[[Yucca gloriosa]]'', and ''[[opuntia stricta]]''.

=== USA ancient California ===
During the [[Miocene]], oak-laurel forests were found in Central and Southern [[California]]. Typical tree species included oaks ancestral to present-day California oaks, as well as an assemblage of trees from the Laurel family, including ''[[Nectandra]]'', ''[[Ocotea]]'', ''[[Persea]]'', and ''[[Umbellularia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Daniel I. (2000) ''A Miocene (10-12 Ma) Evergreen Laurel-Oak Forest from Carmel Valley, California.'' University of California Publications in Geological Sciences 145; April 2000. 3rd ed.

''Terrestrial vegetation of California''. Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-1-282-35915-4}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Only one native species from the Laurel family (Lauraceae), ''[[Umbellularia californica]],'' remains in California today.

There are however, several areas in Mediterranean California, as well as isolated areas of southern Oregon that have evergreen forests. Several species of evergreen ''[[Quercus]]'' forests occur, as well as a mix of evergreen scrub typical of [[Mediterranean climate]]s. Species of ''[[Notholithocarpus]]'', ''[[Arbutus menziesii]]'', and ''[[Umbellularia californica]]'' can be canopy species in several areas.

=== Central America ===
The laurel forest is the most common [[Central America]]n temperate evergreen cloud forest type. They are found in mountainous areas of southern [[Mexico]] and almost all Central American countries, normally more than {{convert|1000|m}} above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the Laurel family, and species of ''[[Weinmannia]]'', ''[[Drimys]]'', and ''[[Magnolia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0167|name=Talamancan montane forests|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cloud forest of [[Sierra de las Minas]], [[Guatemala]], is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern [[Honduras]] there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with [[Nicaragua]]. In [[Nicaragua]] the [[cloud forest]]s are found in the border zone with Honduras, and most were cleared to grow [[coffee]]. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the [[Mombacho]] volcano in Nicaragua. In [[Costa Rica]] there are laurisilvas in the "Cordillera de [[Tilarán]]" and [[Volcán Arenal]], called [[Monteverde]], also in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]].

=== Tropical Andes ===
The [[Yungas]] are typically evergreen forests or jungles, and multi-species, which often contain many species of the laurel forest. They occur discontinuously from [[Venezuela]] to northwestern [[Argentina]] including in [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], usually in the Sub-Andean Sierras. The forest relief is varied and in places where the Andes meet the Amazon, it includes steeply sloped areas. Characteristic of this region are deep ravines formed by the rivers, such as that of the [[Tarma River]] descending to the San Ramon Valley, or the [[Urubamba River]] as it passes through [[Machu Picchu]]. Many of the Yungas are degraded or are forests in recovery that have not yet reached their [[climax vegetation]].

=== Southeastern South America ===

The laurel forests of the region are known as the ''Laurisilva Misionera'', after Argentina's [[Misiones Province]]. The [[Araucaria moist forests]] occupy a portion of the highlands of southern Brazil, extending into northeastern Argentina. The forest canopy includes species of Lauraceae (''[[Ocotea pretiosa]]'' and ''[[Ocotea catharinense|O. catharinense]]''), Myrtaceae (''[[Campomanesia xanthocarpa]]''), and Leguminosae (''[[Parapiptadenia rigida]]''), with an emergent layer of the conifer Brazilian Araucaria (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'') reaching up to {{convert|45|m|ft}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0101|name=Araucaria moist forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtropical [[Serra do Mar coastal forests]] along the southern coast of Brazil have a tree canopy of Lauraceae and Myrtaceae, with emergent trees of Leguminaceae, and a rich diversity of [[bromeliad]]s and trees and shrubs of family [[Melastomaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0160|name=Serra do Mar coastal forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inland [[Alto Paraná Atlantic forests]], which occupy portions of the Brazilian Highlands in southern Brazil and adjacent parts of Argentina and Paraguay, are semi-deciduous.

=== Central Chile ===
{{Main|Valdivian temperate rain forests}}

The Valdivian temperate rain forests, or ''Laurisilva Valdiviana'', occupy southern [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] from the Pacific Ocean to the [[Andes]]  between 38° and 45° latitude. Rainfall is abundant, from {{convert|1500|to(-)|5000|mm}} according to locality, distributed throughout the year, but with some subhumid Mediterranean climate influence for 3–4 months in summer. The temperatures are sufficiently invariant and mild, with no month falling below {{convert|5|C}}, and the warmest month below {{convert|22|C}}.

=== Australia, New Caledonia and New Zealand ===
{{Main|Biodiversity of New Caledonia}}
[[File:Nothofagus demis.JPG|thumb|Distribution of ''[[Nothofagus]]'', a plant genus that typifies Gondwanan distribution, having descended from the supercontinent and persisting in Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Chile; fossils have also been found in Antarctica]]
Laurel forest appears on mountains of the coastal strip of New South Wales in [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Tasmania]], and [[New Zealand]]. The laurel forests of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand are home to species related to those in the Valdivian laurel forests, including Southern Beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'', fossils of which have recently been found in Antarctica&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = H.M. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Z.K. | year = 2007 | title = Fossil nothofagaceous leaves from the Eocene of western Antarctica and their bearing on the origin, dispersal and systematics of Nothofagus | url = | journal = Science in China | volume = 50 | issue = 10| pages = 1525–1535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]]. Other typical flora include [[Winteraceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], Southern Sassafras ([[Atherospermataceae]]), conifers of [[Araucariaceae]], [[Podocarpaceae]], and [[Cupressaceae]], and [[tree fern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, Kazue and Elgene O. Box (1999).

Walther, eds. Basel: Birkhauser, {{ISBN|978-3-7643-6086-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Caledonia was an ancient fragment of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Unlike many of the Pacific Islands, which are of relatively recent volcanic origin, New Caledonia is part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], a fragment of the ancient Gondwana that separated from Australia 60–85&amp;nbsp;million years ago,&lt;ref name="Te Ara"&gt;{{cite web |author=Keith Lewis |author2=Scott D. Nodder |author3=Lionel Carter |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/OceanStudyAndConservation/SeaFloorGeology/1/en | title=Zealandia: the New Zealand continent |work=Te Ara&amp;nbsp;— the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=11 January 2007 | accessdate=22 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ridge linking New Caledonia to [[New Zealand]] has been deeply submerged for millions of years. This isolated New Caledonia from the rest of the world's landmasses, preserving a snapshot of Gondwanan forests. New Caledonia and New Zealand are separated by [[continental drift]] of Australia 85 million years ago. The islands still shelter an extraordinary diversity of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants and animals of Gondwanan origin that have later spread to the southern continents.

The laurel forest of Australia, [[New Caledonia]] (''[[Adenodaphne]]''), and New Zealand have a number of species related to those of the Valdivian laurel forest, through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]] of [[gymnosperms]] like the [[podocarpus]] and deciduous Nothofagus. ''[[Beilschmiedia tawa]]'' is often the dominant canopy species of genus ''[[Beilschmiedia]]'' in lowland laurel forests in the [[North Island]] and the northeast of the [[South Island]], but will also often form the subcanopy in primary forests throughout the country in these areas, with [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] such as [[Kahikatea]], [[Prumnopitys taxifolia|Matai]], [[Miro (tree)|Miro]] and [[Rimu]]. Genus ''Beilschmiedia'' are trees and [[shrub]]s widespread in tropical [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[South America]] as far south as [[Chile]]. In the [[Corynocarpus]] family, ''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'' is called laurel of New Zealand, while ''[[Laurelia novae-zelandiae]]'' belongs to the same genus as ''[[Laurelia sempervirens]]''. The tree [[niaouli]] grows in Australia, New Caledonia, and Papua.

New Caledonia lies at the northern end of the ancient continent [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], while New Zealand rises at the plate boundary that bisects it. These land masses are two outposts of the Antarctic flora, including [[Araucaria]]s and [[Podocarp]]s. At [[Curio Bay]], fossilized logs can be seen of trees closely related to modern [[Kauri]] and [[Norfolk Pine]] that grew on Zealandia about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago during the [[Jurassic]] period, before it split from Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 Fossil forest: Features of Curio Bay/Porpoise Bay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017015051/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=35598 |date=2008-10-17 }} Retrieved on 2007-11-06&lt;/ref&gt;

During glacial periods more of Zealandia became a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] rather than a marine environment. Zealandia was originally thought to have no native land [[mammal]]s, but a recent discovery in 2006 of a fossil mammal jaw from the [[Miocene]] in the [[Otago]] region shows otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand|last=Campbell|first=Hamish|authorlink=|author2=Gerard Hutching |year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=North Shore, New Zealand|isbn=978-0-14-302088-2|pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Guinea]] and Northern Australian ecoregions are closely related. Over time Australia drifted north and became drier; the humid Antarctic flora from Gondwana retreated to the east coast and [[Tasmania]], while the rest of Australia became dominated by sclerophyll forest and [[xeric]] shrubs and grasses. Humans arrived in Australia 50–60,000 years ago, and used fire to reshape the vegetation of the continent; as a result,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} the Antarctic flora, also known as the ''Rainforest flora'' in Australia, retreated to a few isolated areas composing less than 2% of Australia's land area.

==== New Guinea ====
The eastern end of [[Malesia]], including [[New Guinea]] and the [[Aru Islands]] of eastern Indonesia, is linked to Australia by a shallow continental shelf, and shares many [[marsupial]] mammal and bird [[taxon|taxa]] with Australia. New Guinea also has many additional elements of the Antarctic flora, including southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]'') and [[Eucalypt]]s. New Guinea has the highest mountains in [[Malesia]], and vegetation ranges from tropical lowland forest to [[tundra]].

The highlands of New Guinea and [[New Britain]] are home to montane laurel forests, from about {{convert|1000|to(-)|2500|m}} elevation. These forests include species typical of both Northern Hemisphere laurel forests, including ''[[Lithocarpus]], [[Ilex]],'' and Lauraceae, and Southern Hemisphere laurel forests, including Southern Beech ''[[Nothofagus]]'', ''[[Araucaria]]'', [[Podocarp]]s, and trees of the Myrtle family ([[Myrtaceae]]).&lt;ref name="Tagawa, Hideo 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0105|name=Central Range montane rain forests|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Guinea and Northern Australia are closely related. Around 40 million years ago, the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian tectonic plate]] began to split apart from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. As it collided with the [[Pacific Plate]] on its northward journey, the high mountain ranges of central [[New Guinea]] emerged around 5&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=Frith&gt;Frith, D.W., Frith, C.B.

[[File:West Dean lynchet.JPG|thumb|right|The slope of a prehistoric lynchet at [[West Dean, West Sussex]]]]
A '''lynchet''' is an earth terrace found on the side of a hill. Lynchets are a feature of ancient field systems of the [[British Isles]]. They are commonly found in vertical rows and more commonly referred to as 'strip lynchets'. Lynchets appear predominantly in Southern Britain and many are in areas close to [[Hillfort|Iron Age forts]] and other earthworks, including later Roman earthworks and earlier [[Tumulus|barrows]] from the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] periods. The size, location, spacing and number of rows of many strip lynchets indicates that many were man-made. It is most likely that lynchets were dug to maximise the use of land for agriculture, although they may have had other, ceremonial uses. 

In the village of [[Loders]], Dorset, lynchets form a terraced band structure similar to an amphitheatre overlooking the village. [[File:Loders Lynchet theatre.jpg|thumb|Lynchets are arranged in a semi-circular giant amphitheatre above the village of Loders in Dorset.]] Lynchets form part of the Conservation area of neighbouring village [[Uploders]] and where they apparently form old hillside field systems in close proximity to an iron age fort and hill-top barrows. Maps from the 1800 indicate that cider orchards were planted on some lynchets in that area. 


The traditional theory on the formation of lynchets is that they may form naturally on the downslope of a field [[plough]]ed over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68626|title=National Monuments Record Thesauri|author=|date=|work=|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=14 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172401/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68626|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbed [[soil]] slips down the hillside to create a positive lynchet while the area reduced in level becomes a negative lynchet{{clarify|date=September 2014}}. 

The word is the diminutive form of ''lynch'', now rarely appearing in the [[English language]], indicating an [[Terrace (agriculture)|agricultural terrace]].

== Role of material handling ==
Material handling plays an important role in manufacturing and logistics, which together represent over 20% of the U.S. economy.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing
12.0% in 2014 ({{Cite web|url = http://www.nam.org/Newsroom/Facts-About-Manufacturing/|title = Facts About Manufacturing|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-05 |publisher = Nat. Assoc. of Mfg. }}) and logistics
8.2% in 2013 ({{Cite web|url = http://info.tranzact.com/hs-fs/hub/329734/file-2168640880-pdf/2mw-email/25th_Annual_SOL_Report_Update_11_10_14.pdf|title = Annual State of Logistics Report State of Logistics Report|date = Nov 2014|accessdate = 2015-02-15|publisher = CSCMP}})&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every item of physical commerce was transported on a conveyor or lift truck or other type of [[material handling equipment]] in manufacturing plants, warehouses, and retail stores.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mhlroadmap.org/downloads/mhl_roadmap.pdf|title = Material Handling and Logistics U.S. Roadmap|date = January 2014|accessdate = 2015-05-08|publisher = MHI}}&lt;/ref&gt; While material handling is usually required as part of every production worker's job, over 650,000 people in the U.S. work as dedicated "material moving machine operators" and have a median annual wage of $31,530 (May 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/material-moving-machine-operators.htm|title = Occupational Outlook Handbook|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-14|publisher = BLS}}&lt;/ref&gt; These operators use material handling equipment to transport various goods in a variety of industrial settings including moving construction materials around building sites or moving goods onto ships.

== Design of material handling systems ==
[[File:TG-usine-après.JPG|thumb|Material flow diagram between activities in a layout]]

Material handling is integral to the design of most production systems since the efficient flow of material between the activities of a production system is heavily dependent on the arrangement (or ''layout'') of the activities. If two activities are adjacent to each other, then material might easily be handed from one activity to another. If activities are in sequence, a conveyor can move the material at low cost. If activities are separated, more expensive industrial trucks or overhead conveyors are required for transport. The high cost of using an industrial truck for material transport is due to both the labor costs of the operator and the negative impact on the performance of a production system (e.g., increased [[work in process]]) when multiple units of material are combined into a single transfer batch in order to reduce the number of trips required for transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Factory Physics|last = Hopp|first = W.J.|publisher = Waveland|year = 2011|location = Long Grove, IL|pages = 318–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The unit load concept ===
[[File:Unit Load Size.png|thumb|Production batch can be split into a smaller transfer batch containing several unit loads, each of which can contain multiple parts]]

A unit load is either a single unit of an item, or multiple units so arranged or restricted that they can be handled as a single unit and maintain their integrity. Although granular, liquid, and gaseous materials can be transported in bulk, they can also be contained into unit loads using bags, drums, and cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Basics of Material Handling|last = Kulwiec|first = R.A.|publisher = MHI|year = 1981|location = Charlotte, NC|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of unit loads are that more items can be handled at the same time (thereby reducing the number of trips required, and potentially reducing handling costs, loading and unloading times, and product damage) and that it enables the use of standardized material handling equipment. Disadvantages of unit loads include the negative impact of batching on production system performance, and the cost of returning empty containers/pallets to their point of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing Facilities: Location, Planning, and Design|last = Sule|first = D.R.|publisher = PWS|year = 1994|location = Boston|pages = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pallet wrapper.jpg|thumb|Stretch-wrapping machine used to form a unit load]]

=== In-process handling ===
Unit loads can be used both for in-process handling and for distribution (receiving, storing, and shipping). Unit load design involves determining the type, size, weight, and configuration of the load; the equipment and method used to handle the load; and the methods of forming (or building) and breaking down the load. For in-process handling, unit loads should not be larger than the [[batch production|production batch]] size of parts in process. Large production batches (used to increase the utilization of bottleneck activities) can be split into smaller ''transfer batches'' for handling purposes, where each transfer batch contains one or more unit loads, and small unit loads can be combined into a larger transfer batch to allow more efficient transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modeling and Analysis of Manufacturing Systems|last = Askin|first = R.G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 1993|location = New York|pages = 292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution ===
[[File:ALMACEN CAYCO carpetilla.jpg|thumb|Narrow-aisle lift truck used in distribution]]
Selecting a unit load size for distribution can be difficult because containers/pallets are usually available only in standard sizes and configurations; truck trailers, rail boxcars, and airplane cargo bays are limited in width, length, and height; and the number of feasible container/pallet sizes for a load may be limited due to the existing warehouse layout and storage rack configurations and customer package/carton size and retail store shelf restrictions. Also, the practical size of a unit load may be limited by the equipment and aisle space available and the need for safe material handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/Material_Handling_Equipment.pdf|title = Material Handling Equipment|date = 2012|accessdate = 2014-10-02|publisher = |last = Kay|first = M.G.|pages = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of material handling ==

=== Manual handling ===
[[File:Niosh-lifting-equation-illustration.gif|thumb|NIOSH Lifting Equation applied to loading punch press stock task]]

Manual handling refers to the use of a worker’s hands to move individual containers by lifting, lowering, filling, emptying, or carrying them. It can expose workers to physical conditions that can lead to injuries that represent a large percentage of the over half a million cases of musculoskeletal disorders reported in the U.S. each year, and often involve strains and sprains to the lower back, shoulders, and upper limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-131/pdfs/2007-131.pdf|title = Ergonomic Guidelines for Manual Material Handling|date = 2007|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = California Department of Industrial Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ergonomic improvements can be used to modify manual handling tasks to reduce injury. These improvements can include reconfiguring the task and using positioning equipment like lift/tilt/turn tables, hoists, balancers, and manipulators to reduce reaching and bending. The NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) 1991 Revised Lifting Equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applications Manual for the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation|last = Waters|first = T.R.|publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|year = 1994|location = Cincinnati, OH|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to evaluate manual lifting tasks. Under ideal circumstances, the maximum recommended weight for manual lifting to avoid back injuries is 51&amp;nbsp;lb (23.13&amp;nbsp;kg). Using the exact conditions of the lift (height, distance lifted, weight, position of weight relative to body, asymmetrical lifts, and objects that are difficult to grasp), six multipliers are used to reduce the maximum recommended weight for less than ideal lifting tasks.

=== Automated handling ===
[[File:FANUC R2000iB AtWork.jpg|thumb|Industrial robot]]
Whenever technically and economically feasible, equipment can be used to reduce and sometimes replace the need to manually handle material. Most existing material handling equipment is only ''semi-automated'' because a human operator is needed for tasks like loading/unloading and driving that are difficult and/or too costly to fully automate. However, ongoing advances in sensing, machine intelligence, and robotics have made it possible to fully automate an increasing number of handling tasks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dexarticle&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knight |first1=Will |title=This is the most dexterous robot ever created |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610587/robots-get-closer-to-human-like-dexterity/ |website=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hodson |first1=Richard |title=How robots are grasping the art of gripping |journal=Nature |date=10 May 2018 |volume=557 |issue=7704 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05093-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dexnet&gt;[https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/ Mahler, Jeffrey, et al. "Dexterity Network Home Page"]&lt;/ref&gt; A rough guide to determine how much can be spent for automated equipment that would replace one material handler is to consider that, with benefits, the median moving machine operator costs a company $45,432 per year.&lt;ref&gt;$31,530 median wage divided by 0.694, where wages represent 69.4% and benefits 30.6% of total labor cost ({{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecec.nr0.htm|title = Employer Costs for Employee Compensation|date = December 2014|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = BLS}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a real interest rate of 1.7%&lt;ref&gt;Average U.S. rate from 2005-2009 ({{Cite web|url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FR.INR.RINR|title = Real interest rate|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = The World Bank}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and a service life of 5 years&lt;ref&gt;Average service life of Custom Software ({{Cite web|url = https://www.bea.gov/national/FA2004/Tablecandtext.pdf|title = BEA Depreciation Estimates|date = 2004|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = BEA}}), conservative assumption since software is a major component of automated equipment and has the shortest service life compared to other components.&lt;/ref&gt; for the equipment with no salvage value,&lt;ref&gt;Conservative assumption that simplifies the analysis since any positive salvage value would
increase the purchase cost estimate.&lt;/ref&gt; a company should be willing to pay up to

&lt;math&gt;\$45\,432\left (\frac{1-1.017^{-5}}{0.017} \right )=\$45\,432(4.75)=\$219\,019
&lt;/math&gt;

to purchase automated equipment to replace one worker.&lt;ref&gt;Amount willing to pay is the present value of an [[Present value|annuity immediate]].&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, automated equipment is not as flexible as a human operator, both with respect to not being able to do a particular task as well as a human and not being able to be as easily redeployed to do other tasks as needs change.

'''Metastability in electronics''' is the ability of a [[digital electronics]] system to persist for an unbounded time in an [[Equilibrium point|unstable equilibrium]] or [[metastability|metastable]] state.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In digital logic circuits, a [[digital signal]] is required to be within certain voltage or current limits to represent a '0' or '1' [[logic level]] for correct circuit operation; if the signal is within a forbidden intermediate range it may cause faulty behavior in logic gates the signal is applied to.  In metastable states, the circuit may be unable to settle into a stable '0' or '1' logic level within the time required for proper circuit operation.  As a result, the circuit can act in unpredictable ways, and may lead to a system failure, sometimes referred to as a "glitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaney|first=Thomas J.|title=My Work on All Things Metastable OR Me and My Glitch|url=http://blendics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/My-Work-on-All-Things-Metastable-OR-Me-and-My-Glitch.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metastability is an instance of [[Buridan's_ass#Application_to_digital_logic:_Metastability|Buridan's]] paradox.

Metastable states are inherent features of [[asynchronous circuit|asynchronous digital systems]], and of systems with more than one independent [[Clock signal|clock]] domain.  In self-timed asynchronous systems, arbiters are designed to allow the system to proceed only after the metastability has resolved, so the metastability is a normal condition, not an error condition.&lt;ref name="bainbridge"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In synchronous systems with asynchronous inputs, synchronizers are designed to make the probability of a synchronization failure acceptably small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaney|first=Thomas J.|title="Reprint of Technical Memorandum No. 10, "The Glitch Phenomenon" (1966)"|url=http://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=bcl_techreports}}Washington University St. Louis, MO&lt;/ref&gt; 
Metastable states are avoidable in fully synchronous systems when the input [[Setup time#Setup and hold times|setup and hold time]] requirements on flip-flops are satisfied.

==Example==
[[File:SR-NOR-latch.png|thumb|The Set–Reset NOR latch example]]

A simple example of metastability can be found in an [[Flip-flop_(electronics)#SR NOR latch| SR NOR latch]], when {{em|both}} Set and Reset inputs are true (R=1 and S=1) and then both transition to false (R=0 and S=0) at about the same time.  Both outputs Q and {{overline|Q}} are initially held at 0 by the simultaneous Set and Reset inputs. After both Set and Reset inputs change to false, the flip-flop will (eventually) end up in one of two stable states, one of Q and {{overline|Q}} true and the other false.  The final state will depend on which of R or S returns to zero first, chronologically, but if both transition at about the same time, the resulting metastability, with intermediate or oscillatory output levels, can take arbitrarily long to resolve to a stable state.

== Arbiters ==
{{main|arbiter (electronics)}}
In electronics, an ''arbiter'' is a circuit designed to determine which of several signals arrive first. Arbiters are used in asynchronous circuits to order computational activities for shared resources to prevent concurrent incorrect operations. Arbiters are used on the inputs of fully synchronous systems, and also between clock domains, as [[Metastability in electronics|synchronizer]]s for input signals.  Although they can minimize the occurrence of metastability to very low probabilities,  all arbiters nevertheless have metastable states, [[SR latch#Timing considerations|which are unavoidable]] at the boundaries of regions of the input [[state space (controls)|state space]] resulting in different outputs.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synchronous circuits==
[[File:4_Bit_Shift_Register_001.svg|thumb|Synchronizers are used when transferring signals between clock domains. One simple synchronizer design involves simply delaying the input signal (data0) from a different clock domain using multiple edge sensitive flip-flops which are locally clocked (clock0)]]
[[Synchronous circuit]] design techniques make digital circuits that are resistant to the failure modes that can be caused by metastability.  A ''clock domain'' is defined as a group of flip-flops with a common clock.  Such architectures can form a circuit guaranteed free of metastability (below a certain maximum clock frequency, above which first metastability, then outright failure occur), assuming a low-[[Clock skew|skew]] common clock. However, even then, if the system has a dependence on any continuous inputs then these are likely to be vulnerable to metastable states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleeman | first1 = L. | last2 = Cantoni | first2 = A. | year = | title = Metastable Behavior in Digital Systems" December 1987 | url = | journal = IEEE Design &amp; Test of Computers | volume = 4 | issue = 6| pages = 4–19 | doi = 10.1109/MDT.1987.295189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When synchronous design techniques are used, protection against metastable events causing systems failures need only be provided when transferring data between different clock domains or from an unclocked region into the synchronous system. This protection can often take the form of a series of [[Flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|delay flip-flops]] which delay the data stream long enough for metastability failures to occur at a negligible rate.

==Failure modes==
Although metastability is well understood and architectural techniques to control it are known, it persists as a [[failure mode]] in equipment.

Serious computer and [[digital hardware]] bugs caused by metastability have a fascinating social history. Many engineers have refused to believe that a [[flip-flop (electronics)|bistable]] device can enter into a state that is neither ''true'' nor ''false'' and has a positive probability that it will remain indefinite for any given period of time, albeit with exponentially decreasing probability over time.&lt;ref name=" Harris"&gt;{{cite book

At the boundaries in the continuous domain between regions which map to different discrete outputs,  points arbitrarily close together in the continuous domain map to different outputs, making a decision as to which output to select a difficult and potentially lengthy process.&lt;ref name="Lamport 1984"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Leslie Lamport]]|url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/buridan.pdf|title=Buridan's Principle|origyear=December 1984|date=February 2012|accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the inputs to an arbiter or flip-flop arrive almost simultaneously, the circuit most likely will traverse a point of metastability. Metastability remains poorly understood in some circles, and various engineers have proposed their own circuits said to solve or filter out the metastability; typically these circuits simply shift the occurrence of metastability from one place to another.&lt;ref&gt;Ran Ginosar. "[http://www.ee.technion.ac.il/~ran/papers/Sync_Errors_Feb03.pdf Fourteen Ways to Fool Your Synchronizer]" ASYNC 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chips using multiple clock sources are often tested with tester clocks that have fixed phase relationships, not the independent clocks drifting past each other that will be experienced during operation.  This usually explicitly prevents the metastable failure mode that will occur in the field from being seen or reported. Proper testing for metastability often employs clocks of slightly different frequencies and ensuring correct circuit operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24768">'''Neo-Riemannian theory''' is a loose collection of ideas present in the writings of [[music theory|music theorists]] such as [[David Lewin]], Brian Hyer, [[Richard Cohn]], and [[Henry Klumpenhouwer]]. What binds these ideas is a central commitment to relating [[harmony|harmonies]] directly to each other, without necessary reference to a [[tonic (music)|tonic]]. Initially, those harmonies were [[major chord|major]] and [[minor chord|minor triads]]; subsequently, neo-Riemannian theory was extended to standard [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] sonorities as well. Harmonic proximity is characteristically gauged by efficiency of [[voice leading]]. Thus, C major and E minor triads are close by virtue of requiring only a single [[semitone|semitonal]] shift to move from one to the other. Motion between proximate harmonies is described by simple transformations. For example, motion between a C major and E minor triad, in either direction, is executed by an "L" transformation. Extended progressions of harmonies are characteristically displayed on a geometric plane, or map, which portrays the entire system of harmonic relations. Where consensus is lacking is on the question of what is most central to the theory: smooth voice leading, transformations, or the system of relations that is mapped by the geometries. The theory is often invoked when analyzing harmonic practices within the [[Romantic music#Late Romantic Era .281850-1910.29|Late Romantic]] period characterized by a high degree of [[chromaticism]], including work of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]].&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Autumn 1998 |title=An Introduction to Neo-Riemannian Theory: A Survey and Historical Perspective |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=167–180 |jstor=843871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minor as upside down major.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Riemann's 'dualist' system: minor as upside down major.]]

Neo-Riemannian theory is named after [[Hugo Riemann]] (1849–1919), whose "dualist" system for relating triads was adapted from earlier 19th-century harmonic theorists. (The term "[[harmonic dualism|dualism]]" refers to the emphasis on the inversional relationship between major and minor, with minor triads being considered "upside down" versions of major triads; this "dualism" is what produces the change-in-direction described above. See also: [[Utonality]]) In the 1880s, Riemann proposed a system of transformations that related triads directly to each other &lt;ref name="Klumpenhouwer"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Klumpenhouwer |first=Henry |date=1994 |title=Some Remarks on the Use of Riemann Transformations |url=http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.94.0.9/mto.94.0.9.klumpenhouwer.art |journal=[[Music Theory Online]] |volume=0 |issue=9 |issn=1067-3040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of this aspect of Riemann's writings, independently of the dualist premises under which they were initially conceived, originated with [[David Lewin]] (1933–2003), particularly in his article "Amfortas's Prayer to Titurel and the Role of D in Parsifal" (1984) and his influential book, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations'' (1987). Subsequent development in the 1990s and 2000s has expanded the scope of neo-Riemannian theory considerably, with further mathematical systematization to its basic tenets, as well as inroads into 20th century repertoires and music psychology.&lt;ref name="Cohn Intro" /&gt;

==Triadic transformations and voice leading==

The principal transformations of neo-Riemannian triadic theory connect triads of different species (major and minor), and are their own [[inversion (music)|inverses]] (a second application undoes the first). These transformations are purely harmonic, and do not need any particular voice leading between chords: all instances of motion from a C major to a C minor triad represent the same neo-Riemannian transformation, no matter how the voices are distributed in register.

The three transformations move one of the three notes of the triad to produce a different triad:
*The '''P''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Parallel key|Parallel]]. In a Major Triad move the third down a semitone (C major to C minor), in a Minor Triad move the third up a semitone (C minor to C major)
*The '''R''' transformation exchanges a triad for its [[Relative key|Relative]]. In a Major Triad move the fifth up a tone (C major to A minor), in a Minor Triad move the root down a tone (A minor to C major)
*The '''L''' transformation exchanges a triad for its Leading-Tone Exchange. In a Major Triad the root moves down by a semitone (C major to E minor), in a Minor Triad the fifth moves up by a semitone (E minor to C major)

Observe that '''P''' preserves the ''perfect fifth'' interval (so given say C and G there are only two candidates for the third note: E and E{{flat}}), '''L''' preserves the ''minor third'' interval (given E and G our candidates are C and B) and '''R''' preserves the ''major third'' interval (given C and E our candidates are G and A).

Secondary operations can be constructed by combining these basic operations:

*The '''N''' (or ''Nebenverwandt'') relation exchanges a major triad for its minor [[subdominant]], and a minor triad for its major [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] (C major and F minor). The "N" transformation can be obtained by applying R, L, and P successively.&lt;ref name="Cohn Weitzmann"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Spring 2000 |title=Weitzmann's Regions, My Cycles, and Douthett's Dancing Cubes |journal=[[Music Theory Spectrum]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=89–103 |doi=10.1525/mts.2000.22.1.02a00040 |jstor=745854 |via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''S''' (or ''Slide'') relation exchanges two triads that share a third (C major and C{{sharp}} minor); it can be obtained by applying L, P, and R successively in that order.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations |last=Lewin |first=David |date=1987 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780199759941 |location=New Haven, CT |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''H''' relation (LPL) exchanges a triad for its hexatonic pole (C major and A{{flat}} minor)&lt;ref name="Cohn Hexatonic"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=Summer 2004 |title=Uncanny Resemblances: Tonal Signification in the Freudian Age |journal=[[Journal of the American Musicological Society]] |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=285–323 |doi=10.1525/jams.2004.57.2.285|jstor=10.1525/jams.2004.57.2.285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any combination of the L, P, and R transformations will act inversely on major and minor triads: for instance, R-then-P transposes C major down a minor third, to A major via A minor, whilst transposing C minor to E{{flat}} minor up a minor 3rd via E{{flat}} major.

Initial work in neo-Riemannian theory treated these transformations in a largely harmonic manner, without explicit attention to voice leading. Later, Cohn pointed out that neo-Riemannian concepts arise naturally when thinking about certain problems in voice leading.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=27 November 2008 |title=Scale Theory, Serial Theory, and Voice Leading |url=https://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/scalesarrays.pdf |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2249.2008.00257.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two triads (major or minor) share two common tones and can be connected by stepwise voice leading the third voice if and only if they are linked by one of the L, P, R transformations described above.&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth" /&gt; (This property of stepwise voice leading in a single voice is called [[voice-leading]] [[Occam's razor|parsimony]].) Note that here the emphasis on inversional relationships arises naturally, as a byproduct of interest in "parsimonious" voice leading, rather than being a fundamental theoretical postulate, as it was in Riemann's work.

More recently, [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] has argued that the connection between neo-Riemannian operations and voice leading is only approximate (see below).&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mathematics and Computation in Music |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-02394-1 |editor-last=Chew |editor-first=Elaine |series=Communications in Computer and Information Science |volume=38 |location=Heidelberg |pages=258–273 |chapter=Three Conceptions of Musical Distance |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |editor-last2=Childs |editor-first2=Adrian |editor-last3=Chuan |editor-first3=Ching-Hua |chapter-url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/distance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the formalism of neo-Riemannian theory treats voice leading in a somewhat oblique manner: "neo-Riemannian transformations," as defined above, are purely harmonic relationships that do not necessarily involve any particular mapping between the chords' notes.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;

== Graphical representations ==
[[File:Neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.svg|thumb|500px|Pitches in the Tonnetz are connected by lines if they are separated by minor third, major third, or perfect fifth. Interpreted as a torus the Tonnetz has 12 nodes (pitches) and 24 triangles (triads).]]

Neo-Riemannian transformations can be modeled with several interrelated geometric structures. The Riemannian [[Tonnetz]] ("tonal grid," shown on the right) is a planar array of pitches along three simplicial axes, corresponding to the three consonant intervals. Major and minor triads are represented by triangles which tile the plane of the Tonnetz. Edge-adjacent triads share two common pitches, and so the principal transformations are expressed as minimal motion of the Tonnetz. Unlike the historical theorist for which it is named, neo-Riemannian theory typically assumes enharmonic equivalence (G{{sharp}} = A{{flat}}), which wraps the planar graph into a [[torus]].

[[File:TonnetzTorus.gif|thumb|One toroidal view of the neo-Riemannian Tonnetz.]]

Alternate tonal geometries have been described in neo-Riemannian theory that isolate or expand upon certain features of the classical Tonnetz. [[Richard Cohn]] developed the Hyper [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] system to describe motion within and between separate major third cycles, all of which exhibit what he formulates as "maximal smoothness." (Cohn, 1996).&lt;ref name="Cohn Maximal Smooth"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Cohn |date=March 1996 |title=Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions |journal=[[Music Analysis (journal)|Music Analysis]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=9–40 |jstor=854168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another geometric figure, Cube Dance, was invented by Jack Douthett; it features the geometric dual of the Tonnetz, where triads are vertices instead of triangles (Douthett and Steinbach, 1998) and are interspersed with augmented triads, allowing smoother voice-leadings.

Many of the geometrical representations associated with neo-Riemannian theory are unified into a more general framework by the continuous voice-leading spaces explored by Clifton Callender, Ian Quinn, and Dmitri Tymoczko. This work originates in 2004, when Callender described a continuous space in which points represented three-note "chord types" (such as "major triad"), using the space to model "continuous transformations" in which voices slid continuously from one note to another.&lt;ref name="Callender MTO"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |date=2004 |title=Continuous Transformations |journal=Music Theory Online |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Tymoczko showed that paths in Callender's space were isomorphic to certain classes of voice leadings (the "individually T related" voice leadings discussed in Tymoczko 2008) and developed a family of spaces more closely analogous to those of neo-Riemannian theory. In Tymoczko's spaces, points represent particular chords of any size (such as "C major") rather than more general chord types (such as "major triad").&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Geometry"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tymoczko |first=Dmitri |author-link=Dmitri Tymoczko |date=2006 |title=The Geometry of Musical Chords |url=http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=313 |pages=72–74 |pmid=16825563 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307073427/http://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/voiceleading.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko together proposed a unified framework connecting these and many other geometrical spaces representing diverse range of music-theoretical properties.&lt;ref name="CQT"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Callender |first=Clifton |last2=Quinn |first2=Ian |last3=Tymoczko |first3=Dmitri |author-link3=Dmitri Tymoczko |title=Generalized Voice Leading Spaces |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=320 |pages=346–348|doi=10.1126/science.1153021|date=18 Apr 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Harmonic table note layout]] is a modern day realisation of this graphical representation to create a musical interface.

== Criticism ==

Neo-Riemannian theorists often analyze chord progressions as combinations of the three basic LPR transformations, the only ones that preserve two common tones. 
Thus the progression from C major to E major might be analyzed as L-then-P, which is a 2-unit motion since it involves two transformations. (This same transformation sends C minor to A{{flat}} minor, since L of C minor is A{{flat}} major, while P of A{{flat}} major is A{{flat}} minor.) These distances reflect voice-leading only imperfectly.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; For example, according to strains of neo-Riemannian theory that prioritize common-tone preservation, the C major triad is closer to F major than to F minor, since C major can be transformed into F major by R-then-L, while it takes three moves to get from C major to F minor (R-then-L-then-P). However, from a chromatic voice-leading perspective F minor is closer to C major than F major is, since it takes just two semitones of motion to transform F minor into C major (A{{flat}}-&gt;G and F-&gt;E) whereas it takes three semitones to transform F major into C major. Thus LPR transformations are unable to account for the voice-leading efficiency of the IV-iv-I progression, one of the basic routines of nineteenth-century harmony.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; Note that similar points can be made about common tones: on the Tonnetz, F minor and E{{flat}} minor are both three steps from C major, even though F minor and C major have one common tone, while E{{flat}} minor and C major have none.

Underlying these discrepancies are different ideas about whether harmonic proximity is maximized when two common tones are shared, or when the total voice-leading distance is minimized. For example, in the R transformation, a single voice moves by whole step; in the N or S transformation, two voices move by semitone. When common-tone maximization is prioritized, R is more efficient; when voice-leading efficiency is measured by summing the motions of the individual voices, the transformations are equivalently efficient. Early neo-Riemannian theory conflated these two conceptions. More recent work has disentangled them, and measures distance unilaterally by voice-leading proximity independently of common-tone preservation. Accordingly, the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations becomes problematized. As early as 1992, Jack Douthett created an exact geometric model of inter-triadic voice-leading by interpolating augmented triads between R-related triads, which he called "Cube Dance".&lt;ref name="Douthett"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Douthett |first=Jack |last2=Steinbach |first2=Peter |date=1998 |title=Parsimonious Graphs: A Study in Parsimony, Contextual Transformation, and Modes of Limited Transposition |url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/mod/resource/view.php?id=2314278 |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=241–263 |doi=10.2307/843877 |jstor=843877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Douthett's figure was published in 1998, its superiority as a model of voice leading was not fully appreciated until much later, in the wake of the geometrical work of Callender, Quinn, and Tymoczko; indeed, the first detailed comparison of "Cube Dance" to the neo-Riemannian "Tonnetz" appeared in 2009, more than fifteen years after Douthett's initial discovery of his figure.&lt;ref name="Tymoczko Distance" /&gt; In this line of research, the triadic transformations lose the foundational status that they held in the early phases of neo-Riemannian theory. The geometries to which voice-leading proximity give rise attain central status, and the transformations become heuristic labels for certain kinds of standard routines, rather than their defining property.

Nonetheless, among all possible sets of the twenty-four Riemannian triadic transformations, the length of combinations of members from the set of L, P, and R transformations better correlates with chromatic voice-leading distance than nearly every other set of transformations. For example, if only L and R transformations were used to measure transformational distance between triads, the number of contradictions between transformational distance and voice-leading distance like those examples above is much greater than when using L, P, and R. This partially restores some distinction between "primary" and "secondary" transformations.&lt;ref name="MurphyReview"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=S. |date=1 April 2014 |title=Audacious Euphony: Chromaticism and the Triad's Second Nature |journal=[[Journal of Music Theory]] |language=en |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=79–101 |doi=10.1215/00222909-2413598 |issn=0022-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

Beyond its application to triadic chord progressions, neo-Riemannian theory has inspired numerous subsequent investigations. These include

*Voice-leading proximity among chords with more than three tones- among species of [[hexachord]]s, such as the [[Mystic chord]] (Callender, 1998)&lt;ref name="Callender"&gt;Callender, Clifton, "Voice-Leading Parsimony in the Music of Alexander Scriabin", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 42/2 (1998), 219–233&lt;/ref&gt;

*Progressions among triads within diatonic rather than chromatic space.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

*Transformations among all possible triads, not necessarily strict mode-shifting [[Involution (mathematics)|involutions]] ([[Julian Hook|Hook]], 2002).&lt;ref name="Hook 1"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Uniform Triadic Transformations", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 46/1–2 (2002), 57–126&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transformations between chords of differing cardinality, called ''cross-type transformations'' (Hook, 2007).&lt;ref name="Hook 2"&gt;Hook, Julian, "Cross-Type Transformations and the Path Consistency Condition", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Applicability to [[popular music|pop music]].&lt;ref name="Capuzzo"&gt;Capuzzo, Guy, "Neo-Riemannian Theory and the Analysis of Pop-Rock Music", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' 26/2 2004), Pages 177–200&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these extensions share neo-Riemannian theory's concern with non-traditional relations among familiar tonal chords; others apply voice-leading proximity or harmonic transformation to characteristically atonal chords.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">The '''Neyer d-optimal test''' is a sensitivity test.  It can be used to answer questions such as "How far can a carton of eggs fall, on average, before one breaks?" If these egg cartons are very expensive, the person running the test would like to minimize the number of cartons dropped, to keep the experiment cheaper and to perform it faster. The Neyer test allows the experimenter to choose the experiment that gives the most information. In this case, given the history of egg cartons which have already been dropped, and whether those cartons broke or not, the Neyer test says "you will learn the most if you drop the next egg carton from a height of 32.123 meters."

== Applications ==

The Neyer test is useful in any situation when you wish to determine the average amount of a given stimulus needed in order to trigger a response.  Examples:

* Material Toughness - how far does this type of bottle filled with detergent need to fall before it breaks?
* Drug Efficacy -  how much of this drug is enough to cure this diseases?
* Toxicology - what percentage of contaminated seed is enough to cause a bird of this species to die?
* Sensory Threshold - how strong does the light have to be for this photodetector to sense it?
* Damage Threshold - how loud does the sound have to be in order to damage this microphone ?

== History ==

The Neyer-d optimal test was described by Barry T. Neyer in 1994. This method has replaced the earlier [[Bruceton analysis]] or "Up and Down Test" that was devised by Dixon and Mood in 1948 to allow computation with pencil and paper. Samples are tested at various stimulus levels, and the results (response or no response) noted. The Neyer Test guides the experimenter to pick test levels that provide the maximum amount of information. Unlike previous methods that have been developed, this method requires the use of a computer program to calculate the test levels.

Although not directly related to the test method, the [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio analysis]] method is often used to analyze the results of tests conducted with the Neyer D-Optimal test. The combined test and analysis methods are commonly known as the Neyer Test.

Dror and Steinberg (2008) suggest another [[experimental design]] method which is more efficient than Neyer's, by enabling the usage of a [[D-optimal design]] criterion from the outset of the experiment. Furthermore, their method is extended to deal with situations which are not handled by previous algorithms, including extension from fully sequential designs (updating the plan after each observation) to group-sequential designs (any partition of the experiment to blocks of numerous observations), from a binary response ("success" or "failure") to any generalized linear model, and from the univariate case to the treatment of multiple predictors (such as designing an experiment to test a response in a medical treatment where the experimenters changes doses of two different drugs).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">A '''night safari''' is a [[nocturnal]] visit to a [[zoo]] or wildlife-spotting natural area. The term was first used by the [[Night Safari, Singapore]], which opened in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nightsafari.com.sg/about/fastfacts.htm Night Safari - World's First in Singapore]&lt;/ref&gt;
While the term generally applies to zoos or facilities that allow visitors to view animals within enclosures or fenced areas, the term is expanding to include viewing of wildlife in national parks and other natural areas, such as in Laos.

&lt;!--Basic introduction; who he is--&gt;
'''Avram Noam Chomsky''' (born December 7, 1928) is an American [[linguist]], [[philosopher]], [[cognitive scientist]], [[historian]], [[Activism|political activist]], and [[Social criticism|social critic]]. Sometimes described as "the father of modern linguistics", Chomsky is also a major figure in [[analytic philosophy]] and one of the founders of the field of [[cognitive science]]. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and laureate professor at the [[University of Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MITLinguistics/posts/1547120331974705|title=MIT Linguistics|via=Facebook|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/worldrenowned-linguist-noam-chomsky-joins-ua-faculty|title=World-Renowned Linguist Noam Chomsky Joins UA Faculty|work=UANews|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as [[linguistics]], war, politics, and [[mass media]]. Ideologically, he aligns with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].

&lt;!--Early life up until 1966--&gt;
Born to middle-class [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants in [[Philadelphia]], Chomsky developed an early interest in [[anarchism]] from alternative bookstores in New York City. He began studying at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] at age 16, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955, he was appointed to [[Harvard University]]'s [[Society of Fellows]]. While at Harvard, he developed the theory of [[transformational grammar]]; for this, he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. Chomsky began teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', which remodelled the scientific study of language. From 1958 to 1959, he was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. Chomsky is credited as the creator or co-creator of the [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]] theory, the [[generative grammar]] theory, the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], and the [[minimalist program]]. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of [[behaviorism]], being particularly critical of the work of [[B. F. Skinner]].

&lt;!--Later life post-1967--&gt;
Chomsky [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|vocally opposed U.S. involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], believing the war to be an act of [[American imperialism]]. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]". Associated with the [[New Left]], he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on [[Nixon's Enemies List|Nixon's "Enemies List"]]. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the [[Linguistics Wars]]. In collaboration with [[Edward S. Herman]], Chomsky later co-wrote [[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|an analysis]], which articulated the [[propaganda model]] of media criticism, and worked to expose the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. Additionally, his defense of [[freedom of speech]]—including free speech for [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]]—generated significant controversy in the [[Faurisson affair]] of the early 1980s. Following his retirement from active teaching, Chomsky has continued his vocal political activism by opposing the [[War on Terror]] and supporting the [[Occupy Movement]].

&lt;!--Brief assessment of Chomsky's reception and legacy:--&gt;
One of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a [[paradigm shift]]er who helped spark a [[cognitive revolution|major revolution]] in the [[human sciences]], contributing to the development of a new [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivistic]] framework for the study of [[language]] and the [[mind]]. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading [[Criticism of American foreign policy|critic]] of [[U.S. foreign policy]], [[neoliberalism]] and contemporary [[state capitalism]], the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and mainstream [[news media]]. His ideas have proved highly significant within the [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] movements. Some of his critics have accused him of [[anti-Americanism]].

== Early life ==

===Childhood: 1928–45===
Avram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=9|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=3}} His father was [[William Chomsky|William "Zev" Chomsky]], an Ashkenazi Jew originally from [[Ukraine]] who had fled to the United States in 1913. Having studied at [[Johns Hopkins University]], William went on to become school principal of the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] religious school, and in 1924 was appointed to the faculty at [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia. Chomsky's mother was the Belarusian-born Elsie Simonofsky (1904–1972), a teacher and activist whom William had met while working at Mikveh Israel.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9–10|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=What motivated his [political] interests? A powerful curiosity, exposure to divergent opinions, and an unorthodox education have all been given as answers to this question. He was clearly struck by the obvious contradictions between his own readings and mainstream press reports. The measurement of the distance between the realities presented by these two sources, and the evaluation of why such a gap exists, remained a passion for Chomsky.|source=Biographer [[Robert F.

His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} The brothers were close, although David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=11–13}} Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of [[Zionism]]; the family was particularly influenced by the [[Left Zionism|Left Zionist]] writings of [[Ahad Ha'am]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=11–13|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}} As a Jew, Chomsky faced [[anti-semitism]] as a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=15}}

Chomsky described his parents as "normal [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]" who had a [[centre-left politics|center-left]] position on the political spectrum; however, he was exposed to [[far-left politics]] through other members of the family, a number of whom were [[socialism|socialists]] involved in the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=14|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=11, 14–15}} He was substantially influenced by his uncle who owned a newspaper stand in New York City, where Jewish leftists came to debate the issues of the day.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=23|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=12, 14–15, 67|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=4}} Whenever visiting his uncle, Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores in the city, voraciously reading political literature.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=23}} He later described his discovery of [[anarchism]] as "a lucky accident",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=17–19}} because it allowed him to become critical of other far-left ideologies, namely [[Stalinism]] and other forms of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=17–19|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=16, 18}}

Chomsky's primary education was at [[Oak Lane Day School|Oak Lane Country Day School]], an independent [[Deweyism|Deweyite]] institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non-competitive atmosphere.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=12|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} It was here, at the age of 10, that he wrote his first article, on the spread of [[fascism]], following the [[Catalonia Offensive|fall of Barcelona]] to [[Francisco Franco]]'s fascist army in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=13|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} At the age of 12, Chomsky moved on to secondary education at [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], where he joined various clubs and societies and excelled academically, but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching used there.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=21–22|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=14|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=4}} During the same time period, Chomsky attended the Hebrew High School at [[Gratz College]]. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17}}

In 1945, Chomsky, aged 16, embarked on a general program of study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning [[Arabic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=47|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=47}} However, he was frustrated with his experiences at the university, and considered dropping out and moving to a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=17}} His intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist [[Zellig Harris]], whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=48–51|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19, 31}} Chomsky's [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] honors thesis was titled "Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew", and involved his applying Harris's methods to the language.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=32}} Chomsky revised this thesis for his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], which he received at Penn in 1951; it would subsequently be published as a book.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=33}} He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of his teacher [[Nelson Goodman]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=33}}

From 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was named to the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]], where he undertook research on what would become his doctoral dissertation.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=79|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=20}} Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} a significant factor in his decision to move to Harvard was that the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, [[J. L. Austin]] of the [[University of Oxford]], would strongly influence Chomsky.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=33–34}} In 1952, Chomsky published his first [[academic article]], "Systems of Syntactic Analysis", which appeared not in a journal of linguistics, but in ''[[The Journal of Symbolic Logic]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} Being highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures given at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=81}} Although he had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, in 1955 he submitted a thesis to them setting out his ideas on [[transformational grammar]]; he was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] on the basis of it, and it would be privately distributed among specialists on [[microfilm]] before being published in 1975 as part of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=83–85|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=36|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3pp=4–5}} Possession of this Ph.D. nullified his requirement to enter [[national service]] in the armed forces, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=36}} [[George Armitage Miller]], a Professor at Harvard, read the Ph.D. and was impressed; together he and Chomsky published a number of technical papers in [[mathematical linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=38}}

{{double image|left|Rudolf Rocker.jpg|155|George Orwell press photo.jpg|152|The work of anarcho-syndicalist [[Rudolf Rocker]] (left) and democratic socialist [[George Orwell]] (right) significantly influenced the young Chomsky.}}

In 1947, Chomsky entered into a romantic relationship with [[Carol Chomsky|Carol Doris Schatz]], whom he had known since they were toddlers, and they married in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=13, 48, 51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19}} After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to an apartment in the [[Allston]] area of [[Boston]], remaining there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=20}} In 1953 the couple took up a Harvard travel grant in order to visit Europe, traveling from the [[United Kingdom]] through [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] and into [[Italy]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=20–21}} On that same trip they also spent six weeks in [[Israel]] at [[Hashomer Hatzair]]'s [[HaZore'a]] Kibbutz. Although enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab racism]] that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=20–21}}

On visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of Yiddish anarchist journal ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', becoming enamored with the ideas of contributor [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose work introduced him to the link between anarchism and [[classical liberalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=24|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=13}} Other political thinkers whose work Chomsky read included the anarchist [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], democratic socialists [[George Orwell]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], and works by Marxists [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Karl Korsch]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=24–25}} His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which were documented in Orwell's ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=26}} He avidly read leftist journal ''[[politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'', remarking that it "answered to and developed" his interest in anarchism,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=34–35}} as well as the periodical ''[[International Council Correspondence|Living Marxism]]'', published by [[council communism|council communist]] [[Paul Mattick]]. Although rejecting its Marxist basis, Chomsky was heavily influenced by council communism, voraciously reading articles in ''Living Marxism'' written by [[Antonie Pannekoek]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=36–40}} He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the [[Leninist League (US)|Leninist League]], an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their views that the [[Second World War]] was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's "[[state capitalism|state capitalists]]" to crush Europe's proletariat.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=43–44}}

===Early career: 1955–66===

Chomsky had befriended two linguists at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Morris Halle]] and [[Roman Jakobson]], the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955. There Chomsky spent half his time on a [[mechanical translation]] project, and the other half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=86–87|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=38–40}} Chomsky had been recruited to MIT by Jerome Wiesner, an influential scientist who, at this time, was also involved in getting the US's nuclear missile program established &lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight (2018). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''. Yale University Press., pp. x-xii, 16, 30, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Having brought such missile research to MIT, Wiesner then became a nuclear strategy adviser to both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, before returning to MIT to oversee research programmes at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 2018, pp. xi-xii; Snead, D. L. 1999. ''The Gaither Committee, Eisenhower, and the Cold War''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its military involvement, Chomsky has described MIT as "a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work."{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=87}} In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by [[Columbia University]] as a visiting professor.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=91}} That same year, Chomsky's first child, a daughter named Aviva, was born,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} and he published his first book on linguistics, ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'', a work that radically opposed the dominant [[Zellig Harris|Harris]]–[[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] trend in the field.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=88–91|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=40|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=5}} The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused "significant upheaval" in the discipline.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=88–91}} Linguist [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] later asserted that it "revolutionized the scientific study of language".{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=1}} From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=84}}

In 1959 he published a review of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' in the journal ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=6|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=96–99|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=41|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=5}} Opining that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics, his review helped him to become an "established intellectual",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=119}} and he proceeded to found MIT's Graduate Program in linguistics with Halle. In 1961 he was awarded [[academic tenure]], being made a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=101–102, 119|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=23}} He went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth [[International Congress of Linguists]], held in 1962 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which established him as the ''de facto'' spokesperson of American linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=102}} He continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (1966), ''Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar'' (1966), and ''[[Cartesian linguistics|Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought]]'' (1966).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=103}} Along with Halle, he also edited the ''Studies in Language'' series of books for [[Harper and Row]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=104}} and extended the theory of generative grammar to [[phonology]] in ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://libraries.mit.edu/chomsky/slideshow/#active=1&amp;slide=b4 |title=Slideshow {{!}} unBox the Chomsky Archive |publisher= MIT  |access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to receive academic recognition and honors for his work, in 1966 visiting a variety of Californian institutions, first as the [[Linguistics Society of America]] Professor at the [[University of California]], and then as the Beckman Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} His Beckman lectures would be assembled and published as ''Language and Mind'' in 1968.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=122}} In this period, military scientists were also interested in Chomsky's linguistics. As former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, said: "much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop … languages for computer operations in military command and control systems."&lt;ref&gt;A. Debons, 'Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact', in F. Alt and M. Rubinoff, ''Advances in Computers'', Vol.11, 1971. New York/London 1971, p354; A. Newell in G. Bugliarello (ed.), ''Bioengineering: An Engineering View'', San Francisco 1968, p271.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, between 1963 and 1965, Chomsky was a consultant for a military sponsored project "to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control." One of Chomsky's students who also worked on this project, [[Barbara Partee]], says that this research was justified to the military on the basis that "in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program."&lt;ref&gt;C. Knight, [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html 'When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky’s Linguistics for their Weapons Systems'], ''3 Quarks Daily'', 12 March 2018 (citing Arnold Zwicky, [https://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/grammars-of-number-theory.pdf ‘Grammars of Number Theory: Some Examples’], Working Paper W-6671, MITRE Corp., 1963, Foreword, last page).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these scientists eventually found Chomsky's theories unworkable for their computer systems. Other subsequent difficulties with the theories led to various debates between Chomsky and his critics that came to be known as the "[[Linguistics Wars]]", although they revolved largely around debating philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=60–61}}

==Later life==

===Anti-Vietnam War activism and rise to prominence: 1967–75===
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=[I]t does not require very far-reaching, specialized knowledge to perceive that the United States was invading South Vietnam. And, in fact, to take apart the system of illusions and deception which functions to prevent understanding of contemporary reality [is] not a task that requires extraordinary skill or understanding. It requires the kind of normal skepticism and willingness to apply one's analytical skills that almost all people have and that they can exercise.|source=Chomsky on the Vietnam War{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=114}}}}

Chomsky first involved himself in active political protest against U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=78}} However, it was not until 1967 that he publicly entered the debate on United States foreign policy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=120}} In February he published a widely read essay in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled "[[The Responsibility of Intellectuals]]", in which he criticized the country's involvement in the conflict; the essay was based on an earlier talk that he had given to Harvard's Foundation for Jewish Campus Life.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=122|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=83}} He expanded on his argument to produce his first political book, ''[[American Power and the New Mandarins]],'' which was published in 1969 and soon established him at the forefront of American dissent.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=122–123|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=83}} His other political books of the time included ''At War with Asia'' (1971), ''The Backroom Boys'' (1973), ''For Reasons of State'' (1973), and ''Peace in the Middle East?'' (1975), published by [[Pantheon Books]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xvi–xvii|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=163|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=87}} Coming to be associated with the American [[New Left]] movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=123}} he nevertheless thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Erich Fromm]], and preferred the company of activists to intellectuals.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=134–135}} Although ''The New York Review of Books'' did publish contributions from Chomsky and other leftists from 1967 to 1973, when an editorial change put a stop to it,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=162–163|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=87}} he was virtually ignored by the rest of the mainstream press throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=162–163}}

Along with his writings, Chomsky also became actively involved in left-wing activism. Refusing to pay half his taxes, he publicly supported students who refused [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]], and was arrested for being part of an anti-war teach-in outside [[the Pentagon]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129}} During this time, Chomsky, along with [[Mitchell Goodman]], [[Denise Levertov]], [[William Sloane Coffin]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], also founded the anti-war collective [[RESIST (non-profit)|RESIST]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=5|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=127–129|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3pp=80–81}} Although he questioned the objectives of the [[1968 student protests]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=121–122, 131}} Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups; furthermore, he and his colleague Louis Kampf began running undergraduate courses on politics at MIT, independently of the conservative-dominated [[political science]] department.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=121|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=78}}

During this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam and, as Chomsky says, "a good deal of [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus".&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael (2006). ''Remembering Tomorrow: From the politics of opposition to what we are for'', Seven Stories Press, pp. 97–99; C. P. Otero (1988). ''Noam Chomsky: Language and politics'', Black Rose, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; As Chomsky elaborates, "[MIT was] about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab&amp;nbsp;... the Research Laboratory for Electronics."&lt;ref&gt;White, G. D. (2000). ''Campus Inc.: Corporate power in the ivory tower''. Prometheus Books, pp. 445–446.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, student activists were actively campaigning "to stop the war research" at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shalom, [http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue23/shalom23.htm "Review of Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent, by Robert F. Barsky"], ''New Politics'', NS6(3), Issue 23. Retrieved October 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but he also thought it best to keep such research on campus and he proposed that it should be restricted to what he called "systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character".&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 121–122, 140-141; Albert 2006, p. 98; Knight 2016, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; MIT had six of its anti-war student activists sentenced to prison terms. Chomsky says MIT's students suffered things that "should not have happened." However, Chomsky has also claimed that MIT has "quite a good record on civil liberties".&lt;ref&gt;Albert 2006, pp. 107–108; Knight 2016, pp. 36–38, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 Chomsky visited the Vietnamese city of [[Hanoi]] to give a lecture at the [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]]; on this trip he also toured Laos to visit the refugee camps created by the war, and in 1973 he was among those leading a committee to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the [[War Resisters League]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=153|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=24–25, 84–85}}

[[File:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|President [[Richard Nixon]] placed Chomsky on his "Enemies List".]]

As a result of his anti-war activism, Chomsky was ultimately arrested on multiple occasions, and U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] included him on the [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents|master version]] of his [[Nixon's Enemies List|"Enemies List"]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=80}} He was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience, and his wife began studying for her own Ph.D. in linguistics in order to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or loss of employment.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=123–124|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=22}} However, MIT – despite being under some pressure to do so – refused to fire him due to his influential standing in the field of linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} His work in this area continued to gain international recognition; in 1967 he received honorary doctorates from both the [[University of London]] and the [[University of Chicago]][[Doctor of Humane Letters|.]]{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} In 1970, [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] and [[Swarthmore College]] also awarded him honorary D.H.L.'s, as did [[Bard College]] in 1971, [[Delhi University]] in 1972, and the [[University of Massachusetts]] in 1973.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1pp=xv–xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=143}}

In 1971 Chomsky gave the Bertrand Russell Memorial Lectures at the [[University of Cambridge]], which were published as ''Problems of Knowledge and Freedom'' later that year. He also delivered the [[Whidden Lectures]] at [[McMaster University]], the [[Huizinga Lecture]] at [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, the Woodbridge Lectures at [[Columbia University]], and the Kant Lectures at [[Stanford University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}} In 1971 he partook in a [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] on Dutch television, entitled ''Human Nature: Justice versus Power''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=52|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=222}} Although largely agreeing with Foucault's ideas, he was critical of [[post-modernism]] and French philosophy generally, believing that post-modern leftist philosophers used obfuscating language which did little to aid the cause of the working-classes{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=192–195|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=53}} and lambasting France as having "a highly parochial and remarkably illiterate culture".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=192–195}} Chomsky also continued to publish prolifically in linguistics, publishing ''Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar'' (1972),{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=143}} an enlarged edition of ''Language and Mind'' (1972),{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} and ''Reflections on Language'' (1975).{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=51}} In 1974 he became a corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=156}}

===Edward Herman and the Faurisson affair: 1976–80===
{{See also|Cambodian genocide denial#Chomsky and Herman|Faurisson affair}}
[[File:Noam Chomsky (1977).jpg|thumb|left|Noam Chomsky (1977)]]
Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=175}} His public talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized actions of the Israeli government and military,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=167, 170}} and his political views came under attack from right-wing and centrist figures, the most prominent of whom was [[Alan Dershowitz]]. Chomsky considered Dershowitz "a complete liar" and accused him of actively misrepresenting his position on issues.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=170–171}}  During the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with [[Edward S. Herman]], who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=157}} Together they authored ''[[Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact &amp; Propaganda]]'', a book which criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and highlighted how mainstream media neglected to cover stories about these activities; the publisher [[Warner Modular]] initially accepted it, and it was published in 1973. However, Warner Modular's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies to be destroyed.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160–162|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}}

While mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from [[Michael Albert]]'s [[South End Press]], an activist-oriented publishing company.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=85}}
In 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised ''Counter-Revolutionary Violence'' and published it with South End Press as the two-volume ''[[The Political Economy of Human Rights]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=187|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=86}} In this they compared U.S. media reactions to the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Cambodian genocide]] and the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on that in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=187}}&lt;ref&gt;This Chomsky-Herman thesis has been challenged by Sophal Ear, who "argues that concurrent [media] coverage of human rights violations in right-wing regimes in [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chile]] and [[South Korea]] exceeded the coverage given to Cambodia" during the genocide: See {{cite web |last=Sharp |first=Bruce |url=http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/chomsky.htm |title=Averaging Wrong Answers: Noam Chomsky and the Cambodia Controversy |website=Mekong.net |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a particular interest in the situation in East Timor, Chomsky testified on the subject in front of the [[United Nations]]' [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] in both 1978 and 1979, and attended a conference on the occupation held in [[Lisbon]] in 1979.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=103}} The following year, the Marxist academic, [[Steven Lukes]] authored an article for the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' accusing Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader [[Pol Pot]].&lt;ref&gt;https://libcom.org/files/lukes_chomsky_debate_1980_1981-2_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laura J. Summers and Robin Woodsworth Carlsen replied to the article, arguing that Lukes completely misunderstood Chomsky and Herman's work. The controversy damaged his reputation,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=187–189}} and Chomsky maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies about him in order to defame him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=190}}

Although Chomsky had long publicly criticized [[Nazism]] and [[totalitarianism]] more generally, his commitment to [[freedom of speech]] led him to defend the right of French historian [[Robert Faurisson]] to advocate a position widely characterized as [[Holocaust denial]]. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for the historian's freedom of speech was published as the preface to Faurisson's 1980 book ''Mémoire en défense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=179–180|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=185|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=61}} and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=184}} Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist [[Werner Cohn]] later published an analysis of the affair titled ''Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers''.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=78}} The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=185}} and Chomsky did not visit France, where the translation of his political writings was delayed until the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Jean |title=Chomsky à Paris: chronique d'un malentendu |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2010/06/03/chomsky-a-paris-chronique-d-un-malentendu_1367002_3260.html |work=Le Monde des Livres |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for almost thirty years following the debacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aeschimann |first=Eric |title=Chomsky s'est exposé, il est donc une cible désignée |url=http://www.liberation.fr/monde/0101638536-chomsky-s-est-expose-il-est-donc-une-cible-designee |work=Liberátion |date=31 May 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaganite era and work on the media: 1980–89===

The election of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] to the U.S. Presidency in 1980 marked a period of increased military intervention in [[Central America]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=90–91}} In 1985, during [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Nicaragua's Contra War]] – in which the U.S. supported the [[Contras|Contra militia]] against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government – Chomsky travelled to [[Managua]] to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=91, 92}} Many of these lectures would be published in 1987 as ''On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=91}} In 1983 he published ''[[The Fateful Triangle]]'', an examination of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] and the place of the U.S. within it, arguing that the U.S. had continually used the conflict for its own ends.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=99|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=13}} In 1988, Chomsky then visited the [[Palestinian territories]] to witness the impact of Israeli military occupation.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=98}}

In 1988, Chomsky and Herman published ''[[Manufacturing Consent|Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', in which they outlined their [[propaganda model]] for understanding the mainstream media; there they argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news provided was censored through four filters which had a great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=160, 202|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=127–134}} The book was adapted into a 1992 film, ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', which was directed by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Peter Wintonick]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=136}} In 1989, Chomsky published ''[[Necessary Illusions|Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies]],'' in which he critiqued what he sees as the pseudo-democratic nature of Western capitalist states.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=138–139}}

By the 1980s, a number of Chomsky's students had become leading linguistic specialists in their own right, expanding, revising, and expanding on Chomsky's ideas of generative grammar.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=53}} By the end of the 1980s, Chomsky had established himself as a globally recognized figure.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=59}}

===Increased political activism: 1990–present===

In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=214}} Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the [[East Timorese Relief Association]] and the [[National Council for East Timorese Resistance]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as ''Powers and Prospects'' in 1996.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=104}} As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist [[John Pilger]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=107}} After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led [[International Force for East Timor]] arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the [[Timor Gap Treaty]]. {{Sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=109–110}} Chomsky's book ''Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order'' was a [[Boston Globe]] and Voice Literary Supplement bestseller in 1999.

[[File:Noam Chomsky WSF - 2003.jpg|thumb|left|Chomsky at the [[World Social Forum]] ([[Porto Alegre]]) in 2003]]

Chomsky retired from full-time teaching,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}} although as an [[Emeritus]] he nevertheless continued to conduct research and seminars at MIT.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}}

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed, with these interviews being collated and published by [[Seven Stories Press]] in October.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=110–111}}
Chomsky argued that the ensuing [[War on Terror]] was not a new development, but rather a continuation of the same U.S. foreign policy and its concomitant rhetoric that had been pursued since at least the Reagan era of the 1980s.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=143}} In 2003 he published ''[[Hegemony or Survival]]'', in which he articulated what he called the United States' "imperial grand strategy" and critiqued the [[Iraq War]] and other aspects of the 'War on Terror.'{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=114–118}}

Chomsky toured the world with increasing regularity during this period, giving talks on various subjects.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2001 he gave the [[D.T. Lakdawala]] Memorial Lecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/2001/11/04/stories/0204000j.htm U.S., Britain ignored 'culture of terrorism': Chomsky], ''[[The Hindu]]'' November 4, 2001. Retrieved 21 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Delhi]], India, and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the [[Latin American Association of Social Scientists]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=120}} In 2002 Chomsky visited Turkey in order to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a [[co-defendant]] and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the prosecution on the first day.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} During that trip, Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favour of the Kurds' [[human rights]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=25}} A supporter of the [[World Social Forum]], he attended their conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=112–113, 120}}

His wife, Carol, died in December 2008.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}}

[[File:Noam Chomsky Toronto 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Chomsky speaking in support of the [[Occupy movement]] in 2011]]

Chomsky was drawn to the energy and activism of the [[Occupy movement]], delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence, first [[Occupy (Chomsky book)|''Occupy'']] a pamphlet, in 2012, then, in 2013, ''Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity''. Both were published by [[Zuccotti Park Press]]. His analysis included a critique that attributed Occupy's growth as a response to a perceived abandonment of the interests of the white working class by the Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jul/06/noam-chomsky-occupy-movement-spark-video |title=Noam Chomsky: 'The Occupy movement just lit a spark' – video |last=Younge |first=Gary |date=July 6, 2012 |last2=Hogue |first2=Kat Keene |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |last3=theguardian.com|access-date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Chomsky joined the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]] advisory council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noam Chomsky Joins NAPF Advisory Council |url=https://www.wagingpeace.org/noam-chomsky-joins-napf-advisory-council/ |website=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a senior fellow there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Joe |title=Tickets on sale for Tucson talk on nuclear war with Noam Chomsky, Daniel Ellsberg |url=https://tucson.com/news/local/tickets-on-sale-for-tucson-talk-on-nuclear-war-with/article_66bf8396-1b21-5af5-9843-79bcbf551fd0.html |website=Arizona Daily Star |accessdate=27 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Chomsky announced his support for [[Vermont]] U.S. senator [[Bernie Sanders]] in the upcoming [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |title=Inside the mind of Bernie Sanders: unbowed, unchanged, and unafraid of a good fight |work=The Guardian |date=June 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117082624/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |dead-url=no |first=Paul |last=Lewis |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Chomsky was publicly rebuked by President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] of Turkey after he signed an [[open letter]] condemning the Turkish leader for his [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)#2015 PKK rebellion|anti-Kurdish repression]] and for holding double standards on terrorism.&lt;ref name="erdogan"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Chomsky hits back at Erdoğan, accusing him of double standards on terrorism |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/14/chomsky-hits-back-erdogan-double-standards-terrorism-bomb-istanbul |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 14, 2016|access-date =January 14, 2016 |issn= |language= |first=Matthew |last=Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky accused Erdoğan of [[hypocrisy]] and added that the Turkish president supports [[al-Qaeda]]'s Syrian affiliate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-crisis-turkey-and-saudi-arabia-shock-western-countries-by-supporting-antiassad-jihadists-10242747.html |title=Turkey and Saudi Arabia alarm the West by backing Islamist extremists the Americans had bombed in Syria |author=Sengupta, Kim |newspaper=The Independent |date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name="erdogan" /&gt; Chomsky also criticized the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and U.S. involvement in [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], highlighting that Saudi has "one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/5/17/chomsky_saudi_arabia_is_the_center |title=Chomsky: Saudi Arabia is the "Center of Radical Islamic Extremism" Now Spreading Among Sunni Muslims |date=May 17, 2016 |newspaper=[[Democracy Now!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the documentary ''[[Requiem for the American Dream]]'' was released, summarizing his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a "75-minute teach-in".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/movies/review-noam-chomsky-focuses-on-financial-inequality.html |title=Review: Noam Chomsky Focuses on Financial Inequality in 'Requiem for the American Dream' |last=Gold |first=Daniel M. |date=January 28, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Requiem for the American Dream'' was published as a book in 2017, and is a furthering of the ideas put forward in the 2016 documentary ([[Seven Stories Press]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sevenstories.com/books/3993-requiem-for-the-american-dream |title=Books &amp;#124; Seven Stories Press |publisher=Sevenstories.com |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Chomsky called [[Donald Trump]] an "ignorant, thin-skinned megalomaniac" and a "greater evil" than Hillary Clinton. Asked about claims that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election through hacking, Chomsky said: "It's possible, but it's a kind of strange complaint in the United States. The U.S. has been [[Foreign electoral intervention|interfering]] with, and undermining, elections all over the world for decades and is proud of it."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://pr.aljazeera.com/post/153594128485/noam-chomsky-speaks-with-upfront-slams-media Noam Chomsky speaks with ‘Upfront’ – slams media coverage, criticises third party voters]".

In August 2017, at age 88 and retired since 2002, Chomsky left [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to join the linguistics department of [[University of Arizona]] in Tucson as part-time faculty,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/28/chomsky-joins-university-arizona-faculty/JYdA9TjGk6OeBwa7Q8fPjJ/story.html Noam Chomsky leaves MIT to join University of Arizona faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weidenfeld |first1=Lisa |title=Noam Chomsky Is Leaving MIT |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/08/29/noam-chomsky-mit-arizona/ |website=Boston Magazine |accessdate=27 July 2018 |date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially starting a few weeks later, and teaching in spring 2018.&lt;ref name="Univ.

In July 2018, Chomsky said in an interview with ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' that "it's hard to think of a more brutal and sadistic policy" about the [[Trump administration family separation policy]].&lt;ref name="url Brutal and Sadistic: Noam Chomsky on Family Separation &amp; the U.S. Roots of Today's Refugee Crisis | Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/27/brutal_and_sadistic_noam_chomsky_on |title="Brutal and Sadistic": Noam Chomsky on Family Separation &amp; the U.S. Roots of Today's Refugee Crisis &amp;#124; Democracy Now! |format= |website= |accessdate=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview Chomsky also said that [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]]'s victory of the 2018 New York primary election "was a quite spectacular and significant event".&lt;ref name="url Noam Chomsky on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Spectacular Victory &amp; Growing Split in Democratic Party | Democracy Now!"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/27/noam_chomsky_on_alexandria_ocasio_cortezs |title=Noam Chomsky on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's "Spectacular" Victory &amp; Growing Split in Democratic Party &amp;#124; Democracy Now! |format= |website= |accessdate=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis to Chomsky's linguistic theory is rooted in [[biolinguistics]], holding that the principles underlying the structure of language are biologically determined in the human mind and hence genetically transmitted.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=4|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=2–3}} He therefore argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=7}} In adopting this position, Chomsky rejects the [[radical behaviorism|radical behaviorist]] psychology of B.&amp;nbsp;F.

===Universal grammar===
{{Main|Universal grammar}}

Since the 1960s, Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting that there is an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: "[[poverty of the stimulus]]" argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones which have never before been uttered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/noam-chomskys-theory-universal-grammar-right-its-hardwired-our-brains-364236 |title=Noam Chomsky's Theory Of Universal Grammar Is Right; It's Hardwired Into Our Brains |date=2015-12-07 |work=Medical Daily|access-date=2017-08-04 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute "universal grammar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chomsky, Noam |url=https://chomsky.info/architecture01/ |title=The 'Chomskyan Era' (excerpted from The Architecture of Language) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thornbury |first1=Scott |title=An A–Z of ELT (Methodology) |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Education |location=Oxford |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/mit-claims-to-have-found-a-language-universal-that-ties-all-languages-together/ |title=MIT claims to have found a "language universal" that ties all languages together |newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformational generative grammar===
{{Main|Transformational generative grammar}}

Beginning with his ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' (1957), a distillation of his ''Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (1955), Chomsky challenges [[structural linguistics]] and introduces [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Transformacijsko-generativni pristup jeziku u ''Sintaktičkim strukturama'' i ''Aspektima teorije sintakse'' Noama Chomskog |trans-title=Transformational-generative approach to language in ''Syntactic structures'' and ''Aspects of the theory of syntax'' of Noam Chomsky |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=SOL: Lingvistički časopis |volume=6 |issue=12–13 |pages=103–112 |year=1991 |issn=0352-8715 |id={{ZDB|1080348-8}} |archivedate=September 2, 2012 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNlKB4s?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |accessdate=May 15, 2015}} [http://opak.crolib.hr/cgi-bin/unicat.cgi?form=D1941130086 (CROLIB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures. [[Surface structure]] 'faces out' and is represented by spoken utterances, while [[deep structure]] 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. Transformational grammar is a [[generative grammar]] (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in mathematical notation, which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The transformational grammar thus relates meaning and sound.&lt;ref name="MTCW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Noam Chomsky |url=https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016015800/https://chomsky.info/2004____/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |via=chomsky.info |accessdate=December 18, 2017 |first=Zoltán Gendler |last=Szabó |publisher=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers, 1860–1960|editor-first = Ernest|editor-last = LePore |year=2004 |location=Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chomsky hierarchy===
{{Main|Chomsky hierarchy}}

The Chomsky hierarchy, sometimes referred to as the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy, is a containment hierarchy of classes of [[formal grammars]]. The hierarchy imposes a logical structure across different language classes and provides a basis for understanding the relationship between grammars (devices that enumerate the valid sentences within languages). In order of increasing expressive power it includes [[regular grammar|regular (or Type-3) grammars]], [[context-free grammar|context-free (or Type-2) grammars]], [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive (or Type-1) grammars]], and [[formal grammar|recursively enumerable (or Type-0) grammars]]. Each class is a strict subset of the class above it, i.e., each successive class can generate a broader set of [[formal languages]] (infinite sets of strings composed from finite sets of symbols, or alphabets) than the one below.&lt;ref name=":522"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.wmich.edu/~bhardin/cs4850/ChomskyPresentation.pdf |title=The Chomsky Hierarchy |publisher=cs.wmich.edu |accessdate=February 29, 2016 |author=Robert Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being important in linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy is also relevant in [[theoretical computer science]], especially in [[programming language theory]],&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{cite book |title=Selected Papers on Computer Languages |date=2002 |publisher=Center for the Study of Language and Information |isbn=978-1-57586-381-8 |chapter=Preface |last1=Knuth |first1=Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[compiler]] construction, and [[automata theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Computability, complexity, and languages: fundamentals of theoretical computer science |last2=Weyuker |first2=Elaine J. |last3=Sigal |first3=Ron |publisher=Academic Press, Harcourt, Brace |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-12-206382-4 |edition=2nd |location=Boston |page=327| author-link2 = Elaine Weyuker |last1=Davis |first1=Martin| author-link1 = Martin Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist program===
{{Main|Minimalist program}}
Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's research has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or '[[Logical form (linguistics)|logical forms]]'.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt; When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior research has focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to ''create'' these rules.&lt;ref name="McGill"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Changed Noam Chomsky Simplifies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/arts/a-changed-noam-chomsky-simplifies.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 5, 1998|access-date =February 22, 2016 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Margalit |last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed through elite [[corporatocracy|corporate interests]], who use corporate media, advertising, and [[think tanks]] to promote their own [[propaganda]].

He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British imperialism have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading [[Christianity]]; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} Prominent examples that he regularly cites are the actions of the [[British Empire]] in India and Africa, and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}}

Chomsky explains his decision to focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14, 160}} His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway the population of the U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=18}}

He has been critical of U.S. involvement in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel–Palestine conflict]], arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the [[Levant]] that is home to both Jews and Arabs.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=170|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=76–77|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=159}} However, acknowledging the [[realpolitik]] of the situation, Chomsky has also considered a [[two-state solution]] on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=97|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=159}} As a result of [[Political positions of Noam Chomsky#Chomsky and the Middle East|his criticisms of Israel]], Chomsky was barred from entering Israel in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/israel-noam-chomsky-palestinian-west-bank |title=Noam Chomsky barred by Israelis from lecturing in Palestinian West Bank |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=May 16, 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/middleeast/18chomsky.html |title=Israel Roiled After Chomsky Barred From West Bank |last=Bronner |first=Ethan |date=May 17, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2010/05/201051904343834346.html |title=Israel: Chomsky ban 'big mistake' |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/17/denied_entry_israel_blocks_noam_chomsky |title=Denied Entry: Israel Blocks Noam Chomsky from Entering West Bank to Deliver Speech |publisher=Democracy Now!|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html |title=Noam Chomsky Denied Entry To Israel |date=January 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114172540/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/noam-chomsky-denied-entry_0_n_578285.html|archive-date=January 14, 2016|access-date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capitalism and socialism===
[[File:Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor and Emeritus Professor of Linguistics, MIT (14112575810).jpg|thumb|Chomsky speaking at [[Chatham House]], London, May 2014]]
In his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of [[capitalism]] and the [[selfishness|selfish]] pursuit of material advancement.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=15}} At the same time, he developed a disdain for the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] attempts to establish a socialist society, as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=168|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Rather than accepting the common view among American economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy on the one hand and total private ownership on the other, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy on the one hand and total autocratic control (whether state or private) on the other.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=164–165}} He argues that Western capitalist nations are not really democratic,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=169}} because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=170}} He has stated his opposition to [[Ruling class|ruling elites]], among them institutions like the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[GATT]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=211}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Socialism will be achieved only insofar as all social institutions—in particular, the central industrial, commercial, and financial institutions of a modern society—are placed under democratic control in a federal industrial republic of the sort that Russell and others envisioned, with actively functioning workers' councils and other self-governing units in which each citizen, in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s words, will be "a direct participator in the government of affairs."|source=Noam Chomsky{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=210}} }}

Chomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods financial control]] agreements.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He characterizes the U.S. as a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], viewing both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as manifestations of a single "Business Party" controlled by corporate and financial interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14–15}} Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Noting that this economic system is firmly entrenched and difficult to overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of the upheaval.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}

Chomsky deems libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas to be the inheritors of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=189}} arguing that his ideological position revolves around "nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=95}}
He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future in which there is direct worker control of the [[means of production]], with society governed by [[workers' council]]s, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=199}} In this, he believes that there will be no need for [[political parties]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=200}} By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction, a sense of fulfillment, and purpose to their work.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=197, 202}} He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=201–202}}

=== News media and propaganda ===
{{Main|Propaganda model}}
Chomsky's political writings have largely been focused on the two concepts of [[ideology]] and [[power (social and political)|power]], or the media and state policy.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=20}} One of Chomsky's best-known works, ''Manufacturing Consent'', dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, from government-guided "free market" forces, is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=37–38}} As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=179}} Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=178}} He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=189}} As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=177}} He also points to examples of important news stories that have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Fred Hampton]] with possible [[FBI]] involvement, the massacres perpetrated in [[Nicaragua]] by the U.S.-funded [[Contras]], and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=179–182}}
To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=184}}

Chomsky considers most [[conspiracy theories]] to be fruitless, distracting substitutes to thinking about  [[policy|policy formation]] in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=70}} He does not dismiss [[conspiracy theories]] outright, but he does consider them unproductive to challenging [[power (social and political)|power]] in a substantial way.
In response to the labeling of his own thoughts as "conspiracy theory", Chomsky has replied that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether [[General Motors]] would be accused of conspiracy if they deliberately selected what they would use or discard to sell their product.{{sfn|Rai|1995|p=42}}

==Philosophy==
{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=Chomsky's intellectual life had been divided between his work in linguistics and his political activism, philosophy coming as a distant third. Nonetheless, his influence among analytic philosophers has been enormous&amp;nbsp;... he has persistently defended his views against all takers, engaging in important debates with many of the major figures in analytic philosophy throughout his career.|source=Zoltán Gendler Szabó, 2004&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;}}

Chomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[philosophy of language]], and the [[philosophy of science]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=19}} In these fields he has been highly critical of many other philosophers, in particular those operating within the field of [[cognitive science]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=19}}

==Personal life==
Chomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another,{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=158|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=19}} calling himself "scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=121}} An intensely private person,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=7}} he is uninterested in appearances and the fame that his work has brought him.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=116}} McGilvray suggested that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but that he was impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=230}} He also has little interest in modern art and music.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=206–207}} He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the U.S., he subscribes to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', and ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=121}} He acknowledges that his income and the financial security that it accords him means that he lives a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=9}} He characterizes himself as a "[[Workforce|worker]]", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=6}}

Despite having been raised Jewish, Chomsky is currently [[Irreligious|non-religious]], although he has expressed approval of forms of religion such as [[liberation theology]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=69}} He is known for his "dry, laconic wit",{{attribution needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} and for the use of [[irony]] in his writings,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=162}} and has attracted controversy for labeling established political and academic figures with terms such as "corrupt", "fascist", and "fraudulent".{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=199}} Chomsky's colleague [[Steven Pinker]] has said that he "portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions that he generates from his critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/20/society.politics |title=The Guardian Profile: Noam Chomsky |last=Jaggi |first=Maya |authorlink=Maya Jaggi |date=January 20, 2001 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky avoids attending [[academic conferences]], including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=169}}

==Reception and influence==

{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=[Chomsky's] voice is heard in academia beyond linguistics and philosophy: from computer science to neuroscience, from anthropology to education, mathematics and literary criticism. If we include Chomsky's political activism then the boundaries become quite blurred, and it comes as no surprise that Chomsky is increasingly seen as enemy number one by those who inhabit that wide sphere of reactionary discourse and action.|source=Sperlich, 2006{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=60}}}}
Chomsky's legacy is as both a "leader in the field" of linguistics and "a figure of enlightenment and inspiration" for [[political dissent]]ers.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=191}} Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in him being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being "on the outer margin of acceptability."{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=24}}

===In academia===

Linguist John Lyons remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become "the most dynamic and influential" school of thought in the field.{{sfn|Lyons|1978|p=2}} By the 1970s, his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=42}} while a poll conducted by [[Minnesota State University Moorhead|Minnesota State University]] found ''Syntactic Structures'' to be the single most important work in the field of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Cognitive Science Millennium Project |url=http://web.mnstate.edu/schwartz/cogsci100.htm |publisher=web.mnstate.edu |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his work in [[automata theory]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and the Chomsky hierarchy has become well known in [[computer science]], and he is much cited within the field of [[computational linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Michael Sipser |author=Sipser, Michael |year=1997 |title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation |publisher=PWS Publishing |isbn=978-0-534-94728-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Knuth: Selected Papers on Computer Languages |url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cl.html |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's work contributed substantially to the decline of [[behaviorist psychology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/ |title=Behaviorism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher= |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, some arguments in [[evolutionary psychology]] are derived from his research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lecture 6: Evolutionary Psychology, Problem Solving, and 'Machiavellian' Intelligence |publisher=Massey University |website=School of Psychology |year=1996 |url=http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |accessdate=September 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117055247/http://evolution.massey.ac.nz/lecture6/lect600.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nim Chimpsky]], a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in [[animal language acquisition]] at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Radick |title=The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Nobel Prize laureate in Medicine and Physiology, [[Niels Kaj Jerne]], used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system, equating "components of a generative grammar&amp;nbsp;... with various features of protein structures". The title of Jerne's Stockholm Nobel Lecture was "The Generative Grammar of the Immune System".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1984/jerne-lecture.pdf |title=The Generative Grammar of the Immune System |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=19 August 2013 |author=Niels K.

An MIT press release found that Chomsky was cited within the [[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]] more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chomsky is Citation Champ |publisher=[[MIT]] News Office |date=April 15, 1992 |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1992/citation-0415.html |accessdate=September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their respect for his intellectual contribution, a number of linguists and philosophers have been very critical of Chomsky's approach to language. These critics include Christina Behme, Cedric Boeckx, [[Margaret Boden]], Rudolph Botha, [[Vyvyan Evans]], [[Nicholas Evans (linguist)|Nicholas Evans]], [[Daniel Everett]], [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele Goldberg]], Anna Kinsella, [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]], [[Stephen Levinson]], Bruce Nevin, [[Geoffrey K.

Chomsky's approach to academic freedom has led him to give support to MIT academics whose actions he deplores. In 1969, when Chomsky heard that [[Walt Rostow]], a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened "to protest publicly" if Rostow was "denied a position at MIT". Then, in 1989, when Pentagon adviser [[John Deutch]] wanted to be the President of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, ''The New York Times'' quoted Chomsky as saying, "He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met.... If somebody's got to be running the C.I.A., I'm glad it's him."&lt;ref&gt;Barsky 1997, pp. 140–141; Noam Chomsky (1996). ''Class Warfare: Interviews with David Barsamian''.

However, Sperlich notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=10}} University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=153–154}} Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many [[social science|social scientists]] claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so or not.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics "do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text".{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}

In Spring 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/noam-chomsky-teach-politics-course-spring |title=Noam Chomsky to Teach Politics Course In Spring |date= |publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|de|Otto-Suhr-Institut für Politikwissenschaft}}''' (''Otto Suhr Institute for Political Science'', OSI) a [[research institute]] of the [[Free University of Berlin]] and one of the leading [[political science|political-science]] institutions in [[Germany]]. It is named after [[Otto Suhr]], a former [[mayor of Berlin]] (1894–1957, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]).

== History ==
The OSI arose in 1959 from the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] (''German Academy for Politics'') founded in 1920. During the [[German student movement]] in the late 1960s, the Otto-Suhr-Institut was reckoned a 'leftist' and later an 'alternative' [[think tank]], as it employed radical thinkers such as [[Johannes Agnoli]]. However, in present days this reputation is rather legendary than lifelike.

== Current activity ==
The OSI is part of the Department for Political and Social Sciences. It continues to be one of the leading institutions in the field of political science in Germany, focussing on the study of [[International Relations]]. Since 2001, [[Thomas Risse]] heads the institute's Center for Transnational Relations, Foreign and Security Policy which was founded in 1986 as the Center for Transatlantic Foreign and Security Policy [[Helga Haftendorn]].

== International programmes ==
The institute offers an integrated German-French double-degree Bachelor as well as a double-degree Master programme with French [[Grande Ecole]] [[Sciences Po Paris]] (formerly also known as Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris) as well as a German-Russian joint Master’s programme in co-operation with the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]]. It has also successfully developed a Double Degree in Public Policy and Management with the European top-ranking business school, [[HEC Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/v/frankreich/HEC_FUB/index.html |title=Otto-Suhr-Institute of Political Science: German-French program with HEC Paris |publisher=Polsoz.fu-berlin.de |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German-French double degree programmes are recognised and coordinated by the [[Franco-German University]].

== What ''type'' of thing is social science? ==

Social science can be described as all of the following:
* Branch of [[science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-511229-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |title=science |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science |accessdate=2011-10-16 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]], Inc |quote='''3 a:''' knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method '''b:''' such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned with the physical world and its phenomena }}&lt;!--{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=3}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[List of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines#Social sciences|Major category]] of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

== Branches of social science ==

* [[Anthropology]] - study of humans, past and present, that draws and builds upon knowledge from the social sciences and biological sciences, as well as the humanities and the natural sciences.
** [[Anthropology of religion]] – study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures
** [[Applied anthropology]] – application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems.
** [[Archaeology]] – study of cultures via material remains and environmental data ([[Outline of archaeology]])
** [[Cultural anthropology]] – branch of anthropology focused on the study of cultural variation among humans, collecting data about the effect of global economic and political processes on local cultural realities.
** [[Ethnobiology]] – scientific study of dynamic relationships between peoples, biota, and environments, from the distant past to the immediate present.
** [[Ethnobotany]] – is the study of a region's plants and their practical uses through the traditional knowledge of a local culture and people.

** [[Evolutionary anthropology]] – interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominids and non-hominid primates.
** [[Experimental archaeology]] – Experimental archaeology employs a number of different methods, techniques, analyses, and approaches in order to generate and test hypotheses, based upon archaeological source material, like ancient structures or artifacts.
** [[Historical archaeology]] – form of archaeology dealing with topics that are already attested in written records.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">The '''Petersen matrix''' is a comprehensive description of systems of [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] used to model [[chemical reactor|reactors]] for [[Biodegradability prediction|pollution control]] (engineered [[decomposition]]) as well as in [[environmental systems]]. It has got as many columns as the number of relevant involved components ([[chemicals]], [[pollutants]], [[biomass]]es, [[gases]]) and as many rows as the number of involved [[Chemical process|processes]] (biochemical reactions and physical degradation). One further column is added to host the description of the [[kinetics (chemistry)|kinetics]] of each transformation ([[rate equation]]).&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=David L.|title=Practical wastewater treatment|year=2006|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-78044-1|pages=288|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471780448.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fang&gt;{{cite book|last=Fang|first=editor, Herbert H.P.|title=Environmental anaerobic technology : applications and new developments|year=2010|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=London|isbn=9781848165427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matrix structure ==
The mass conservation principle for each process is expressed in the rows of the matrix. If all components are included (none omitted) then the mass conservation principle states that, for each process:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all process } i:\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}\dot{\rho_j} = 0 \;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the density rate of each component. This can also be seen as the process [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric relation]].

Moreover, the rate of variation of each component for all processes simultaneous effect can be easily assessed by summing the columns:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all component } j: \frac{\partial C_j}{\partial t} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij} r_i \; ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; are the reaction rates of each process.

== Example ==
A system of a third [[Order of reaction|order reaction]] followed by a [[Michaelis-Menten]] enzyme reaction.

:&lt;chem&gt;
{A} + 2B -&gt; S
&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;
{E} + S &lt;=&gt;[k_f][k_r] ES -&gt;[k_\mathrm{cat}] {E} + P
&lt;/chem&gt;

where the reagents A and B combine forming the substrate S (S = AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which with the help of enzyme E is transformed into the product P.
Production rates for each substance is:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d [\ce A]}{d t} &amp;= -k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce B]}{d t} &amp;= -2 k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce S]}{d t} &amp;= k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2 - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce E]}{d t} &amp;= - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}] + k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\\
\frac{d [\ce ES]}{d t} &amp;= k_f[\ce E][\ce S] - k_r[\ce{ES}] - k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce P]}{d t} &amp;= k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Petersen matrix reads as
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{Diagonal split header|Process | Components&lt;br/&gt;(kmol/m³)}} !! A !! B !! S !! E !! ES !! P !! Reaction rate  
|-
| P1: 2nd order formation of S from A and B || -1 || -2 || +1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P2: Formation of ES from E and S|| 0 || 0 || -1 || -1 || +1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_f[\ce E][\ce S]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P3: Back decomposition of ES into E and S|| 0 || 0 || +1 || +1 || -1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_r[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P4: Forward decomposition of ES into E and P || 0 || 0 || 0 || +1 || -1 || +1 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The Petersen matrix can be used to write the system's rate equation

:&lt;math chem&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix} 
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce A] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce B] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce S] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce E] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce{ES}] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce P]
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
    -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
    +1 &amp; -1 &amp; +1 &amp; 0  \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1  \\
    0 &amp; +1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1  \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; +1  \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix} 
     k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2 \\
     k_f[\ce E][\ce S] \\
     k_r[\ce{ES}] \\
     k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}] \\
  \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computing]], the '''producer–consumer problem'''&lt;ref name="ostep1"&gt;{{citation|title=Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces [Chapter: Condition Variables]|url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-cv.pdf|

publisher=Arpaci-Dusseau Books|date=2014|first1=Remzi H.|last1=Arpaci-Dusseau|first2=Andrea C.|last2=Arpaci-Dusseau}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the '''bounded-buffer problem''') is a classic example of a multi-[[Process (computing)|process]] [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, who share a common, fixed-size [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]] used as a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]]. The producer's job is to generate data, put it into the buffer, and start again. At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e., removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time. The problem is to make sure that the producer won't try to add data into the buffer if it's full and that the consumer won't try to remove data from an empty buffer.

The solution for the producer is to either go to sleep or discard data if the buffer is full. The next time the consumer removes an item from the buffer, it notifies the producer, who starts to fill the buffer again. In the same way, the consumer can go to sleep if it finds the buffer empty. The next time the producer puts data into the buffer, it wakes up the sleeping consumer. The solution can be reached by means of [[inter-process communication]], typically using [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]]. An inadequate solution could result in a [[deadlock]] where both processes are waiting to be awakened. The problem can also be generalized to have multiple producers and consumers.

== Inadequate implementation ==
To solve the problem, some programmer might come up with a solution shown below. In the solution two library routines are used, &lt;code&gt;sleep&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wakeup&lt;/code&gt;. When sleep is called, the caller is blocked until another process wakes it up by using the wakeup routine. The global variable &lt;code&gt;itemCount&lt;/code&gt; holds the number of items in the buffer.
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int itemCount = 0;

procedure producer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {
        item = produceItem();

        if (itemCount == BUFFER_SIZE) 
        {
            sleep();
        }

        putItemIntoBuffer(item);
        itemCount = itemCount + 1;

        if (itemCount == 1) 
        {
            wakeup(consumer);
        }
    }
}

procedure consumer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {

        if (itemCount == 0) 
        {
            sleep();
        }

        item = removeItemFromBuffer();
        itemCount = itemCount - 1;

        if (itemCount == BUFFER_SIZE - 1) 
        {
            wakeup(producer);
        }

        consumeItem(item);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The problem with this solution is that it contains a [[race condition]] that can lead to a [[deadlock]]. Consider the following scenario:
# The &lt;code&gt;consumer&lt;/code&gt; has just read the variable &lt;code&gt;itemCount&lt;/code&gt;, noticed it's zero and is just about to move inside the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block.
# Just before calling sleep, the consumer is interrupted and the producer is resumed.
# The producer creates an item, puts it into the buffer, and increases &lt;code&gt;itemCount&lt;/code&gt;.
# Because the buffer was empty prior to the last addition, the producer tries to wake up the consumer.
# Unfortunately the consumer wasn't yet sleeping, and the wakeup call is lost. When the consumer resumes, it goes to sleep and will never be awakened again. This is because the consumer is only awakened by the producer when &lt;code&gt;itemCount&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 1.
# The producer will loop until the buffer is full, after which it will also go to sleep.
Since both processes will sleep forever, we have run into a deadlock. This solution therefore is unsatisfactory.

An alternative analysis is that if the programming language does not define the semantics of concurrent accesses to shared variables (in this case &lt;code&gt;itemCount&lt;/code&gt;) with use of synchronization, then the solution is unsatisfactory for that reason, without needing to explicitly demonstrate a race condition.

==Using semaphores==
[[Semaphore (programming)|Semaphores]] solve the problem of lost wakeup calls. In the solution below we use two semaphores, &lt;code&gt;fillCount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;emptyCount&lt;/code&gt;, to solve the problem. &lt;code&gt;fillCount&lt;/code&gt; is the number of items already in the buffer and available to be read, while &lt;code&gt;emptyCount&lt;/code&gt; is the number of available spaces in the buffer where items could be written. &lt;code&gt;fillCount&lt;/code&gt; is incremented and &lt;code&gt;emptyCount&lt;/code&gt; decremented when a new item is put into the buffer. If the producer tries to decrement &lt;code&gt;emptyCount&lt;/code&gt; when its value is zero, the producer is put to sleep. The next time an item is consumed, &lt;code&gt;emptyCount&lt;/code&gt; is incremented and the producer wakes up. The consumer works analogously.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
semaphore fillCount = 0; // items produced
semaphore emptyCount = BUFFER_SIZE; // remaining space

procedure producer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {
        item = produceItem();
        down(emptyCount);
        putItemIntoBuffer(item);
        up(fillCount);
    }
}

procedure consumer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {
        down(fillCount);
        item = removeItemFromBuffer();
        up(emptyCount);
        consumeItem(item);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The solution above works fine when there is only one producer and consumer. With multiple producers sharing the same memory space for the item buffer, or multiple consumers sharing the same memory space, this solution contains a serious race condition that could result in two or more processes reading or writing into the same slot at the same time. To understand how this is possible, imagine how the procedure &lt;code&gt;putItemIntoBuffer()&lt;/code&gt; can be implemented. It could contain two actions, one determining the next available slot and the other writing into it. If the procedure can be executed concurrently by multiple producers, then the following scenario is possible:
# Two producers decrement &lt;code&gt;emptyCount&lt;/code&gt;
# One of the producers determines the next empty slot in the buffer
# Second producer determines the next empty slot and gets the same result as the first producer
# Both producers write into the same slot

To overcome this problem, we need a way to make sure that only one producer is executing &lt;code&gt;putItemIntoBuffer()&lt;/code&gt; at a time. In other words, we need a way to execute a [[critical section]] with [[mutual exclusion]]. The solution for multiple producers and consumers is shown below.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
mutex buffer_mutex; // similar to "semaphore buffer_mutex = 1", but different (see notes below)
semaphore fillCount = 0;
semaphore emptyCount = BUFFER_SIZE;

procedure producer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {
        item = produceItem();
        down(emptyCount);
        down(buffer_mutex);
        putItemIntoBuffer(item);
        up(buffer_mutex);
        up(fillCount);
    }
}

procedure consumer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {
        down(fillCount);
        down(buffer_mutex);
        item = removeItemFromBuffer();
        up(buffer_mutex);
        up(emptyCount);
        consumeItem(item);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the order in which different semaphores are incremented or decremented is essential: changing the order might result in a deadlock. 
It is important to note here that though mutex seems to work as a semaphore with value of 1 (binary semaphore), but there is difference in the fact that mutex has ownership concept. Ownership means that mutex can only be "incremented" back (set to 1) by the same process that "decremented" it (set to 0), and all other tasks wait until mutex is available for decrement (effectively meaning that resource is available), which ensures mutual exclusivity and avoids deadlock. Thus using mutexes improperly can stall many processes when exclusive access is not required, but mutex is used instead of semaphore.

==Using monitors==
The following [[pseudo code]] shows a solution to the producer–consumer problem using [[monitor (synchronization)|monitors]]. Since mutual exclusion is implicit with monitors, no extra effort is necessary to protect the critical section. In other words, the solution shown below works with any number of producers and consumers without any modifications. It is also noteworthy that using monitors makes race conditions much less likely than when using semaphores.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}{{Clarify|post-text=(see Talk page)|date=January 2013}}

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
monitor ProducerConsumer 
{
    int itemCount = 0;
    condition full;
    condition empty;

    procedure add(item) 
    {
        if (itemCount == BUFFER_SIZE) 
        {
            wait(full);
        }

        putItemIntoBuffer(item);
        itemCount = itemCount + 1;

        if (itemCount == 1) 
        {
            notify(empty);
        }
    }

    procedure remove() 
    {
        if (itemCount == 0) 
        {
            wait(empty);
        }

        item = removeItemFromBuffer();
        itemCount = itemCount - 1;

        if (itemCount == BUFFER_SIZE - 1) 
        {
            notify(full);
        }


        return item;
    }
}

procedure producer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {
        item = produceItem();
        ProducerConsumer.add(item);
    }
}

procedure consumer() 
{
    while (true) 
    {
        item = ProducerConsumer.remove();
        consumeItem(item);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Without semaphores or monitors==
The producer–consumer problem, particularly in the case of a single producer and single consumer, strongly relates to implementing a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] or a [[channel (programming)|channel]]. The producer–consumer pattern can provide highly efficient data communication without relying on semaphores, mutexes, or monitors ''for data transfer''. Use of those primitives can give performance issues as they are expensive to implement. Channels and FIFOs are popular just because they avoid the need for end-to-end atomic synchronization. A basic example coded in C is shown below. Note that:

* Atomic [[read-modify-write]] access to shared variables is avoided, as each of the two &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt; variables is updated only by a single thread. Also, these variables stay incremented all the time; the relation remains correct when their values wrap around on an integer overflow.
* This example does not put threads to sleep, which may be acceptable depending on the system context. The &lt;code&gt;schedulerYield()&lt;/code&gt; is there just to behave nicely and could be removed. Thread libraries typically require semaphores or condition variables to control the sleep/wakeup of threads. In a multi-processor environment, thread sleep/wakeup would occur much less frequently than passing of data tokens, so avoiding atomic operations on data passing is beneficial.
* This example does not work for multiple producers and/or consumers because there is a race condition when checking the state.  For example, if only one token is in the storage buffer and two consumers find the buffer non-empty, then both will consume the same token and possibly increase the count of consumed tokens over produced counter.
* This example, as written, requires that &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX + 1&lt;/code&gt; is evenly divisible by &lt;code&gt;BUFFER_SIZE&lt;/code&gt;; if it is not evenly divisible, &lt;code&gt;[Count % BUFFER_SIZE]&lt;/code&gt; produces the wrong buffer index after &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt; wraps past &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX&lt;/code&gt; back to zero.  An alternate solution without this restriction would employ two additional &lt;code&gt;Idx&lt;/code&gt; variables to track the current buffer index for the head (producer) and tail (consumer).  These &lt;code&gt;Idx&lt;/code&gt; variables would be used in place of &lt;code&gt;[Count % BUFFER_SIZE]&lt;/code&gt;, and each of them would have to be incremented at the same time as the respective &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt; variable is incremented, as follows: &lt;code&gt;Idx = (Idx + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
volatile unsigned int produceCount = 0, consumeCount = 0;
TokenType sharedBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

void producer(void) {
	while (1) {
		while (produceCount - consumeCount == BUFFER_SIZE) {
			schedulerYield(); /* sharedBuffer is full */
		}
		/* Write to sharedBuffer _before_ incrementing produceCount */
		sharedBuffer[produceCount % BUFFER_SIZE] = produceToken();
		++produceCount;
	}
}

void consumer(void) {
	while (1) {
		while (produceCount - consumeCount == 0) {
			schedulerYield(); /* sharedBuffer is empty */
		}
		consumeToken(&amp;sharedBuffer[consumeCount % BUFFER_SIZE]);
		++consumeCount;
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[computer science]], a [[formal language]] is called '''recursively enumerable''' (also '''recognizable''', '''partially decidable''', '''semidecidable''', '''Turing-acceptable''' or '''Turing-recognizable''') if it is a [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable subset]] in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible words over the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of the language, i.e., if there exists a [[Turing machine]] which will enumerate all valid strings of the language.

Recursively enumerable languages are known as '''type-0''' languages in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of formal languages. All [[regular language|regular]], [[context-free grammar|context-free]], [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]] and [[recursive language|recursive]] languages are recursively enumerable.

The class of all recursively enumerable languages is called '''[[RE (complexity)|RE]]'''.

==Definitions==
There are three equivalent definitions of a recursively enumerable language:

# A recursively enumerable language is a [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]] [[subset]] in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible words over the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of the [[formal language|language]].
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a [[Turing machine]] (or other [[computable function]]) which will enumerate all valid strings of the language. Note that if the language is [[Infinity|infinite]], the enumerating algorithm provided can be chosen so that it avoids repetitions, since we can test whether the string produced for number ''n'' is "already" produced for a number which is less than ''n''. If it already is produced, use the output for input ''n+1'' instead (recursively), but again, test whether it is "new".
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a Turing machine (or other computable function) that will halt and accept when presented with any [[literal string|string]] in the language as input but may either halt and reject or loop forever when presented with a string not in the language. Contrast this to [[recursive language]]s, which require that the Turing machine halts in all cases.

All [[regular language|regular]], [[context-free language|context-free]], [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]] and [[recursive language|recursive]] languages are recursively enumerable.

[[Post's theorem]] shows that '''[[RE (complexity)|RE]]''', together with its [[complement (complexity)|complement]] [[co-RE]], correspond to the first level of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

==Example==
The set of [[Halting Problem|halting turing machines]] is recursively enumerable but not recursive. Indeed one can run the Turing Machine and accept if the machine halts, hence it is recursively enumerable. On the other hand the problem is undecidable. 

Some other recursively enumerable languages that are not recursive include:

* [[Post correspondence problem]] 
* [[Mortality (computability theory)]]
* [[Entscheidungsproblem]]

==Closure properties==
Recursively enumerable languages (REL) are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are two recursively enumerable languages, then the following languages are recursively enumerable as well:

* the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''
* the [[Concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \circ P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''
* the [[Union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] &lt;math&gt;L \cap P&lt;/math&gt;.

Recursively enumerable languages are not closed under [[set difference]] or complementation. The set difference ''L&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;P'' may or may not be recursively enumerable.  If ''L'' is recursively enumerable, then the complement of ''L'' is recursively enumerable if and only if ''L'' is also recursive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21215">'''Robust optimization''' is a field of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] theory that deals with optimization problems in which a certain measure of robustness is sought against [[uncertainty]] that can be represented as deterministic variability in the value of the parameters of the problem itself and/or its solution.

== History ==
The origins of robust optimization date back to the establishment of modern [[decision theory]] in the 1950s and the use of '''worst case analysis''' and [[Wald's maximin model]]  as a tool for the treatment of severe uncertainty.  It became a discipline of its own in the 1970s with parallel developments in several scientific and technological fields. Over the years, it has been applied in [[statistics]],  but also in [[operations research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertsimas|first=Dimitris|author2=Sim, Melvyn |title=The Price of Robustness|journal=Operations Research|year=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=35–53|doi=10.1287/opre.1030.0065}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[electrical engineering]],&lt;ref name="VPP Robust 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = The design of a risk-hedging tool for virtual power plants via robust optimization approach | journal= Applied Energy | date = October 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.059 | author = Shabanzadeh M | volume = 155 | pages = 766–777 | last2 = Sheikh-El-Eslami | first2 = M-K |last3 = Haghifam | first3 = P|last4 = M-R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RO2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Generation Maintenance Scheduling via robust optimization | journal=  23rd Iranian Conference in Electrical Engineering (ICEE) | date = July 2015 | doi = 10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146458 | author = Shabanzadeh M | last2 = Fattahi | first2 = M }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[control theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khargonekar|first=P.P.|author2=Petersen, I.R. |author3=Zhou, K. |title=Robust stabilization of uncertain linear systems: quadratic stabilizability and H/sup infinity / control theory|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|volume=35|issue=3|pages=356–361|doi=10.1109/9.50357|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[finance]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p6UHHfkQ9Y8C&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=AqlJfX5Z0X&amp;dq=economics%20robust%20optimization&amp;lr&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false%20 Robust portfolio optimization]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Investment management|portfolio management]]&lt;ref&gt;Md.

In [[engineering]] problems, these formulations often take the name of "Robust Design Optimization", RDO or "Reliability Based Design Optimization", RBDO.

== Example 1==

Consider the following [[linear programming]] problem

:&lt;math&gt; \max_{x,y} \ \{3x + 2y\} \ \ \mathrm { subject \ to }\ \  x,y\ge 0; cx + dy \le 10, \forall (c,d)\in P &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a given subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

What makes this a 'robust optimization' problem is the &lt;math&gt;\forall (c,d)\in P&lt;/math&gt; clause in the constraints. Its implication is that for a pair &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; to be admissible, the constraint &lt;math&gt;cx + dy \le 10&lt;/math&gt; must be satisfied by the '''worst'''  &lt;math&gt;(c,d)\in P&lt;/math&gt; pertaining to &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, namely the pair &lt;math&gt;(c,d)\in P&lt;/math&gt; that maximizes the value of &lt;math&gt;3x + 2y&lt;/math&gt; for the given value of &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

If the parameter space &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is finite (consisting of finitely many elements), then this robust optimization problem itself is a [[linear programming]] problem: for each &lt;math&gt;(c,d)\in P&lt;/math&gt; there is a linear constraint &lt;math&gt;cx + dy \le 10&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is not a finite set, then this problem is a linear [[semi-infinite programming]] problem, namely a linear programming problem with finitely many (2) decision variables and infinitely many constraints.

== Classification ==
There are a number of classification criteria for robust optimization problems/models. In particular, one can distinguish between problems dealing with '''local''' and '''global''' models of robustness; and between '''probabilistic''' and '''non-probabilistic''' models of robustness. Modern robust optimization deals primarily with non-probabilistic models of robustness that are [[worst case]] oriented and as such usually deploy [[Wald's maximin model]]s.

=== Local robustness ===

There are cases where robustness is sought against small perturbations in a nominal value of a parameter. A very popular model of local robustness is the [[stability radius|radius of stability]] model:

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\rho}(x,\hat{u}):= \max_{\rho\ge 0}\ \{\rho: u\in S(x), \forall u\in B(\rho,\hat{u})\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the nominal value of the parameter, &lt;math&gt;B(\rho,\hat{u})&lt;/math&gt; denotes a ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy given stability/performance conditions associated with decision &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

In words, the robustness (radius of stability) of decision &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the largest ball centered at &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}&lt;/math&gt; all of whose elements satisfy the stability requirements imposed on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The picture is this:

[[Image:Local robustness.png|500px]]

where the rectangle &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of all the values &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; associated with decision &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Global robustness ===

Consider the simple abstract robust optimization problem

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in X}\ \{f(x): g(x,u)\le b, \forall u\in U\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of all ''possible'' values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; under consideration.

This is a ''global'' robust optimization problem in the sense that the robustness constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b, \forall u\in U&lt;/math&gt; represents all the ''possible'' values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;.

The difficulty is that such a "global" constraint can be too demanding in that there is no &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies this constraint. But even if such an &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; exists, the constraint can be too "conservative" in that it yields a solution &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; that generates a very small payoff &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; that is not representative of the performance of other decisions in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, there could be an &lt;math&gt;x'\in X&lt;/math&gt; that only slightly violates the robustness constraint but yields a very large payoff &lt;math&gt;f(x')&lt;/math&gt;. In such cases it might be  necessary to relax a bit the robustness constraint and/or modify the statement of the problem.

==== Example 2====
Consider the case where the objective is to satisfy a constraint  &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b,&lt;/math&gt;. where &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; denotes the decision variable and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter whose set of possible values in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. If there is no &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b,\forall u\in U&lt;/math&gt;, then the following intuitive measure of robustness suggests itself:

: &lt;math&gt;\rho(x):= \max_{Y\subseteq U} \ \{size(Y): g(x,u)\le b, \forall u\in Y\} \ , \ x\in X&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;size(Y)&lt;/math&gt; denotes an appropriate measure of the "size" of set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set, then &lt;math&gt;size(Y)&lt;/math&gt; could be defined as the [[cardinality]] of set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

In words, the robustness of decision is the size of the largest subset of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for which the constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied for each &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in this set. An optimal decision is then a decision whose robustness is the largest.

This yields the following robust optimization problem:

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in X, Y\subseteq U} \ \{size(Y): g(x,u) \le b, \forall u\in Y\}&lt;/math&gt;

This intuitive notion of global robustness is not used often in practice because the robust optimization problems that it induces are usually (not always) very difficult to solve.

====Example 3====
Consider the robust optimization problem
:&lt;math&gt;z(U):= \max_{x\in X}\ \{f(x): g(x,u)\le b, \forall u\in U\}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued function on &lt;math&gt;X\times U&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that there is no feasible solution to this problem because the robustness constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b, \forall u\in U&lt;/math&gt; is too demanding.

To overcome this difficulty, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; be a relatively small subset of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; representing "normal" values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and consider the following robust optimization problem: 
:&lt;math&gt;z(\mathcal{N}):= \max_{x\in X}\ \{f(x): g(x,u)\le b, \forall u\in \mathcal{N}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, its optimal solution may not perform well on a large portion of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and therefore may not be robust against the variability of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

One way to fix this difficulty  is to relax the constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b&lt;/math&gt; for values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; outside the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; in a controlled manner so that larger violations are allowed as the distance of  &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; increases. For instance, consider the relaxed robustness constraint
: &lt;math&gt;g(x,u) \le b + \beta \cdot dist(u,\mathcal{N}) \ , \ \forall u\in U&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; is a control parameter and &lt;math&gt;dist(u,\mathcal{N})&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, for &lt;math&gt;\beta =0&lt;/math&gt; the relaxed robustness constraint reduces back to the original robustness constraint.
This yields the following (relaxed) robust optimization problem:

:&lt;math&gt;z(\mathcal{N},U):= \max_{x\in X}\ \{f(x): g(x,u)\le b + \beta \cdot dist(u,\mathcal{N}) \ , \  \forall u\in U\}&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;dist&lt;/math&gt; is defined in such a manner that  
:&lt;math&gt;dist(u,\mathcal{N})\ge 0,\forall u\in U&lt;/math&gt;

and 
 
: &lt;math&gt;dist(u,\mathcal{N})= 0,\forall u\in \mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore the optimal solution to the relaxed problem satisfies the original constraint &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b&lt;/math&gt; for all values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, it also satisfies the relaxed constraint
: &lt;math&gt;g(x,u)\le b + \beta \cdot dist(u,\mathcal{N})&lt;/math&gt;

outside &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Non-probabilistic robust optimization models===

The dominating paradigm in this area of robust optimization is [[Wald's maximin model]], namely

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in X}\min_{u\in U(x)} f(x,u)&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt; represents the decision maker,  the &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt; represents Nature, namely [[uncertainty]], &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; represents the decision space and &lt;math&gt;U(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of possible values of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; associated with decision &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the ''classic'' format of the generic model, and is often referred to as ''minimax'' or ''maximin'' optimization problem. The non-probabilistic ('''deterministic''') model has been and is being extensively used for robust optimization especially in the field of signal processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Verdu | first1 = S. | last2 = Poor | first2 = H.

The equivalent [[mathematical programming]] (MP) of the classic format above is

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in X,v\in \mathbb{R}} \ \{v: v\le f(x,u), \forall u\in U(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;

Constraints can be incorporated explicitly in these models. The generic constrained classic format is

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in X}\min_{u\in U(x)} \ \{f(x,u): g(x,u)\le b,\forall u\in U(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalent constrained MP format is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{x\in X,v\in \mathbb{R}} \ \{v: v\le f(x,u), g(x,u)\le b, \forall u\in U(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Probabilistically robust optimization models===
These models quantify the uncertainty in the "true" value of the parameter of interest by probability distribution functions. They have been traditionally classified as [[stochastic programming]] and [[stochastic optimization]] models. Recently, probabilistically robust optimization has gained popularity by the introduction of rigorous theories such as [[scenario optimization]] able to quantify the robustness level of solutions obtained by randomization. These methods are also relevant to data-driven optimization methods. 

===Robust counterpart===
The solution method to many robust program involves creating a deterministic equivalent, called the robust counterpart. The practical difficulty of a robust program depends on if its robust counterpart is  computationally tractable.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Tal A., El Ghaoui, L. and  Nemirovski, A. (2009). Robust Optimization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10175">Many types of '''sense loss''' occur due to a dysfunctional sensation process, whether it be ineffective [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], [[nerve damage]], or cerebral impairment. Unlike [[agnosia]], these impairments are due to damages prior to the [[perception]] process.

==Vision loss==
{{Main|Vision loss}}

Degrees of vision loss vary dramatically, although the [[ICD-9]] released in 1979 categorized them into three tiers: [[normal vision]], [[low vision]], and [[blindness]].  Two significant causes of vision loss due to sensory failures include media opacity and [[optic nerve]] diseases, although [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[retinal disease]] can also lead to blindness.  Most causes of vision loss can cause varying degrees of damage, from total blindness to a negligible effect. Media opacity occurs in the presence of [[opacity (optics)|opacities]] in the eye tissues or fluid, distorting and/or blocking the [[image]] prior to contact with the [[photoreceptor cells]].  Vision loss often results despite correctly functioning retinal receptors. Optic nerve diseases such as [[optic neuritis]] or [[retrobulbar neuritis]] lead to dysfunction in the afferent nerve pathway once the signal has been correctly transmitted from retinal photoreceptors.

Partial or total vision loss may affect every single area of a person's life. Though loss of eyesight may occur naturally as we age, trauma to the eye or exposure to hazardous conditions may also cause this serious condition. Workers in virtually any field may be at risk of sustaining eye injuries through trauma or exposure. A traumatic eye injury occurs when the eye itself sustains some form of trauma, whether a [[penetrating injury]] such as a laceration or a non-penetrating injury such as an impact. Because the eye is a delicate and complex organ, even a slight injury may have a temporary or permanent effect on eyesight.

==Hearing loss==
{{Main|Hearing loss}}
Similarly to vision loss, [[hearing loss]] can vary from full or partial inability to detect some or all [[frequency|frequencies]] of sound which can typically be heard by members of their [[species]].  For [[humans]], this range is approximately 20 [[hertz|Hz]] to 20&amp;nbsp;kHz at ~6.5 [[decibel|dB]], although a 10&amp;nbsp;dB correction is often allowed for the [[elderly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Phonological features, auditory objects, and illusions | url = | journal = Journal of Phonetics | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 60–89 | doi = 10.1016/j.wocn.2009.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary causes of hearing loss due to an impaired sensory system include long-term exposure to [[environmental noise]], which can damage the [[mechanoreceptors]] responsible for receiving [[sound|sound vibrations]], as well as multiple diseases, such as [[HIV]] or [[meningitis]], which damage the [[cochlea]] and [[auditory nerve]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bizley | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Walker | first2 = K. M. M. | year = 2010 | title = Sensitivity and Selectivity of Neurons in Auditory Cortex to the Pitch, Timbre, and Location of Sounds | url = | journal = Neuroscientist | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 453–469 | doi = 10.1177/1073858410371009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss may be gradual or sudden. Hearing loss may be very mild, resulting in minor difficulties with conversation, or as severe as complete deafness. The speed with which hearing loss occurs may give clues as to the cause. If hearing loss is sudden, it may be from [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or a problem with [[blood circulation]]. A gradual onset is suggestive of other causes such as [[aging]] or a [[tumor]]. If you also have other associated neurological problems, such as [[tinnitus]] or [[vertigo]], it may indicate a problem with the nerves in the ear or brain. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral hearing loss is most often associated with conductive causes, trauma, and acoustic neuromas. Pain in the ear is associated with ear infections, trauma, and obstruction in the canal.

==Anosmia==
{{Main|Anosmia}}
Anosmia  is the inability to perceive [[odor]], or in other words a lack of functioning [[olfaction]]. Many patients may experience unilateral or bilateral anosmia.

A temporary loss of smell can be caused by a blocked nose or infection. In contrast, a permanent loss of smell may be caused by death of olfactory receptor neurons in the nose or by brain injury in which there is damage to the olfactory nerve or damage to brain areas that process smell. The lack of the sense of smell at birth, usually due to genetic factors, is referred to as congenital anosmia.

The diagnosis of anosmia as well as the degree of impairment can now be tested much more efficiently and effectively than ever before thanks to "smell testing kits" that have been made available as well as screening tests which use materials that most clinics would readily have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig JC |title=Grating orientation as a measure of tactile spatial acuity |journal=[[Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=197–206 |year=1999 |pmid=10527368 |doi= 10.1080/08990229970456|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cases of congenital anosmia remain unreported and undiagnosed. Since the disorder is present from birth the individual may have little or no understanding of the sense of smell, hence are unaware of the deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08990220310001622997 |title=Decline of tactile acuity in aging: a study of body site, blood flow, and lifetime habits of smoking and physical activity, Somatosensory &amp; Motor Research, Informa Healthcare |format= |work= |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somatosensory loss==
The [[somatosensory system]] is a complex sensory system made up of a number of different receptors, including thermoreceptors, nociceptors, mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. It also comprises essential processing centres, or sensory modalities, such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception. The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia, skeletal muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.

While touch (also called tactile or tactual perception) is considered one of the five traditional senses, the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term "touch" is usually replaced with "somatic senses" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved.

Insensitivity to [[somatosensory]] stimuli, such as [[heat]], [[cold]], [[touch]], and [[pain]], are most commonly a result of a more general physical impairment associated with [[paralysis]]. Damage to the [[spinal cord]] or other major [[nerve fiber]] may lead to a termination of both [[afferent nerve|afferent]] and [[efferent nerve|efferent]] signals to varying areas of the body, causing both a loss of touch and a loss of [[motor coordination]]. Other types of somatosensory loss include [[hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy]], which consists of ineffective afferent neurons with fully functioning efferent neurons; essentially, motor movement without somatosensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = X. | year = 1976 | title = Acute Central Cord Syndrome Injury Mechanisms and Stress Features | doi = 10.1097/brs.0b013e3181c94cb8 | journal = Spine | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = E955–E964 | pmid=20543769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory loss can occur due to a minor nick or lesion on the spinal cord which creates a problem within the neurosystem. This can lead to loss of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing. In most cases it often leads to issues with touch. Sometimes people cannot feel touch at all while other times a light finger tap feels like someone has punched them. There are medications and therapies{{such as?}} that can help control the symptoms of sensory loss and deprivation.

==Ageusia==
{{main|Ageusia}}

Ageusia is the loss of taste, particularly the inability to detect [[sweetness]], [[sourness]], [[Bitterness (taste)|bitterness]], [[saltiness]], and [[umami]] (meaning "pleasant/savory taste"). It is sometimes confused with anosmia (a loss of the sense of smell). Because the tongue can only indicate texture and differentiate between sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami, most of what is perceived as the sense of taste is actually derived from smell. True ageusia is relatively rare compared to hypogeusia (a partial loss of taste) and dysgeusia (a distortion or alteration of taste).

Tissue damage to the nerves that support the tongue can cause ageusia, especially damage to the [[lingual nerve]] and the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]]. The lingual nerve passes taste for the front two-thirds of the tongue and the glossopharyngeal nerve passes taste for the back third of the tongue. The lingual nerve can also be damaged during otologic surgery, causing a feeling of metal taste.

Taste loss can vary from true [[ageusia]], a complete loss of taste, to [[hypogeusia]], a partial loss of taste, to [[dysgeusia]], a distortion or alteration of taste.  The primary cause of ageusia involves damage to the [[lingual nerve]], which receives the stimuli from [[taste buds]] for the front two-thirds of the [[tongue]], or the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], which acts similarly for the back third. Damage may be due to neurological disorders, such as [[Bell’s palsy]] or [[multiple sclerosis]], as well as [[infectious diseases]] such as meningoencephalopathy.  Other causes include a [[vitamin B]] deficiency, as well as taste bud death due to acidic/spicy foods, [[radiation]], and/or [[tobacco]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macaluso | first1 = E. | year = 2010 | title = Orienting of spatial attention and the interplay between the senses.

'''''The Biology of the Cell Surface''''' is a book by American biologist [[Ernest Everett Just]]. It was published by P. Blakiston’s Son &amp; Co in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6379|accessdate=15 March 2012|title=The biology of the cell surface, by Ernest Everett Just|publisher=Biodiversity Heritage Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just began writing the book in 1934 in Naples and finished it in France, shortly before being sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. He considered the book to be his "crowning achievement". The book examined the role of the cell surface in embryology, development and evolution, and presented a critique of [[gene theory]], particularly the views of [[Jacques Loeb]]. Sapp suggests that "Just’s theorizing on the cell cortex [in this work] was unsurpassed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapp|first=J|title="Just" in time: gene theory and the biology of the cell surface.|journal=Molecular reproduction and development|date=Oct 2009|volume=76|issue=10|pages=903–11|pmid=19396869|doi=10.1002/mrd.21044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TGEN.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Translational Genomics Research Institute at night.]]

'''The Translational Genomics Research Institute''' ('''TGen'''), is a [[non-profit]] [[genomics]] [[research institute]] based in Arizona, United States. TGen seeks to employ [[genetics|genetic]] discoveries to improve disease outcomes by developing smarter [[diagnostics]] and [[targeted therapy|targeted therapeutics]].

== History and activities ==
TGen was established in 2002 by [[Jeffrey Trent]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States.  The Institute began with a {{US$|100 million}} investment from Arizona public- and private-sector investors.&lt;ref name="Alltucker20080416"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2008/04/16/20080416biz-tgenfund0416.html|title=5-year-old TGen fights for funding|last=Alltucker|first=Ken|date=16 April 2008|work=The Arizona Republic|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117111231/http://www.azcentral.com/business/articles/2008/04/16/20080416biz-tgenfund0416.html?nclick_check=1|archive-date=17 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TGen conducts research on a number of human disorders including [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Autism]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Diabetes]] and numerous forms of [[cancer]] and a variety of other complex human diseases.  This internationally recognized institute has helped to generate a strong foundation for Arizona's growing role in scientific research and cutting edge [[biotechnology]].

The emerging field of [[Translational medicine|translational genomics research]] harnesses the power of new discoveries resulting from the [[Human Genome Project]] and applying them to the development of improved diagnostics, [[prognostics]] and therapies for cancer, [[neurological]] disorders, diabetes and other complex [[disease]]s.

The '''Treaty of Tolentino''' was a peace treaty between [[Revolutionary France]] and the [[Papal States]], signed on 19 February 1797 and imposing terms of surrender on the Papal side. The signatories for France were the [[French Directory]]'s Ambassador to the Holy See, François Cacault, and the rising General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and opposite them four representatives of [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]]'s [[Curia]]. 
 
It was part of the events following the invasion of [[Italy]] in the early stages of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Having defeated the Austrians at the [[Siege of Mantua (1796–1797)|Battle of Mantua]], at the Arcola Bridge and in the [[Battle of Rivoli]], Napoleon had no more enemies in northern Italy and was able to devote himself to the Papal States. Following nine months of negotiations between France and the Papal States, in February 1797 9,000 French soldiers invaded the Papal [[Romagna]] Region, leaving the Pope no choice but to accept the French terms.

==Terms==

The treaty added 15 million [[French livre|livre]] to the indemnity of 21 millions extracted from the Papal States at the [[Armistice of Bologna|preceding armistice signed at Bologna]]—36 million in all. 

In addition, the papal city of [[Avignon]] and its territory, the [[Comtat Venaissin]], which had been occupied by French forces at an early stage of the Revolution, were formally ceded to France - putting a definite end to half a millennium of Papal rule. 

The [[Romagna]] region - as noted, already invaded by the French - was also ceded by the Papal States and included in the newly created [[Cisalpine Republic]]. 

The treaty also formalized the confiscation of artistic treasures from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Over a hundred paintings and other works of art were to go to the [[Louvre]]  in [[Paris]]. The French commissioners reserved the right to enter any building, public, religious or private, to make their choice and assessment of what was to be taken to France. This part of the treaty was extended to apply to all of Italy in 1798 by treaties with other Italian states. 

Other conditions imposed on the Papal States included a compensation to the family of the journalist [[Hugh de Basseville]], killed by a crowd in Rome for having allegedly "insulted the Pope", and giving consent to the stationing of French troops in [[Ancona]] until the end of the war.

==Criticism==

Of the French terms, the confiscation of artistic works - or, as many considered it, theft and plunder - came under criticism and its legitimacy questioned. Among the fiercest opponents was [[Quatremère de Quincy]] who in 1796 wrote a pamphlet, ''Letters in Miranda'', in which he affirmed the strong relationship between a work of art and  the place in which it was intended, asserting that "eradicating the context in which the work was created irreparably impairs its legibility". 

Of the confiscated works of art, a bronze statue by [[Giunio Bruto]] remains in Paris. However, most of the works were restored after Napoleon's fall, and Bruto's main works are now located in Vatican Gardens in Rome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46229">A '''two-child policy''' is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children. It has previously been used in [[Vietnam]]. In [[British Hong Kong]] in the 1970s, citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit (although it was not mandated by law), and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies. Since 2016, it has been implemented in China, replacing the country's previous [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= China to end one-child policy and allow two |work= BBC |date= 29 October 2015 |url=

== China (Mainland) ==
During the 1970s, Chinese citizens were encouraged to have only one child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/one-child-policy|title=one-child policy - Definition &amp; Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing [[Cultural Revolution]] and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors. During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The colloquial term "births per woman" is usually formalized as the ''[[Total Fertility Rate]]'' (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.)

As China's youngest generation (born under the [[one-child policy]], which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) came of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-07-10/154513416121.shtml | language=Chinese | accessdate=7 November 2008 | date=10 July 2007 | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | title=计生委新闻发言人:11%以上人口可生两个孩子 (English: "Spokesperson of the one-child policy committee: 11% or more of the population may have two children)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013, most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news |title=China's 'one-child' rethink marks symbolic shift |author=Patti Waldmeir |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7bed3f70-4dfa-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper=FT |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ouyang | first1 = Y. | title = China relaxes its one-child policy | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62544-1 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9907 | pages = e28–e30 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-07/10/content_17706811.htm|title=Most Chinese provincial areas relax one-child policy - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|first=|last=杨洁|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Xinhua]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the overall [[fertility rate]] of mainland China is, in fact, closer to two children per family than to one child per family (1.8). In addition, since 2012, Han Chinese in southern [[Xinjiang]] were allowed to have two children. This, along with incentives and restrictions against higher Muslim [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] fertility, was seen as attempt to counter the threat of [[Xinjiang conflict|Uyghur separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The government in Xinjiang is trying to limit Muslim births|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21678007-government-xinjiang-trying-limit-muslim-births-remote-control|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2015, [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] reported the change in the existing law to a two-child policy citing a statement from the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= China to end one-child policy and allow two |work= BBC |date= 29 October 2015 |url=

In 2018, about two years after the new policy reform, China is facing new ramifications from the two-child policy. Since the revision of the one-child policy, 90 million women have become eligible to have a second child.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180223131904.htm|title=China's two-child policy may exacerbate gender inequality|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the new two-child policy may have negative implications on gender roles, with new expectations from females to bear more children and to abandon their careers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21736574-two-child-rule-still-applies-officials-know-more-babies-are-needed-not-fewer-china|title=China is in a muddle over population policy|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reform, China saw a short-lived boost in fertility rate for 2016. Chinese women gave birth to 17.2 million babies in 2016, but declined by 3.5% in 2017.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Husbands still have greater marital power, thus increasing fertility pressure on their female counterpart.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The dynamic of relationships (amount of "power" held by each parent), and the amount of resources each parent has contributes to the struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qian|first=Yue|last2=Jin|first2=Yongai|date=2018-02-21|title=Women's Fertility Autonomy in Urban China: The Role of Couple Dynamics Under the Universal Two-Child Policy|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323327889|journal=Chinese Sociological Review|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1–35|doi=10.1080/21620555.2018.1428895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources would be items such as income, and health insurance. Dominance would be described as who has the final say in pregnancy, who has to resign in their career for maternal/parental leave. However, females have shown interest in a second child if the first child did not possess the desired gender.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Chinese couples have also polled and stated that they would rather invest in one child opposed to two children.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To add, another concern for couples would be the high costs of raising another child; China's childcare system needs to be furthered developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-03-12/no-easing-of-two-child-policy-official-says-101220222.html|title=No Easing of Two-Child Policy, Official Says - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in cultural norms appears to be having negative consequences and leads to fear of a large aging population with smaller younger generations; thus the lack of workforce to drive the economy.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In [[British Hong Kong]], the Eugenics League was founded in 1936, which became [[The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"&gt;[http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&amp;content=about/history.asp History of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327235233/http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&amp;content=about%2Fhistory.asp |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides family planning advice, [[sex education]], and [[birth control]] services to the general public of Hong Kong. In the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the "Two is Enough" campaign,&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"/&gt; which reduced the general birth rate through educational means.

The [[total fertility rate]] in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world.
Although the "Two is Enough" campaign found widespread approval, it does not reflect current government policy in supporting families.

==Iran==
Iranian authorities encouraged families in Iran not to have more than two children when conducting [[family planning in Iran]] from early 1990s to late 2006. Iran's government "declared that Islam favored families with only two children", as one historian put it.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.184&lt;/ref&gt; When the family planning program was initiated, Iran's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives - pills, condoms, IUDs, implants, tubal ligations, and vasectomies.&lt;ref name="sciolino"&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors : the Elusive Face of Iran'', Free Press, 2000, 2005 (p.282)&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in 2006, the government's population control policy changed when Ahmadinejad called for reversal of Iran's existing policy of "two children is enough"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stimson.org/swa/pdf/Iran_DemBrief1.pdf Prospects for Ahmadinejad’s Call for More Rapid Population Growth in Iran] {{cite news

In [[Singapore]], the two-child policy until the 1980s was called "Stop at Two".

==United Kingdom==
In July 2007, the [[think tank]] Optimum Population Trust (now [[Population Matters]]) advocated what the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described as a "'two-child' policy" to combat population increases and climate change in the United Kingdom.  The article stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"According to the report, published by the Optimum Population Trust, Britain's high birth rate is a major factor in the current level of climate change, which can only be combated if families voluntarily limit the number of children they have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Firth|first=Niall|title=Families should have no more than two children - thinktank|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-467728/Families-children--thinktank.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2012, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a 'two-child policy',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep|title=Two-child benefits policy targets the strivers in low-paid jobs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/25/iain-duncan-smith-two-child-policy|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been fronted by the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] and former leader of the Conservative Party [[Iain Duncan Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice|first=Andrew|title=What is Iain Duncan Smith's two-child policy?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-is-iain-duncan-smiths-twochild-policy-8227368.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, [[David Cameron]] denied any such plans to cut child benefits or tax credits. However, three months later, [[George Osborne]], the then Finance Minister, announced that child tax credits would be limited to the first two children only. This was to come into force from the 2017/2018 financial year and apply to children born after that date only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Asa|title=Tax credits: what are they, who claims them, and why is everyone so angry about the cuts?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11951056/Tax-credits-what-are-they-who-claims-them-and-why-is-everyone-so-angry-about-the-cuts.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 2019 however the policy becomes retrospective. Families  making a new benefit claim (or whose circumstances change) will have the 2-child policy applied to them irrespective of when their children were born.

The two-child policy took effect on 5 April 2017. One particular aspect of the new rules, termed the "rape clause", has caused controversy. Although the policy excludes all but the first two children from all available benefits, an exemption can be applied for if the conception of the third and any further children occurred as a result of the [[rape]] of the claimant. A woman wishing to claim this exemption must fill in an eight-page form: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The form requires women wanting to be eligible for the exemption to sign a declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex – and giving the child’s name. They must sign a declaration reading: 'I believe the non-consensual conception exemption applies to my child.' They must also sign another declaration that says: 'I confirm that I am not living with the other parent of this child.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter||last2=Butler|first2=Patrick|title=Government under fire over new child tax credit form for rape victims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/06/government-under-fire-over-new-child-tax-credit-form-for-victims|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That the woman must thereby identify the child in question (which is thought to be assigned a tax code created for this exemption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rustin|first1=Susanna|title=The ‘rape rule’ for tax credits tramples the rights of children it’s meant to protect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/17/rape-rule-tax-credits-rights-children-sex-crime|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), that first or second children conceived by rape do not count towards this exemption and that women who are still living with their abusers are not eligible are just some of the aspects of the rape clause that caused widespread condemnation. Ruth Graham, writing for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], summarises the issues surrounding this new policy thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The policy and the exemption have received harsh criticism from a wide variety of sources since they were announced in 2015. One member of parliament called the exemption implementation 'inhumane and barbaric.' Feminists have pointed out the cuts disproportionately affect women. A coalition of the U.K.’s largest Christian denominations and Jewish groups pointed out that the policy discriminates against people whose religion compels them to have larger families. A United Nations committee on children’s rights asked the British government to explain the policy last year, because of concerns about women having to somehow prove they were raped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=Ruth|title=This Cruel New U.K. Policy Punishes Women for Having More Than Two Children 378 69 618|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/04/10/the_u_k_two_child_tax_credit_policy_is_nonsensical_and_cruel.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=Slate|date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History===

From 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into [[North and South Vietnam]] along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region. [[North Vietnam]] became the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and had a communist government, whereas [[South Vietnam]] became the [[Republic of Vietnam]] and was more aligned with the United States and other Western nations.&lt;ref name="Vietnam Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langguth|first1=A.J.|title=Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975|date=March 12, 2002|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1231-1|page=671}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, North Vietnam began a policy advocating a two-child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population.&lt;ref name="Population Council Daniel Goodkind" /&gt; Vietnam's family planning policy was developed before those of other countries, such as China and [[India]], the government used a system of information, education, communication (IEC) campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knudsen|first1=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|date=June 30, 2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5|pages=139–168|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975 under the Communist Party, there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the North to the rest of Vietnam, which extended into the next decade.&lt;ref name="Fertility Family Planning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allman|first1=James|last2=Vu|first2=Qui Nhan|last3=Nguyen|first3=Minh Thang|last4=Pham|first4=Bich San|title=Fertility and Family Planning in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=September 1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=308–317|doi=10.2307/1966685|jstor=1966685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the government of the Republic of Vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy, inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viet Nam|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/vietnam.doc|website=United Nations|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Vietnam government practiced various family planning measures, including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the National Committee for Population and Family Planning. After 1983, each family was required to limit the number of children to two. In 1985, the government increased incentives, such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors, and disincentives, such as penalties for violations in family planning.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam" /&gt;

In 1986, the Party implemented the Renovation (''[[Đổi Mới]]'') Policy, which completely reversed the Communist Party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals. The aims of the Renovation Policy were to end Vietnam's economic isolation, increase competitiveness, and raise living standards.&lt;ref name="History Doi Moi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Donald|title=Doi Moi Policy and the Small-Enterprise Boom in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam|journal=Geographical Review|date=April 1996|volume=86|issue=2|pages=178–197|doi=10.2307/215955|jstor=215955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population, the Vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruun|first1=Ole|last2=Jacobsen|first2=Michael|title=Human Rights and Asian Values: Contesting National Identities and Cultural Representations in Asia|date=2 September 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1212-0|pages=161–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[Government of Vietnam|Council of Ministers]] issued an in-depth family planning policy, adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|date=Mar 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|doi=10.2307/1973424|jstor=1973424|last1=Ministers&amp;#93;|first1=&amp;#91;Council of}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed one-or-two-child policy of Vietnam was established nine years after China's [[one-child policy]] was implemented, and elements of China's policy are reflected in Vietnam's, such as the emphasis on marrying later,&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; postponing childbearing age (22-years of age or older for women and 24-years of age or older for men),&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; and spacing out birth of children (3–5 years apart).&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; The state was required to supply free birth control devices (such as [[intrauterine device|intrauterine loops]], [[condoms]], and birth control pills) and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; Furthermore, if families did not comply with the two-child policy, they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt;

In 1993, the Vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified Vietnam of the one-to-two child policy as a mandatory national policy. The policy combined advertisements and education to promote a smaller family "so people may enjoy a plentiful and happy life."&lt;ref name="Harvard 1993 Resolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution of 1993 on Policy Concerning the Population and Family Planning Work|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/VIETNAM2.htm|website=Hanoi Voice of Vietnam Network|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese government explicitly linked the family planning policy with "historical and cultural traditions, value structures and development objectives," encouraging a collectivist mindset in which individuals honor the needs of the nation above their own.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values" /&gt; The goal of the policy was to reduce the Vietnamese fertility rate to the replacement level of 2.1&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute"/&gt; by 2015, so that the country could have a stable population during mid-21st century. In 1997, the goal was accelerated to reach the replacement level by 2005, and the government subsequently integrated an increased use of abortion as a means to curb population growth.&lt;ref name="World Policy Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=John F.|title=World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact|date=March 30, 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2836-3|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Standing Parliamentary Committee of the National Assembly issued the highest legislative document on population titled the Population Ordinance, which restructured the official family planning policy.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; According to the ordinance, couples "shall have the right to decide on the time to have babies, the number of children and the duration between child births."&lt;ref name="Population 2003"&gt;{{citation|title=Population Ordinance (6/2003)|website=The Standing Committee of National Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly after, the government implemented the National Strategy on Population 2001-2010, which again called for decreasing the fertility rate to the replacement level by 2005. This caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; To address this confusion, the government issued Resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that "to sustain high economic growth, Viet Nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country." However at this time, the population had already reached the goal of having a total fertility rate below the replacement level.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

In 2009, the Population Ordinance was amended to again restrict the number of children to be one or two children, although individuals were allowed to decide the timing and spacing of their births.&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordinance No. 08/2008|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/poppolicy.htm|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is currently drafting a new Law on Population to replace the Population Ordinance in 2015.

The organizational structure of the two-child policy was housed under different governmental units since its conception in the 1960s. As the policy evolved from "Initiation in the 1960s–1970s; Maturity in the 1980s–1990s; and Legalization in the 2000s–2010s",&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; the administration of the population policy also changed. From 1961-1983, the population program fell under the Population and Birth Control Unit. From 1984–2002, it was under the control of National Committee for Population and Family Planning. From 2003–2006, it was in the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children. Since 2007, the population program has been under the General Office for Population and Family Planning.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

Although the policy was advocated on the national level, the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives, instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"/&gt; Each family was required to have at most two children, and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement. Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice. Individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them, whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the Labor Medal for "good realization of the population – family planning program".&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt; The government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries, promotions, and sometimes even their jobs.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt;

===Current status===

Currently, the effective population policy is the revised 2009 Population Ordinance which states that "each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning, reproductive health care: (i) decide time and birth spacing; (ii) have one or two children, exceptional cases to be determined by the Government."&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend" /&gt; Thus, individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have. Furthermore, later that year, Chief Executive Trương Tấn San stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of Vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020, and suggested that a new comprehensive Law on Population be introduced to the government by 2015.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

===Effects of this policy===

====Reduction of the birthrate====
The total fertility rate in Vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993, suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|title=Falling Fertility in Vietnam|journal=Population Studies: A Journal of Demography|date=1997|volume=51|issue=2|pages=203–211|doi=10.1080/0032472031000149916}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one demographic model, the [[fertility#Bongaarts' model of components of fertility|Bongaarts' model of components of fertility]], high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate. Furthermore, because of this policy, the population has fundamentally changed their ideas of the family. In 1988, the Inter-Censal Demographic and Health Survey found that parents wanted an average of 3.3 children, and in 1994, they found that the ideal number of children fell to 2.8.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility" /&gt;

However, the reported findings differ depending on the [[fertility]] model utilized and on the particular research study cited. The [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|United Nations Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific]] found that the average number in household was 3.1 in 1998.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy" /&gt; In another study conducted by the America-based non-profit, non-governmental organization [[Population Reference Bureau]], the number found was lower at 2.3.&lt;ref name=PRB&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of Population and Development in Vietnam|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2003/AnOverviewofPopulationandDevelopmentinVietnam.aspx|website=Population Reference Bureau|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in the Worldwide State of the Family in 1995 by Tran Xuan Nhi,&lt;ref name="Vietnam Families"&gt;{{citation|last1=Nhi|first1=Tran Xuan|title=Vietnam's families|publisher=Worldwide State of the Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; found a contrasting finding that the [[total fertility rate]] only dropped slightly and the size of [[nuclear families]] experienced only a slight change, dipping from 4.8 to 4.7 from 1989 to 1994.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisensale|first1=Steven|title=Family Policy in a Changing Vietnam|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|date=2000|volume=31|issue=1|pages=79–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex-based differences====

There is evidence that [[son preference]] exists in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Son Preference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Haughton|first2=Dominique|title=Son Preference in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=1995|volume=26|issue=6|pages=325–337|doi=10.2307/2138098|jstor=2138098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, men oversee and are responsible for household enterprises, managing agriculture, ancestral worship, and carrying on the family name.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guilmoto|first1=Christophe Z.|title=Son Preference, Sex Selection, and Kinship in Vietnam|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 2012|volume=38|issue=1|pages=31–54|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00471.x|pmid=22833863}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the desire for a son is seen in the Vietnamese family's fertility practices, the desire for more than one son is not.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Families with two daughters are twice as likely to have a third child than families with at least one son, presumably with the hopes that this one will be a boy.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Furthermore, women who do not have any sons are around 15% less likely to use contraceptives than families who have at least one.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt; There were also increased rates of "contraceptive failure" amongst couples who had a son, as families secretly removed an IUD to bypass the policy in hopes of having a son.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; This is consistent with findings from other East Asian countries in which son preference corresponds with a demand for fewer children so that families will have at least one son to maintain the ancestral line.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt;

Despite the evidence for son preference, there is no clear evidence that Vietnam's sex ratio at birth is increasing, as seen in other East Asian countries, notably China, though evidence is conflicting depending on the source.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; In fact, according to the Vietnamese census data for 1989 and 1999, the sex ratios of males to females at birth are actually decreasing.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; On the other hand, some sources state that the impact of son preference varies by region of Vietnam. In the north, there is a strong relationship between sex bias in fertility decisions and number of male births, while in the south, this relationship is nonexistent.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; However, mothers who pursue certain occupations, such as government cadres and farmers, are more likely to want a particular sex of child and have higher sex-ratio differences at birth. This reflects the pressure for government employees to adhere to the two-child limit, and the perceived necessity of males for manual labor in the farm.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belanger|first1=Daniele|last2=Khuat|first2=Thi Hai Oanh|last3=Liu|first3=Jianye|last4=Le|first4=Thanh Thuy|last5=Pham|first5=Viet Thanh|title=Are Sex Ratios at Birth Increasing in Vietnam?|journal=Population|date=2003|volume=58|issue=2|pages=231–250|doi=10.2307/3246604|jstor=3246604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism===

====Inadequate contraceptives====
Although the policy states that "the state will supply, free of charge, birth control devices... to eligible persons who are cadres, manual workers, civil servants or members of the armed forces... and poor persons who register to practice family planning... The widespread sale of birth control devices will be permitted to facilitate their use by everybody that needs them,"&lt;ref name=JPRS&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|doi=10.2307/1973424 |journal=Population and Development Review|date=February 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|jstor=1973424 |last1=Ministers&amp;#93; |first1=&amp;#91;Council of }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only modern contraceptive readily available in Vietnam is the IUD.&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=S.|title=In Vietnam, Contraceptive Awareness High, Use Low Despite Two-Child Policy|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1992|volume=18|issue=3|pages=117–119|doi=10.2307/2133412|jstor=2133412}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women choose not to use it due to the side effects, such as increased bleeding, back and abdominal pains, headache, and general weakness.&lt;ref name="Abortion IUD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Annika|last2=Le|first2=Thi Nham Tuyet|last3=Nguyen|first3=Lap|last4=Kajsa|first4=Sundstrom|title=Abortion in Context: Women's Experience in Two Villages in Thai Binh Province, Vietnam|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1996|volume=22|issue=3|pages=103–107|doi=10.2307/2950750|jstor=2950750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, contraceptive use is low among women under the age of 25, and experts have speculated that "contraceptive use among young women might increase if temporary, easy-to-use methods, such as the pill and the condom, were more accessible. For the government to achieve its two-child policy, the survey committee recommends increased promotion of the commercial availability of the condom and the pill, and strengthening of the government family planning program."&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern" /&gt;

====Increased abortion====
Abortion rates in Vietnam are unusually high by international standards, with a total abortion rate of at least 2.5 abortions per woman.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodkind|first1=Daniel|title=Abortion in Vietnam: Measurements, Puzzles, and Concerns|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=December 1994|volume=25|issue=6|pages=342–352|doi=10.2307/2137878|jstor=2137878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the abortion rate for young age groups is higher than older age groups due to a limited awareness of contraceptive methods and availability. Individuals of lower educational levels also have higher abortion rates.&lt;ref name="Abortion Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Thanh Binh|title=Abortion in Present Day Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences|date=January 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam also has some of the world's most liberal abortion laws, though the Vietnamese government is aiming to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortion-related difficulties.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whittaker|first1=Andrea|title=Abortion in Asia: Local Dilemmas, Global Politics|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-795-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006,&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ngo|first1=Thoai D.|last2=Keogh|first2=Sarah|last3=Nguyen|first3=Thang H.|last4=Le|first4=Hoan T.|last5=Pham|first5=Kiet H. T.|last6=Nguyen|first6=Yen B.T.|title=Risk factors for repeat abortion and implications for addressing unintended pregnancy in Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|date=June 2014|volume=125|issue=3|pages=241–246|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2013.11.014|pmid=24726618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple factors influencing Vietnam's high abortion rates. First, because women do not have access to contraceptive methods besides IUDs, whilst condoms remain expensive relative to average income, as a result many do not use effective birth control.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Women who have undergone multiple abortions used short-term methods of contraceptives, such as condoms and contraceptive pills, which are less effective than long-acting contraceptives to which many do not have access.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt; Secondly, due to the higher costs of raising a child in some geographic areas of Vietnam, abortions have become more acceptable.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Furthermore, the era of modernization and development of free-market reforms since the 1980s has led to a rise in premarital and unwanted pregnancy, and subsequently increased abortion services.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Additionally, the Vietnamese government has insufficient alternatives to abortion within the family planning purposes and a lack of post-abortion contraceptive dialogues for families.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; Thus, experts have suggested providing more diverse, long-acting contraceptive alternatives and increasing counseling for families that have experienced an abortion as methods to decrease abortion in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt;

'''Uniform field theory''' is a formula for determining the effective [[electrical resistance]] of a parallel wire system. By calculating the mean square field acting throughout a section of coil, formulae are obtained for the effective resistances of single- and multi-layer solenoidal coils of either solid or stranded wire.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Armstrong and T. P. Hilditch, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v107/n2696/abs/107573b0.html A study of catalytic actions at solid surfaces], ''Nature,''  107, pages 573-575 (30 June 1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

'''William Seifriz''' (August 11, 1888 &amp;ndash; July 13, 1955) was a Professor of Biology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and an important figure in the history of [[plant physiology]] and [[plant]] [[cell biology]].

==Personal life==

William Seifriz was born on August 11, 1888 outside of Washington, D.C. to Paul Seifriz M.D. and his wife, both of whom emigrated from Germany in 1887. After Paul Seifriz died, Seifriz' mother ran a boarding house for scientists from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. This association with botanists led the young Seifriz to pursue the study of botany. After graduating [[McKinley Technical High School]] in 1907 as [[valedictorian]], he worked as a laboratory assistant in the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], working on experimental electroculture. After working as a laboratory assistant for three years, he spent one year as a practical student in a shipyard in [[Bremen, Germany]]. After returning to America, he spent one year studying law at [[Georgetown University]]. Realizing that science would be a worthwhile way for him to accomplish his life's work, he entered [[The Johns Hopkins University]] where he was awarded a B.S. ''[[honoris causa]]'' in 1917 and earned a Ph.D. in [[botany]] in 1920. After graduation, Seifriz went to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] to study cell physiology with [[Robert Hippolyte Chodat]].  He continued to do research at [[Imperial College London]] and [[King's College London]] in England. Then Seifriz joined [[Herbert Freundlich]] at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] to learn the techniques he would need to understand the physical properties of [[protoplasm]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamiya|first1=Noburô |title=In Memoriam William Seifriz|journal=Protoplasma|date=1956|volume=45|issue=4|pages=513–524|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01252673?view=classic#page-1|accessdate=September 14, 2016|doi=10.1007/bf01252673}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freundlich, H. and W. Seifriz|title=Über die Elastizität von Solen und Gelen|journal=Z. Phys. Chem.|date=1923|volume=104|issue=3/4|pages=233–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seifriz spent time with [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Jacobus van't Hoff]], [[Svante Arrhenius]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Max Planck]], [[Walther Nernst]] and [[Max von Laue]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seifriz|first1=William|title=A New University|journal=Science|volume=120|issue=3107|pages=87–91|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/120/3107/87|accessdate=September 14, 2016|doi=10.1126/science.120.3107.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 when he was head of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] botanical laboratories, he led an expedition to the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountains in Colombia to collect and study flora there.&lt;ref&gt;"19,000-Foot Snow-Capped Peak Goal of Expedition Hunting New Flora in South American Wilderness." Philadelphia Record July 28, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seifriz held 'Philosophical Meetings' at his home ''Seifriziana'' to which he invited artists, musicians, scientists, medical doctors, psychologists, and other intellectuals. He loved animals and kept birds, monkeys, donkeys, cats, rabbits, peacocks and a dog. He also collected French porcelain and Italian bronze. He did not have a telephone.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glorious handful| journal=Time |volume=30 |issue=33 |page=29|date=December 6, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Seifriz married Myra George when he was 64.

Seifriz died on July 13, 1955 while collecting botanical specimens near the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

William Seifriz was an Associate Editor for the journal Protoplasma from its founding in 1926 to his death in 1955. He was also an Associate Editor of [[Journal of Colloid Science]] and Biodynamica.

==University life==

Seifriz was a Seessel Fellow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anon|title=Catalog of Yale University (1921-1922) Eighteenth Series, Number 16|date=1922|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=444|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Yale University]] from 1922 to 1923. He became an instructor at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1923 and came to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as a National Research Fellow in 1924 and became a professor of protoplasmatology and [[plant geography]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Research==

Seifriz was a [[naturalist]] and a laboratory scientist who studied the viscoelastic properties and microscopic structure of [[protoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dietrich|first1=Michael R.|title=Explaining the "Pulse of Protoplasm": The Search for Molecular Mechanisms of Protoplasmic Streaming.|journal=Journal of Integrative Plant Biology|date=2015|volume=57|issue=1|pages=14–22|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jipb.12317/abstract|accessdate=September 14, 2016|doi=10.1111/jipb.12317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Loose Protoplasm" has Rhythmic Flow of Higher Life Tissue|url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&amp;d=ADT19371202.2.63#|accessdate=September 19, 2016|agency=Aspen Daily Times (December 2, 1937)|issue=page 7|publisher=Colorado Historic Newspapers Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a [[micromanipulator]] and [[microdissection]], Seifriz showed that protoplasm was [[non-Newtonian]], [[thixotropic]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wayne|first1=Randy|title=Plant Cell Biology: From Astronomy to Zoology|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_biw80LgjwC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=plant+cell+biology+from+astronomy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pUUSyYOa2l&amp;sig=LsATJCrd-aqLaGbLCYe9vB1Zm68&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwins63hmY_PAhULaD4KHa0KBYkQ6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=plant%20cell%20biology%20from%20astronomy&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seifriz proposed that the physical properties of protoplasm were a consequence of long chain molecules attached to one another like a brush heap. Seifriz studied the streaming protoplasm of the slime mold [[Physarum polycephalum]] and coined the word, ''protoplasmatologist'' for someone who studies the properties of living protoplasm. Seifriz' expertise ranged from physics to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seifriz|first1=William|title=A materialistic interpretation of life|journal=Philosophy of Science|date=1939|volume=6|issue=3|pages=266–284|doi=10.1086/286557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seifriz's work appeared in ''[[Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|title= The pulse of protoplasm|journal=Time |volume=36 |issue=22 |page=46|date=November 24, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Seifriz' book, ''Protoplasm'', E. O. Kraemer wrote, "Professor Seifriz is a versatile scientist. His work on emulsions, gels, and other colloid topics is well known among chemists and physicists, but they may not be aware that Professor Seifriz is a member of a botany department and is an active investigator in botany and biology. Professor Seifriz's general attitude toward science, and, in particular, his point of view in his book is typified by the quotation from Descartes with which he introduces his preface: If, therefore, anyone wishes to search out the truth of things in serious earnest, he ought not to select one special science; for all the sciences are conjoined with each other and interdependent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraemer|first1=E. O.|title=Protoplasm. By William Seifriz|journal=J. Phys. Chem.|date=1937|volume=41|issue=2|pages=341–342|doi=10.1021/j150380a028|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j150380a028|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Seifriz' book, ''The Structure of Protoplasm'', C. A. Shull described it as "One of the most important summaries of protoplasmic structure in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shull|first1=C. A.|title=The Structure of Protoplasm: William Seifriz|journal=Botanical Gazette|date=1942|volume=103|issue=3|pages=630–631|doi=10.1086/335080|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/335080|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This gifted young man had done postgraduate work in botany at Tokyo's Imperial University, was studying at Giessen in Germany in the fateful summer of 1939. When Germany invaded Poland, the Japanese Government ordered Kamiya to get out. Not stopping for books or clothing, he left posthaste for the U. S. by way of Hamburg and Bergen. He wrote to Dr. Seifriz, asking if he could go to work in his laboratory. Seifriz welcomed him. "First thing I did," Seifriz recalls, "was to lend him a raincoat." Kamiya still has it"''.''&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

==Teaching==

In his lectures in ''Physics and Chemistry of Protoplasm'', Seifriz gave not only the facts, but the background of the subject and the ''lines of thought by which the discoveries have come about''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; When he lectured on ''Plants and Climates'', he showed slides of photographs that he took while on his many botanical trips throughout the world.

==Film==

Seifriz used cinematography to make a movie entitled, ''Seifriz on Protoplasm,'' which won prizes at several film festivals and was shown on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seifriz|first1=William|title=Seifriz on Protoplasm (1954)|url=http://labs.plantbio.cornell.edu/wayne/CellBiologyVideos/Seifriz.mp4|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

''Chamaedorea seifrizii'', the Victorian Parlor Palm, was named after William Seifriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Robin|title=Parlor talk: Victorian palms, primordial rhythms|url=http://keysnews.com/node/67693|accessdate=September 14, 2016|agency=Keys News; Wednesday June 24, 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' ''xenia'' motif''' in Roman [[mosaic]] is a [[still life]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a grouping of various items, mostly edible, representing a generous offering (a ''xenia'') from a wealthy host to his guests.  The items are often spread across different compartments in floor mosaic schemes. No doubt there were once paintings, but these have been lost.

Typical elements of a ''xenia'' motif include game hanging from hooks, fish, baskets of fruit (often overturned), and the like. [[Vitruvius]] lists specifically "poultry, eggs, vegetables, and other country produce".&lt;ref&gt;''[[de Architectura]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/6*.html#7.4 VI:7:4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xenia'' motifs are typically found in reception rooms.

[[Xenia (Greek)|The word ''xenia'']] is Greek, and means 'hospitality'; in Latin, it came to mean presents for guests, and later presents in general. It also came to include a class of [[epigram]]matic inscription attached to the presents, [[xenia epigram]]s.

The comic strip is a [[Text comics|text-based comic]], that answers readers' questions, with illustrations of the main characters, various objects, and, or the experiments being discussed. It is run as a single panel comic that appears in newspapers as a color, or black and white Sunday feature, in either a 1/4 page strip, or 1/2 tab format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://images.amuniversal.com/ups/sales/UPS_Factsheet6_06.pdf|title=Universal Press Syndicate: Fact Sheet, June 2006 |publisher=[[Universal Press Syndicate]]|pages=2, 3|date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic has reached a readership of 52 million readers, in 13 countries.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; About 80 percent of the letters it receives are from females.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; From its comic origins, its lead character Beakman would later star in his own [[live action]] [[television series]], ''[[Beakman's World]]''.&lt;ref name="Post2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/20/DI2006062000567.html|title=Comics: Meet the Artist|first=Suzanne |last=Tobin|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic also branched out into other media, gaining numerous awards along the way. The comic continued for several months after its author died of a heart attack on April 29, 2016.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Jok-Church-Beakman-and-Jax-cartoon-strip-for-7396400.php|title=Jok Church, of Beakman and Jax cartoon strip for kids, dies at 67|author=Steve Rubenstein|date=5 May 2016|work=SFGate|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jok's final remaining comic was published on July 17, 2016, just three days after its 25th anniversary of publication.&lt;ref name=GoComics/&gt;

The comic strip was originally named ''You Can with Beakman'' (also called ''U Can with Beakman''.&lt;ref name="BrnLW"/&gt; Its only main character at the time was '''Beakman Place''', a male figure with spiky blue hair, glasses, a neck tie, and a breast pocket full of instruments. Beakman is a non-[[scientist]] that learns about the world through books, and then finds ways to prove what he's read about.&lt;ref name=ADE&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn86033360/1994-05-10/ed-1/seq-10/png/ |title=National News: Cartoonist defends 'explosive' comic strip experiment|work=Adirondack Daily Enterprise|publisher=Northern New York Library Network Newspaper.com |date=1994-05-10 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after [[Beekman Place]], a small street on the east side of Manhattan, New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Real Breakman, by Brenden Shea|work=Odyssey. March 2000, Vol. 9 Issue 3, page 45|publisher=[[Odyssey (children's magazine)]] |date=March 2000|page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic is in a question-and-answer format, in which a reader asks a question, addressed to either Beakman, or also later, his sister '''Jax Place''',&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Amzn&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0836270215|title=Beakman and Jax's Microscope Book: Product description|publisher=Amazon.com|date=December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; a red head, with her hair curled up behind her head in blue circular bands, she wears glasses, and [[Knucklebones|jacks]] in her hair, and as [[earring]]s.

A paragraph after the results of the experiment, in inverted text at the bottom of the comic, would explain the answer.

==Concept==
The idea for doing a comic strip came to Jok while he was working for [[Lucasfilm]], and answering questions from [[George Lucas]]' [[fan mail]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/living/1998/beak030298.html|title=Beakman's World: Museum hosts hands-on show|first=Connie|last=Yeager|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|publisher=[[E. W. Scripps Company]]|date=1998-03-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906044215/http://www.cincypost.com/living/1998/beak030298.html|archivedate=2004-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that he was “overcome by the bravery children showed by asking Mr. Lucas anything at all" and he "decided to write about real questions from real kids".&lt;ref name=SFBay&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=8445 |title=Introducing Jok Church’s Comic - You Can with Beakman &amp; Jax|first=Tom W.|last=Kelly|work=[[San Francisco Bay Times]]|publisher=sfbaytimes.com|archivedate=2008-10-11 |deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132457/http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=8445}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at [[Lucasfilm]], Jok began working on a project called "Here's How" a comicstrip and educational television series featuring [[C-3PO]] teaching foreign language and [[R2-D2]] explaining the more physical world", the idea was eventually shelved, but the concept later evolved into Jok's Comicstrip featuring a character named Beakman.&lt;ref name="AMU"/&gt; He would receive these science questions from children, and he would choose to answer them based on subjects that he didn't know about, and wanted to learn.&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt; The comic was written for an audience that includes children, but not exclusively children.&lt;ref name="Post2006"/&gt; He felt his purpose in making the comics was "to make sure my readers are not intimidated by the world through which they walk".&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; He would then research the subject, write, draw, and color the comics by using a Macintosh computer.&lt;ref name=UCan1&gt;{{cite book | last = Church | first = Jok  | title = You Can with Beakman: Science Stuff You Can Do  | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing | year = 1992 | page = 4 | isbn = 0836270045}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process gained him criticism in May 1994 when he explained how to do an experiment separating [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] from water, through [[electrolysis]] using a single jar, and a [[nine-volt battery]], for which he defended the comic strip, by explaining the small amount of gas that would be produced in this way would not be overly dangerous. This was reported to be the first time an experiment's safety was questioned.&lt;ref name=ADE/&gt;

Besides answering questions from children, Jok also took questions from adults. One such question came from the Canadian Prime Minister, [[Jean Chrétien]], who asked about why golf balls had little dents. Jok later explained that he "has world leaders periodically contribute to his&amp;nbsp;... feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndicates/News Services: Prime minister asks.|work=Editor &amp; Publisher |volume= 127 |issue=40|publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |date=1994-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the comic strip Jok also introduced an annual "Beakman and Jax Make Up Your Own Rules Contest", in which the reader could report on an experiment or research they did. There were up to 100 winners from around the world, and the prizes were such things as a free telescopes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life: Your Family, Melissa Baird|work=Marysville/Yuba City's Appeal-Democrat November 12, 1995, page C4|publisher=[[Appeal-Democrat]] |date=1995-10-12 |page=C4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of the Beakman &amp; Jax books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Briefs: Cedar Rapids, Student wins book|work=The Cedar Rapids Gazette: Thursday, Nov. 10,1994, Page 3Y|publisher=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]] |date=1994-11-10 |page=3Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and media==
The comic first appeared in the [[Marin Independent Journal]], and was offered to them for free.&lt;ref name=SFBay/&gt; The earlier comic strips were then reprinted in three "Science Stuff You Can Do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/search?q=Science+Stuff+You+Can+Do |title=Science Stuff You Can Do, Search on Open Library.org |publisher=Open Library|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; books, a ''Best of'', and was the bases for two specialty books, ''Beakman &amp; Jax's Bubble Book'' and ''Beakman &amp; Jax's Microscope Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL2697013W/The_Best_of_You_Can_With_Beakman_and_Jax |title=The Best of You Can With Beakman and Jax, on Open Library.org |publisher=Open Library|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the release of the first book June 1, 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780836270044 |title=You Can with Beakman: Science Stuff You Can Do, publication information. |publisher=[[American Booksellers Association]]

In 1995 an official website opened for the strip published by the "North Bay Network", it won many awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/index.cgi/4273355/FID3542/res/encat/102981.htm |title=You can with Beakman and Jax |publisher=[[Indiana University]].com|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later moved to its current location in 1996, published by [[Network Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoismind.com/whois/beakman.com.html |title=Beakman.com - Whois Data |publisher=[[Whois]].com|date=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it has received several positive reviews from such internet guides as "The parents' pocket guide to kids &amp; computers" by Family Computer Workshop, which gave the site 5 out of 5 stars and recommended it for readers 7–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Parents' Pocket Guide to Kids &amp; Computers |authors=Family Computer Workshop Staff| publisher = Family Computer Workshop | year = 1998 | page = 166 | isbn = 0966645634}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the site contained questions and answers, as well as hands-on activities, some of which required [[Netscape]] and [[Shockwave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Elizabeth B. | last = Miller | title = The Internet Resource Directory for K–12 Teachers and Librarians | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2001 | page = 174 | isbn = 1563089130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final strip was published on July 17, 2016, three days after its 25th anniversary and three months after Jok Church died.
