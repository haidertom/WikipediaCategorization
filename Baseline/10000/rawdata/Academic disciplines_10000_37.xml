'''Anthropotechnic''' is a term used in [[art]], [[science]] and [[literature]] to denote something with aspects of both man and machine.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Charwat, Hans Jürgen: Lexikon der Mensch-Maschine-Kommunikation. Oldenbourg, 1994, {{ISBN|3-486-22618-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s such as [[Max Ernst]]'s "Oedipus Rex" are early examples of the use of this quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famous-painters.org/Max-Ernst/Oedipus-Rex.shtm |title=Oedipus Rex - Max Ernst Painting Gallery |publisher=Famous-painters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals.

==Uses==
* In her book ''Education in Human Creative Existential Planning'', [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] uses the term Genetic Anthropotechnic as a means of ensuring that only the desired characters are inherited by future generations of human beings though the usage of genetics and hence, avoidance of the "fatalism" of inheritance.&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Education in Human Creative Existential Planning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sG8NuWEIuIC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6301-5|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in her ''Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience '', she uses the term Anthropotechnic with reference to the ability of human being to turn animals from being dangerous to "human-friendly".&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3l8yyvfH5AQC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=3 June 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5191-3|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Science|applied}}
'''Applied science''' is the application of existing scientific knowledge to practical applications, like [[technology]] or inventions.

Within [[natural science]], disciplines that are [[basic science]], also called '''pure science''', develop basic ''[[information]]'' to 
predict and perhaps explain and understand phenomena in the natural world. Applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. This includes a broad range of applied science related fields from [[engineering]], [[business]], [[medicine]] to [[early childhood education]].

Applied science can also apply [[formal science]], such as [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], as in [[epidemiology]]. [[Genetic epidemiology]] is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.

==Applied research==
Applied research is the practical application of [[science]]. It accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, [[State (polity)|state-]], [[Commerce|business-]], or [[customer|client-]]driven purpose.  Applied research is contrasted with [[pure research]] (basic research) in discussion about research ideals, methodologies, programs, and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last = Roll-Hansen|first = Nils|url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62f0/dced123c24c7bc89b7d0d72bfcf885634a43.pdf|title = Why the distinction between basic (theoretical) and applied (practical) research is important in the politics of science|date=April 2009|accessdate = September 13, 2018|format = PDF|publisher = The London School of Economics and Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Applied research deals with solving practical problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=a definition of applied research |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Education/ELSI/research-main.html |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818065432/http://www.lbl.gov/Education/ELSI/research-main.html |archivedate=August 18, 2011 }}{{Link note|note = The site appears to be available, but returns a 'forbidden' response, suggesting that only certain IP ranges or recognized accounts might have access.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally employs [[empirical]] methodologies. Because applied research resides in the messy real world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. For example, it may be impossible to use a [[random sample]]. Thus, transparency in the [[methodology]] is crucial. Implications for interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Since applied research has a provisional close-to-the-problem and close-to-the-data orientation, it may also use a more provisional [[conceptual framework]] such as [[working hypotheses]] or pillar questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M.

==Branches of applied science==
{{Outline|Outline of applied science#Branches of applied science}}

Engineering fields include [[thermodynamics]], [[heat transfer]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[mechanics of materials]], [[kinematics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[materials science]], [[earth sciences]], [[engineering physics]].

[[Medical sciences]], for instance [[medical microbiology]] and [[clinical virology]], are applied sciences that apply [[biology]] toward medical knowledge and inventions, but not necessarily medical technology, whose development is more specifically [[biomedicine]] or [[biomedical engineering]].

==In education==
In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (BASc) is equivalent to the [[Bachelor of Engineering]], and is classified as a professional degree.  The BASc tends to focus more on the application of the engineering sciences.  In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree.

In [[Education in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom's educational system]], Applied Science refers to a suite of "vocational" science qualifications that run alongside "traditional" [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] or [[A-Level]] Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/An%20invisible%20revolution_Applied%20Science%20in%20the%2014_19%20curriculum.pdf|format=pdf |title=Applied Science - an invisible revolution? |first=Jim |last=Donnelly |publisher=[[Nuffield Foundation]]|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Science courses generally contain more coursework (also known as portfolio or internally assessed work) compared to their traditional counterparts. These are an evolution of the GNVQ qualifications that were offered up to 2005.
These courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the Wolf Report 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011 |title=Review of Vocational Education - The Wolf Report|first=Alison|last=Wolf |date=March 2011 |docket=DFE-00031-2011|publisher=Department for Education and Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
however, their merits are argued elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Jacqueline|last=Bell|first2=Jim|last2=Donnelly|title=Positioning Applied Science In Schools: Uncertainty, Opportunity and Risk in Curriculum Reform |url=http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003001238/http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf|format=pdf|archive-date=3 October 2011|agency=Centre for Studies in Science &amp; Mathematics Education |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2007 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] offers an [[Minor (academic)|undergraduate minor]] as well as [[Master of Science]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees in "applied science." Courses and research cover varied fields including [[neuroscience]], [[optics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[nondestructive testing]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/ |publisher=William &amp; Mary |title=Applied Science |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, the Bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of Cornell-Technion $100 million in City capital to construct the universities' proposed Applied Sciences campus on Roosevelt Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Mayor Bloomberg, Cornell President Skorton and Technion President Lavie announce historic partnership to build a new applied sciences campus on Roosevelt Island |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr444-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |location= |publisher=The City of New York |agency=Office of the Mayor |date=19 December 2011 |access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)''' is a leading research institute in [[Nainital]], [[Uttarakhand]] which specializes in [[Astronomy]], [[Astrophysics]] and [[Atmospheric Sciences]]. An autonomous body under the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DST), [[Government of India]], the institute is situated at Manora Peak (1,951 m (6,401&amp;nbsp;ft)), about 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nainital]], a popular hill station.&lt;ref name="ni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |title=Local attractions: Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) |publisher=[[Nainital district]] official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829134618/http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |archivedate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Observatory#Astronomical observatories|astronomical observatory]] is open to the public during working days on afternoons. For night viewing however, three - four days on moonlight nights are fixed and prior permission is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nainitaltourism.com/observatory_aries.html|title=OBSERVATORY ( Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)|publisher=Official Nainital tourism website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was started on 20 April 1954 under the supervision of Dr.A.N.Singh as Uttar Pradesh State Observatory (UPSO) in the premises of the [[Govt. Sanskrit College]], presently known as [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]], [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].
With the creation of the State of [[Uttarakhand]] on 9 Nov 2000, and because of its geographical location within the boundaries of [[Uttarakhand]], UPSO came under the administrative control of the new government and was re-christened as the State Observatory (SO). Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) was its new name when it came under the Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST), Govt. of India as an autonomous body on 22 March 2004.

==Research facilities==
===Astronomy and Astrophysics===
[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Belgian PM Charles Michel activate the ARIES Telescope located in Uttarakhand.jpg|thumb|300px|Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] and Belgian Prime Minister [[Charles Michel]] remotely activate the ARIES telescope from [[Brussels]] on 30 March 2016.]]
Research activities at ARIES cover topics related to the sun, stars and galaxies. ARIES has made significant contributions particularly to the field of star clusters and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). The longitude of ARIES (79° East) locates it in the middle of a 180-degree wide longitude band having modern astronomical facilities lying between the Canary Islands (20° West) and Eastern Australia (157° East).Observations, which are not possible in Canary Islands or Australia due to daylight, can be made at ARIES. Because of its geographical location and existence of good astronomical observation sites, ARIES has made unique contributions to many areas of astronomical research, particularly those involving time critical phenomena (e.g., the first successful attempt in the country to observe optical afterglow of GRBs was carried out from ARIES). A large number of eclipsing binaries, variable stars, star clusters, nearby galaxies, GRBs, and supernova have been observed from ARIES. The other research fields of the institute include solar astronomy, stellar astronomy, star clusters, stellar variability and pulsation, photometric studies of nearby galaxies, Quasars, and transient events like supernovae and highly energetic Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). A total solar eclipse lasting about 4 minutes was successfully observed from Manavgat, Antalya in Turkey on 29 March 2006 by a team of scientists from the Institute.

In past, new ring systems around Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were discovered from the observatory. Recently, for the first time a direct correlation between the intra-night optical variability and the degree of polarization of the radio jets in Quasars was established based on the observations from ARIES. For the first time periodic oscillations are detected in optical intra day variability data of blazers which is extremely useful to get the blackhole mass of blazers and also provide a strong support to accretion disk based models of AGN.

===Atmospheric Sciences===
Nainital (29.40N; 79.50E, 1958 m amsl) is located at a high altitude in the Central Himalayas and away from urban cities or any major pollution source. This factor makes it very suitable for carrying out observations in background condition and to study the regional environment, particularly interactions between natural and anthropogenic trace species and climate change. Additionally, the ARIES site can also provide information on long range transport of pollutants. Studies on lower atmospheric dynamics are also very important in this region, which is severely lacking over northern India.

==Infrastructure==
The Institute has in-house workshops to meet the requirements of electronic, mechanical, and optical maintenance of the instruments. ARIES has a modern computer center with internet facility and a well maintained library with more than 10,000 volumes of research journals and an excellent collection of books on Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and Atmospheric Sciences.

[[File:Indiana-rural-road.jpg|thumb|right|Driving in certain conditions may trigger '[[highway hypnosis]]' in some people, which is an example of automaticity. Those who experience highway hypnosis often drive for long distances, responding to external events in the correct and safe manner, but have no memory of the time spent under highway hypnosis as a result.]]
'''Automaticity''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɔː|t|əm|ə|ˈ|t|ɪ|s|ᵻ|t|i}} is the ability to do things without occupying the [[mind]] with the low-level details required, allowing it to become an automatic response pattern or [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. It is usually the result of [[learning]], [[repetition (learning)|repetition]], and practice. Examples of tasks carried out by '[[muscle memory]]' often involve some degree of automaticity.

Examples of automaticity are common activities such as walking, speaking, bicycle-riding, assembly-line work, and driving a car (the last of these sometimes being termed "[[highway hypnosis]]"). After an activity is sufficiently practiced, it is possible to focus the mind on other activities or thoughts while undertaking an automatized  activity (for example, holding a conversation or planning a speech while driving a car).

==Characteristics==
[[John Bargh]] (1994), based on over a decade of research, suggested that four characteristics usually accompany automatic behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-saarland.de/fak5/excops/download/four_horsemen_of_automaticity.pdf |title=The Four Horsemen of Automaticity: Awareness, lntention, Efficiency, and Control in Social Cognition |author=John A Bargh |accessdate=2014-02-16 |publisher=New York University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222000524/http://www.uni-saarland.de/fak5/excops/download/four_horsemen_of_automaticity.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }} {{link note|note=NOTE: Missing pages 24-25.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Awareness 
:A person may be unaware of the mental process that is occurring.
;Intentionality
:A person may not be involved with the initiation of a mental process.
;Efficiency
:Automatic mental processes tend to have a low [[cognitive load]], requiring relatively low mental resources. 
;Controllability 
:A person may not have the ability to stop or alter a process after initiation.

Bargh states that these are simply common characteristics; not all are needed for a process to be considered automatic. For instance, [[Stereotype#Activation|stereotype activation]] has been described as an automatic process: it is unintentional and efficient, requiring little effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bargh |first=John |last2=Chen |first2=Mark |last3=Burrows |first3=Lara |year=1996 |title=Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action |url=http://www.cuclasses.com/stat1001/homeworks/studies/socialbehavior.pdf |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association, Inc |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=230–244 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.230 |accessdate=February 16, 2014 |pmid=8765481 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903153500/http://www.cuclasses.com/stat1001/homeworks/studies/socialbehavior.pdf |archivedate=September 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However stereotype activation is accompanied by above chance awareness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doyen |first=Stephanie |last2=Klein |first2=Oliver |last3=Pichon |first3=Cora-Lise |last4=Cleeremans |first4=Axel |year=2012 |title=Behavioral priming: it's all in the mind, but whose mind? |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029081.g003 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=e29081 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029081 |accessdate=February 16, 2014 |pmid=22279526 |pmc=3261136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if conflicting processing goals are available then it becomes controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=Irene |last2=Mahzarin |first2=Banaji |year=1996 |title=Automatic and controlled processes in stereotype priming |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~mrbworks/articles/1996_JPSP.pdf |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association, Inc.

==In reading==
LaBerge and Samuels (1974) helped explain how reading fluency develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readingrockets.org/articles/68 |title=Comprehension Instruction: What Works |author=Michael Pressley |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=ReadingRockets}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automaticity refers to knowing how to perform some arbitrary task at a competent level without requiring conscious effort — ''i.e.'', it is a form of [[unconscious competence]].

Moreover, if the student is automatic or is "a skilled reader, multiple tasks are being performed at the same time, such as decoding the words, comprehending the information, relating the information to prior knowledge of the subject matter, making inferences, and evaluating the information's usefulness to a report he or she is writing" (Samuels){{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. It is essential to understand automaticity and how it is achieved to better a student's performance. This is important for teachers because automaticity should be focused on in early years to ensure higher level reading skills in adolescence.

==Disruption==
Automaticity can be disrupted by explicit [[attention]] when the devotion of conscious attention to the pattern alters the content or timing of that pattern itself.  This phenomenon is especially pronounced in situations that feature high upside and/or downside risk and impose the associated psychological stress on one's conscious mind; one's performance in these situations may either ''a'') be unimpaired or even enhanced ("[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]") or ''b'') deteriorate ("[[Choke (psychology)|choke]]").

This effect has been named the "centipede effect" after the fable of the "[[Centipede's dilemma]]", where a toad immobilises a centipede simply by asking it how it walks. The centipede's normally unconscious locomotion was interrupted by conscious reflection on it.  The psychologist George Humphrey referred to this parable in his 1923 ''The story of man's mind'':&lt;ref name=humphrey&gt;{{cite book|last=Humphrey|first=George|title=The story of man's mind|year=1923|publisher=Small, Maynard and company|location=Boston|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBxVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=centipede#search_anchor|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No man skilled at a trade needs to put his constant attention on the routine work," he wrote. "If he does, the job is apt to be spoiled."

==Use to influence==
In ''Influence'', [[Robert Cialdini]]'s book about [[social psychology]] and influence tactics, Cialdini explains how common [[automatic response patterns]] are in [[human behavior]], and how easily they can be triggered, even with erroneous cues.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R.B. (2001). ''Influence: Science and practice'' (4th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes an experiment conducted by social psychologists [[Ellen Langer|Langer]], Chanowitz, and Blank  which illustrates how compliant people will be with a request if they hear words that sound like they are being given a reason, even if no actual reason is provided. The experimenters approached people standing in line to use a photocopier with one of three requests:

* "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?"
* "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" or
* "Excuse me. I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?"

{|class="wikitable" style="float:right; margin-left: 1em;"
!rowspan="3" | Small&lt;br /&gt;request
|Sound&amp;nbsp;reason    || {{bartable|94|% (15 out of 16)}}
|-
|No&amp;nbsp;reason       || {{bartable|60|%  (9 out of 15)}}
|-
|Placebic&amp;nbsp;reason || {{bartable|93|% (14 out of 15)}}

|-
|Placebic&amp;nbsp;reason || {{bartable|24|%  (6 out of 25)}}
|}
When given the request plus a reason, 94% of people asked complied with the request. When given the request without a reason, only 60% complied. But when given the request with what sounds like a reason but isn't, compliance jumped back to 93%. Langer, Chanowitz, and Blank are convinced that most human behavior falls into automatic response patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R.B. (2001). Influence: Science and practice (4th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langer, E.J., (1989). Minding matters. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), ''Advances in experimental social psychology'' (Vol. 22). New York, Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the request was made larger (20 pages instead of 5), subjects expected a sound reason before complying, as illustrated in the table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbialek.cba.pl/pliki/langer.pdf Langer, Blank and Chanowitz, ''The Mindlessness of Ostensibly Thoughtful Action: The Role of "Placebic" Information in Interpersonal Interaction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}

'''Bioliquids''' are liquid fuels made from biomass for energy purposes other than transport (i.e. heating and electricity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-e-a.net/document-library/articles/REAYearbook2009FINALVersion.pdf Renewable Energy Association 2009 Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioliquids are usually made from virgin or used vegetable and seed oils, like [[Palm oil|palm]] or [[Soybean oil|soya]] oil. These oils are burned in a power station to create heat, which can then be used to warm homes or boil water to make steam. This steam can then be used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.

[[Rudolf Diesel]]'s first public exhibition of the internal combustion engine, that was to later bear his name, ran on [[peanut]] oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/3986 Sustainable Energy From Vegetable Oil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioliquid production and use==
Bioliquids have been used for many years to provide heat for homes on a small scale but now big energy providers are looking at their use on a larger scale.

A controversial plant in [[Bristol]] (UK) was recently given the go ahead despite receiving several hundred complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12439191 BBC News: Bristol biofuel plant given go-ahead by Eric Pickles]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant will be built and operated by W4B and provide enough power for 25,000 homes.

==Advantages==
Bioliquids have several key advantages over other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref name="greenwise"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120315021204/http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2012-03-15 | title= Bioliquids: do they have a role in renewable energy? | last= Aylott | first= Matthew | date= March 2011 | work=  | publisher= Green Wise Business | accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bioliquids have a high energy density
* The technology is well established, having been used for many years
* Can be used on demand, reacting quickly to changes in demand for power
* Can help reduce dependency on foreign oil.
* Reduces the green house gas emissions.

==Disadvantages==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}

Many of the same problems that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], impact on [[water resources]], as well as energy balance and efficiency.

Bioliquids also have several key problems compared to other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-bioliquid-feedstocks-and-heat-electricity-and-chp-technologies-nnfcc-11-016 Evaluation of Bioliquid Feedstocks &amp; Heat, Elec. &amp; CHP Technologies, NNFCC 11-016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Price of fuel is very variable, due to competitiveness of feedstock for other uses (e.g. soap)
* Supply chain is still very new
* Governments, such as the EU, remained undecided on bioliquids

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1925">A "'''cerebral rubicon'''" in paleontology is the minimum [[cranial capacity]] required for a specimen to be classified as a certain [[paleospecies]] or genus.  The term is mostly used in reference to human evolution.&lt;ref name=dirt&gt;{{cite web |last=Holmes |first=Andrew |url=http://livelikedirt.blogspot.com/2015/01/homo-files-cerebral-rubicon.html |title=Live Like Dirt: Homo files: the cerebral rubicon |publisher=Livelikedirt.blogspot.com |date=2015-01-02 |accessdate=2016-04-11 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Scottish anthropologist Sir [[Arthur Keith]] set the limit at 750 cc for the genus ''Homo''.&lt;ref
name=dirt/&gt; The minimum cranial capacity for the species [[Homo sapiens]] is generally set at 900cc.&lt;ref
name=dirt/&gt;

One of the reasons for the proposal to exclude ''[[Homo habilis]]'' from the genus ''Homo'', and renaming it as "''Australopithecus habilis''", is the small capacity of their cranium (363cc -600 cc).

==Origin==
The term is most likely a reference to the [[Rubicon]] river, which in the time of the [[Roman Empire]] marked the border between [[Gaul|Cisapline Gaul]] and Italy proper.  Crossing the river with an army, as [[Julius Caesar]] did in 49 B.C., was illegal by Roman law and is commonly seen as the "point-of-no-return" for Caesar's revolution.  As such, a "rubicon" can  be used [[idiom]]atically as any strict dividing line or point-of-no-return.

'''Craquelure''' ({{lang-fr|craquelé}}, {{lang-it|crettatura}}) is the fine pattern of dense cracking formed on the surface of materials and can be induced by drying, aging, intentional patterning, or a combination of all three.  The term is most often used to refer to [[tempera]] or [[oil painting]]s, but it can also develop in old [[ivory carving]]s or painted miniatures on an ivory backing. Recently, craquelure has been proposed as a way to authenticate art.

==Craquelure in painted surfaces==
Painting systems are composed of complex layers with unique mechanical properties that depend on the type of drying oil or paint medium used and the presence of paint additives, such as organic solvents, surfactants, and plasticizers. Understanding the mechanism of craquelure formation in paint and the resulting crack morphology provides information about the methods and materials used by the artists.

=== Characterization of craquelure morphology ===
There are seven key features used to describe craquelure morphology:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucklow|first=Spike|date=1997|title=The Description of Craquelure Patterns|jstor=1506709|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=129–140|doi=10.2307/1506709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Local and global direction of cracks
# Relationship to weave or grain direction of support
# Crack shape
# Crack spacing
# Crack thickness
# Termination of cracks
# Organization of crack network

These seven criteria have been used to identify "styles" of craquelure, which relate crack patterns to various historic schools of art. This links the crack patterns with specific time periods, locations, and painting styles.
* Italian paintings on panel (1300-1500): cracks oriented perpendicular to wood grain with jagged lines and distinct secondary networks of thin cracks&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Flemish paintings on panel (1400-1600): cracks oriented parallel to wood grain with smooth, straight segments; uniform thicknesses and small, square islands observed&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Dutch paintings on canvas (1600s): cracks oriented perpendicular to major axis of painting with jagged lines and square junctions; cracks tend to follow weft and warp of canvas support&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* French paintings on canvas (1700s): non-directional cracks with smooth, curved lines in random distributions; newly-developed, stiffer sublayers tended to delocalize tension from the support and remove the connection between crack direction and canvas weave&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Craquelure during drying ===
During drying, the pictorial layer tends to shrink as volatile solvents evaporate. Non-uniform shrinkage across the painting surface is caused by differential adhesion to the sublayer by different paint species and leads to large tensile stresses in the top paint layer. Crack formation during drying depends strongly on adhesion to the sublayer, paint film thickness, composition, and the mechanical properties of the sublayer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giorgiutti-Dauphine|first=Frederique|date=2016|title=Painting cracks: A way to investigate the pictorial matter|url=https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4960438|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=120|pages=065107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Craquelure formed during the drying process appears within days of painting and is characterized by shallow cracks that are localized to the topmost layers of paint. This localization results from capillary forces, which constrain drying stresses to the free surface of the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Drying cracks are usually isotropic due to the fine dispersion of pigment particles within the evaporating volatile solvents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Crack propagation at a critical strain, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_m&lt;/math&gt;, is opposed by an unfavorable increase in [[surface energy]] as the crack elongates and promoted by a release in the elastic energy of the material near the crack. The condition for the propagation of a drying crack can be evaluated precisely using [[fracture mechanics]].

==== Adhesion to sublayer ====
Crack width is heavily dependent on the ability of the top paint layer to adhere to the sublayer. If poor adhesion between these layers occurs, the pictorial layer can slide over the sublayer and create dramatic, wide cracks in response to uneven tensile strains during solvent evaporation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike aging cracks, the width of drying cracks is highly varying as a result.  Poor adhesion can occur if the painter mixes too much oil or other fatty substance into the sublayer material.

==== Film thickness ====
Below a critical film thickness, &lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt;, the pictorial layer will remain crack-free. Cracks are not able to propagate in thin films because the decrease in elastic energy as the crack elongates is not enough to negate the concurrent increase in surface energy. The critical film thickness is approximated by:

&lt;math&gt;h_c = \frac{E_p\Gamma}{Z\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic modulus of the pictorial layer, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; the surface energy of this layer, Z a dimensionless constant that depends on the cracking pattern, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the stress experienced during drying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Films thicker than this critical value display networks of cracks. The degree of connectivity between nucleation sites increases with film thickness, so that thicknesses near the critical value are characterized by isolated star-shaped crack junctions and thick films show more complete networks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Sublayer properties ====
The spacing of cracks during drying depends strongly on the stiffness of the support, or sublayer. An infinitely stiff sublayer does not contribute to the strain in the pictorial layer, so that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_p=\epsilon_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;is the stiffness of the pictorial layer. The crack spacing for an infinitely stiff support is approximated by:

&lt;math&gt;d \approx \frac{4h\Gamma}{E_pa\epsilon_m^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the pictorial layer, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; the surface energy of the pictorial layer, &lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt; the elastic modulus of the pictorial layer, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the depth of the crack.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For a less stiff sublayer, an additional strain in the sublayer, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_s&lt;/math&gt;, lessens the strain in the pictorial layer such that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_m - \epsilon_s = \epsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;. If the ratio of the strains between the two layers is approximately the same as the ratio of their elastic moduli, the crack spacing for a support with finite stiffness can be approximated as:

&lt;math&gt;d \approx \frac{4h\Gamma}{E_pa\epsilon_p^2(1+E_p/E_s)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_s&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic modulus of the sublayer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The denominator in this approximation indicates that crack spacing is dependent on the mismatch in the elastic moduli of the two layers; therefore, regions with stiffer paints tend to have cracks that are more spread out.

==== Other effects ====
Changes in the relative humidity during the drying process affect both the ground layer and support of a painting, promoting crack propagation. Paintings involving hygroscopic materials like wood supports or [[gesso]] ground layers are especially susceptible to variations in relative humidity. Gesso is brittle at relative [[Relative humidity|humidities]] (RH) below 75%; as RH increases, gesso becomes less stiff and transitions to a ductile state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krzemien|first=Leszek|date=2016|title=Mechanism of craquelure pattern formation on panel paintings|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00393630.2016.1140428|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=61|pages=324–330|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in RH cause highly non-uniform tensile strains across the gesso surface, and when the material contracts upon drying, it fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aurand|first=Alice|date=18 April 2018|title=Understanding the moisture induced fatigue damage in panel paintings: a methodological approach for quantifying the role of preparatory layers in overall response|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01769628|journal=Physical issues in the conservation of Paintings: Monitoring, Documenting, and Treatment|volume=|pages=|via=HAL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craquelure formed during gesso drying are particularly noticeable.

Similarly, wood supports respond significantly to changes in RH. Wood grains tend to swell perpendicular to the grain axis when they are exposed to moisture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=David|last2=Uzielli|first2=Luca|last3=Mazzanti|first3=Paola|date=May-June 2017|title=Strains in gesso on painted wood panels during humidity changes and cupping|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1296207416303697|journal=Journal of Cultural Heritage|volume=25|pages=163–169|doi=10.1016/j.culher.2016.11.002|issn=1296-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a wet ground layer is applied to the surface of a wood support, the wood in contact with the layer swells while the back of the panel remains unchanged. This can contribute to cupping, in which the panel of wood starts to bow transverse to the wood grain. The increased strains on the convex side of the cupped wood panel causes further fracture in the ground layer as it dries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Craquelure during aging ===
Compared to their drying counterparts, aging cracks are sharper, deeper, and are developed over the lifetime of the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This type of craquelure is much more difficult to predict and model because it depends on the specific environmental changes and chemical aging reactions the paint is subjected to. Critical processes that contribute to aging craquelure include direct impacts, gradients in temperature and relative humidity, support deformation, restoration processes like canvas reinforcement and stretching, and oxidation reactions that make the surface chalky or more brittle. In general, the pictorial layer becomes more brittle as it ages, which makes it unable to accommodate the stresses induced by environmental factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Induced craquelure===
[[Aged artwork|Induced craquelure]] can be created by a variety of techniques, and in paintings is often used by forgers of [[Old Master]] paintings, which would normally show some.  Art forger [[Eric Hebborn]] developed a technique and [[Tony Tetro]] discovered a way to use [[formaldehyde]] and a special baking process.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Hays, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zAQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;ots=0pMAWWzTCj&amp;dq=tony%20tetro%20trial&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Being Salvador Dali"] ''[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast]]'' (July 2000). Retrieved June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Craquelure is almost impossible to accurately reproduce artificially in a particular pattern, although there are some methods such as baking or finishing of a painting by which this is attempted. These methods, however, generally achieve cracks that are uniform in appearance, while genuine craquelure has cracks with irregular patterns.&lt;ref name="homeinstitute"/&gt;

Craquelure is frequently induced by using zinc white paints as the underlayer in [[pentimento]] techniques. Zinc whites with small zinc oxide particles (~250&amp;nbsp;nm) are more successful at inducing craquelure than larger particles because it does not adhere to the sublayer.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macchia|first=Andrea|date=2015|title=White zinc in linseed oil paintings: chemical, mechanical, and aesthetic aspects|url=|journal=Periodico di Mineralogica|volume=84|pages=483–495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, zinc white paints using linoleic acid-based binders are more successful at producing craquelure than paints with other binders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Craquelure in ceramics==
[[File:425203204 640068f512 o.jpg|thumb|[[Ge ware|Ge-type]] vase, with "gold thread and iron wire" double crackle, dated by the [[Palace Museum]] [[Beijing]] to the [[Song dynasty]]]]
Craquelure affecting the glaze in ceramics may develop with age but has also been used as a deliberate decorative effect, which has a long history in [[Korean pottery|Korean]] and [[Chinese pottery]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Ward, 149"&gt;Ward, 149&lt;/ref&gt; These deliberate glazing effects are usually known as "crackle", with '''crackle[d] glaze''' or "crackle porcelain" being common terms. It is typically distinguished from [[crazing]], which is accidental craquelure arising as a [[glaze defect]], although in some cases, experts have difficulty in deciding whether milder effects are deliberate or not.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 101, 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; Some may also only have developed with age. Leading Chinese wares of the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan dynasties]] with deliberate crackle glazes are [[Guan ware]] and [[Ge ware]]; in [[Ru ware]], the milder crackle may be accidental, though the majority of pieces have it.

Ge ware can have a type of double crackle, known as "gold thread and iron wire", where there are two patterns, one with wide and large crackle and the other with a finer network. Each set of cracks has had the effect heightened by applying a coloured stain, in different colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3179984&amp;partId=1&amp;ware=31241&amp;page=1 British Museum page], PDF.94 (expand two sets of comments); Krahl, Regina: [[Oxford Art Online]], section "Guan and Ge wares" in "China, §VIII, 3: Ceramics: Historical development"&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple layers of glaze, and the wider crackle develops first, with the finer one developing inside those sections. The crackle may take some time to appear after firing and is probably mainly caused by rapid cooling&lt;ref&gt;[[Rose Kerr (art historian)|Kerr, Rose]], [[Joseph Needham|Needham, Joseph]], Wood, Nigel, ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 12, Ceramic Technology'', p. 266, 2004, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521838339}}, 9780521838337, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mabcHwmAD5oC&amp;pg=PA265 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps low [[silica]] in the glaze.

==Modern applications==
[[File:Adcrocuta eximia.jpg|thumb|Craquelure in fossilized hyena tooth]]

=== Acrylic craquelure ===
[[File:French - Pair of Jars - Walters 491860, 491861.jpg|thumb|250px|Pair of Chinese crackled glaze jars with French [[ormolu]] mounts, both 18th century]]
The modern decor industry has used the technique of craquelure to create various objects and materials such as glass, ceramics, iron. This was made possible by the use of marketing kits that react with the colors used in decorative acrylic colors. The extent of craquelure produced varies according to the percentage of reagent and time of use. To highlight the cracks, glitter powder—usually available in copper, bronze and gold—is used. Mixing different brands of ready-made products to mimic craquelure results in various sizes and patterns of cracks.&lt;ref name="homeinstitute"/&gt; Software programs are available for creating craquelure in digital photos.&lt;ref name="digicraq"/&gt;

=== Use in art authentication ===
Methods that utilize craquelure as a means of detecting art forgery have been proposed. Historical craquelure patterns are difficult to reproduce and are therefore a useful tool in authenticating art. Modern detection techniques rely on feature extraction at crack junctions and image matching to verify the authenticity of artwork with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912553886|title=Computational forensics : 5th International Workshop, IWCF 2012, Tsukuba, Japan, November 11, 2012 and 6th International Workshop, IWCF 2014, Stockholm, Sweden, August 24, 2014, Revised selected papers|others=Garain, Utpal,, Shafait, Faisal,, IWCF (Workshop) (6th : 2014 : Stockholm, Sweden)|isbn=9783319201252|location=Cham|oclc=912553886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eternity''' in [[common parlance]] is an infinitely long period of [[time]]. In [[classical philosophy]], however, eternity is defined as what exists outside time while sempiternity is the concept that corresponds to the colloquial definition of eternity. 

Eternity is an  important concept in many [[religion]]s, where the god or gods are said to endure eternally. Some, such as [[Aristotle]], would say the same about the natural [[cosmos]] in regard to both past and future eternal duration, and like the eternal [[Platonic realism|Platonic form]]s, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] was considered essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity/#Ety |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Eternity |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Philosophy of space and time}}
[[Aristotle]] [[arguments for eternity|argued]] that the [[cosmos]] has no beginning. In Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], eternity is the [[unmoved mover]] (God), understood as the [[gradient]] of [[Minimum total potential energy principle|total synergy]] ("produces motion by being loved").&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Jiyuan [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pRlUoAbmIC&amp;pg=PA188 The Structure of Being in Aristotle’s Metaphysics] Springer, 2003, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boethius]] defined eternity as "simultaneously full and perfect possession of interminable life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boedder|first1=Bernard|title=Natural Theology|url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/nath34.htm|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=March 15, 2015|quote=Aeternitas est interminablis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Eternity is often symbolized by the image of a snake swallowing its own tail, known as the [[Ouroboros]] (or Uroboros). The circle is also commonly used as a symbol for eternity, as is the mathematical symbol of infinity, &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. {{cn|date=March 2015}}   Symbolically, it suggests that Eternity has no beginning or end.

The '''Feast of the Gods''' or '''Banquet of the Gods''' as a subject in art showing a group of deities at table has a long history going back into [[Ancient history|antiquity]].  Showing [[Ancient Greek religion|Greco-Roman deities]], it enjoyed a revival in popularity in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and then in the [[Low Countries]] during the 16th century, when it was popular with [[Northern Mannerist]] painters, at least partly as an opportunity to show copious amounts of nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 342–343; Woolett, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the occasion shown was specifically either the wedding of [[Cupid and Psyche]] or that of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], but other works show other occasions, especially the ''Feast of Bacchus'', or a generalized feast. While the wedding of Cupid and Psyche is just the happy ending of Psyche's story, the wedding of Peleus and Thetis is part of the grand narrative of Greek mythology.  The feast was interrupted by [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, who threw the golden [[Apple of Discord]] inscribed "for the most beautiful" into the company, provoking the argument that led to the [[Judgement of Paris]], and ultimately to the [[Trojan War]].  Eris is sometimes shown in the air with the apple, or the apple with the diners, and sometimes the feast forms a background scene to a painting of the Judgement, or ''vice versa''.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 343&lt;/ref&gt;  This wedding was also used as a political symbol around the time of the marriage of the Dutch leader [[William the Silent]] to [[Charlotte of Bourbon]] in 1575.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 343, citing P. Grootkerk's PhD, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, despite Thetis being a sea-nymph, depictions of her wedding have the same inland setting as other scenes. A depiction by [[Hans Rottenhammer]] (1600, [[Hermitage Museum]]) probably of the wedding of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Amphitrite]] is set in a beach-side pavilion, with the sea full of an unruly crowd of marine mythological creatures.  The ''Feast of [[Achelous]]'' is derived from [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', who describes  how [[Theseus]] is entertained by the river god in a damp grotto, while waiting for the river's raging flood to subside: "He entered the dark building, made of spongy pumice, and rough tuff. The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VIII, 547ff&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject was painted a number of times, with Rubens producing an early version with [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]],&lt;ref&gt;Woollett, 60-63&lt;/ref&gt; and a later picture attributed to his "school", and Hendrick van Balen collaborating with [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]]. All show much smaller and more decorously behaved groups than the wedding parties.

==Italian Renaissance== 
[[File:Feastofthegods.jpg|thumb|''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]] and Titian (1514–29), also with [[Priapus]] and [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]], also bottom right]]

One of the earliest depictions is a ''[[cassone]]'' panel  by [[Bartolomeo di Giovanni]] from the 1490s (Louvre, ''illustrated''); this is paired with a panel of the ''Procession of Thetis'', another common way of depicting a wedding; artists were unsure what form an actual Olympian wedding ceremony might have taken.  A more sophisticated but similar depiction of a rustic picnic eaten on the ground, is ''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'' by [[Giovanni Bellini]] (1514), later changed by [[Titian]] (to 1529), a large and important painting; both show the story of [[Priapus]] and [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]].&lt;ref name="Bull"&gt;Bull, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major [[fresco]]s from the end of the [[High Renaissance]] showed the wedding banquet of Cupid and Psyche: [[Raphael]]'s central panel in the "[[Loggia]] of Psyche" at the [[Villa Farnesina]] in Rome, and [[Giulio Romano]]'s wall panel in the [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]].  Both of these became very well-known through [[old master print|print versions]], often freely adapting the compositions, and inspired a wide range of versions in drawings and media of the decorative arts such as [[Maiolica|majolica]], painted [[Limoges enamel]] and [[pastiglia]].  Giulio's version seems to show the preparations rather than the feast itself, and only a few of the invited gods have so far arrived. But it is highly atmospheric and its dispersal of the figures across a large setting was to recur in many later depictions.&lt;ref name="Bull" /&gt;  Both frescos showed a good proportion of the participants nude, or almost so, reflecting the practice of recent decades in mythological paintings. The ''[[Pastoral Concert|Fête champêtre]]'' of [[Titian]] (or [[Giorgione]]) may represent a mythological subject, if not a feast then at least a picnic of the gods.

Around the mid-century [[Taddeo Zuccari]] did the ''Wedding of Bacchus and Ariadne'' in fresco in the [[Villa Giulia]], Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 105&lt;/ref&gt; and in northern Europe [[Francesco Primaticcio]] painted that of Peleus and Thetis in a mythological series in the ballroom of the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/340554 Drawing of ''Apple of Discord Thrown by Eris at the Marriage of Peleus and Thetis'']: Study for Fresco in the Hall of Henri II at Fountainebleau, Francesco Primaticcio, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frans Floris]] painted a monumental feast in oil (c. 1550, [[Antwerp]]),&lt;ref&gt;Woolett, 60&lt;/ref&gt; nearly two metres across, as well as a ''Feast of the Seagods'' (1561, [[Stockholm]]).

==Northern Mannerism==

The revival of interest in the subject some decades later in [[Northern Mannerism]] seems to spring from a large [[engraving]] of 1587 by [[Hendrik Goltzius]] in [[Haarlem]] of a drawing by [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] (now [[Rijksmuseum]]) that [[Karel van Mander]] had brought back from [[Prague]], where Spranger was court painter to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]].  ''The Feast of the Gods at the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche'' was so large, at 16 7/8 &amp;times; 33 5/8 in. (43 &amp;times; 85.4&amp;nbsp;cm), that it was printed from three different plates. Over 80 figures are shown, placed up in the clouds over a [[world landscape]] that can be glimpsed below.  The composition borrows from both Raphael and Giulio Romano's versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2000.113 The engraving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art]; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1477730&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=1852,1211.63&amp;page=1 at the British Museum, in sections]; Bull, 342–343&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next thirty years or so a number of Netherlandish artists painted the subject, usually in small [[cabinet painting]]s, often on copper, although ''The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis'' by [[Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem]] was enormous at over four metres wide, a commission in 1593 from the [[Stadtholder]] [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]] for his palace, and [[Jacob Jordaens]]' ''The Golden Apple of Discord'' (1633, from an [[oil sketch]] by [[Rubens]]) is also a monumental treatment.  Painters who returned to the subject several times include in particular [[Hendrick van Balen]], who was known above all for these subjects, and also [[Joachim Wtewael]], Cornelis van Haarlem, [[Cornelis van Poelenburch]], and [[Abraham Bloemaert]].&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 342–343; Slive, 13–14; Vlieghe, 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the same period these same painters, later followed by Rubens, produced many depictions of ''[[Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus]]'' ("Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes", meaning that love needs food and wine to thrive), a proverb derived from the [[emblem book]]s, which showed just [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Bacchus]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Cupid]] picnicking on the ground in most early versions, or seated at a table in some later ones.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the concentration of images by the [[Haarlem Mannerists]] reflects the patronage of the powerful brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Both the weddings of Cupid and Psyche and that of Peleus and Thetis were common subjects in antiquity, going back to Greek [[black-figure vase painting]].  The latter was perhaps shown in the Roman [[cameo glass]] [[Portland Vase]].  However such depictions rarely show the wedding feast, preferring the ceremony or processions to it.

The earlier paintings may owe something to entertainments ''alla antica'' such as those of the Compagnia della Cassuola ("Company of the Shovel") mentioned by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], where a social confraternity in [[Florence]] including artists such as [[Giovanni Francesco Rustici]] and [[Andrea del Sarto]] held elaborate dinners which might include the attendees dressing as classical gods and re-enacting episodes from mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, 33&lt;/ref&gt;  Raphael and Giulio's frescos decorated spaces used for lavish entertaining that might bear comparison with Olympian hospitality; the previous century [[Marsilio Ficino]] had written a thank-you letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] that made just that comparison.&lt;ref name="Bull" /&gt;

The later paintings can also be seen in the context of the wider interest in "company scenes" of social occasions in Netherlandish art at the start of the 17th century, expressed in the new genre subject of the [[merry company]], and its "gallant" and "elegant" variations,&lt;ref&gt;Liedke, 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the continuation of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]'s scenes of peasant life by his son [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan]] and others.  The feasts formed a division of the class of small-scale mythological paintings, in which the interest of the figures is very often shared with landscape or [[still life]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 105–106, and ''passim'' for the rest of chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these figure in many feasts, but the emphasis is on a generous range of nude figures, displaying a variety of complicated poses that display the artist's virtuosity.&lt;ref&gt;Woollett, 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Small groups of non-divine revellers in similar [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] landscape settings are called [[bacchanal]]s, and are even more common in art.  Other subjects that were popular at the same period showed the entertainment of classical gods by humans, in the story of [[Baucis and Philemon]] and other tales. ''[[The Triumph of Bacchus]]'' (''Los Baracchos'', 1628) by [[Diego Velázquez]], in the [[Museo del Prado]], is a famous example of the subject of Bacchus drinking with humans.

==Later works==
The [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace at Potsdam]] in [[Berlin]] has a ceiling painting in the Marmorsaal ("Marble Hall") depicting the ''Feast of the Gods on Olympus'' (1769) by the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical painter]] [[Amédée van Loo]]. [[Romanticism|Romantic Nationalism]] extended the range of gods that might be depicted to the [[Norse gods]].  In 1863 the [[Peredvizhniki]] ("Wanderers") group of progressive artists was founded after several left the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in disgust after the subject set for the annual Gold Medal contest (the Russian equivalent of the ''[[Prix de Rome]]'') was "The Feast of [[Odin]] in [[Valhalla]]", which they thought both un-Russian and of no social relevance.&lt;ref&gt;"Wanderers" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'', Ed. Ian Chilvers, 2004, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0198604769}}, 9780198604761, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WYaRX58a0_IC&amp;pg=PA747 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later painting, particularly in England, sometimes depicted [[fairy]] scenes of a somewhat similar types, such as ''[[The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania]]'' (1849) and its matching ''Reconciliation'', by Sir [[Joseph Noel Paton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5481">'''Figure and ground''' is a concept drawn from [[Gestalt psychology]] by [[media studies|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] in the early 1970s. This concept underpins the meaning of his famous phrase, "[[The medium is the message]]". The concept was an approach to what was called "perceptual organization." He began to use the terms figure and ground as a way "to describe the parts of a situation&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cios.org/encyclopedia/mcluhan/probe/fg/probe_fg.html|title=CIOS/McLuhan Site: Probe: Figure &amp; Ground|website=www.cios.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;" and "to help explain his ideas about media and human communication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" The concept was later employed to explain how a communications technology, the medium or ''figure'', necessarily operates through its context, or ''ground''.

To McLuhan, "‘figure’ refers to something that jumps out at us, something that grabs our attention, [whereas] ‘ground’ refers to something that supports or contextualizes a situation and is usually an area of unattention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" When we first experience a new image or sensation, there are certain aspects of the object that grab our attention and engage us and certain aspects that we unintentionally ignore. We should not focus on just the "figure" or the "ground" though, as McLuhan believed that both were equally as important to understanding the full meaning of the situation. "This distinction between that which is perceived and that which is blocked out in order to focus perception is central for McLuhan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://felix.openflows.com/html/mcluhan_latour.html|title=Felix Stalder: McLuhan and Latour|website=felix.openflows.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

McLuhan used different words to describe the figure/ground relationship, sometimes using content for figure and environment or, more often, medium for ground.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"McLuhan looked at media through a figure/ground relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" To him, people tended to focus on only specific parts of the media, and disregard other parts. "To examine the total effect of any medium, McLuhan pointed out that we need to look at both figure AND ground, and their relationship to one another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" He believed that "only focusing on the ‘content’ of the media was like looking at figures without examining their ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" "The ground, or environment, is not a passive container, but active processes that influence the relationships between all of the elements in it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;"

McLuhan believed that to fully grasp the impact of a new technology in regard to figure (medium) and ground (context),&lt;ref name="LAC"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/innis-mcluhan/ Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt; one must understand that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Neither piece is definitive without the other. His ''[[Understanding Media]]'' explores different grounds as they are structured by different media including print, radio, and television.

[[Al Held]], a well-known artist, exemplifies this idea in one of his paintings. The work is called The Big N and it "provides us with an introduction to the concepts of figure and ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" Looking at a glance, you might draw your attention to the black triangles. "Once you were given the name of the painting, however, the frame became linked to the figures, and an 'N' suddenly appeared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" In understanding the work, it is important to look at the bigger picture. Al Held’s painting is well-known for its display of framing, or context, and its importance to the meaning of the overall situation. If either the frame or the painting itself were to change, the interpretation of the work might shift. Pertaining to media, we must look at both the figure and the ground to "understand [its] effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;" The ground which media creates gives a context for human communication, and thus "directs human action in unique and important ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;"

McLuhan argued that we must study media in their historical context, particularly in relation to those technologies that preceded them. The present environment, itself made up of the effects of previous technologies, gives rise to new technologies, which, in turn, further shapes societies and individuals.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Furthermore, all technologies have embedded within them their own assumptions about [[Time- and space-bias|time and space]]. Again, the message conveyed by the medium can only be understood if the medium is concurrently analyzed with the environment in which it is used — and which, simultaneously, it effectively creates. McLuhan believed that an examination of the figure-ground relationship can offer a critical commentary on culture and society.&lt;ref name="LAC" /&gt;

Alternately, the idea of "figure" can also refer to content of a particular medium, while "ground" refers to the medium itself. McLuhan's aphorism "[[The medium is the message]]" can thus be read as an attempt to draw attention away from a preoccupation with the figure/message to a consideration of the importance of the ground/medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7689">'''François Thibaut''' (born January 3, 1948) is an educator known for developing the ''Thibaut Technique'' [[second language acquisition]] method for children and is the Founder/Director of ''The Language Workshop for Children'' (“LWFC”)He currently operates nationwide educational centers based in New York City.&lt;ref name="talklikeny"&gt;{{cite web| title = To Talk Like New York, Sign Up for Spanish| author = Qjito, Mirta | publisher = [[The New York Times]]| date = 1999-10-18|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1DA1739F93BA25753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=francois%20thibaut&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thibaut’s technique is the basis of the curriculum offered at LWFC programs and in the [[Professor Toto]] children’s language education animation. The LWFC begins teaching languages to children at the age of six months, when they’re preverbal.&lt;ref name="blngualbaby"/&gt;[[Image:Thibaut.jpg|frame|right|Francois Thibaut at the Language Workshop For Children]]

==Childhood Observations, The Basis of the Thibaut Technique==
At the age of six Thibaut was enrolled at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe|College Saint Barbe boarding school in Paris]] where teachers intentionally made little to no effort to translate or explain the meaning of the French language curriculum in which newly arriving, non-French speaking students found themselves immersed. Instead, after six weeks of absorbing French in a context-rich language immersion classroom, the non-French elementary age children would begin speaking French in single words. Then by week eight they were speaking in two, and then three word sentences.  Eventually, by 2½ months they were constructing complete, accent-free French sentences, correctly attributing noun genders, and using past, present, and future tenses.  Years later Thibaut realized that he’d observed a strong example of what neurolinguist [[Eric Lenneberg]] later identified in his book Biological Foundations of Language (1967) what he termed the [[critical period]] in language development. Thibaut’s childhood observations eventually led him to bring immersive, emotionally stimulating, context-rich, language classes founding his Cercle Franco Americain (later Language Workshop for Children) classes in New York, NY in the early 1970s. Thus, the Thibaut Technique was introduced into American culture.&lt;ref name="blngualbaby"&gt;{{cite web| title = Bilingual Babies, A Sign of the Times| author = Sreenivasan, Hari | publisher = [[Nightline (US news program)|ABC Nightline]]| date = 2007-01-30|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E1DA1739F93BA25753C1A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=francois%20thibaut&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superbaby"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Super Baby Burnout Syndrome| author = Elder, Janet | publisher = [[The New York Times]]| date = 1980-01-08|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D71539F93BA35752C0A96F948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach has often been attributed to baby language enrichment products first introduced for VCR’s in the mid-1990s. While many of these brands have had more national exposure, Thibaut’s technique was in existence for more than 20 years prior to their debut.

==Early Teaching Experience==
Thibaut emigrated to [[New York City]]  in 1973, when foreign language instruction was strongly focused on high school and college students. As a teacher he was frustrated by watching his college-age students continually struggle the same drill and translation-based French so he began focusing on younger learners, abandoned translation-drills, and adopted the context-rich, language acquisition devices that he observed at his own elementary school in the 1950s, adding his own brand of playfulness, color, and humor.

==The Language Workshop for Children==
Since 1973, his internationally recognized Language Workshop for Children has offered stimulating language lessons for babies, toddlers and elementary grades. Original music, vocabulary-building songs, language immersion, festive visual aids, action games and native-fluent language teachers are why the LWFC is the country’s leader in children’s language educational play. As Thibaut says, “Children remember the words that make them happy”.

==The French Language Salon==
In 2011, Thibaut drew on his successful technique with children by offering friendly, situationally relevant classes through his French Language Salon® classes for adults. Thibaut’s new adult method immediately integrates grammar and conversation, rather than teaching them as separate disciplines. Thibaut’s former child students often attend his adult classes to practice French for social and professional purposes. Thibaut also designed a test preparation program for students of varying levels who are working to pass in exams focused on French as a second language and comply with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]].

Thibaut specializes in different types of test preparation that merge his original French teaching style with patterns that correlating to the pertaining exam (SAT, AP French, CEFRL, and Canadian TEF.)  He combines his French education experience with an understanding of the exams and their tendencies, inspired by the, “life-hack,” movement and applied to a more academic and professional sphere.

==Technology==
With the growth of technology at the turn of the new century, Thibaut expanded his outreach platforms beyond the classroom by producing his [[Professor Toto]] Language Education Series for children, available in original CD/DVD and downloadable formats through Amazon, as well as making his language lessons and test prep services available via Skype.

'''Geo-replication''' systems are designed to improve the distribution of data across geographically distributed [[Computer networking|data networks]]. This is intended to improve the response time for applications such as [[web portal]]s. Geo-replication can be achieved using software, hardware or a combination of the two. 

== Software ==
Geo-replication software is a [[network performance]]-enhancing technology that is designed to provide improved access to portal or [[intranet]] content for uses at the most remote parts of large organizations. It is based on the principle of storing complete replicas of portal content on local servers, and then keeping the content on those servers up-to-date using heavily compressed data updates.

=== Portal acceleration ===
Geo-replication technologies are used to provide replication of the content of portals, intranets, web applications, content and data between servers, across wide area networks [[Wide area network|WAN]] to allow users at remote sites to access central content at [[Local area network|LAN]] speeds. 

Geo-replication software can improve the performance of data networks that suffer limited [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and periodic disconnection. [[Terabyte]]s of data can be replicated over a [[wide area network]], giving remote sites faster access to web applications.

Geo-replication software uses a combination of [[data compression]] and content [[web cache|caching]] technologies. [[Delta encoding|differencing]] technologies can also be employed to reduce the volume of data that has to be transmitted to keep portal content accurate across all servers. This update compression can reduce the load that portal traffic place on networks, and improve the response time of a portal.

=== Portal replication ===
Remote users of web portals and collaboration environments will frequently experience network bandwidth and latency problems which will slow down their experience of opening and closing files, and otherwise interacting with the portal. Geo-replication technology is deployed to accelerate the remote end user portal performance to be equivalent to that experienced by users locally accessing the portal in the central office.

=== Differencing engine technologies ===
To deliver this reduction in the size of the required data updates across a portal, geo-replication systems often use differencing engine technologies. These systems are able to difference the content of each portal server right down to the byte level. This knowledge of the content that is already on each server enables the system to rebuild any changes to the content on one server, across each of the other servers in the deployment from content already hosted on those other servers. This type of differencing system ensures that no content, at the byte level, is ever sent to a server twice.

=== Offline portal replication on laptops === 
Geo-replication systems are often extended to deliver local replication beyond the server and down to the laptop used by a single user. Server to laptop replication enables mobile users to have access to a local replica of their business portal on a standard laptop. This technology may be employed to provide in the field access to portal content by, for example, sales forces and combat forces.

The '''Gromov Flight Research Institute''' or '''GFRI''' for short ({{lang-ru|link=no|Лётно-исследовательский институт имени М.&amp;nbsp;М.&amp;nbsp;Громова}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|ЛИИ}}) is an important Russian State Research Center which operates aircraft test base located in [[Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast|Zhukovsky]], 40&amp;nbsp;km south-east of Moscow. The airfield is also known as [[Ramenskoye, Moscow Oblast|Ramenskoye]] air base.

It has [[List of longest runways|world's second longest public-use runway]], at {{convert|5402|m|abbr=on}} with concrete surfacing covers the area of 2.5&amp;nbsp;million square meters. 
The airfield was used as the backup landing site for the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Shuttle Buran]] test program and also as a test base for a Buran's [[aerodynamic]] [[prototype]]s. (See [[OK-GLI]])

GFRI periodically hosts the [[MAKS (air show)|MAKS]] event, the International Air Show (Aviasalon).&lt;!-- The next ([[MAKS Airshow|MAKS]] 2019) is scheduled to take place also in Zhukovsky.--&gt;

At present, GFRI is also hosted [[Zhukovsky International Airport]].

== History ==
The Flight Research Institute was founded on March 8, 1941, in accordance with the decree of [[Sovnarkom]] and the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. [[Mikhail Gromov (aviator)|Mikhail Gromov]], a [[test pilot]], [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], became its first chief. From the very beginning the Institute participated in development and testing of aircraft and airborne systems, conducted flight research in order to pave the way to further scientific activities.

The first years of the Institute's existence fell on the [[Great Patriotic War|war times]]. During the war experts of the institute kept developing recommendations to eliminate defects in flight qualities and war-fighting capabilities of the aircraft, flight testing of the aircraft prototypes, studied the foreign aircraft and equipment, both purchased and taken as trophies.

=== Cold War ===
Zhukovsky airfield was the Soviet Union's equivalent to the US Edwards AFB and as such many types of aircraft underwent evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;https://thelexicans.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/western-aircraft-in-the-ussr/&lt;/ref&gt;

Here some western aircraft were tested or analyzed. it’s unknown if any flight evaluations were made by the USSR. Google Earth look around for the Ramenskoye Airport shows an F-4 parked there.
* Wrecks from F-111s shot down over North Vietnam were sent to Zhukovskiy to be analyzed.
* Pieces of US planes shot down in North Vietnam and their captured electronic countermeasures equipment were taken for evaluation (F-111, A-6, A-7, B-52, F-4, F105, etc.).
* Captured VNAF helicopters are believed to have been tested (UH-1H, CH-47).

=== Perestroika times ===

Due to financial problems in the 1990s ([[perestroika]] times), tourist fighter flights in former secret jets became available, mainly for wealthy western tourists. The security check was comparable to the Russian visa. On offer for flights was the [[Aero L-39 Albatros]] jet trainer, the Soviet-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] for stratosphere "Edge of Space"-flights, the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29|MiG-29]] Fulcrum and even the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] Flanker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migflug.com Sukhoi Su-27 Flight, Zhukovsky Airbase]&lt;/ref&gt; From June 2006, flights stopped on Zhukovsky. Today, flights in the [[Aero L-39 Albatros]] are available with the famous [[Aerobatic]] Team Wjasma Rus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vyazmarus.com Vyazma Rus Display Team] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202194808/http://vyazmarus.com/ |date=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29|MiG-29]] Fulcrum flights are available in Nizhniy Novgorod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migflug.com/en/jet-fighter-flights/flying-with-a-jet/mig-29-fulcrum-in-russia.html MiG-29 in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sukhoi Su-27P in 1995.jpg|thumb|250px|Modified [[Sukhoi Su-27]]P aeroplane (1995)]]

The airline was established by the institute in 1995 as a wholly owned commercial subsidiary and named Gromov Air (later [[Moskovia Airlines]]).

The '''Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict''' is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses exclusively on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of September 2018, it has been ratified by 133 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions of the 1954 Convention were supplemented and clarified by two protocols concluded in 1954 and 1999. All three agreements are part of International Humanitarian Law, which, in the form of further agreements, primarily includes provisions defining the permissible means and methods of warfare and aiming at the widest possible protection of persons not involved in the fighting. In contrast to these parts of International Humanitarian Law, the agreements on the protection of cultural property were drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations (UN); the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is primarily responsible for the dissemination and monitoring of compliance. In addition to rules designed to ensure the protection and respect of cultural property during an armed conflict, these agreements also provide for security measures to be implemented in times of peace. As of June 2018, 132 states are party to the Hague Convention of 1954, 109 and 77 states respectively have acceded to the Protocols of 1954 and 1999. Blue Shield International, based in The Hague, is active in the field of international coordination with regard to military and civil structures for the protection of cultural assets.

The guiding principles of the Convention and the motivation for its conclusion, dissemination and respect are summarised in the preamble, which states, among other things,

"... that any damage to cultural property, irrespective of the people it belongs to, is a damage to the cultural heritage    of all humanity, because every people contributes to the world's culture..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-hague-convention/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural property==
For the purposes of the present Convention, the term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:

(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;

(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a);

(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural property]] is the manifestation and expression of the cultural heritage of a group of people or a society. It is an expression of the ways of living developed by a community and passed on from generation to generation, including the customs of a people, their practices, places, objects, artistic endeavours and values. The protection of cultural property during times of armed conflict or occupation is of great importance, because such property reflects the life, history and identity of communities; its preservation helps to rebuild communities, re-establish identities, and link people's past with their present and future.

== History ==
The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] preceded the Hague Convention of 1954.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The laws of armed conflicts : a collection of conventions, resolutions, and other documents |date=1988 |publisher=Nijhoff |last=Schindler |first=Dietrich |last2=Toman |first2=Jiří |isbn=9024733065 |edition=3rd |location=Dordrecht |oclc=13270517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multilateral agreement of 1899 and the slightly amended later version of 1907 contained in Article 27 the commandment for the attacking party to spare historical monuments, educational institutions and institutions of religious, not-for-profit, artistic or scientific significance as far as possible during sieges and bombardments. The party under attacked is called upon to ark appropriate buildings. Article 56 also contained a general ban on the confiscation, destruction or damage of such facilities. However, during the [[First World War]], acceptance of these first Hague Conventions was severely restricted by the so-called all-participation clause. It stated that, in the event of war or armed conflict, this Agreement should apply only if all States involved in that conflict are parties to the Convention.

The Russian lawyer, painter and writer [[Nicholas Roerich]], who witnessed the destruction of cultural assets in Russia during the First World War and the [[October Revolution]], initiated the development of an independent treaty at the beginning of the 1930s to protect cultural assets during armed conflicts. Ten years later, just before the beginning of the First World War, he had also addressed his idea to the Russian Tsar Nicholas II. On his initiative, Georges Chklaver of the Institute for Higher International Studies at the University of Paris drew up a corresponding draft in 1929. This proposal was subsequently discussed by the International Museum Office of the [[League of Nations]] and at private conferences in Bruges in 1931 and 1932 and in Washington, D.C. in 1933. The seventh international conference of American states, which took place in Buenos Aires in 1933, recommended the adoption of the draft. The Board of the Pan-American Union subsequently presented a treaty "on the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments", which was signed on 15 April 1935 in the White House by 21 states in North, Central and South America.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; Ten of the signatory states also became parties by ratification, the first of which was the United States on 13 July 1935 and the last of which was Colombia on 20 February 1937. The agreement, also known as the [[Roerich Pact]] after its initiator, entered into force on 26 August 1935.

The Roerich Pact contained eight articles and several significant innovations compared with the general provisions of Articles 27 and 56 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. On the one hand, the treaty established the status of neutrality for historical monuments, museums, scientific and artistic institutions as well as educational and cultural institutions. This legal position, comparable to the neutrality of medical personnel and comparable institutions during a war, resulted in respect for these goods by all parties involved in a conflict and thus their protection. The Parties should send lists of monuments and sites for which they claimed protection under the Treaty to the Pan-American Union, which should forward them to all States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Roerich Pact|date=2018-05-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roerich_Pact&amp;oldid=840203974|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Banner of Peace from the Roerich Pact.svg|thumb|120x120px|The Banner of Peace- The Emblem of Protection of the Roerich Pact]]
In addition, the Treaty defined a protection mark for the marking of cultural objects, consisting of three red dots in a red circle on a white background. Nicholas Roerich, who designed it with early symbolism in mind, described the significance of the three points as a symbol of art, science and religion as the three most important cultural activities of humanity, with the circle as the element that linked these three aspects in the past, present and future. The symbol was also called the "Banner of Peace", the movement based on the Roerich Pact under the name Pax Cultura in analogy to the [[Geneva Conventions]] as the "Red Cross of Culture".

However, the acceptance of the Roerich Pact was limited to the United States and the countries of Central and South America. Not a single country in Europe and Asia, the geopolitical focus of the Second World War that began a few years later, signed or ratified the treaty. Even though it remains valid in relations between the parties and the Organization of American States (OAS) and continues to act as a depositary in succession to the Pan-American Union, the Roerich Pact remained without significant practical relevance. As the USA is not party to the 1999 Second Protocol of the Hague Convention, the Roerich Pact is therefore still of importance as a contractual obligation in the area of cultural property protection. Nevertheless, with the establishment of a protective label and the administration of lists of cultural assets worthy of protection by a central international institution, this treaty introduced two important far-reaching principles in the area of the protection of cultural assets in armed conflicts that remain important today.

Only four years after the Roerich Pact was signed, the government of the Netherlands presented a draft for a new convention, in the drafting of which the International Museum Office of the League of Nations was also significantly involved. However, the start of the [[Second World War]] in the same year prevented all further steps to develop and implement this proposal. After the end of the war, in 1948 the Netherlands again submitted a proposal to UNESCO, which had been founded three years earlier. In 1951, the General Conference of UNESCO decided to set up a committee of governmental experts to draft a new convention. A year later, this committee submitted a draft to the General Conference, which forwarded it to the national governments for further discussion. From 21 April to 14 May 1954, an international conference was held in The Hague with the participation of 56 states, which drew up a final version and adopted it as the "Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict".&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; The agreement entered into force on 7 August 1956. After the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, this was the second important agreement in the field of international humanitarian law to which the United Nations played a major role in its creation and implementation.

== The Hague Convention==
The Hague Convention outlines various prohibitions and obligations which States Parties are expected to observe, both in peacetime and in times of conflict.

Broadly, the Hague Convention requires that States Parties adopt protection measures during peacetime for the safeguarding of cultural property. Such measures include the preparation of inventories, preparation for the removal of movable cultural property and the designation of competent authorities responsible for the safeguarding of cultural property.

States Parties undertake to respect cultural property, not only located within their own territory, but also within the territory of other States Parties, during times of conflict and occupation. In doing so, they agree to refrain from using cultural property and its immediate surroundings for purposes likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict. States Parties also agree to refrain from any act of hostility directed against such property.

The Convention also requires the establishment of special units within national military forces, to be charged with responsibility for the protection of cultural property. Furthermore, States Parties are required to implement criminal sanctions for breaches of the Convention, and to undertake promotion of the Convention to the general public, cultural heritage professionals, the military and law-enforcement agencies.

An example of the successful implementation of the Hague Convention was the Gulf War, in which many members of the coalition forces (who were either party to the Convention or who, in the instance of the US, were not party to the Convention) accepted the Convention's rules, most notably by creating a "no-fire target list" of places where cultural property was known to exist.

===Safeguarding cultural property===
The obligation of States Parties to safeguard cultural property in peacetime is outlined in Article 3. It stipulates:

'The High Contracting Parties undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict, by taking such measures, as they consider appropriate.'&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respect for cultural property===
The Hague Convention sets out a minimum level of respect which all States Parties must observe, both in relation to their own national heritage as well as the heritage of other States Parties. States are obliged not to attack cultural property, nor to remove or misappropriate movable property from its territory of origin. Only exceptional cases of 'military necessity' will excuse derogation from this obligation. However, a State Party is not entitled to ignore the Convention's rules by reason of another Party's failure to implement safeguarding measures alone.

This is set out in Article 4 of the Hague Convention:

'Article 4:

(1) The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect cultural property situated within their own territory as well as within the territory of other High Contracting Parties by refraining from any use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility directed against such property.

(2) The obligations mentioned in paragraph I of the present Article may be waived only in cases where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.

(3) The High Contracting Parties further undertake to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property. They shall, refrain from requisitioning movable cultural property situated in the territory of another High Contracting Party.

(4) They shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.

(5) No High Contracting Party may evade the obligations incumbent upon it under the present Article, in respect of another High Contracting Party, by reason of the fact that the latter has not applied the measures of safeguard referred to in Article 3.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
The rules set out in the Hague Convention also apply to States who are Occupying Powers of territory during conflict or otherwise. The Convention obliges Occupying Powers to respect the cultural property of the occupied territory, and to support local national authorities in its preservation and repair when necessary. This obligation is articulated in Article 5:

'Article 5:

(1) Any High Contracting Party in occupation of the whole or part of the territory of another High Contracting Party shall as far as possible support the competent national authorities of the occupied country in safeguarding and preserving its cultural property.

(2) Should it prove necessary to take measures to preserve cultural property situated in occupied territory and damaged by military operations, and should the competent national authorities be unable to take such measures, the Occupying Power shall, as far as possible, and in close co-operation with such authorities, take the most necessary measures of preservation.

(3) Any High Contracting Party whose government is considered their legitimate government by members of a resistance movement, shall, if possible, draw their attention to the obligation to comply with those provisions of the Conventions dealing with respect for cultural property.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Special protection ===
The Hague Convention establishes a 'special protection' regime, which obliges States Parties to ensure the immunity of cultural property under special protection from acts of hostility (Articles 8 and 9).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Under Article 8, this protection may be granted to one of three categories of cultural property: (1) refuges intended to shelter movable cultural property in the event of armed conflict; (2) centers containing monuments; and (3) other immovable cultural property of very great importance. To receive special protection, cultural property must also be located an adequate distance from an industrial center or location which would render it vulnerable to attack, and must not be used for military purposes.

== First Protocol to the Hague Convention ==
The First Protocol was adopted at the same time as the Hague Convention, on 14 May 1954. It specifically applies to movable cultural property only, and prohibits the export of movable property from occupied territory and also requires its return to its original territory at the conclusion of hostilities (Article 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15391&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; States Parties under the obligation to prevent the export of such property may be required to pay an indemnity to States whose property was removed during hostilities.

==Second Protocol to the Hague Convention==
{{anchor|Second Protocol to the Hague Convention}}
Criminal acts committed against cultural property in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s highlighted the deficiencies in the implementation of the Hague Convention and its First Protocol. As a result of the 'Boylan review' (a review of the Convention led by Professor Patrick Boylan),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001001/100159eo.pdf|title=Review of the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in Armed Conflict|last=Boylan|first=Patrick J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention was adopted at a Diplomatic Conference held at The Hague in March 1999. The Second Protocol seeks complement and expand upon the provisions of the Hague Convention, by including developments in international humanitarian law and cultural property protection which had emerged since 1954. It builds on the provisions contained in the Convention relating to the safeguarding of and respect for cultural property, as well as the conduct of hostilities; thereby providing greater protection for cultural property than that conferred by the Hague Convention and its First Protocol.

===Enhanced protection===
[[File:Azerbaijan Gobustan site - EP sign.jpg|thumb|The enhanced protection emblem displayed at the Gobustan Archaeological site in Azerbaijan.]]
One of the most important features of the Second Protocol is the 'enhanced protection' regime it establishes. This new category of cultural property is outlined in Chapter Three of the Second Protocol. Enhanced protection status means that the relevant cultural property must remain immune from military attack, once it is inscribed on the List of Cultural Property Under Enhanced Protection.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/enhanced-protection/|title=Enhanced Protection {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1954 Hague Convention requires States not to make any cultural property the object of attack except for cases of 'military necessity', the Second Protocol stipulates that cultural property under enhanced protection must not be made a military target, even if it has (by its use) become a 'military objective'. An attack against cultural property which enjoys enhanced protection status is only excusable if such an attack is the 'only feasible means of terminating the use of property [in that way]' (Article 13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be granted enhanced protection, the cultural property in question must satisfy the three criteria stipulated in Article 10 of the Second Protocol. The three conditions are:

(a) it  is cultural heritage of the greatest importance for humanity;

(b) it is protected by adequate domestic legal and administrative measures recognising its exceptional cultural and historic value and ensuring the highest level of protection; and

(c) it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites and a declaration has been made by the Party which has control over the cultural property, confirming that it will not be so used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are 13 cultural properties from 8 States Parties inscribed on the Enhanced Protection List. These include sites in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cambodia, Cyprus, Georgia, Italy, Lithuania, and Mali.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt;

===The Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 24 of the Second Protocol establishes a 12-member Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its members are elected for a term of four years, and an equitable geographic representation is taken into account at the election of its members. The Committee meets once a year in ordinary session, and in extraordinary sessions if and when it deems necessary.

The Committee is responsible for the granting, suspension and cancellation of enhanced protection to cultural properties nominated by States Parties. It also receives and considers requests for international assistance which are submitted by States, as well as determining the use of the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Under Article 27 of the Second Protocol, the Committee also has a mandate to develop Guidelines for the implementation of the Second Protocol.

===The Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 29 of the Second Protocol establishes the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its purpose is to provide financial or other assistance for 'preparatory or other measures to be taken in peacetime'. It also provides financial or other assistance in relation to 'emergency, provisional or other measures to protect cultural property during periods of armed conflict', or for recovery at the end of hostilities. The Fund consists of voluntary contributions from States Parties to the Second Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/fund/|title=Fund {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the sums of US $50,000 and US $40,000 were provided to Libya and Mali respectively from the Fund, in response to their requests for assistance in the installation of emergency and safeguarding measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/international-assistance/|title=International Assistance {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions and individual criminal responsibility===
Chapter Four of the Second Protocol specifies sanctions to be imposed for serious violations against cultural property, and defines the conditions in which individual criminal responsibility should apply. This reflects an increased effort to fight impunity through effective criminal prosecution since the adoption of the Hague Convention in 1954. The Second Protocol defines five 'serious violations' for which it establishes individual criminal responsibility (Article 15):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# making cultural property under enhanced protection the object of attack; 
# using cultural property under enhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in support of military action; 
# extensive destruction or appropriation of cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol; 
# making cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol the object of attack; and
# theft, pillage or misappropriation of, or acts of vandalism directed against cultural property protected under the Convention.
States are obligated to adopt appropriate legislation to make these violations criminal offences under their domestic legislation, to stipulate appropriate penalties for these offences, and to establish jurisdiction over these offences (including universal jurisdiction for three of the five serious violations, as set out in Article 16(1)(c)).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/590&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of prosecution for crimes against cultural property is ''The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi'' case, handed down by the International Criminal Court on 27 September 2016. Al Mahdi was charged with and pleaded guilty to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion, and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Case Information Sheet: The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi|last=International Criminal Court|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803043957/https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|archive-date=3 August 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Mahdi was a member of the Ansar Eddine group (a group associated with Al Qaeda), and a co-perpetrator of damaging and destroying nine mausoleums and one mosque in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Military Manual ===
[[File:Military manual.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Military Manual on the Protection of Cultural Property]]
In 2016 UNESCO, in collaboration with the Sanremo International Institute of Humanitarian Law, published a manual titled 'Protection of Cultural Property: Military Manual'. This manual outlines the rules and obligations contained in the Second Protocol, and provides practical guidance on how these rules should be implemented by military forces around the world. It also contains suggestions as to best military practices in relation to these obligations. It relates only to the international laws governing armed conflict, and does not discuss military assistance that is provided in connection with other circumstances such as natural disasters.

==Destruction of cultural property in World War II==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===The Nazis and "degenerate art"===
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1913, Le Canot, En Canot, Femme au Canot et a l'Ombrelle, Im Boot, approximate dimensions 150 x 116.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''[[En Canot|En Canot (Im Boot)]]'' was one of many works classified as [[degenerate art]] and confiscated by the Nazis.]]The Nazi Party headed by [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in Germany in 1933 after the country's crippling defeat, and its socioeconomic distress during the years following [[World War I]]. [[World War II]] was aimed at reclaiming the glory of the once great Germanic state. Cultural property of many European nations and significant ethnic and social groups within them fell victim to Nazi Germany. The Nazi party, through the [[Third Reich]], confiscated close to 20% of all Western European art during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/records-and-research/documenting-nazi-plunder-of-european-art.html|title=Documenting Nazi Plunder of European Art|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Nazi party had looted and collected thousands of objects, art works and artefacts from occupied nations, destroyed many, or stored them in secret.

With artists depicting the hardship of the German people after World War I, and further expressing the fear of anti-Semitism and fascism, the Nazi party and Hitler himself soon realised the dangerous power of art, and began to clamp down on artistic production and forcing both artists and the public alike to adhere to a Nazi-approved style.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alter-Müri|first=Simone|date=2004|title=Teaching about War and Political Art in the New Millennium|jstor=3194079|journal=Art Education|volume=57|issue=1|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inherent within the Nazi's ideology was the idea of supremacy of the [[Aryan race|Aryan Race]] and all that it produced; as such the Nazi campaign's aims were to neutralize non-Germanic cultures and this was done through the destruction of culturally significant art and artefacts. This is illustrated greatest in the Jewish communities throughout Europe; by devising a series of laws that allowed them to justify and regulate the legal confiscation of cultural and personal property. Within Germany the looting of German Jewish cultural property began with the confiscation of non-Germanic artwork in the German state collection. Further, artists that were Jewish and artworks that did not match the Nazi ideology, or posed a threat to it, were stamped as [[degenerate art]]. Degenerate works of art, culminating in the infamous exhibition with the same name, were those whose subject, artist, or art was either Jewish or expressed Anti-Nazi sentiments, and was as such offensive to the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, Bücherverbrennung.jpg|default px|thumbnail|right|[[Nazi book burnings]].]]

Jewish collections were looted the most throughout the war. German Jews were ordered to report their personal assets, which were then privatized by the country. Jewish owned art galleries were forced to sell the works of art they housed. The Nazis concentrated their efforts on ensuring that all art within Germany would be Aryan in nature, speaking to the might of the Germanic state rather than Jewish art which was deemed as a blight on society. In a feat to "purge" German museums and collections, confiscation committees seized approximately 16,000 items within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|title=Degenerate art - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unexploited art was destroyed in massive bonfires. As the war progressed, the Nazi party elite ordered the confiscation of cultural property throughout various European countries.

===Nazi plunder in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Amber Room-1.jpg|thumbnail|Modern Day Amber Room]]
In the [[Soviet Union]], Nazi plunder of cultural significant art is best illustrated in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich's]] pillage of the [[Catherine Palace]] near [[St Petersburg]] and its famous [[Amber Room]] dating to the early 1700s. In October 1941, the Nazis had occupied the western portion of the Soviet Union, and began removing art treasures to the west. The entirety of the [[Amber Room]] was removed to [[Königsberg]] and reconstructed there. In January 1945, with the Russian army advancing on the city, the Amber Room was ordered to be moved again but its fate is thereafter unclear. A post-war Russian report concluded that 'summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945' during the battle to take the city. However, in the absence of definitive proof, other theories about its fate continue to be entertained to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-amber-room-160940121/|title=A Brief History of the Amber Room|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With financial assistance from German donors, Russian craftsmen reconstructed a new Amber Room during the 1990s. The new room was dedicated by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.

==After World War II==
With the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the subsequent defeat of the [[Axis Powers]], the atrocities which the Nazi leadership condoned, leading to the removal of culturally significant items and the destruction of numerous others could not be allowed to occur in future generations. This led the victorious [[Allied forces (World War II)|Allied forces]] to create provisions to ensure safeguards for culturally significant items in times of war. As a result, following the signature of the [[Roerich Pact]] by the American States in 1935, attempts were undertaken to draft a more comprehensive convention for the protection of monuments and works of art in time of war. In 1939, a draft convention, elaborated under the auspices of the International Museums Office, was presented to governments by the Netherlands. Due to the onset of the Second World War the draft convention was shelved with no further steps being taken. With the conclusion of the war, a new proposal was submitted to [[UNESCO]] by the Netherlands in 1948. The General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1951 decided to convene a committee of government experts to draft a convention. This committee met in 1952 and thereafter submitted its drafts to the General Conference. The intergovernmental Conference, which drew up and adopted the Convention and the further Acts, took place at The Hague from 21 April to 14 May 1954 where 56 States were represented. Following this international agreement The Hague Convention For the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict would come into force in 1956 in order to be an instrument of non derogation for the states bound by the document to stop the looting and destruction of cultural property.

==Implementation of the Convention==

=== Punishment for infringements ===
The [[Rome Statute]], adopted in July 1998 and entering into force four years later, as the legal basis of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), defines in Article 8(2) deliberate attacks against buildings of a religious, educational, artistic, scientific or non-profit nature and against historical monuments as [[war crimes]] in both international and non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - By topic|website=ihl-databases.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Court is thus authorised to prosecute such crimes if such an act was committed either by a national of a Contracting Party or on the territory of a Contracting Party. However, it only exercises its competence if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to ensure effective prosecution itself. Since September 2015, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi has been charged with the destruction of mausoleums in Timbuktu in the first trial before the ICC over the destruction of cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Situation in the Republic of Mali, The Prosecutor v.

=== Siege of Dubrovnik and the Mostar Bridge ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Aerial view Dubrovnik Old City.jpg|thumbnail|The Old City of Dubrovnik]]
Article 3 of the Statute of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] also contains provisions that allow the prosecution of violations of the fundamental principles of the Hague Convention of 1954. On the basis of this article, for the first time since the conclusion of the Convention, proceedings were brought in an international court for the destruction of cultural property during an armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abtahi|first=Hirad|date=|title=The Protection of Cultural Property in Times of Armed Conflict: The Practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/6418-abtahi-hirad-2001-protection-of-cultural-property|journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of its establishment the city of Dubrovnik was under the protection of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; after the Fourth Crusade the city came under the sovereignty of Venice 1205–1358 CE, and by the [[Treaty of Zadar]] in 1358, it became part of the Hungarian-Croatian Kingdom. Following the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the city was annexed by Austria and remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the conclusion of the First World War. From 1918 to 1939 Dubrovnik was part of the Zetska Banovina District that established its Croatian connections. From 1945 to 1990 Croatia would become part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. One of the most striking features of the historic city of Dubrovnik, and that which gives its characteristic appearance are its intact medieval fortifications. Its historic city walls run uninterrupted encircling the Old-City. This complex structure of fortification is one of the most complete depictions of medieval construction in the Mediterranean, consisting of a series of forts, bastions, casemates, towers and detached forts. Within the Old City are many medieval churches, cathedrals, and palaces from the Baroque period, encircled by its fortified wall, which would ensure its listed place by [[UNESCO]] as a world heritage site in 1972. The Old Town is not only an architectural and urban ensemble of high quality, but it is also full of museums and libraries, such as the collection of the Ragusan masters in the Dominican Monastery, the Museum of the History of Dubrovnik, the Icon Museum, and the libraries of the Franciscan and Dominican Monasteries. It also houses the archives of [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], which have been kept continuously since the 13th century and are a very important source for Mediterranean history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95|title=Old City of Dubrovnik|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives hold materials created by the civil service in the Republic of Ragusa.

The Siege of Dubrovnik was a military engagement fought between the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and Croatian forces which defended the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence. The Old Town was specifically targeted by the JNA even though it served no military purpose to bomb this town. At the heart of the bombing efforts by the JNA elite was the complete eradication of the memory of the Croatian people and history by erasing their cultural heritage and destroying their cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/strugar/cis/en/cis_strugar_en.pdf|title=ICTY Information Sheet on Dubrovnik Case and Strugar|last=|first=|date=|website=ICTY|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's convictions, which among other charges were also based on this article, were issued in February 2001 against Dario Kordić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/kordic_cerkez/4|title=Kordić &amp; Čerkez (IT-95-14/2) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a commander of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) during the war in Bosnia, against Miodrag Jokić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/miodrag_jokic/4|title=Jokić, Miodrag (IT-01-42/1) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior commander in the navy of the Yugoslav People's Army during the Battle of Dubrovnik in 1991, and against Milan Martić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/martic/4|title=Martić (IT-95-11) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a politician and military leader of the internationally unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al. (IT-04-74) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the fire on the bridge.

The historic town of [[Mostar]], spanning a deep valley of the Neretva River, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries as an Ottoman frontier town and during the [[Austro-Hungarian]] period in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mostar was mostly known for its old Turkish houses and specifically the [[Old Bridge, Mostar|Old Bridge]]; the Stari Mostar, after which it is named. In the 1990s conflict with the former Yugoslavia, however, most of the historic town and the Old Bridge were destroyed purposely by Croatian Army and their allies. This type of destruction was in step with that of the Old Town of Dubrovnik, where the aim was the eradication of the memory of the people that once occupied the land, an effort reminiscent of the [[Third Reich]] and the Nazi party. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006. Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the firing of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al.

=== Khmer Rouge Tribunal ===
The [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal]], established by the United Nations together with the government of Cambodia in July 2006, has the possibility of prosecuting the destruction of cultural assets during the [[Khmer Rouge]] dictatorship from April 1975 to January 1979, with explicit reference to the Hague Convention of 1954, pursuant to Article 7 of the Law on the Establishment of Extraordinary Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Law on the establishment of extraordinary Chambers

https://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/legal-documents/KR_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, most of the more than 3,300 temples and 130 mosques in Cambodia were severely damaged by the Khmer Rouge. They also destroyed all 73 Catholic churches and many other sites of religious or cultural significance. The Hague Convention of 1954 can be applied in principle, since Cambodia became a party to the Convention in 1962, before the Khmer Rouge came to power, and because Article 19 of the Convention stipulates that even in non-international armed conflicts, each party to the conflict is bound at least by the provisions on respect for cultural property.

However, it is not yet known whether and to what extent trials will be instituted in the court which are based on the destruction of cultural property. A possible problem with the application of Article 7 and thus with the Hague Convention, is that it is a legal requirement to establish the existence of an armed conflict. This would then resemble the definition commonly used in international humanitarian law. Whether such an assessment of the Khmer Rouge dictatorship will be possible, cannot yet be predicted.

===Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL===
{{main|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]].  The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL has plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIL attack|author=Khalid al-Taie|publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com|date=13 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIL activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

Although Libya, Syria and Iraq ratified the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict in 1957, 1958 and 1967 respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention. The Hague|date=14 May 1954|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has not been effectively enforced.

== International Acceptance and Partnering Organisations ==
As of June 2018, 131 states have become party to the Hague Convention of 1954 and 109 states to the first protocol. 77 states have become party to the Second Protocol of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/states-parties/|title=States Parties {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], France became a party in 1957. Russia is contracting party in legal succession of the Soviet Union, which also became party in 1957. the People's Republic of China ratified the convention in 2000 and the United States acceded in 2009. The United Kingdom signed the Agreement in 1954 and ratified the Convention and acceded to the Protocols in 2017.

The main reason for the long period between signature and ratification by the United States were the reservations of the [[US Department of Defense]] during the [[Cold War]], that the Convention's obligations regarding the possible use of nuclear weapons could not be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usicomos.org/hague-convention-and-usicomos/|title=Hague Convention and US/ICOMOS|website=www.usicomos.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Chiefs of Staff, to which the commanders-in-chief of all units of the American armed forces belong, unanimously declared itself in 1995 in favour of voluntary compliance with the Convention. On 6 January 1999, then US President Bill Clinton recommended that the US Senate ratify both agreements. In his opinion, they were not only in accordance with the principles and methods of the American Armed Forces, but were even based on them in essential aspects. After the Senate approved accession in September 2008, the US Ambassador to UNESCO, Stephen Engelken, handed over the instrument of ratification to [[Kōichirō Matsuura]], Secretary-General of UNESCO on 13 March 2009. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on 14 May 2004, the Government of the United Kingdom declared its intention to become a party to the Convention and the two Protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20121223133857/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2452.aspx|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK To Ratify Convention Safeguarding Cultural Heri…|date=2012-12-23|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the conclusion of the Second Protocol of 1999, which, in the view of the British government, eliminated essential weaknesses and ambiguities of the 1954 Convention. A draft law containing ratification of the Convention, the two protocols and criminal law provisions was announced by the UK government in November 2006.

=== UNESCO ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), a legally independent specialized agency of the United Nations based in Paris, and is the most important international institution in the field of dissemination and implementation of the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. It acts as depositary of the Hague Convention of 1954 and its two Protocols and administers the "International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection".

=== Blue Shield International ===
In addition, Blue Shield International (formerly the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]], ICBS; in French Comité International du Bouclier Bleu, CIBB) has existed since 1996. Its mission is to improve international cooperation in the field of cultural heritage protection and to support local and regional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53136889|title=A Blue shield for the protection of our endangered cultural heritage : proceedings of the open session co-organized by PAC core activity and the section on national libraries|date=2003|publisher=International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, Core Acitivity on Preservation and Conservation|others=Koch, Corine., IFLA Programme on Preservation and Conservations.|isbn=2912743028|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=53136889}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Protocol of 1999 explicitly mentions in Articles 11 and 27 the consultative role of the International Committee of the Blue Shield in the implementation of the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1999-second-protocol/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the International Committee was founded in 2017, national Blue Shield Committees have already been established in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Curacao, Denmark, France, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Madagascar, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and the USA, comparable to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. These national associations support the work of the International Committee in their respective home countries. The Association of the National Committees of the Blue Shield (ANCBS) was established on September 28, 2006 as its umbrella organization. Since 2017, all international activities have been bundled in Blue Shield International.

While in many wars the freedom of movement of United Nations personnel is significantly restricted due to security concerns, Blue Shield is regarded as particularly suitable due to its structure to act flexibly and autonomously in armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gezielte Zerstörung von (Welt- )Kulturerbe in Krisenländern als Herausforderung für die Vereinten Nationen |author=Sabine Freifrau von Schorlemer |publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH &amp; Co. KG.|isbn=9783848727872 |edition=1st |location=Baden-Baden |oclc=934159492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the partial dissolution of state structures and the very unclear security situation resulting from the wars and unrest in Iraq, Syria, Mali, Egypt and Libya, the employees of Blue Shield and its national organizations then carried out very robust undertakings to protect the cultural assets there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/23_1/feature.html|title=Newsletter 23.1 Spring 2008|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concerns in particular the collection of cultural assets to be protected, the compilation with local experts of "no-strike lists" (- which preserve the coordinates of important cultural monuments), the linking of civil and military structures and the training of local military personnel with regard to the protection of cultural assets. From Blue Shield's point of view, it is not enough to develop and adopt international law norms such as the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict or the Doha Statement of the Conference of 'Ulamâ on Islam and Cultural Heritage'. It is necessary to implement these standards effectively on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000012502400/Bildersturm-in-MossulKlassische-Normen-und-Uebereinkuenfte-versagen|title=Bildersturm: Die globalen Normen zum Schutz von Kulturgut greifen nicht - derStandard.at|website=DER STANDARD|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also concerns the prevention of the illicit trade in antiquities and stolen cultural assets to finance military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/05/real-life-indiana-jones-vs-isis|title=Real-Life Indiana Jones Vs.

=== Other civil society structures ===
The "International League of National Societies for the Protection of Cultural Property", based in the Swiss city of Freiburg, was also established in May 1997 as an international umbrella organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dgks-ev.org/internationale-liga/|title=Internationale Liga – Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturgüterschutz e.V.|website=dgks-ev.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the activities of these national and international organisations and associations, which also include the protection of cultural property against disasters in times of peace, [[civil society]] structures will play an increasing role in the field of cultural property protection and support the work of state and international institutions.

One example of international cooperation in the protection of cultural assets was the temporary storage of art treasures from the National Museum in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], in Switzerland. The art objects, which were severely threatened in the National Museum both by the [[Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)]] that lasted until 1995 and by the subsequent rule of the [[Taliban]] regime, were moved to a so-called "Afghanistan Museum in Exile" in the Swiss town of Bubendorf in 1999 with the consent of all parties to the conflict. The exhibition, which was supported primarily by the voluntary work of Swiss citizens and exiled Afghans, as well as by donations of around 1.5 million Swiss francs and supervised by the Swiss Afghanistan Institute based in Bubendorf, was open to the public from October 2000 to October 2006 and was visited by around 50,000 people during this time. In March 2007, the objects were returned to Kabul under the direction of UNESCO and with the support of the German Air Force. According to the spokesman of the Bubendorf Museum, this was the largest return of art objects since the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phototheca-afghanica.ch/afghanistanmuseum/|title=Internet - The Afghanistan Museum in Exile|website=www.phototheca-afghanica.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Iraqi National Museum in [[Baghdad]] was seriously plundered from 8 to 12 April 2003, some three weeks after the start of the [[Iraq War]]. The museum was reopened only three years earlier on 28 April 2000, some nine years after its closure as a result of the war. Later investigations carried out by a US commission in collaboration with museum staff found evidence of at least three independent incidents.[1] According to the Commission's findings, the looting was sometimes spontaneous and indiscriminate. However, a number of indications also indicated that some of the thieves had a good knowledge of the museum and expert knowledge of the cultural assets on display. Although particularly valuable objects were kept in the cellar of the museum in the run-up to the war, considerable losses were also incurred here. The Commission corrected initial estimates of some 170,000 stolen works of art to 11,000 to 15,000 stolen objects. By the time the study results were published in 2005, about 5,000 of them had been recovered in various ways.

From September 2009 to September 2011, Robin Cohen was the director. Since then, directorship has been jointly in the hands of [[Oliver Blackwell]] and [[Hein de Haas]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heindehaas.com/bio.html|title = Biography|author = Hein de Haas|accessdate = May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''John Hope Franklin Center for Interdisciplinary and International Studies''' (JHFC) is located at [[Duke University]] in the United States. It is a consortium of programs dedicated to studying and revitalizing theories of how knowledge is gained and exchanged. The more than twenty participants come from a broad range of disciplines, converging to explore intellectual, social, and political issues, including race and race relations, the legacy of the African-American Experience, equality and opportunity amongst populations, and the implications of globalization. In essence, the Center's mission is to facilitate the interactions of humanists and others involved in the social sciences in an intellectual setting amenable to diverse partnerships.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/about/jhf.php About the Center &gt;&gt; John Hope Franklin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814071316/http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/about/jhf.php |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
The Franklin Center is named after Dr. [[John Hope Franklin]], the James B. Duke Professor Emeritus of History and former professor of Legal History at Duke. An intellectual leader and lifelong civil rights activist, his work has inspired the Center's dedication to creative sharing of ideas and methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/specialcollections/franklin/bio.html Biography of John Hope Franklin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One essential aspect of the Franklin Center is its wholehearted embrace of new technologies and innovations to enhance intellectual exchange. Using resources such as multimedia and high-speed videoconferencing, the Center employs advanced technologies both as a means to share ideas and as an end, aware of the revolutionizing power of these innovations in education and society.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

On the bus line and within walking distance to other parts of Duke's campuses, the Center is easily accessible to residents from the Durham and Triangle area, who are invited to participate in and experience workshops, lectures, exhibits, and other public events. A brown-bag lunch series--"Wednesday Conversations"—invites local residents and community leaders to share insights and expertise on matters of local and universal consequence. Past speakers have included professors from universities around the country as well as people from high-ranking positions in various foundations and associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/web/institute/assets/pdfs/events/WedConversations.pdf Wednesday Conversations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914051118/http://www.duke.edu/web/institute/assets/pdfs/events/WedConversations.pdf |date=2006-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[A major]] / [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]] with three sharps placed after the clef.]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''key signature''' is a set of [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{Music|sharp}}), [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{Music|b}}), and rarely, [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{Music|natural}}) symbols placed together on the [[staff (music)|staff]].  Key signatures are generally written immediately after the [[clef]] at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a [[Sheet music|score]], notably after a [[Bar (music)|double barline]].

A key signature designates [[note (music)|note]]s that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding [[natural sign|natural]] notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature.  A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one [[semitone]] above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone.  Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the [[Clef#Treble clef|treble staff]] applies to Fs not only on that line, but also to Fs in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other Fs. This convention was not universal until the late [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], however; music published in the 1720s and 1730s, for example, uses key signatures showing sharps or flats on both octaves for notes which fall within the staff.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An [[Accidental (music)|accidental]] is an exception to the key signature, applying only in the measure in which it appears.

Although a key signature may be written using any combination of sharp and flat symbols, the most common series of thirteen homogeneous key signatures—ranging from six flats to six sharps, with each successive flat or sharp placed on the [[circle of fifths|note a perfect fifth below or above]], respectively, the previous one—is assumed in much of this article.  A piece scored using a single diatonic key signature and no accidentals contains notes of at most seven of the twelve [[pitch class]]es, which seven being determined by the particular key signature.

Each [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale. However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Schulenberg, David. ''Music of the Baroque''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4x3aKvOQWAC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;vq=%22the+key+of+a+baroque+work%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U3x7lhOyyIiT-O_HsTZlZxw8FrkSA p. 72.]. "(…) to determine the key of a Baroque work one must always analyze its tonal structure rather than rely on the key signature."&lt;/ref&gt; or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, David. ''The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland''. Cork: Cork University Press, 2005. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzrfncNnr4cC&amp;pg=PA25-IA13&amp;vq=%22In+a+few+cases+Petrie+has+given+what+is+clearly+a+modal+melody+a+key+signature+which+suggests+that+it+is+actally+in+a+minor+key%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U0BqVPTuQnnaH32iLpCvrYnyT143Q p. 22]. "In a few cases Petrie has given what is clearly a modal melody a key signature which suggests that it is actually in a minor key. For example, ''Banish Misfortune'' is presented in D minor, although it is clearly in the Dorian mode."&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common (in contrast to brief passages within a piece, which, as they modulate from key to key often temporarily disagree with the key signature); but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethoven's very late piano sonatas.  For example, in his [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 31 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 110]], the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A{{music|flat}} minor and has a significant modulation to C{{music|flat}} major, and both these keys theoretically require seven flats in their key signature.  (The second appearance later in the movement of this same section, a semitone lower, in G minor, uses the correct key signature of two flats.)

== Conventions ==

[[File:ks1.gif|thumb|right|200px|1. [[B major]] scale: no key signature; accidentals required throughout]]
{{anchor|scale2}}[[File:ks2.gif|thumb|right|200px|2. [[B major]] scale: key signature; accidentals not needed]]

In principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern [[Music notation#Modern notation|music notation]]. This allows musicians to identify the key simply by the number of sharps or flats (which is the same in any clef), rather than their position on the staff. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an [[F♯ (musical note)|F-sharp]],&lt;ref name="orderofsharp"&gt;|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-read-key-signatures.html |title=How to Read Key Signatures|accessdate=29 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to a [[G major]] or an [[E minor]] key.

However, in 20th-century music, there are occasional exceptions to this, where a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale, where a key signature may be invented to reflect this.  This may consist of a number of sharps or flats that are not the normal ones (such as a signature of just C{{music|sharp}} or E{{music|flat}}), or it may consist of one or more sharps combined with one or more flats (such as a signature containing both F{{music|sharp}} and B{{music|flat}}).  Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of [[Béla Bartók]], for example.

The effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any [[octave]] will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in [[#scale2|scale 2]] illustrated – the next-to-last note – is played as an A{{music|sharp}} even though the A{{music|sharp}} in the key signature (the last sharp sign) is written an octave lower).&lt;ref name="orderofsharp" /&gt;

In a score containing more than one instrument, all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature. Exceptions include:
* If an instrument is a [[transposing instrument]].
* If an instrument is a [[percussion instrument]] with indeterminate pitch.
* Composers usually omit the key signature for [[timpani]] parts. Besides not using a key signature, timpani parts were early on also treated often as transposing instrument parts, the pitch of the high drum being written as C and, as timpani were almost always tuned a [[perfect fourth]] apart (dominant on the low drum and tonic on the high drum), the pitch of the low drum being written as G, with the actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the part, e.g. "timpani in D–A", if they were tuned A (low drum) and D (high drum).
* Composers may omit the key signature for [[French horn|horn]] and occasionally [[trumpet]] parts. This is perhaps reminiscent of the early days of brass instruments, when [[Crook (music)|crooks]] would be added to them, in order to change the length of the tubing and allow playing in different keys.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* On occasion, in more modern works, instruments may be notated in different keys even when they are not transposing instruments, because the music is [[polytonal]] and the different parts are actually in different keys which sound together.

[[File:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Circle of fifths]] showing [[major key|major]] and [[minor key]]s and their signatures]]

=== Notational conventions ===

The convention for the notation of key signatures follows the [[circle of fifths]]. Starting from [[C major]] (or equivalently [[A minor]]) which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new key's [[leading note]] (seventh degree) for major keys or [[supertonic]] (second degree) for minor keys. Thus [[G major]] ([[E minor]]) has one sharp which is on the F; then [[D major]] ([[B minor]]) has two sharps on F and C and so on.

Similarly, successively lowering the key by a fifth adds a flat, going counterclockwise around the circle of fifths. The new flat is placed on the [[subdominant]] (fourth degree) for major keys or [[submediant]] (sixth degree) for minor keys. Thus [[F major]] ([[D minor]]) has one flat which is on the B; then [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] ([[G minor]]) has two flats (on B and E) and so on.

Put another way: for key signatures with sharps, the first sharp is placed on F with subsequent sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for key signatures with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional key signatures, with up to seven sharps or flats and including the ''empty'' signature of C major (A minor).

Corollaries:

* Starting from a key with flats in its key signature: raising by fifths successively reduces the flats to zero at C major (A minor). Further such raising adds sharps as described above.
* Starting from a key with sharps: lowering by fifths successively reduces those sharps to zero. Further such lowering adds flats as described above.
* When the process of raising by a fifth (adding a sharp) produces more than five or six sharps, successive such raising generally involves changing to the [[enharmonic equivalent]] key using a flat-based signature. Typically this is at F{{music|sharp}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;G{{music|flat}}, but may also be at C{{music|sharp}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;D{{music|flat}} or B&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C{{music|flat}}. The same principle applies to the process of successive lowering by a fifth.

The relative minor is a [[minor third]] down from the major, regardless of whether it is a ''flat'' or a ''sharp'' key signature.

The key signatures with seven flats ({{Music|flat}}) and seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of [[C-sharp major|C{{music|#}} major]] (seven sharps) is more simply represented as [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]] (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are (in twelve tone [[equal temperament]]) the same, because C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} are enharmonically the same note. Pieces ''are'' written in these ''extreme'' sharp or flat keys, however: for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of [[The Well-Tempered Clavier]] [[List of compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach#The Well-Tempered Clavier .28846.E2.80.93893.29|BWV 848]] is in C{{music|#}} major. The modern musical ''[[Seussical]]'' by [[Stephen Flaherty|Flaherty]] and [[Lynn Ahrens|Ahrens]] also has several songs written in these extreme keys.

Key signatures can be further extended through [[double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s (for example, a piece in the key of G{{music|#}} major can be expressed with a double sharp on F{{music|x}} and six sharps on the other six pitches). As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used (in the case of G{{music|#}}, the same passage could be expressed in A{{music|b}} with only four flats).

[[File:Natural key signature example.png|thumb|Natural key signature: a key signature with seven [[Natural (music)|naturals]] ({{Music|natural}}) used to cancel the seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) of the previous signature.]]
The key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a [[measure (music)|measure]], simply by notating the new signature, although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is needed to cancel the preceding signature. If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.

=== Variants of standard conventions ===

In traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications (whether of newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.

Similarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.

When the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.

At one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a [[barline|double barline]] (provided the change occurred between bars and not inside a bar), even if it was not required by the structure of the music to mark sections within the movement; but more recently it has increasingly become usual to use just a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.

If both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed (in the case where the change occurs between bars). For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.

In key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.

The A{{music|sharp}} which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pines of Rome]]'', in the third section, "Pines of the Janiculum" (which is in [[B major]]), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.

In the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F{{music|flat}} may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear below the bottom line. An example of this can be seen in [[Isaac Albéniz]]'s ''[[Iberia (Albéniz)|Iberia]]'': first movement, "Evocación", which is in [[A-flat minor|A{{music|flat}}]] minor.

==Major scale structure==
Except for C major, key signatures appear in two varieties, "sharp key signatures" ("sharp keys") and "flat key signatures" ("flat keys"), so called because they contain only one or other.&lt;ref name="Schonbrun"&gt;Schonbrun, Marc (2005). ''The Everything Music Theory Book'', p.68. {{ISBN|1-59337-652-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scales with sharp key signatures===

Sharp key signatures consist of a number of sharps between one and seven, applied in this order: {{nowrap|F C G D A E B}}.&lt;ref name="Bower"&gt;Bower, Michael. 2007.

"Key-Signature". ''Oxford Dictionary of Music'', second edition, associate editor, Joyce Bourne. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-869162-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one sharp (F{{music|sharp}}) in the key signature of a piece in a major key indicates the key of G major, the next note above F{{music|sharp}}. (Six sharps, the last one being E{{music|sharp}} (an [[enharmonic]] spelling of F{{music|natural}}) indicate the key of F{{music|sharp}} major, since F has already been sharped in the key signature.)

This table shows that each scale starting on the [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] [[scale degree]] of the previous scale has one new sharp, added in the order given above.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

===Scales with flat key signatures===
"Flat key signatures" consist of one to seven flats, applied as: {{nowrap|B E A D G C F}}&lt;ref name="Bower"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; The mnemonic device is then reversed for use in the flat keys: "Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father".&lt;ref name="Schonbrun"/&gt; The major scale with one flat is F major. In all other "flat major scales", the tonic or key note of a piece in a major key is four notes below the last flat, which is the same as the second-to-last flat in the signature.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt; In the major key with four flats (B{{music|flat}} E{{music|flat}} A{{music|flat}} D{{music|flat}}), for example, the penultimate flat is A{{music|flat}}, indicating a key of A{{music|flat}} major.

In this case each new scale starts a fifth ''below'' (or a [[Perfect fourth|fourth]] above) the previous one.

== Relationship between ''key signature'' and ''key'' ==

A key signature is not the same as a [[key (music)|key]]; key signatures are merely notational devices. They are convenient principally for [[diatonic]] or [[tonality|tonal]] music.

The key signature defines the [[diatonic scale]] that a piece of music uses without the need for accidentals. Most [[scale (music)|scales]] require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted. For example, the only sharp in the G [[major scale]] is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.

In any case, more extensive pieces often change key (''[[modulation (music)|modulate]]'') during contrasting sections, and only sometimes is this change indicated with a change of key signature; if not, the passage in the second key will not have a matching key signature.

[[File:GottesZeit.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, BWV 106|Bach Cantata 106]] is almost entirely in E{{music|flat}} major, but has only two flats, not three, in the key signature {{audio|GottesZeit.mid|Play}}]]

The [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] has no key signature, leading it to be called the ''[[Dorian mode|Dorian]]'', but it is still in D minor; the B{{music|flat}}s that occur in the piece are written with accidentals.

===Additional terminology===
Keys which are associated with the same key signature are called [[relative minor/major|relative keys]].

When [[musical mode]]s, such as [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called ''transposed modes''.

== Exceptions ==&lt;!--[[Unusual key signature]] redirects directly here.--&gt;

[[File:D Freygish Noteworthy Composer.png|thumb|D [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish]] scale {{audio|D Freygish.mid|Play}}]]

Exceptions to [[Common practice period|common-practice-period]] use may be found in [[Klezmer]] scales, such as [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish (Phrygian)]]. In the 20th century, composers such as [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] and [[Frederic Rzewski|Rzewski]] (see below) began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the [[musical mode|standard order]].

Because of the limitations of the traditional [[Great Highland Bagpipe|highland bagpipe]] scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, the usual 
F{{music|#}} and C{{music|#}}.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Earlykeysig.png|thumb|right|80px|Variant key signatures in a [[Tomas Luis de Victoria|Victoria]] motet. In the ''superius'' (soprano) part the E{{music|flat}} appears first, and in two other parts a flat occurs in two octaves.]]

=== Unusual signatures ===
{{further information|Anhemitonic scale#Modes of the ancohemitonic heptatonic scales and the key signature system}}

The above 15 key signatures only express diatonic scale. and are therefore sometimes called ''standard key signatures''. Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidental as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E{{music|b}} (right hand), and F{{music|b}} and G{{music|b}} (left hand) used for the E{{music|b}} diminished (E{{music|b}} [[octatonic scale|octatonic]]) scale in Bartók's ''Crossed Hands'' (no. 99, vol. 4, ''[[Mikrokosmos (Béla Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]''), or the B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}} and F{{music|#}}&lt;!--yes, sharp--&gt; used for the D [[Phrygian dominant scale]] in [[Frederic Rzewski]]'s ''God to a Hungry Child''.

The absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of C major&amp;nbsp;/ A minor as each accidental may be notated explicitly as required, or the piece may be [[Musical mode|modal]] or [[atonality|atonal]]. An example is Bartók's [[Piano Sonata (Bartók)|Piano Sonata]], which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.

If not bound by common practice conventions, [[microtonal music|microtones]] can also be notated in a key signature; which [[List of musical symbols#Quarter tones|microtonal symbols]] are used depends on the system.

The [[common practice period]] conventions are so firmly established that some [[scorewriter|musical notation programs]] have been unable to show nonstandard key signatures until recently.&lt;ref&gt;One of the most popular musical notation programs, Finale, has only included the option to create a nonstandard key signature since their 2009 version: Finale 2009 User Manual for Windows. "Non-Standard Key Signature." http://www.finalemusic.com/UserManuals/Finale2009Win/Finale.htm (accessed February 17, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The use of a one-flat signature developed in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Key Signature", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

When signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a '''partial signature''' or '''conflicting signature'''. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Partial Signature", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th-century motet ''Absolon fili mi'' attributed to [[Josquin des Prez]] features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.

Baroque music written in [[minor key]]s often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A{{music|flat}} would frequently have to be sharpened to A{{music|natural}} in the [[minor scale|ascending melodic minor scale]], as would the B{{music|flat}}).

The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]] ({{Lang-la|Berytus}}). It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of [[jurisprudence]] until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial [[Constitution (Roman law)|constitutions]] and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal [[precedent]]s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under [[Augustus]] in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"&gt;Walker 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.&lt;ref name="Walker 2000 91"/&gt;

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charnock 1859, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the [[Legio V Macedonica|fifth Macedonian]] and the [[Legio III Gallica|third Gallic]] legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology |date=July–August 2011 | volume=64 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during AD 222–235;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon 1854, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles Ménage]], a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt; Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;Rudorff  1857, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer 1868, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen 1901, pp. 139–144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jidejian 1973, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36"&gt;Clark 2011, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174"&gt;Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; From 425, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt; because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle 2008, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of [[Sidon]], pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 54–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"&gt;Sartre 2005, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Mosaic depicting the bust of a severe-looking man wearing a crown and an intricate royal purple tunic.|[[Justinian I]], the emperor who instigated the rewriting of Roman law]]
Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt; which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Horrocks 2009, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 224–240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard 1999, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.&lt;ref name="Corcoran"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 | author=Corcoran, Simon | authorlink=Simon Corcoran | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106095259/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | archivedate=November 6, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"&gt;Monro 1872, pp. xviii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).&lt;ref name="Corcoran"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 1–4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.&lt;/ref&gt; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5–11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12–19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckland 1921, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/&gt;

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt; He is believed to have taught as of {{circa|lk=no|400}} or {{circa|lk=no|410}}. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyrillus |volume=7 |page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert 1906, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 132–138&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="digest2"&gt;Monro 1872, p. xxix&lt;/ref&gt; Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim 1921, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eunapius 1596, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 to c. 395)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gaza City|Gazan]] lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30–32"/&gt;

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 46–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7"&gt;Greatrex 2011, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another late 5th-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sterk 2009, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350,&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 63–73&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor.&lt;ref&gt;Collinet 1925, pp. 61–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.&lt;ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skaf 2005, pp. 224–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones Hall 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and legacy==

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.&lt;ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460"&gt;Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451–460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunkel"&gt;Kunkel 1973, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuz"&gt;Schulz 1967, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.&lt;ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/&gt; His 533 ''Omnem'' constitution read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], [[Severus of Antioch]] and [[Aphian]]. Under [[Cyrillus]], the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attridge  1992, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt; the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...&lt;ref name="digest2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman 1995, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late 16th-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741 by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192"&gt;Reinink 2002, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the 9th century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.&lt;ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405"&gt;Mousourakis 2003, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91"&gt;Lokin 1994, pp. 71–91&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.&lt;ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307"&gt;Sedlar 2011, pp. 306–307&lt;/ref&gt; Around 900, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35–36"&gt;Stein 1999, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.&lt;ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300"&gt;Kuttner 1991, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.&lt;ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25"&gt;Evans 2005, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.&lt;ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128"&gt;Stein 1999, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Université Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199"&gt;Kassir 2010, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.&lt;ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/&gt; It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.&lt;ref name="log"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duccio Maestà.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s ''[[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà with Twenty Angels and Nineteen Saints]]'' (1308–1311), [[Museo dell'Opera Metropolitana del Duomo a Siena|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]], [[Siena]].]]
'''Maestà''' {{IPA-it|maeˈsta|}}, the Italian word for "majesty", designates an [[Iconography|iconic formula]] of the enthroned [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[child Jesus]], whether or not accompanied with [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s. The ''Maestà'' is an extension of the "[[Seat of Wisdom]]" theme of the seated "Mary [[Theotokos]]", "Mary Mother of God", which is a counterpart to the earlier icon of [[Christ in Majesty]], the enthroned Christ that is familiar in Byzantine [[Mosaics]]. '''''Maria Regina''''' is an art historians' synonym for the [[icon]]ic image of Mary enthroned, with or without the Child.&lt;ref&gt;See M. Lawrence's discussion of this image, "Maria Regina", ''Art Bulletin'' '''7''' (1924–1925:150-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the image seems to have developed, based perhaps on Byzantine precedents such as the coin of Constantine's Empress [[Fausta]], crowned and with their sons on her lap&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Lawrence 1924:&lt;/ref&gt; and on literary examples, such as [[Flavius Cresconius Corippus]]'s celebration of [[Justin II]]'s coronation in 565.&lt;ref&gt;In Corippus' poem, Sophia (Wisdom) prays "''Virgo, creatoris genetrix sanctissima mundi, excelsi regina poli...''". (''Corippus'', A. Cameron, ed., ''In laudem Justini augusti minoris'' (London) 1976, vol. II:52f. The more familiar ''In laudem Mariae'', praising Mary as [[Regina Coeli|Queen of Heaven]], is a late sixth century poem, perhaps by [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings depicting the ''Maestà'' came into the mainstream artistic repertory, especially in Rome, in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Several rare examples in fresco and mosaic, including the lost apse mosaic in the first church in Rome dedicated to Mary, the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]], are listed by John L. Osborne, "Early Medieval Painting in San Clemente, Rome: The Madonna and Child in the Niche", ''Gesta'' '''20'''.2 (1981:299–310) p. 304f.&lt;/ref&gt; with an increased emphasis on the veneration of Mary. The ''Maestà'' was often executed in [[fresco]] technique directly on plastered walls or as paintings on gessoed wooden [[altar]] [[panel painting|panels]].

A more domestic representation, suitable to private devotion, is the iconographic theme of [[Madonna and Child]].

==Examples of ''Maestà'' in painting==
{{main|Maestà (Duccio)}} 
The most famous example of the ''Maestà'' is the ''Maestà with Twenty Angels and Nineteen Saints'', an [[altarpiece]] comprising many individual paintings commissioned by the city of [[Siena]] in 1308 from the artist [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]]. The painting was installed in the [[Siena Cathedral|city's cathedral]] on June 9, 1311. Although it took a generation for its effect truly to be felt, Duccio's ''Maestà'' set Italian painting on a course leading away from the hieratic representations of Byzantine art towards more direct presentations of reality.

Creating this altarpiece assembled from many wood panels bonded together before painting was an arduous undertaking. The work was not only large, the central panel was 7 by 13 feet, but it had to be painted on both sides since it could be seen from all directions when installed on the main altar at the centre of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the ''Maesta'' were episodes from the life of Christ, focusing on his Passion. Sacred narrative unfolds in elegant episodes enacted by graceful figures who seem to dance their way through these stories while still conveying emotional content.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the ''Maesta'' was dismantled in 1771, its power and beauty can only be imagined from scattered parts, some still in Siena, Italy, but others elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Other noted examples of the ''Maestà'' are [[Simone Martini]]'s ''Maestà'' in the [[Palazzo Pubblico]], Siena, or [[Cimabue]]'s fresco in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]].

'''Mana''', in [[Austronesian languages]], means "power", "effectiveness", and "prestige". In most cases, this power and its source are understood to be supernatural and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=POLLEX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/mana1/ |title=Entries for MANA.1 [OC&amp;#93; Power, effectiveness, prestige |publisher=Pollex.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its semantics are language-dependent. The concept is significant in [[Polynesia]]n culture and is part of contemporary [[Pacific Islander]] culture; it came to the attention of Western anthropologists through reports from island missionaries. Its study was included in [[cultural anthropology]]—specifically, the anthropology of religion. Links were seen between ''mana'' and earlier phases of Western religion: [[animism]] at first, followed by [[Robert Ranulph Marett|pre-animism]].

==Etymology==
According to the POLLEX Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|date=2011|title=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|url=http://simon.net.nz/files//2012/12/Greenhill_and_Clark2011.pdf|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=50|issue=2|pages=551–559|doi=10.1353/ol.2011.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for "mana"—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-"—existed in [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, "mana" means "thunder, storm, or wind" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant "powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own."&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=R. A|title=Proto-Oceanic *mana Revisited|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|date=2007|volume=46|issue=2|pages=404–423|doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|In Polynesian culture}}Polynesian culture==
Mana is a foundation of the [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian worldview]], a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred, impersonal force. To have ''mana'' implies influence, [[authority]], and efficacy—the ability to perform in a given situation. The quality of ''mana'' is not limited to individuals; peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects may also possess ''mana'', and its possessors are accorded respect.

==={{anchor|In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture}}Hawaiian and Tahitian culture===
In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture, mana is a [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and healing power which can exist in places, objects and persons. Hawaiians believe that mana may be gained or lost by actions, and Hawaiians and Tahitians believe that mana is both external and internal. Sites on the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and in [[French Polynesia]] are believed to possess mana—for example, the top rim of the [[Haleakalā]] volcano on the island of [[Maui]] and the [[Taputapuatea marae]] on the island of [[Raiatea]] in the [[Society Islands]].

Ancient Hawaiian believed that the island of [[Molokaʻi]] possesses mana, compared with its neighboring islands. Before the unification of Hawaii by [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha I]], battles were fought for possession of the island and its south-shore fish ponds which existed until the late 19th century.

A person may gain mana by ''[[pono]]'' (right actions). In ancient Hawaii, there were two paths to mana: sexual means or violence. Nature is dualistic, and everything has a counterpart. A balance between the gods [[Kū]] and [[Lono]] formed, through whom are the two paths to mana (''ʻimihaku'', or the search for mana). Kū, the god of war and politics, offers mana through violence; this was how Kamehameha gained his mana. Lono, the god of peace and fertility, offers mana through sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In [[Māori language|Māori]], a tribe with ''mana whenua'' must have demonstrated their authority over a territory. In [[Māori culture]], there are two essential aspects of a person's mana: ''mana [[tangata whenua|tangata]]'', authority derived from [[whakapapa]] ([[genealogy]]) and ''mana huaanga'', defined as "authority derived from having a wealth of resources to [[gift economy|gift to others to bind them into reciprocal obligations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Whanganui River report (Wai 167).|date=1999|publisher=GP Publications|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=186956250X|page=35|url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68450539/Whanganui%20River%20Report%201999.pdf|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemopereki Simon]], from [[Ngāti Tūwharetoa|Ngati Tuwharetoa]], asserts that there are many forms of mana in Maori culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ojs.aut.ac.nz/te-kaharoa/index.php/tekaharoa/article/view/6/4|title=View of Te Arewhana Kei Roto i Te Rūma: An Indigenous Neo-Disputatio on Settler Society, Nullifying Te Tiriti, ‘Natural Resources’ and Our Collective Future in Aotearoa New Zealand|website=ojs.aut.ac.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous word reflects a non-Western view of reality, complicating translation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=469d396b-ce85-4e30-b04f-a39dc8d03f38&amp;chapter=36 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020102335/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/reports/viewchapter.asp?reportID=469D396B-CE85-4E30-B04F-A39DC8D03F38&amp;chapter=36 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-20 |title=Waitangi Tribunal |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by the definition of mana provided by [[Maori Mardsden]] who states that mana is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Spiritual power and authority as opposed to the purely psychic and natural force — ihi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Te Ao Hurihuri: The World Moves|last=Marsden|first=Māori|publisher=Hicks Smith|year=1975|isbn=|editor-last=King|editor-first=Micheal|location=Wellington|pages=145|chapter=God, Man, and the Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Prof. [[Margaret Mutu]] mana in its traditional sense means:&lt;blockquote&gt;Power, authority, ownership, status, influence, dignity, respect derived from the god[/[[atua]]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State of Māori Rights|last=Mutu|first=Margaret|publisher=Huia|year=2011|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In terms of leadership [[Ngāti Kahungunu]] legal scholar [https://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/about/staff/carwyn-jones Carwyn Jones] comments that, "mana is the central concept that underlies Māori leadership and accountability." He also considers mana as a fundamental aspect of the constitutional traditions of Māori society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Carwyn|date=2014|title=A Māori Constitutional Tradition|url=https://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/centres/nzcpl/publications/nz-journal-of-public-and-international-law/previous-issues/volume-121,-september-2014/Jones.pdf|journal=New Zealand Journal of Public and International Law|volume=11:3|pages=187-204|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice:

{{quote|Mana and tapu are concepts which have both been attributed single-worded definitions by contemporary writers. As concepts, especially Maori concepts they can not easily be translated into a single English definition. Both mana and tapu take on a whole range of related meanings depending on their association and the context in which they are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/h/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/mana-and-tapu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522222543/http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/h/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/mana-and-tapu |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-05-22 |title=Mana and Tapu |publisher=Ministry of Justice, New Zealand  |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===={{anchor|In general usage}}General use====
In contemporary [[New Zealand English]], the word "mana", taken from the Māori, refers to a person or organisation of people of great personal prestige and character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=357 |title=Kiwi (NZ) to English Dictionary |publisher=New Zealand A to Z |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of the term mana in New Zealand society is as a result of the [[politicisation]] of Maori issues stemming from the [[Māori Renaissance]]. 

=={{anchor|In fantasy}}Gaming and literature==
{{main article|Magic (gaming)}}

[[Larry Niven]] adopted the term in his 1969 short story, [[All the Myriad Ways|"Not Long Before the End"]].  In this and subsequent stories, "mana" was the magical fuel used to cast spells. It was a non-renewable environmental resource; heavy use of magic could deplete the mana in an area.

Following on from the idea of mana as something that could be "used up", fantasy [[role-playing game]]s and video games adopted the term to quantify "magical power."&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golub |first1=Alex |title=The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic |url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620052259/http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic|dead-url=no |archive-date=20 June 2014 |website=theappendix.net |publisher=The Appendix |accessdate=4 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic points (MPs) were used by ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'' and games influenced by it, and for example the 1987 video game ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'' replaced "magic points" with "mana points" as the definition of MPs.

Mana was used in a number of early role-playing [[board game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Matt|last2=P.

Missionary [[Robert Henry Codrington]] traveled widely in [[Melanesia]], publishing several studies of its language and culture. His 1891 book ''The Melanesians: Studies in their Anthropology and Folk-Lore'' contains the first detailed description of mana. Codrington defines it as "a force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control".&lt;ref name="Codrington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Codrington|first1=Robert Henry|title=The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folk-lore|date=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=New York|isbn=9780486202587|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Melanesians:+Studies+in+Their+Anthropology+and+Folklore.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TxDYVJHlGIHZggSm0YL4BA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His era had already defined [[animism]], the concept that the energy (or life) in an object derives from a spiritual component. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]]'s 18th-century animism was adopted by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], the founder of [[cultural anthropology]], who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 ''Researches into the Early History of Mankind''&lt;ref name="Tylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylor|first1=Edward B.|title=Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=1108017517}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} and developed them in volumes one (1871) and two (1874) of ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Tylor's cultural evolution===
In Tylor's [[cultural anthropology]], other [[primate]]s (from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved) did not appear to possess culture.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The discovery that primates and other mammals [[animal culture|have some culture]] (practical knowledge taught by parents who learned it from their parents) does not substantially affect the argument, since humanity's characteristically-complex learned behaviour is unique.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor did not try to find evidence of a non-cultural human state because he considered it unreachable, "a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals" and "savage life as in some sort representing an early known state."&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|33}} He described such a hypothetical state as "the human savage naked in both mind and body, and destitute of laws, or arts, or ideas, and almost of language".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|30}} According to Tylor, speculation about an acultural state is impossible. Using the method of [[Comparative cultural studies|comparative culture]], similar to [[comparative anatomy]] and the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method of historical linguistics]] and following [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits ([[meme]]s and [[memeplex]]es): savage and civilised. Tylor wrote, "From an ideal point of view, civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society ... "&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|24}} and identified his model with the "progression-theory of civilization".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

===Evolution of religion===
Tylor cited a "minimum definition" of religion as "the belief in Spiritual Beings".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|108–110}} He used the word "animism" in two different senses.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|385}} The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy, shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which [[comparative religion]] attempts to reconstruct.

Tylor's work predated Codrington's, and he was unfamiliar with the latter. The concept of mana occasioned a revision of Tylor's view of the evolution of religion. The first anthropologist to formulate a revision (which he called "pre-animistic religion") was [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], in a series of papers collected and published as ''Threshold of Religion''. In its preface he takes credit for the adjective "pre-animistic" but not the noun "pre-animism", although he does not attribute it.&lt;ref name="Marett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marett|first1=Robert Randolph|title=Threshold of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Hardpress Ltd|location=|isbn=1313151963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

According to Marett, "Animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion." Tylor had used the term "natural religion",&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|386}} consistent with Georg Ernst Stahl's concept of a natural spiritual energy. The soul of an animal, for example, is its vital principle. Marett wrote, "One must dig deeper" to find the "roots of religion".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==={{anchor|Pre-animistic phase of religion}}Pre-animism===
Describing pre-animism, Marett cited the Melanesian mana (primarily with Codrington's work): "When the science of Comparative Religion employs a native expression such as mana ... it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning ... Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ... ".&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} In Melanesia the ''animae'' are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits "of ghost-like appearance" or imitating living people. Spirits can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|115–120}}

The most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from, and exists independently of, its source. ''Animae'' act only through mana. It is impersonal, undistinguished, and (like energy) transmissible between objects, which can have more or less of it. Mana is perceptible, appearing as a "Power of awfulness" (in the sense of awe or wonder).&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Objects possessing it impress an observer with "respect, veneration, propitiation, service" emanating from the mana's power. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: "startling manifestations of nature", "curious stones", animals, "human remains", blood,&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|2}} thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and the sound of a [[bullroarer]].&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|14–17}}

If mana is a distinct power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the ''anima''). An ''anima'' may have departed, leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a "rudimentary religion" or "magico-religious" phase in which the mana figures without ''animae'', "no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|xxvi}} Like Tylor, he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and pre-animism identified with the [[supernatural]]—the "mysterious", as opposed to the reasonable.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

==={{anchor|Criticisms}}Criticism===
In 1936, [[Ian Hogbin]] criticised the universality of Marett's pre-animism: "Mana is by no means universal and, consequently, to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious".&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogbin|first1=H. Ian|title=MANA|journal=Oceania|date=March 1936|volume=6|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.1936.tb00187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marett intended the concept as an abstraction.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} Spells, for example, may be found "from Central Australia to Scotland."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Early 20th-century scholars also saw mana as a universal concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy. In his 1904 essay, "Outline of a General Theory of Magic", [[Marcel Mauss]] drew on the writings of Codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as "power ''par excellence'', the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them".&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauss|first1=Marcel|title=A General Theory of Magic|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415253963|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the [[Iroquois]] [[orenda]] and the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] [[manitou]], convinced of the "universality of the institution";&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|116}} "a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere".&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Mauss and his collaborator, [[Henri Hubert]], were criticised for this position when their 1904 ''Outline of a General Theory of Magic'' was published. "No one questioned the existence of the notion of mana", wrote Mauss's biographer [[Marcel Fournier]], "but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension".&lt;ref name="Fournier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fournier|first1=Marcel|title=Marcel Mauss: A Biography|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691117775|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, not everyone has it, and "even among the varying formulae (''mana'', ''wakan'', ''orenda'', etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies".&lt;ref name="Eliade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Patterns in Comparative Religion|date=1996|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803267336|page=22|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research".&lt;ref name="Eliade2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myths, Dreams and Mysteries: The Encounter Between Contemporary Faiths and Archaic Realities|date=1992|publisher=Peter Smith|location=Magnolia, Massachusetts|isbn=9780844666259|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Coal Research''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung}}) is an institute located in [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]], [[Germany]] specializing in [[chemistry|chemical research]] on [[catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |URL=http://kofo.mpg.de/en/institute/general-information|title=General information |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft''). Founded in 1912 as the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research]] (''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung'') in [[Mülheim an der Ruhr]] to study the chemistry and uses of coal, it became an independent Max Planck Institute in 1949.

==Research==
The Institute carries out basic research in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], in [[homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous]] and [[heterogeneous catalysis]] as well as in [[theoretical chemistry]]. The principal aim is to develop new methods for the selective and environmentally benign preparation of new compounds and materials.

The MPI KoFo has been at the forefront of research in chemistry since its formation. One of these is the development of the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] through the efforts of [[Franz Joseph Emil Fischer|Franz Fischer]] and [[Hans Tropsch]] in 1925 when the institute was still organized as the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Kohlenforschung''. [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Karl Ziegler]] also worked at the institute alongside [[Hans-Georg Gellert]], one of his former students, to discover aufbau reaction (''Aufbaureaktion'') or growth reaction among [[Organoaluminium chemistry|aluminum alkyl compounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/institute/history |title=History of the institute |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

===Organic Synthesis===
Research in the Organic Synthesis Department, led by [[Manfred T. Reetz]], involves the introduction of [[molecular biology]] into [[Organic chemistry#Organic synthesis|synthetic organic chemistry]] in the quest to exploit directed evolution of [[stereoselectivity|stereoselective]] [[enzymes]] as catalysts in [[enantioselective synthesis|asymmetric reactions]]. The goals include the implementation of efficient molecular biological strategies and techniques for probing [[Protein sequencing|protein sequence]] [[Sequence space (evolution)|space]] rapidly and the development of high-throughput screening systems for evaluating stereoselectivity and [[thermostability]] of [[enzyme]] [[mutation|mutants]]. Current challenges include selective C-C and C-H activating oxidations of simple and complex organic compounds as well as hydrolytic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/organic-synthesis |title=Organic synthesis |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homogeneous Catalysis===
The Homogeneous Catalysis Department, led by {{ill|Benjamin List|de}}, focuses on the development of new catalysis concepts within the areas of [[organocatalysis]], [[transition metals|transition metal]] catalysis, and, to some extent, [[biocatalysis]]. Since 1999, the group concentrates on [[Enantioselective synthesis#Enantioselective catalysis|enantioselective organocatalysis]] as a fundamental approach complementing biocatalysis and transition metal catalysis. They have a profound interest in developing “new reactions”, designing and identifying new principles for the development of organocatalysts, expanding the scope of already developed catalysts such as [[proline]], using organocatalysis in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals, and also investigating the mechanism by which organocatalysts activate their substrates. Furthermore, in 2005 the department has first conceptualized another approach to asymmetric catalysis, namely [[Asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis|Asymmetric Counteranion-Directed Catalysis]] (ACDC). This idea has not only progressed within the department but also at other institutions around the globe into a general strategy for asymmetric synthesis applied in organocatalysis as well as in transition metal catalysis and [[Lewis acids and bases#Lewis acids|Lewis acid]] catalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/homogeneous-catalysis- |title=Homogeneous catalysis |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterogeneous Catalysis===
The Heterogeneous Catalysis Department, led by [[Ferdi Schüth]], is concentrated on the [[Inorganic chemistry|synthesis and characterization of inorganic materials]] with an application focus in heterogeneous catalysis. Especially important are high surface area materials with controlled [[porosity]] and nanostructured catalysts. Reactions studied include model reactions, such as [[carbon monoxide]] [[carbon monoxide#Bond polarity and oxidation state|oxidation]], and energy relevant conversions, i.e. methane activation, biomass conversion, ammonia decomposition and catalyzed hydrogen storage. This research is supported by studies into the fundamental processes governing solids formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/heterogeneous-catalysis |title=Heterogeneous catalysis |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organometallic Chemistry===
The Organometallic Chemistry Department, led by [[Alois Fürstner]], is focused on the development and understanding of organometallic reagents and catalysts, as well as on their application to the synthesis of structurally complex targets of biological significance. Particular attention is paid to the development and validation of catalytic methods for [[Carbon–carbon bond]] formation. Long term projects of current interest concern [[Olefin metathesis|alkene]] and [[Alkyne metathesis|alkyne]] metathesis, the development and use of pi-acids (platinum, gold etc.), iron catalysis and [[Coupling reaction|cross coupling]] in general. Moreover, the group is engaged in the development of novel donor [[ligands]], including [[carbenes]] and compounds containing formally "zerovalent" carbon atoms. All methods are scrutinized by applications to the total synthesis and "diverted total synthesis" of natural products and pharmaceutically active compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/organometallic-chemistry |title=Organometallic chemistry |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Chemistry===
The Theoretical Chemistry Department, led by [[Walter Thiel]], focuses on theoretical developments that extend the scope of [[computational chemistry|computational methodology]], especially for large molecules, and applies theoretical methods to study specific chemical problems, mostly in close cooperation with experimental partners. The activities of the group cover a broad methodological spectrum such as [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]], [[density functional theory]], [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semiempirical methods]] and combined [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]]/[[Molecular mechanics|molecular mechanical]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.kofo.mpg.de/en/research/theoretical-chemistry |title=Theoretical chemistry |author=Max Planck Institute for Coal Research |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media evaluation''' is a discipline of the [[social science]]s and centres on the analysis of media content rating the exposure using a number of pre-designated criteria commonly including tonal value and presence of key messages. It is said to be one of the fastest growing areas of [[mass communications]] research. 

[[The International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication (AMEC)]] is the industry appointed trade body for companies and individuals involved in research, measurement and evaluation in editorial media coverage and related communications issues. To be a full member of [http://www.amecorg.com/ AMEC], companies must be able to a) offer comprehensive media evaluation, research and interpretation services, b) been in business for at least two years and c) have media evaluation turnover in excess of £150,000 when applying.

'''Minatec''' (initially called the '''Mi'''cro and '''Na'''no'''tec'''hnology Innovation Centre) is a vast complex specializing in [[Nanotechnology|micro-nano technologies]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. 

The centre was launched in June 2006 as a partnership between '''[[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|LETI]]''' (the Electronics and Information Technologies Laboratory of [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|CEA]], the French Atomic Energy Commission) and by [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]. The site was already home to LETI, Europe's top centre for applied research in microelectronics and nanotechnology. Minatec combines a physical research campus with a network of companies, researchers and engineering schools. It was launched to foster technology transfer, with real-life applications in energy and communications, among others.
 
The complex is home to 3,000 researchers, 1,200 students, and 600 technology transfer experts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minatec.com/en/minatec&lt;/ref&gt;  on a state-of-the-art 20-hectare campus offering 10,000 square metres for [[cleanroom]] space.

The Minatec campus has dedicated special-events facilities (900 m²), ranging from 20-person conference rooms to a 400-seat amphitheater. These spaces are available to researchers for their scientific events such as the international conference Nanosafe held every two years since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.materials.cea.fr/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Seminaires/index.php?id=36 Fifth Nanosafe International Conference - Nanosafe 2016 - MINATEC, Grenoble, France.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita Art Museum) 3.jpg|thumb|x150px|First painting of the Fujita scroll showing two courtiers on the balcony of a building and men lighting torches in the garden outside the house.]]
The {{nihongo|'''''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'''''|紫式部日記絵巻|Murasaki Shikibu nikki emaki}} is a mid-13th century [[emaki]], a Japanese picture scroll, inspired by the [[The Diary of Lady Murasaki|private diary]] (''[[Nikki Bungaku|nikki]]'') of [[Murasaki Shikibu]], [[lady-in-waiting]] at the 10th/11th centuries Heian court and author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. This emaki belongs to the classical style of [[Japanese painting]] known as ''[[yamato-e]]'' and revives the iconography of the [[Heian period]].

Today there remain four paper scrolls of the emaki in varying condition and stored in different collections: Hachisuka, Matsudaira, Hinohara scrolls ([[Tokyo]]), and Fujita scroll ([[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Osaka]]).&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131"&gt;{{harvnb|Okudaira|1973|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the extant scrolls, the first relates the celebrations on occasion of the birth of prince Atsunari (Atsuhira, later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]]) in 1008 and the last those of the birth of Prince Atsunaga (later [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]]) in 1009. This difference in time indicates that the original emaki most likely consisted of more scrolls than exist today.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"&gt;{{citation

== Description ==
{{nihongo|''[[The Diary of Lady Murasaki]]''|紫式部日記|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki}} records the daily life of the [[Heian era]] lady-in-waiting and writer, [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki Shikibu]], author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Most likely written between 1008 and 1010, the largest portion consists of descriptive passages of the birth of [[Empress Shōshi]]'s (Akiko) children (future Emperors [[Emperor Go-Ichijō|Go-Ichijō]] and [[Emperor Go-Suzaku|Go-Suzaku]]) and related festivities, with smaller [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] describing life at the Imperial court and relations between other ladies-in-waiting and court writers such as [[Izumi Shikibu]], [[Akazome Emon]] and [[Sei Shōnagon]].&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt; It also gives a lively account of the regency of the powerful [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]].&lt;ref name="Hempel-p203"/&gt; Like the romantic novel Genji Monogatari, the diary deals with emotions and human relationships, particularly with Murasaki Shikibu's constraints at the court of Akiko, loneliness and futility after her husband's death (in 1001).&lt;ref name="mason-p30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author is critical of her contemporaries, the men for their discourteous ways (including Fujiwara no Michinaga) and the women for their inexperience and lack of education and will.&lt;ref name="Keene99.42"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Donald |last1=Keene  |title=Travelers of a Hundred Ages: The Japanese as revealed through 1000 years of diaries |publisher =[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1999 |pages=42–46 |isbn=978-0-231-11437-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diary is considered a masterpiece of [[Nikki Bungaku]].&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;

Emaki, which are long paper scrolls telling a story through texts and paintings, came to Japan through exchange with the Chinese Empire around the 6th century and spread widely among the Heian aristocracy.  The subsequent [[Kamakura period]] was marked by internal strife and civil wars that fostered the rise of the warrior class. If the warriors of the ''[[bakufu]]'' preferred "quick-moving narrative scrolls" such as war tales or legends, the production of emaki at the Heian court subsisted. Pictures illustrating ''The Tale of Genji'' continued to be popular into the early Kamakura period and revived interest in the author, Murasaki Shikibu. Towards the end of the 13th century, a renewed interest in the refined culture of the Heian period led some artists to return to painting styles of the Imperial Court; many emaki were produced during this period.&lt;ref name="mason-p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'' belongs to this golden age of the emaki and according to Penelope Mason "may be regarded as one of the finest extant examples of prose-poetry narrative illustration from the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] period".&lt;ref name="mason-p29"/&gt; It was created about 200 years after the diary was written, in the mid-13th century.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Suzuki Keizō, a scholar of the history of costume dated it to around 1250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murase96.163"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Miyeko |last1=Murase|title=L’art du Japon|language=French|trans-title=Japanese Art|publisher=Éditions LGF - Livre de Poche|series=La Pochothèque| year=1996 |pages=163–164 |isbn=2-253-13054-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.193"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|2001|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clasica.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=144&amp;PHPSESSID=a002ac85757493eaae8791c0849f1324 |script-title=ja:紫式部日記繪詞 |trans-title=Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki |publisher=Clasica |language=Japanese |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425122936/http://clasica.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=144&amp;PHPSESSID=a002ac85757493eaae8791c0849f1324 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It transcribes the solitude and the observations of palace life from the diary but adds to the text a certain nostalgia for the glorious past of the Heian court which is typical for the 13th century, giving an overall feeling of "lost golden age", according to Mason, even during happy events such as parties.&lt;ref name="mason-p183" /&gt; The explanatory notes (or captions), i.e. the non-painting part, show little textual deviations from  the diary.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;

An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is mentioned in the ''[[Meigetsuki]]'' ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar [[Fujiwara no Teika]]. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to [[Cloistered rule|cloistered]] [[Emperor Go-Horikawa]] planned to create a new emaki of ''The Tale of Genji'' (after the 12th century [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]], the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter [[Fujiwara Nobuzane]] and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frederic05.207"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Louis |last1=Frédéric |title=Japan encyclopedia |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2005 |page=207 |isbn=0-674-01753-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC |accessdate=2011-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and composition ==
Two elements  are found in the illustrations of the emaki: people indoors engaging in activities typical of the aristocracy of the period,  such as writing letters, playing instruments, exchanging poems or talking to each other; and the gardens outside their buildings. For this reason,  Mason calls the people in the emaki "house bound".&lt;ref name="mason-p22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leftward direction of scroll reading is reflected in the composition of paintings and pictures which may build to a climax from right to left;  or a main event presented on the right may be followed by its after-effects to the left.&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt; Stylistically the emaki follows the principles of the ''onna-e'' genre of ''[[yamato-e]]'' and is in this respect similar to the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki|Tale of Genji Scrolls]] (1120–1140) but differs from them in many other aspects.&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murase96.163" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.53"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical for ''onna-e'', the paintings depict life at the palace with a sense of nostalgia, timeless and very retained, but purely decorative elements such as landscapes and contemplative scenes are added.&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194" /&gt; Illustrations are relatively short&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the case of the Genji Monogatari Emaki, {{convert|43|cm|abbr=on}} on average.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to emaki of war or folktales,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Where a single scene could be more than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} long&lt;/ref&gt; which according to Mason, "heightens the symbolic quality of non-figural motifs".&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt;

The painting technique of ''tsukuri-e'' ("built painting"), used mainly in emaki of the court in the twelfth century, is also used here.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt; It is done in three stages: a first sketch of the scene is made with [[India ink|Indian ink]] (probably by a master of the workshop), then the color is applied on the entire surface of the paper in a specific order, from large areas in the background to fine details. Finally, the contours are enhanced or revived in ink to emphasize the depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/t/tsukurie.htm |title=Tsukuri-e |publisher=[[JAANUS]] (Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System) |accessdate =2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a visible change in style may again be noted, because the pigments are here less opaque than usual, and the more subtle shades are highlighted by fine outlines in ink; and in addition, the decorative aspect emerges strongly through extensive use of gold dust, and sometimes of silver.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt; According to Mason, the technique seems to be less careful than in the past, as can be seen in elements of the architectural interior (sliding doors, screens ...) which lack detail or in the silver powder which is used much less often in general compared to gold.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;

The cultural changes after the Heian period resulted in a more realistic depiction of figures including movements and gestures.&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;
Abandoning the Heian period ''[[hikime kagibana]]'' style ("slit eyes, hooked nose"),&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;technique of representing the faces with four lines on a white background, similar to [[Noh]] masks to mark the extreme reclusiveness of the aristocrats&lt;/ref&gt; figures were painted individual features and facial expressions that  conveyed emotions and moods.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194" /&gt; More generally, M. Murase notes that the expression of feelings subtly changed compared to the scrolls of the 12th century; here the rooms (or the inner space, because it depends on the fusuma) in the palace are larger and less intimate or private, and nobles come and go naturally and determined.&lt;ref name="Murase96.163" /&gt; Unlike earlier scrolls such as the Genji Emaki, in which architecture and landscape were used as metaphors for people's emotions, interpersonal or societal pressures, in these scrolls the people's feelings are painted directly on the faces or shown through gestures, in addition to being expressed by the placement of characters within the scene. Architectural elements such as pillars, beams or platforms continued to be used to convey moods. Landscapes stand on their own as they are detached from the characters' emotions and gain a new function as a place to escape from the constraints of court life.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most emaki, the composition is based on the ''fukinuki yatai'' ("blown-off roof") technique, which consists of a [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of looking down from above into the inner spaces resulting in a plunging view. Furthermore, diagonals are used to mark depth.  Compared to earlier scrolls, in these scrolls, the interior spaces are depicted from a more normal perspective such as through rolled up bamboo blinds (''misu''&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt;) or spaces in the walls where sliding panels (''[[fusuma]]'') had been removed.&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt; The pace that is intentionally slow in ''tsukuri-e'', here seems slightly faster with illustrations depicting a single occurrence in time and temporally related events positioned close to each other in the emaki.&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.64"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |id=Okudaira73 |p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new decorative approach to paintings of the court (''onna-e'') inspired by the themes of literature is evident in several other works of the Kamakura period, such as [[uta monogatari (literature)|uta monogatari]] (e.g. ''[[The Tales of Ise]] Emaki''), [[tsukuri monogatari]] (e.g. ''[[Sumiyoshi Monogatari]] Emaki'') and romances (e.g. {{nihongo|Lord Takafusa's Love Songs|隆房卿艶詞絵巻|Takafusa Kyō tsuya kotoba emaki}}).&lt;ref name="mason-p29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|2001|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.33"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |id=Okudaira73 |p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
The illustrations provide insight into life and festivities at the [[Heian Palace]]; which sometimes consisted of something as simple as games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently at the time of manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]] or the [[Pillow Book Emaki]] (''Makura no Sōshi Emaki'') they provide valuable information on the architectural [[shinden-zukuri]] style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and traditional Japanese influences.&lt;ref name="mason-p107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Extant scrolls==
It is thought that the emaki originally consisted of 10–12 scrolls.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt; The ancestral heritage of the emaki before the [[Edo period]] is not known and an investigation conducted during the [[Meiji period]], found that only four scrolls had survived, each {{convert|21.0|cm|abbr=on}} high and about {{convert|4.5|-|5.4|m|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; The owners and state of preservation of all four scrolls has since changed.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; The extant parts correspond to about 15 percent of the original diary and are not in sequence.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt; They consist of 24 scenes of varying widths distributed among three scrolls, six single sheets and two hanging scrolls in six different locations: [[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Gotoh Museum]], [[Tokyo National Museum]] and three private collections.&lt;ref name="Hempel-p203"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hempel|first=Rose|title=The golden age of Japan, 794-1192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT7rAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2011-10-29|year=1983|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=978-0-8478-0492-4|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scroll begins with a text section and generally alternates scene descriptions with illustrations, ending with a painting. In two instances a long text section is split in two parts&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;3rd text of Hachisuka and 4th text of Hinohara scroll.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hachisuka scroll has an accumulation of three illustrations&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Paintings 3, 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; unseparated by text, and an accumulation of two unseparated independent text sections.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Texts 6 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hachisuka scroll===
Chronologically the oldest scenes of the emaki, combined with some of the later anecdotes in the diary, are contained in the Hachisuka scroll. Named after its former owner, the [[Hachisuka clan]], rulers of the [[Tokushima Domain]] in [[Awa Province (Tokushima)|Awa Province]], this scroll is privately owned. It consists of eight illustrations and seven text sections on 16 paper sheets.&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The long third text section is split in two parts and followed by three illustrations. The seventh text section immediately follows the sixth without a painting between the two. The full scroll is {{convert|537.5|cm|abbr=on}} long and has been designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]]. Scenes 1–5 correspond to a continuous part of the diary and are the oldest diary entries represented by any of the four extant emaki scrolls. Scenes 6 and 7 correspond to later diary entries and appear in the diary after several of the scenes described in the other three extant scrolls.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Third day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - painting 1).gif|thumb|left|Nobles offering congratulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitool.amherst.edu:8881/R/C1EGFH2VE36NBIQHS6V2A3RBCI8D6YIEA9C94UAY6L495D3ND3-00196?func=results-jump-full&amp;set_entry=000008&amp;set_number=000665&amp;base=3036 |title=Diary of Murasaki Shikibu   Section 1 (Right)   Nobles Offer Congratulations |work=Amherst College Library, Digital Collections |publisher=[[Amherst College]] |accessdate=2011-11-27 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Hachisuka scroll starts with a description of a banquet given by the queen's [[majordomo]] and managed by the governor of [[Ōmi Province]] on [[Kankō]] 5, 9th month, 13th day (October 14, 1008), the third night of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]]. On that occasion, the mother, [[Empress Shōshi]] received presents such as baby clothes and furniture. The illustration associated with this scene shows court nobles on the balconies outside of the principal building in which the queen is located.&lt;ref name="diary-p85-86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emak HachisukaS.jpg|thumb|right|Fourth painting (right), fifth painting (middle) and fourth text section (left)]]
The second to fifth scenes of the Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008). On that day, the prime minister and baby's grandfather, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]], celebrates the birth. In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was joyful and happy. Tables with rice balls ([[mochi]]) were placed in the garden, the full moon shone beautifully and torches made the scene as bright as in daylight. There is one illustration following this scene.&lt;ref name="diary-p86-87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third text is split in two parts, followed by three illustrations. The text contains a detailed description of how the dinner was served to the queen including the names of the maids of honour and their father's names. The ladies who had not been selected to attend "wept bitterly".

The relatively short fourth scene describes that the maids of honour exit from the queen's room which had been partitioned off by ''misu''&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"&gt;a thinly woven bamboo curtain hung before great people and women's apartments&lt;/ref&gt; entering the torch-lit garden. It also gives more details and an interpretation of the dress of one of those maids, Lady Oshikibu.&lt;ref name="diary-p88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - priest).jpg|thumb|right|The seventh painting, located between the 5th (right) and 6th (left) text sections]]
The short fifth passage is a continuation of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: ''You cannot see such a lovely thing every day'', to which he replies: ''Indeed! indeed!'' clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen.&lt;ref name="diary-p88"/&gt;

====Our lady of the chronicle====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - Bai Juyi).jpg|thumb|left|Murasaki Shikibu (right) reading to Empress Shōshi (left). A scroll of {{nihongo|Bai Juyi's poetry anthology|白氏文集|Hakushi Monjū}} is spread on a [[maki-e]] writing desk between them.]]
This anecdote, the sixth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, occurs at an unspecified date in 1009. It is part of a description of the lady Saemon no Naishi who, Murasaki Shikibu writes in the diary, hated her. Naishi spread the rumour that Murasaki Shikibu was proud of her Chinese learning (which in the [[Heian period]] was the domain of the male aristocracy) and gave her the name "Japanese Chronicle Lady".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;After the [[Shoku Nihongi|Chronicles of Japan]] written in Classical Chinese.&lt;/ref&gt; In the anecdote, Murasaki Shikibu explains she learned Chinese in childhood, that she was taught not to be proud of  her learning, keeping it a secret during her life in fear of how others would judge her. The text in the emaki relates how [[Empress Shōshi]] requested that Murasaki Shikibu read to her in Chinese and teach her the poetical works of [[Bai Juyi]] (in particular the part known as {{nihongo||新楽府|shingafu}}) in secrecy. Nevertheless, the Emperor and Prime Minister found out about it and presented to the Empress a number of poetical works.&lt;ref name="diary-p135-136"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gosechi dancers====
This final scene in the Hachisuka scroll is about a scene from the Gosechi, an ancient dance performed by young beautiful girls in the 11th month to celebrate the harvest.&lt;ref name="Mostow1996-p178"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mostow|first=Joshua S.|title=Pictures of the heart: the Hyakunin isshu in word and image|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0KcAwrVksQC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=2011-11-30|year=1996|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1705-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emaki text begins  with a description of the appearance and clothing of two of the participating girls and ends with a scene in which the girls throw down their fans as the secretaries of the sixth rank approached them to take away their fans. Murasaki Shikibu considered the dancers graceful but unlike girls.&lt;!-- clarify here? not sure what she means here. the text in my translation reads: "Though they were graceful they did not seem like girls." perhaps check with Bowring --&gt; This particular scene is set on Kankō 5, 11th month, 22nd day (December 22, 1008).&lt;ref name="diary-p115-116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Painting only scenes====
The Hachisuka scroll contains paintings which are not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the [[Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki#Thinking of the first time at court|second text section of the Hinohara scroll]], where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed ''[[tsumado]]'' (hinged plank door) and ''[[shitomido]]'' (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick on top of it (''[[tōdai (light)|tōdai]]'').&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For a reproduction as relief see the lower image on [http://kakitutei.web.fc2.com/murasaki/etizen/bridge2.html this page].&lt;/ref&gt;

The final illustration of the Hachisuka scroll has no corresponding text section in the extant emaki fragments. However its content can be matched to a scene from the diary in which Murasaki Shikibu expresses her sorrows as a widow&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Her husband had died in 1001.&lt;/ref&gt; worrying about the future. She relates how she is gazing dreamily at the moon when she is "hopelessly sad" and lonely. Playing the [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] (a kind of horizontal harp) on a cool evening makes her even more miserable. This section of the diary also contains a short description of her room containing two bookcases, one with books that her husband had placed there and that no one has touched since, the other with "old poems and romances", likely referring to her own works. This scene is set on an unknown date in [[Kankō]] 6 (1009). The illustration present in the emaki&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For a reproduction as relief see the upper image on [http://kakitutei.web.fc2.com/murasaki/etizen/bridge2.html this page]. For a recent reproduction of the painting see [http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-1.htm this image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525165712/http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-1.htm# |date=2012-05-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a tatami room playing the koto with a court lady walking outside her room on the balcony (''[[engawa]]'').&lt;ref name="diary-p132-133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fujita scroll===
Formerly in possession of the {{nihongo|[[Akimoto clan]]|秋元家}}, rulers of the [[Tatebayashi Domain]] in [[Kōzuke Province]], the extant Fujita scroll alternates five sections of text and five paintings. Based on this ancestral heritage it is sometimes referred to as former Akimoto scroll.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; A sixth text only section has been preserved as a 19th-century copy from the original emaki. The extant scroll is {{convert|434.0|cm|abbr=on}} long, in possession of the [[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Osaka]] and was designated as [[National Treasure of Japan]] on June 28, 1956.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbookXI"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ohishi|1990|p=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the time from the evening of the 5th day celebration of the birth of the first Imperial Prince, Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]], and ends with the furnishing of Michinaga's residence for the visit of [[Emperor Ichijō]].&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ohishi|1990|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki Fujita Art Museum 2ndpaint.JPG|thumb|x150px|right|Second painting.]]
Set shortly after the fifth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, this scene relates events from the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008), the day Michinaga celebrated the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō. Some people were casting ''da''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A gambling game played with dice now not known.&lt;/ref&gt; others composed poems. Murasaki Shikibu then praises [[Fujiwara no Kintō]]'s repartee and skills in the composition of poetry; however on this evening he did not participate in the exchange of poems. The queen gave gift of robes and baby dresses to the highest ranked ladies; lined kimonos to those of 4th rank; and [[hakama]] to the lesser sixth ranked ladies.&lt;ref name="diary-p89-90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A boating party====
The second section is a direct continuation of the previous scene, recounting an outing of young courtiers, dressed in white, going boating on a moonlit night the following day (Kankō 5, 9th month, 16th day, or 17 October 1008 in the Gregorian calendar). The ladies left behind appeared jealous according to Murasaki Shikibu.&lt;ref name="diary-p90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Fujita Art Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Ox-drawn carts of Emperor's ladies-in-waiting (illustration of the 3rd scene)]]
Continuing from the previous scene, confusion occurs among the people in the boats as palanquins of ladies-in-waiting of the Emperor's court appear near the shelter for conveyances. Michinaga welcomes them happily and distributes gifts among them.&lt;ref name="diary-p90-91"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth celebration organized by the Imperial Court====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita - A).jpg|right|thumb|x150px|Murasaki Shikibu (center) catches a glimpse at the Empress (left) with undone hair beyond the ''misu''.&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt;]]
The Emperor celebrated on Kankō 5, 9th month, 17th day (October 18, 1008), the seventh day of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō. Presents were exchanged between court nobles and the Emperor. During the evening ceremony, Murasaki Shikibu catches a glance of the queen, remarking that she appeared weary, having lost weight and gaining a pale complexion. Her "hair would be better tied up" writes Murasaki Shikibu; however she stops the description, realizing the impropriety of her depiction of the  "mother of the nation".&lt;ref name="diary-p91-92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preparations for the Imperial visit====
Set some time between Kankō 5, 10th month, 13th day and the morning of 16th day (November 13 to 16, 1008), this scene begins with a description of planting [[chrysanthemum]]s&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Chrysanthemum flowers are associated with the Imperial Family.&lt;/ref&gt; at Michinaga's mansion in preparation for the Emperor's visit. In the second part of the section, Murasaki Shikibu is musing about her melancholic life because of an "extraordinary sorrow", wishing to be more adaptable and mindless. Wondering whether she is too sinful, she yearns for a religious life. Seeing waterfowl playing heedlessly in a pond, she writes the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:
&lt;poem&gt;
Waterfowl floating on the water—
They seem so gay,
But in truth
It is not gay to live anxiously seeking means of existence.
&lt;/poem&gt;

====Day of the Imperial visit (Tanaka Shinbi copy)====
A sixth text section of the Fujita scroll has been preserved in the form of a copy from the original manuscript made by {{nihongo|Tanaka Shinbi|田中親美}} (1875–1975), researcher and collector of Japanese fine arts who also assisted in the reproduction of old writings and ancient paintings including the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]].&lt;ref name="Shinbi-nipponica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Nipponica]] |title=田中親美 |trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi |url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E/ |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher=[[Shogakukan]] }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinbi-daijirin"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Daijirin]] |title=田中親美 |trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0ss&amp;stype=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=112183000000 |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher=[[Sanseidō]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218184256/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0ss&amp;stype=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=112183000000 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinbi-kokushi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Kokushi Daijiten]] |title=田中親美|trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi|url=http://dic.search.yahoo.co.jp/search?p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=opsrch |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher= [[Yoshikawa Kobunkan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1894 he worked on the reproduction of the Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki.&lt;ref name="Shinbi-nipponica"/&gt; This text fragment does not include any illustration and is in possession of the Tanaka family.[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita Art Museum) 2.jpg|left|thumb|x150px|Final painting of the extant scroll corresponding to the sixth scene: Michinaga on the veranda of his boathouse watching courtiers enjoying themselves in the boats he has provided&lt;ref name="mason-p107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p108"/&gt;]]

The scene, which in the diary directly follows the fifth scene of the Fujita scroll, tells of an exchange of letters between Murasaki Shikibu and the Lady Koshosho. Writing her response at the time of a brisk shower in a hurry in order not to keep the messenger waiting as the "sky looked threatening", Murasaki Shikibu adds the following poem to her letter:
&lt;poem&gt;
There are pauses between the showers of the outer world,
But there is no time when my sleeves, wet with tears, are dry.
&lt;/poem&gt;
After dark she receives the following reply from Lady Koshosho:
&lt;poem&gt;
The dark sky dulls my dreamy mind,
The down-dripping rain lingers–
O my tears down falling, longing after thee!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Changing topic, Murasaki Shikibu mentions shortly that at the same day, Michinaga inspected two new boats, one with a dragon's head the other with a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] head at the prow,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Both figures were said to have magical powers to prevent ships from sinking.&lt;/ref&gt; reminding her of animated living figures. The painting located in the emaki after the fifth text section, at the end of the extant Fujita scroll and originally before the sixth scene, illustrates this inspection of boats.&lt;ref name="diary-p95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowring-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Bowring|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penelope Mason sees this diverse composition as a nostalgic representation of the 13th century Imperial Court past its golden age, as despite of the "gaiety and splendor the scene is permeated with fleeting nature of joy and pleasure."&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;

===Matsudaira or former Morikawa scroll===
In 1920 Morikawa Kanichirō (森川勘一郎, 1887–1980) from [[Nagoya]] discovered a 5-segment scroll of the ''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'' consisting of alternatingly five illustrations and five captions.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"&gt;{{harvnb|Study and research institute of old writings|1989|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NagoyaCityMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.city.nagoya.jp/tenji080301.html|title=展覧会の案内|trans-title=Exhibition information|year=2000|publisher=[[Nagoya City Museum]]|accessdate=2011-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416025830/http://www.museum.city.nagoya.jp/tenji080301.html|archivedate=2008-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly in possession of the [[Matsudaira clan]], rulers of the [[Saijō Domain]] in [[Iyo Province]], this scroll is referred to as "Matsudaira clan edition" or after its finder as "Former Morikawa edition" (not to be confused with the Morikawa edition below which refers to the Morikawa family).&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; Two years after discovery Morikawa sold the scroll to the [[Niigata prefecture|Niigata]] businessman and master of the tea ceremony, Masuda Donō (益田鈍翁, 1847－1938, who had it cut into parts.&lt;ref name="masuda dono"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Biographical Dictionary of Art]] (美術人名辞典) |title=益田鈍翁|trans-title=Masuda Donō|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E7%9B%8A%E7%94%B0%E9%88%8D%E7%BF%81 |accessdate=2011-11-07|language=Japanese |edition=online }}&lt;/ref&gt; One part (Morikawa edition), the fifth segment, is bequeathed to the Morikawa family and today in a private collection. A year later, in 1933, Donō detached the third segment and reformatted it as a [[kakemono|hanging scroll]] (now in possession of the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]). The remaining three scenes (numbers 1, 2, 4) were framed in 1934, changed owner once more, eventually (via the Takanashi family)  ending up in the collection of the [[Gotoh Museum]].&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NagoyaCityMuseum"/&gt; They are known collectively as "Gotoh edition".&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; Today's Matsudaira scroll is spread over three locations and includes one [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]] and two [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]].
While this scroll has not survived in one piece, a 20th-century reproduction measures in at {{convert|453.1|cm|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; With the exception of the first scene of the Gotoh edition, the Matsudaira clan scroll depicts events on Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the ''ika-no-iwai'',&lt;ref group="nb" name="ikanoiwai"/&gt; the 50th day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō.

====Gotoh edition====
The Gotoh edition corresponds to scenes 1, 2 and 4 of the Matsudaira clan scroll and had been partitioned off from the scroll in 1932 and 1933 by Masuda Donō. It consists of 3 paintings and 3 associated captions each framed individually (six items in total).&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; This set has been designated as National Treasure on June 28, 1956 and is located at the [[Gotoh Museum]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

=====Moonlit night=====
[[Image:2000 Yen Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|thumb|The image of Murasaki Shikibu (bottom right) on the 2000 yen bank note is taken from this scene.]]
The scene dated to [[Kankō]] 5, 10th month, 17th day (November 17, 1008), shows two drunk courtiers trying to gain entrance to Murasaki Shikibu quarters after she had enjoyed the garden outside her apartment. In the illustration, Murasaki holds her window shut against the men.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt; First to arrive at the scene is the palace steward [[Sangi (Japan)|Sangi]] {{nihongo|[[Fujiwara no Sanenari]]|藤原実成}} (on right) who opens the upper part of Murasaki's lattice door and inquires whether anybody is at home. According to Murasaki Shikibu his intention is to be mentioned to [[Empress Shōshi|Akiko]]. Sanenari is joined by the consort's steward (associated with Akiko), Sangi {{nihongo|[[Fujiwara no Tadanobu]]|藤原斉信}} who also calls out: "Is anyone here?" Murasaki replies faintly, avoiding anything that could be regarded as flirting. Together the two courtiers are requesting her to open the lower part of the door. Such behaviour, somebody of higher rank trying to enter the house of somebody of lower rank, was in the Heian period considered disgraceful and only excused by the young age of the two courtiers.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"/&gt;

In the top right corner, Murasaki's friend, the maid Saishō no Kimi, is visible.&lt;ref name="mason-p33"/&gt; The large garden occupying the left half of the painting and the  diagonally positioned building are considered to be a bold scene arrangement.&lt;ref name="gotoh-nikki-2"&gt;{{citation

The third scene held by the Gotoh museum was originally the fourth segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll. It is therefore preceded by the segment held by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and followed by the 5th segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll which is in possession of the Morikawa family. Like those segments, this scene is dated to the evening of the Ika-no-iwai&lt;ref group="nb" name="ikanoiwai"/&gt; celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō. It shows drunk and disordered court nobles amusing themselves with court ladies. This painting is particularly notable for its lifelike depiction of facial expressions and shapes of each figure in the scene.&lt;ref name="gotoh-nikki-6"&gt;{{citation

====Former Ōkura family fragment====

This item, consisting of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third scene of the Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Donō in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the Ōkura clan　(大倉家), but it is now owned by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] and in custody of the [[Tokyo National Museum]]. It was designated an Important Cultural Property on March 31, 1953.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day of the birth of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters are in full dress in a room decorated with [[kichō]] partitioners and the prince's grandfather, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] at the bottom is offering rice cake ([[mochi]]) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual. The female servant at the bottom right is presumably the author of the diary Murasaki Shikibu.&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100341/000/000?mode=simple&amp;d_lang=en&amp;s_lang=en&amp;word=murasaki&amp;class=&amp;title=&amp;c_e=&amp;region=&amp;era=&amp;century=&amp;cptype=&amp;owner=&amp;pos=1&amp;num=2 |title=Detached segment of The Diary of Lady Murasaki, emaki|publisher= [[Independent Administrative Institution National Institutes for Cultural Heritage]]|accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diary-p103-104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a single scene with a very short illustration showing the inside of a traditional Japanese style room with [[fusuma]] sliding doors, [[tatami]] and a curtain.&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Like all but the first segment of this scroll, the scene is set in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008) on occasion of the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]].&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi had been hiding from the drunken carousal of that evening, but were discovered by Michinaga, Saishō no Chūjō and others. The painting is dominated by the massive figure of Fujiwara no Michinaga dressed in brocade jacket and trousers and placed in the centre of the room.&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi are huddled near the border of the painting with heads bent down as a sign of submission and deference.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On discovering the two court ladies in hiding, Michinaga demands a poem from each of them. Murasaki being frightened and helpless in this situation recites the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:&lt;ref name="mason-p31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diary-p106-107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:On the fiftieth day how should one number those that follow?
:May the Prince's life span more than eight thousand years.

Despite being drunk, Michinaga answered quickly with another poem:

:O would I might live the life of a crane—
:Then might I reckon the years of the Prince
:Up to one thousand!

which according to Murasaki's diary "came from his innermost desire".&lt;ref name="diary-p106-107"/&gt; Based on the topic, this scene resembles the Azumaya edition of the Genji emaki where another court noble demands a response from a woman.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"/&gt;　This part of the scroll was designated [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]] on July 19, 1952.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

===Hinohara or former Hisamatsu scroll===
Formerly in possession of the [[Hisamatsu-Matsudaira clan]], a branch of the [[Matsudaira clan]] and rulers of the [[Iyo-Matsuyama Domain]], this scroll is now privately owned by the Hinohara family (日野原家). Due to this ancestral heritage it is variously referred to as "former Hisamatsu scroll" or "Hinohara scroll". The scroll is {{convert|531.6|cm|abbr=on}} long and consists of alternatingly six sections of text and six associated paintings on 13 sheets of paper.&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The fourth text part is relatively long and has been split in two.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The scroll has been designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Day of the Bird festival====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 1 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 1st painting]]
Murasaki Shikibu tells of an anecdote at the festival of the Kamo Shrine held on Kankō 5, 11th month, 28th day (December 28, 1008), the last {{nihongo|Day of the Bird|酉の日|tori no hi}}.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Last day of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] in the 11th month.&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, [[Fujiwara no Norimichi]], son of Michinaga, had the role of the Emperor's substitute. After a night of merriment, a joke is played on the [[Naidaijin]] by making him believe&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Through the content a characteristics of the present themselves.&lt;/ref&gt; that a present he had received is directly from the Empress; thus requiring an open return. Murasaki Shikibu goes on to describe how noble and dignified Norimichi looked on that day and how his nurse was overwhelmed by his appearance. In a sacred dance performed at night, the mediocre performance of one dancer who had been "very handsome last year" reminded Murasaki Shikibu "of the fleeting life of us all".&lt;ref name="diary-p119-120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration associated with this scene shows the Imperial Messenger, Fujiwara no Norimichi, his head decorated with wisteria branches on the top of a staircase of a shrine building. The [[Train (clothing)|train]] of his garment is flowing down the staircase and he is watched by three courtiers positioned near the bottom of the stairs.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=12–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thinking of the first time at court====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 2 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|x150px|left|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 2nd painting]]
Set on the evening of [[Kankō]] 5, 12th month, 29th day (January 27, 1009), in this scene, Murasaki Shikibu returns to the Imperial Court after a visit to her parents' home. As it is the anniversary of her coming to the court she is looking back at her former life nostalgically. Feeling lonely she goes to sleep murmuring the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:

:My life and the year are closing together.
:At the sound of the wind dreary is my heart.&lt;ref name="diary-p120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting following this text section shows a man on the stairs of a house and two men on a boat just outside the house. The illustration matching the scene described in the text is now the fifth painting of the Hachisuka scroll.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=15–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incident at night====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hinohara - scene 3).jpg|thumb|''All the night through, knocking louder than a water-rail, I stood in vain at the door of hinoki wood weary and lamenting.''&lt;ref name="diary-p140"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This scene from an unknown day in the year Kankō 6 (1009) shows Murasaki asleep at night in a room close to the corridor; a man is knocking on the door. Afraid to open, she spends the night without making a sound. The next morning her nightly visitor reveals himself as Michinaga through a poem he sent to her. She replies with the lines:
:A cause of deep regret, indeed,
:Had the door opened at the knocking of the water-rail!&lt;ref name="diary-p140"/&gt;

====50th day celebration of Atsunaga-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki4L.JPG|thumb|x150px|left|Courtiers carrying food on the balconies of a building.]]
Scenes four to six describe the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsunaga-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]], on Kankō 7, 1st month, 15th day (February 1, 1010). The lengthy fourth section of text is split into two parts. Murasaki Shikibu briefly mentions her friendly relationship with Lady Kokosho and that they join their rooms separating them by ''kichō'' partitions only when both are at home. This behaviour made Michinaga believe that they are gossiping about other people.&lt;ref name="diary-p142-144"/&gt;  Murasaki Shikibu then describes the day's festivities: the Queen and her audience, the clothing, names and titles of the participants which included the Emperor, the infant prince and various court ladies. Dazzled in their presence, she escapes to an inner room. As the nurse, Madam Nakadaka comes away from the Emperor and Queen under the canopy, carrying the prince in her arms, Murasaki Shikibu praises her dignified demeanour, tranquility and earnestness.&lt;ref name="diary-p142-144"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting associated with this scene shows four courtiers on the balcony (''[[engawa]]'') of a Japanese style building outside fabric enclosed rooms, which are not visible. Two of the men are shown walking, the others are kneeling and appear to be talking to a person inside the building or to be handing something to someone inside. Two of the men (one standing, one walking) carry trays with cups.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the full painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=21–22}}. For a recent reproduction of the full painting see [http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-6.htm this image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525165636/http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-6.htm# |date=2012-05-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 5 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 5th painting]]
In  the subsequent scene, the [[dais]] at which the main persons are seated, covered by ''misu'',&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt; is opened and Murasaki Shikibu notes that the people present at the event and seated around the dais on the balcony were either of high rank or court ladies.  Lower rank officials later joined them on the steps below where the royalty is seated to perform music with a lute (''[[biwa]]''), harp (''[[Koto (instrument)|koto]]'') and [[Fue|flute]] (''[[Shō (instrument)|shō]]'').&lt;ref name="diary-p144-145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting corresponding to this scene shows two ladies on the balcony with rolled up misu. Both are squeezed in the corner of the image and appear to be talking to each other.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 6 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|left|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 6th painting]]
A short text section follows, which is the final scene of the scroll and the final part of the known diary. The official musicians mentioned in the previous scene are joined by outsiders, one of which "made a mistake in the notes and was hissed". The [[Minister of the Right]] made a great mistake in praising the six-stringed koto. The emaki text (and diary) ends abruptly with mention of Michinaga's gift of flutes in two boxes.&lt;ref name="diary-p145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration to this scene shows three courtiers seated in a row on the balcony with their backs facing the outside. The left figure is shown with a Japanese harp (''koto'') in front of him, his head is turned toward the other two who appear to be concentrating on something in front of them (likely instruments).

The university has an extensive student life program, with over 1,000 student organizations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programs; student media organizations and publications, [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]]; and three student governments. Ohio State athletic teams compete in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] ([[Football Bowl Subdivision]] for football) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are known as the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]]. Athletes from Ohio State have won 100 Olympic medals ([[List of American universities with Olympic medals|44 gold, 35 silver, and 21 bronze]]). The university is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]] for the majority of sports. The [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey|Ohio State men's ice hockey]] program competes in the [[Big Ten Conference]], while its [[Ohio State Buckeyes women's ice hockey|women's hockey]] program competes in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]. In addition, the OSU men's volleyball team is a member of the [[Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (MIVA). OSU is one of only 14 universities that plays Division I FBS football and Division I ice hockey.

==History==
{{Main|History of Ohio State University}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2016}}
The proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state's agricultural interests and competition for resources from [[Ohio University]], which was chartered by the [[Northwest Ordinance]], and [[Miami University]]. Championed by the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] [[Stalwart (politics)|stalwart]] Governor [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], The Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a [[land-grant university]] under the [[Morrill Act of 1862]] as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The school was originally within a farming community on the northern edge of Columbus. While some interests in the state had hoped the new university would focus on matriculating students of various agricultural and mechanical disciplines, Hayes manipulated both the university's location and its initial board of trustees towards a more comprehensive end.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878, the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio State History and Traditions|url=https://news.osu.edu/history.html|publisher=The Ohio State University|accessdate=July 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216131558/http://news.osu.edu/history.html|archive-date=February 16, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1878, in light of its expanded focus, the Ohio legislature changed the name to "The Ohio State University", with "The" as part of its official name.&lt;ref name="arl.org"&gt;The government of Ohio, in its official web site listing the state's compiled laws: "3335.01 The Ohio State University. The educational institution originally designated as the Ohio agricultural and mechanical college shall be known as "The Ohio State University." http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3335&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio State began accepting graduate students in the 1880s, and in 1891, the school saw the founding of its law school, Moritz College of Law. It would later acquire colleges of medicine, dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine, commerce, and journalism in subsequent years. In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the [[Association of American Universities]].

[[Michael V. Drake]], former chancellor of the [[University of California, Irvine]], became the 15th president of The Ohio State University on June 30, 2014.

==Campus==
[[File:OSU William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library East Atrium.JPG|thumb|The East Atrium at the William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]]
Ohio State's {{convert|1,764|acre|adj=on}} main campus is about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} north of the city's downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] of about {{convert|11|acre|adj=off}}.&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/digitalcontent/faqs#7|title=FAQs|website=University Libraries|publisher=The Ohio State University|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four buildings are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: Hale Hall (originally Enarson Hall), [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Hayes Hall]], [[Ohio Stadium]], and [[University, Hayes and Orton Halls|Orton Hall]].
Unlike earlier public universities such as Ohio University and Miami University, whose campuses have a consistent architectural style, the Ohio State campus is a mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles.
The [[William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]], anchoring the Oval's western end, is Ohio State library's main branch and largest repository. The Thompson Library was designed in 1913 by the Boston firm of Allen and Collens in the Italianate Renaissance Revival style, and its placement on the Oval was suggested by the Olmsted brothers who had designed New York City's [[Central Park]]. In 2006, the Thompson Library began a $100 million renovation to maintain the building's classical Italian Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2009/08/03/OSU_library.ART_ART_08-03-09_A1_5NEL3IU.html|title=OSU's main library reopens today after three-year, $109 million renovation|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohio State operates the North America's 18th-largest university [[research library]] with a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Additionally, the libraries regularly receive about 35,000 serial titles. Its recent acquisitions were 16th among university research libraries in North America.&lt;ref name="arl.org"/&gt; Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include The [[Byrd Polar Research Center]] Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] and other polar research materials; The [[Hilandar Research Library]], which has the world's largest collection of [[medieval]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] manuscripts on microform; the [[Cartoon Research Library|Ohio State Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]], the world's largest repository of original cartoons; The Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute; and the archives of Senator [[John Glenn]].

[[File:Wexner.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|upright=0.7|Detail of the Wexner Center]]Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989 [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. Designed by architects [[Peter Eisenman]] of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]]'s gift of $25 million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking [[deconstructivism|deconstructivist]] architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of The Wexner Center's permanent collection is [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Nude on a black armchair|Nude on a Black Armchair]]'', which was purchased by alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]] at auction for $45 million.

To the south of the Oval is another, somewhat smaller, expanse of green space commonly referred to as the South Oval. At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone [[Greek theatre]]) and [[Mirror Lake (Ohio)|Mirror Lake]].

[[Knowlton Hall]], dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to [[Ohio Stadium]]. Knowlton Hall along with the [[Max M. Fisher College of Business|Fisher College of Business]] and Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the Northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, City and Regional Planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State's campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building's exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by Austin E. Knowlton, the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested 5 white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of [[Architecture]].&lt;ref name="herrick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|title=Knowlton Hall, Austin E.|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928002321/http://herrick.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/building/knowlton-hall-austin-e|archivedate=September 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OSU College of Medicine and Public Health|Ohio State College of Medicine]] is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the [[James Cancer Hospital]], a cancer research institute and one of the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s forty-one [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|comprehensive cancer centers]], along with [[the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital]], a research institute for cardiovascular disease.

The Konwlton Hall, home of the Architecture School, was designed by Mac Scogin Merril Elam from Atlanta along with WSA Studio from Columbus, Ohio.

Ohio State is one of a select few American universities to offer multiple area studies programs under "Comprehensive National Resource Center" (often called "Title VI") funding from the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. The most notable of these is the Center for Slavic and East European Studies founded in 1965 by Professor Leon Twarog. Subsequently, Ohio State's Middle Eastern Studies Center and East Asian Studies Center also achieved Comprehensive National Resource Center status. The university is also home to the [[interdisciplinary]] [[Mershon Center for International Security Studies]], which was founded in 1952 through a bequest of 7 million dollars (54.3 million in 2006 value) from alumnus Colonel Ralph D. Mershon. In 2003, the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] decided to base the National Academic Consortium for Homeland Security at The Mershon Center.

==== Big Ten Academic Alliance ====
Ohio State is a participant in the [[Big Ten Academic Alliance]]. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014-2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/library/reciprocal-borrowing/introduction |title=Reciprocal Library Borrowing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/purchasing-and-licensing |title=Purchasing and Licensing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course sharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/SharedCourses.aspx|title=Sharing Access to Courses|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional development]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/Leadership.aspx|title=Leadership Development|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[study abroad]] and international collaborations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/GlobalCollaborations.aspx|title=Global Collaborations|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.

===Endowment and fundraising===
Ohio State was among the first group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/99-02-05_Trustees:_Endowment_Tops_$1_Billion.html |title=Ohio State endowment tops $1 Billion 2–5–99, Ohio State News |publisher=Osu.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024611/http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/99-02-05_Trustees:_Endowment_Tops_$1_Billion.html |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of four public universities to raise a $1 billion [[financial endowment|endowment]] when it passed the $1 billion mark in 1999. At year's end 2005, Ohio State's endowment stood at $1.73 billion, ranking it seventh among public universities and 27th among all American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/FY05NESInstitutionsbyTotalAssets.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220074532/http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/FY05NESInstitutionsbyTotalAssets.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-02-20 |title=National Merit and Achievement Scholars, 1995–2004 |date=2006 |publisher=National Association of College and University Business Officers }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, the endowment passed the $2 billion mark.

In recent decades, and in response to continually shrinking state funding, Ohio State has conducted two significant multi-year [[fundraising]] campaigns. The first concluded in 1987 and raised $460 million—a record at the time for a public university. The "Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign" took place between 1995 and 2000. With an initial goal of raising $850 million, the campaign's final tally was $1.23 billion, placing Ohio State among the small group of public universities to have successfully conducted a $1 billion campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homepages.indiana.edu/022505/text/iuf.shtml |title=Top 15 Public University Endowments as of June 30, 2004 |publisher=Homepages.indiana.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928181444/http://www.homepages.indiana.edu/022505/text/iuf.shtml |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At his welcoming ceremony, returning President E.

[[File:RPAC1.png|thumb|upright=1.7|right|Recreation and Physical Activity Center (RPAC)]]
The Office of Student Life is responsible for many of the outside-the-classroom aspects of student life at Ohio State. It has more than 30 departments. Among these are student housing; dining services; health, wellness and counseling offices; the [[Ohio Union]], student activities, organizations and leadership development; recreation and intramural sports. The Office of Student Life has partnership affiliations with the [[Jerome Schottenstein Center|Schottenstein Center]], the [[Blackwell Inn]], and the [[Drake Union|Drake Events Center]]. Services supporting student wellness include the Wilce Student Health Center, named for university physician [[John Wilce]], The Mary A. Daniels Student Wellness Center and the Counseling and Consultation Service and the Recreational and Physical Activity Center (RPAC).

The Office of Student Life also oversees the operation of the RPAC. The RPAC is the main recreational facility on campus and offers over half a million square feet of recreation, aquatic, fitness, and meeting space. The RPAC features two on-campus dining locations, a 50-meter competitive pool, 12 wood courts, 10 racquetball courts, 4 squash courts, a four-lane jogging/walking track, five multipurpose rooms, and 27,500 square feet of fitness space. is also inside of the RPAC.

The [[Ohio State University Marching Band|marching band]] is also a longstanding tradition at Ohio State. It is the largest all-brass and percussion band in the world. The traditional school songs from "[[Carmen Ohio]]" to "[[Hang on Sloopy]]" to "Fight the Team Across the Field", are arranged to fit this instrumentation. The band is famous for "[[Script Ohio]]", during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word "Ohio", much like a pen writes the word, all while playing the French march "[[Le Régiment de Sambre et Meuse|Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse]]." At the end of the performance, a high-stepping senior [[sousaphone]] player "dots" the "i" in Ohio.

"Across the Field", Ohio State's fight song, and "Buckeye Battle Cry" are commonly played and sung at athletic events, as well as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]] exercises.

The tradition of high-quality bands is not limited to the football field. OSU's School of Music contains several high-quality concert bands made up of graduate and undergraduate music majors and non-music majors. The OSU Wind Symphony often receives praise on the national level and was selected to perform at the 2003 College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Convention and at the Ohio Music Educators Association Conference in 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008; the OSU Symphonic Band performed in 2007. The OSU Wind Symphony released its newest album, ''Southern Harmony'', on the [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] Label in 2009. The [[Ohio State Jazz Ensemble]] performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1975, 1978, 1986, 1996, and 2001. It also appeared at the [[Mexico City International Jazz Festival]] in 1990 and the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] in 1986, 1996, and 2001. There is also an OSU Symphony Orchestra.

In addition to strong bands, the university is recognized for outstanding choral performance. The [[Ohio State University Men's Glee Club]] was formed in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgc.osu.edu |title=OSU Men's Glee Club |publisher=Mgc.osu.edu |date= |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, led by Professor James Gallagher, the Men's Glee Club participated in the International Musical [[Eisteddfod]] in Llangollen, [[Wales]], and won the male chorus competition by an unprecedented 20 points before, in a unanimous decision of the judges, being named "Choir of the World"—the first American [[choir]] to win such an honor. Robert J. Ward directs the Glee Club. The Ohio State Women's [[Glee Club]] was established in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wgc.osu.edu |title=OSU Women's Glee Club |publisher=wgc.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the group's recent past, under the leadership of Dr. Hilary Apfelstadt, the Glee Club has been selected to sing for state and regional conferences of the Ohio Music Education Association and the American Choral Directors Association. Beginning its season under the direction of Dr. Richard Schnipke, the OSU Women's Glee Club was honored to sing for the Ohio Choral Directors Association annual conference in June 2010.

Ohio State's "[[Buckeye Bullet]]" electric car broke the world record for the fastest speed by an electric vehicle on October 3, 2004, with a speed of 271.737&amp;nbsp;mph (437.3&amp;nbsp;km/h) at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedace.info/bonneville_nationals_buckeye_bullet_timing.htm |title=Bonneville Nationals 2004 |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |publisher=Speedace }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle also holds the U.S. record for fastest electric vehicle with a speed of 314.958&amp;nbsp;mph (506.9&amp;nbsp;km/h), and peak timed mile speed of 321.834&amp;nbsp;mph (517.9&amp;nbsp;km/h). A team of engineering students from the university's "Center for Automotive Research-Intelligent Transportation" (CAR-IT) designed, built and managed the vehicle. In 2007, [[Buckeye Bullet|Buckeye Bullet 2]] was launched. This follow-up effort was a collaboration between Ohio State engineering students and engineers from the [[Ford Motor Company]] and will seek to break the land speed record for hydrogen cell powered vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.osu.edu/news/archive/2007/070711a.php|title=Buckeye Bullet 2|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this needs updated - did end up breaking land-speed records --&gt;

A unique aspect to Ohio State's multibillion-dollar endowment is the Student Investment Management Program. Upperclass finance students taking Business Finance 724 are given the opportunity to manage a twenty million dollar investment fund. Returns from the student-managed funds often outperform the [[S&amp;P 500]] and frequently even the university's own professional fund managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fisher.osu.edu/fin/sim.htm|title=Ohio State Student Investment Management Program|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, The Ohio State dissolved its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit and eliminated four positions in the unit due to concerns about mismanagement and a lack of support for survivors of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2018/07/09/ohio-state-universitys-sexual-misconduct-unit-dissolved-wake-harrowing-claims-survivors/|title=You are being redirected...|website=msmagazine.com|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after the unit was suspended in February 2018 and following an external review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.osu.edu/ohio-state-dissolves-sexual-civility-and-empowerment-unit/|title=Ohio State dissolves Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|work=Ohio State dissolves Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Columbus Dispatch'' and the school newspaper, ''The Lantern'' reported that "[SCE] failed to properly report students’ sexual-assault complaints" and that some victims were told that they were "'lying,' 'delusional,' 'suffering from mental illness,' 'have an active imagination,' that they 'didn’t understand their own experience' and also 'fabricated their story.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180619/ohio-state-closes-sexual-assault-center-fires-4-after-complaints|title=Ohio State closes sexual-assault center, fires 4 after complaints|last=Smola|first=Jennifer|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelantern.com/2018/06/ohio-state-shutting-down-sexual-civility-and-empowerment-unit/|title=Ohio State shuts down its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit|work=The Lantern|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With help from the Philadelphia law firm Cozen O'Connor, the university will be creating a new framework to handle sexual assault cases and reevaluating its Title IX program.

On July 20, 2018, the ''Associated Press'' reported that over 100 students, including male athletes from 14 sports, had reported sexual misconduct against a deceased university team physician. The reports date back to 1978 and include claims that he groped and took nude photographs of his patients. The investigation is ongoing, and four former wrestlers have filed a lawsuit against Ohio State for ignoring complaints of "rampant sexual misconduct." U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Jim Jordan (American politician)|Jim Jordan]] has been named in the lawsuit and has since denied the former wrestlers' claims that he knew about the abuse while he was an assistant coach for eight years at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jim-jordan-ohio-state-700578/|title=Rep.

===Diversity===
Ohio State's main campus has been lauded for the racial diversity of its student body. In various surveys and rankings, it has been included among the best campuses in the nation for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-95845140.html |title=Black Enterprise's 50 Best Colleges for African Americans |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Ohio State ranked 10th in the nation in 2006 for the numbers of African American doctors graduated. ''The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students'' lists Ohio State as one of the 20 best campuses in America for [[LGBT]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenbloom |first=Stephanie |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E0D71531F937A2575AC0A9609C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Is This Campus Gay-Friendly?|publisher=New York Times |date=September 14, 2006 |access-date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campus feature that helps aid student diversity is the Multicultural Center.

Ohio State, despite selective admissions, has also maintained a high amount of socio-economic diversity{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} among its students. The 2007 freshman class contained 22.7% of first-generation college students, which far exceeded the national norm on American campuses of 15.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osu.edu/news/newsitem1801|title=Ohio State University Press|publisher=|access-date=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University housing===
[[File:SCampusGateway.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|South Campus Gateway]]
Ohio State operates 38 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories) (currently include joint dorms known as Smith-Steeb and Park-Stradley), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and West Campus or "The Towers". The residence hall system has 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations. Ohio State also offers three honors residence halls: Bradley Hall, Lincoln Tower, and Taylor Tower.

Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus within the Gateway Residential Complex and the William H. Hall Student Residential Complex. Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.

Student Life University Housing also administers student residential housing on the OSU Newark, OSU Mansfield, and OSU Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) campuses.

The Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC), which is a representative body of all students living in the University's residence halls, helps evaluate and improve the living conditions of the residence halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://involvedliving.osu.edu/rhac/about-us/ |title=About Us : Involved Living |publisher=Involvedliving.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors programs===
Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability [[undergraduates]]: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors. The Scholars program is centered on thirteen specific programs such as "Architecture Scholars", "Media, Marketing, and Communications Scholars", "Biological Sciences Scholars", "International Affairs Scholars", "Business Scholars" and "Politics, Society and Law Scholars." Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program. Additionally, Ohio State offers the Honors Collegium with membership extended to ten incoming freshmen and following the Spring of a student's first or second year to the university's top undergraduates. Collegium students try to compete for internships, graduate schools and nationally competitive awards, such as the [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]], [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], or [[Truman Scholarship|Truman]] Scholarships.

Ohio State also administers two large-scale [[scholarship|scholarship programs]] to ensure access to the university to high-ability students from [[low-income]] or traditionally underrepresented groups. The first, The Young Scholars Program, was initiated in 1988. 120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school. The program offers a series of academic camps each summer and counseling throughout the students' high school careers. Upon completion of the program, which also mandates a college preparatory curriculum and minimum grade point average, the students are guaranteed admission to Ohio State as well as any need-based financial aid. The Land Grant Scholarship was initiated in 2005. This program seeks to ensure access to Ohio State to high-ability students from low-income backgrounds. Ohio State has committed to offering a full-ride scholarship each academic year to at least one student from each of [[Ohio county government|Ohio's 88 counties]].

Ohio State maintains an honors center in the Kuhn Honors and Scholars House, which served as the University President's residence until the 1960s. Three residences are designated all or in part as honors residences: Taylor Tower, Bradley Hall, and Lincoln House.

===Activities and organizations===
[[File:EnarsonHall.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Hale Hall (Original Ohio Union)]]
The [[Ohio Union]] was the first student union built by an American public university. The Ohio Union is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off the university campus. The first Ohio Union, on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. The union also housed many student services and programs, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010. During this time, student activities were relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Ohio Union|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203081517/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|archive-date=December 3, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
[[Student organizations]] at Ohio State provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including [[academic]], [[Social issues|social]], [[religious]], [[artistic]], [[community service|service-based]], [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and many more.
There are over 1,000 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|title=The Ohio State University Undergraduate Admissions and First Year Experience|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816181742/http://undergrad.osu.edu/explore/student-activities.html|archivedate=August 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's forensics team has won the state [[National Forensics Association]] tournament several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/news/00-01/294.html|title=Forensics Team Wins State Champ.|website=www.ohio.edu|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Block O|Block "O"]] is currently the largest student-run organization on the campus of Ohio State. With over 2,400 annual members, Block "O" serves as the official [[student cheering section]] at athletic events for the University. According to the Student Organization Office in the Ohio Union, Agricultural Education Society is the oldest student organization on campus. The Men's Glee Club often disputes the claim, but after consultation with Ohio Union Staff, Agricultural Education Society was named as the university's oldest organization.

Each year, students may sign-up to participate in [http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/ BuckeyeThon], Ohio State's student-led philanthropy. The organization hosts events throughout the year to support the hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplant unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/aboutus/our_beneficiary|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Nationwide Children's Hospital]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Although BuckeyeThon is operated entirely by student volunteers, it is embedded within Student Life and the Ohio State University Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|title=Word document of BuckeyeThon Constitution and Bylaws (March 2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=ohiounion.osu.edu|publisher=The Ohio State University Office of Student Life|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927044941/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/posts/studentorgs/constitutions/2015_4_14_15_46_834.docx|archive-date=September 27, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization receives support, advising, and specialized leadership training from the University. Each February, thousands of students and community members attend BuckeyeThon's signature event, a [[Dance marathon|Dance Marathon]] consisting of two separate 12-hour shifts. In the past 15 years, students have raised over $5 million to support treatment, research, and various therapies at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buckeyethon.osu.edu/events/dance_marathon|title=BuckeyeThon at The Ohio State University|website=buckeyethon.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to BuckeyeThon is the use of an operational fund separate from the main philanthropic cancer fund. As a registered non-profit, BuckeyeThon is subject to University audit and issues gift receipts through the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.giveto.osu.edu/makeagift/?fund=315502|title=Make your gift|website=www.giveto.osu.edu|access-date=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual operational fund relies on University grants, outside sponsors, and event registration fees. This allows the entirety of donations made to the cancer fund to solely support patients without hindrance from outside costs.

Ohio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. ''The Makio'' is the official yearbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |title=Makio – Ohio Union |publisher=Ohiounion.osu.edu |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218162454/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/makio/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Makio's'' sales plummeted by 60% during the early 1970s; the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and revived again in 2000 thanks to several student organizations. ''[[The Lantern]]'' is the school's daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881. ''Mosaic'' is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and [[art]]. ''The Sundial'' is a student-written and published humor magazine. Founded in 1911 it is one of the oldest humor magazines in the country. After a 17-year hiatus in which no magazine was published it has recently been revived, first in print form, and now in an online humor blog, as well as multiple social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2011/01/23/humor-mag-rises-again-at-ohio-state.html |title=Humor Magazine Lives Again |accessdate=May 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |title=Homepage of The Sundial |accessdate=May 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530175636/http://sundial.osu.edu/wordpress/ |archive-date=May 30, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio State has two improvisational comedy groups, ''The 8th Floor Improv'' and ''Fishbowl Improv'', who regularly perform long and short-form improv around campus and across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8thfloorimprov.com |title=The 8th Floor Improv |publisher=The 8th Floor Improv |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/FishbowlImprov|title=8th Floor Improv's Facebook Page|work=Facebook|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two student-run radio stations on campus. [[AROUSE]], the music station, is home to over 100 student DJs, streaming music and independent content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arouseosu.com/about.html|title=About: The Amateur Radio Organization for Student Entertainment|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio broadcasts eleven different Ohio State sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatesports.net/ |title=Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio |publisher=Ohiostatesports.net |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both stations broadcast on an Internet audio stream (no broadcast signals are available in Columbus). Students also operate a local [[cable TV]] channel known as Buckeye TV, which airs primarily on the campus closed cable system operated by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).

===Leadership and service===
The Union's vision is to prepare students to be responsible, engaged leaders committed to community participation for social action and change. Programs with which students can get involved include are the Leadership Collaborative, Leadership Ohio State, Residence Halls Advisory Council, LeaderShape, Buckeye Service Council, Community Commitment Day, SERV team, Service Squad, ImpactOSU, and BUCK I SERV alternative break trips. Additionally, the Service-Learning Institute offers courses that educate students while also helping the greater community. All of these programs have the ultimate goal of making students better leaders, people, and citizens of Ohio.&lt;ref name=keithkeycenter&gt;{{cite web|title=The Keith B.

In 1914, with the approval of President William Oxley Thompson and under the watchful eye of Dean Caroline Breyfogle, Ph.D., [[Mortar Board]] Senior Honor Society was established by seven senior women. Four years later, the members of the group then became one of the four founding chapters of Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society, which now has charters at 231 campuses in the U.S. For more than 100 years at Ohio State, members of Mortar Board have been selected for their significant contributions in scholarship, leadership and service.

===Student government===
At The Ohio State University, three recognized student governments represent their constituents.&lt;ref name=govt&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Governments|url=http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|accessdate=December 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208063009/http://ohiounion.osu.edu/get_involved/student_governments|archive-date=December 8, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Undergraduate Student Government (USG), which consists of elected and appointed student [[Representation (politics)|representatives]] who serve as liaisons from the [[undergraduate]] student body to university officials. USG seeks to outreach to and work for the students at Ohio State.
* Council of Graduate Students (CGS), which promotes and provides [[academic]], [[Academic administration|administrative]], and social programs for the university community in general and for [[graduate students]] in particular. The Council provides a forum in which the graduate student body may present, discuss, and set upon issues related to its role in the academic and non-academic aspects of the University community.
* Inter-Professional Council (IPC), which is a representative body of all professional students in the colleges of [[Dentistry]], [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Optometry]], [[Pharmacy]], and [[Veterinary Medicine]]. Its purpose is to act as a liaison between these students and the governing bodies of the University.

'''Ota Benga''' ({{circa|1883}}&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– March 20, 1916) was  an [[Mbuti people|Mbuti]] ([[Congo Pygmies|Congo pygmy]]) man,  known for being featured in an anthropology exhibit at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1904, and in a [[human zoo]] exhibit in 1906 at the [[Bronx Zoo]]. Benga had been purchased from [[African slave trade]]rs by the missionary and anthropologist Samuel Phillips Verner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=John R.|title=Pioneer African Missionary: Samuel Phillips Verner|journal=Journal of Presbyterian History (1962-1985)|date=1982|volume=60|issue=1|pages=42–57|jstor=23328464}}&lt;/ref&gt; a businessman searching for African people for the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caged in the human zoo: The shocking story of the young pygmy warrior put on show in a monkey house – and how he fuelled Hitler's twisted beliefs|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1224189/Caged-human-zoo-The-shocking-story-young-pygmy-warrior-monkey-house--fuelled-Hitlers-twisted-beliefs.html|accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=Dailymail|date=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He traveled with Verner to the United States. At the Bronx Zoo, Benga had free run of the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo's Monkey House. 
Except for a brief visit with Verner to Africa after the close of the St. Louis Fair, Benga lived in the United States, mostly in [[Virginia]], for the rest of his life.

[[African-American newspapers]] around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga's treatment. 
[[Robert Stuart MacArthur]], spokesman for a delegation of black churches, petitioned New York City Mayor [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] for his release from the Bronx Zoo. {{year needed|date=May 2018}}

In late 1906, the mayor released Benga to the custody of  James M. Gordon, who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. In 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in Virginia, where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth [[Dental restoration|capped]], so the young man could be more readily accepted in local society. 
Benga was tutored in English and began to work at a Lynchburg tobacco factory. He proved a valuable employee because he could climb up the poles to get the tobacco leaves without having to use a ladder.
He began to plan a return to Africa, but  the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 stopped ship passenger travel. 
Benga fell into a [[clinical depression|depression]], and he committed [[suicide]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evanzz|first=Karl|title=The Messenger: The rise and fall of Elijah Muhammad|year=1999|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679442608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early life===
As a member of the [[Mbuti]] people,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume describe Benga as Mbuti and write, "A feature article described Ota Benga as 'a dwarfy, black specimen of sad-eyed humanity.' He was sad because the other pygmies were Batwa but he was not..." (p. 116). They later mention that he "never fully assimilated into the Batwa" during his time with them. Parezo and Fowler refer to "[t]he Mbuti (Batwa) Pygmies and 'Red Africans'" and note that "McGee called them all Batwa Pygmies, 'real aboriginals of the Dark Continent'&amp;nbsp;... [Benga] was slightly taller than the other Pygmies, a characteristic common to his society, the Badinga or Chiri-chiri. Verner considered the Chiri-chiris a Pygmy society, and McGee and the press decided not to quibble over details." (pp. 200–203). Many sources, e.g. Adams (p. 25) and [[NPR]], simply describe him as "a Batwa Pygmy from Africa".&lt;/ref&gt; Ota Benga lived in equatorial forests near the [[Kasai River]] in what was then the [[Congo Free State]]. 
His people were attacked by the ''[[Force Publique]],'' established by [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]] as a militia to control the natives for labor in order to exploit the large supply of [[rubber]] in the Congo.  
Benga's wife and two children were murdered; he survived only because he was on a hunting expedition when the Force Publique attacked his village. He was later captured by "Baschelel" ([[Bashilele]]) slave traders.&lt;ref&gt;name="nyt2006"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Looking Back at the Strange Case of Ota Benga|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6225825|website=NPR.org|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=27 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt;

American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner travelled to Africa in 1904 under contract from the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (St. Louis World Fair) to bring back an assortment of pygmies to be part of an exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the fledgling discipline of [[anthropology]], the noted scientist [[W. J. McGee]] intended to display "representatives of all the world's peoples, ranging from smallest pygmies to the most gigantic peoples, from the darkest blacks to the dominant whites" to show what was commonly thought then to be a sort of [[Scientific racism|cultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Verner discovered Ota Benga while 'en route' to a [[Twa peoples|Batwa]] village visited previously; he negotiated Benga's release from the slave traders for a pound of salt and a bolt of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Verner later claimed Benga was rescued from the cannibals by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/336335-ota-benga-caged-pygmy/|title=100 years ago today, Ota Benga ended his horrible life after caged as 'pygmy' at Bronx Zoo|website=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two spent several weeks together before reaching the village. There the villagers had developed distrust for the ''muzungu'' (white man) due to the abuses of King Leopold's forces. Verner was unable to recruit any villagers to join him until Benga spoke of the ''muzungu'' saving his life, the bond that had grown between them, and his own curiosity about the world Verner came from. Four Batwa, all male, ultimately accompanied them. Verner recruited other Africans who were not pygmies: five men from the [[Kuba Kingdom|Bakuba]], including the son of King Ndombe, ruler of the Bakuba, and other related peoples&amp;nbsp;– "Red Africans" as they were collectively labeled by contemporary anthropologists.&lt;ref name="parezo204"&gt;Parezo and Fowler (2007), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As exhibit===

====St. Louis World Fair====
[[File:Louisiana Purchase pygmies.jpg|thumb|Benga (second from left) and the Batwa in St. Louis]]
The group was brought to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in late June 1904 without Verner, who had been taken ill with [[malaria]]. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition had already begun, and the Africans immediately became the center of attention. Ota Benga was particularly popular, and his name was reported variously by the press as ''Artiba'', ''Autobank'',&lt;ref name="Bradford Geronimo"&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ota Bang'', and ''Otabenga''. He had an amiable personality, and visitors were eager to see his teeth, which had been [[human tooth sharpening|filed to sharp points]] in his early youth as ritual decoration. The Africans learned to charge for photographs and performances. One newspaper account, promoting Ota Benga as "the only genuine African [[cannibal]] in America", claimed "[his teeth were] worth the five cents he charges for showing them to visitors".&lt;ref name="parezo204" /&gt;

When Verner arrived a month later, he realized the pygmies were more prisoners than performers. Their attempts to congregate peacefully in the forest on Sundays were thwarted by the crowds' fascination with them. McGee's attempts to present a "serious" scientific exhibit were also overturned. On July 28, the Africans' performing to the crowd's preconceived notion that they were "savages" resulted in the First Illinois Regiment being called in to control the mob. Benga and the other Africans eventually performed in a warlike fashion, imitating [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] they saw at the Exhibition.&lt;ref name="Verner arrive"&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 118–121&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apache]] chief [[Geronimo]] (featured as "The Human Tyger"&amp;nbsp;– with special dispensation from the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]])&lt;ref name="Bradford Geronimo" /&gt; grew to admire Benga, and gave him one of his [[arrowhead]]s. For his efforts, Verner was awarded the gold medal in anthropology at the close of the Exposition.&lt;ref name="Verner arrive" /&gt;

====American Museum of Natural History====
Benga accompanied Verner when he returned the other Africans to the Congo. He briefly lived amongst the Batwa while continuing to accompany Verner on his African adventures. He married a Batwa woman who later died of snakebite, and little is known of this second marriage. Not feeling that he belonged with the Batwa, Benga chose to return with Verner to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 151–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verner eventually arranged for Benga to stay in a spare room at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City while he was tending to other business.  Verner negotiated with the curator Henry Bumpus over the presentation of his acquisitions from Africa and potential employment. While Bumpus was put off by Verner's request of the prohibitively high salary of $175 a month and was not impressed with the man's credentials, he was interested in Benga. Wearing a Southern-style linen suit to entertain visitors, Benga initially enjoyed his time at the museum. He became homesick, however.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 159–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writers Bradford and Blume imagined his feelings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What at first held his attention now made him want to flee. It was maddening to be inside&amp;nbsp;– to be swallowed whole&amp;nbsp;– so long. He had an image of himself, stuffed, behind glass, but somehow still alive, crouching over a fake campfire, feeding meat to a lifeless child. Museum silence became a source of torment, a kind of noise; he needed birdsong, breezes, trees.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The disaffected Benga attempted to find relief by exploiting his employers' presentation of him as a 'savage'. He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises; when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor's wife, he pretended to misunderstand, instead hurling the chair across the room, just missing the woman's head. Meanwhile, Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum. He soon found another home for Benga.&lt;ref name ="museum" /&gt;

====Bronx Zoo====
At the suggestion of Bumpus, Verner took Benga to the [[Bronx Zoo]] in 1906. [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], director of the zoo, initially hired Benga to use as help in maintaining the animal habitats. However, Hornaday saw that people took more notice of Benga than the animals at the zoo, eventually making Hornaday create an exhibition to feature Benga.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt; There, the Mbuti man was allowed to roam the grounds freely. He became fond of an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, "the presiding genius of the Monkey House", who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 172–174.&lt;/ref&gt; The events leading to his "exhibition" alongside Dohong were gradual:&lt;ref name="nyt2006"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit, and the zoo encouraged him to hang his [[hammock]] there, and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target. On the first day of the exhibit, September 8, 1906, visitors found Benga in the Monkey House.&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt; Soon, a sign on the exhibit read:

[[File:Ota Benga at Bronx Zoo.jpg|thumb|Ota Benga at the Bronx Zoo in 1906. Only five promotional photos exist of Benga's time here, none of them in the "Monkey House"; cameras were not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), photo insert.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The African Pygmy, "Ota Benga."&lt;br /&gt;
Age, 23 years. Height, 4 feet 11 inches.&lt;br /&gt;
Weight, 103 pounds. Brought from the&lt;br /&gt;
Kasai River, Congo Free State, South Cen-&lt;br /&gt;
tral Africa, by Dr. Samuel P. Verner. Ex-&lt;br /&gt;
hibited each afternoon during September.&lt;ref name="nyt1906"&gt;"Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy," ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 10, 1906, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors; he was supported by [[Madison Grant]], Secretary of the [[New York Zoological Society]], who lobbied to put Ota Benga on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo.  A decade later, Grant became prominent nationally as a [[scientific racism|racial anthropologist]] and [[eugenics|eugenicist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African-American]] clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit. Said James H. Gordon,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes ... We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls."&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt;  Gordon thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and a promotion of [[Darwinism]]: "The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity, and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted.&lt;ref name="nyt2006"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of clergymen backed Gordon.&lt;ref name="Spiro 47"&gt;Spiro (2008), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human, an editorial in  ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter ... It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering. The pygmies ... are very low in the human scale, and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place ... from which he could draw no advantage whatever. The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date.&lt;ref name="Spiro 48"&gt;Spiro (2008), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the controversy, Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo. In response to the situation, as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds, he became more mischievous and somewhat violent.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1998). See chapter on Ota Benga.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around this time, an article in ''The New York Times'' stated, "It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people, and then we bring one here to brutalize him."&lt;ref name="nyt1906" /&gt;

The zoo finally removed Benga from the grounds. Verner was unsuccessful in his continued search for employment, but he occasionally spoke to Benga. The two had agreed that it was in Benga's best interests to remain in the United States despite the unwelcome spotlight at the zoo.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 187–190.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Toward the end of 1906, Benga was released into Reverend Gordon's custody.&lt;ref name="nyt2006" /&gt;

===Later life===
Gordon placed Benga in the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum, a church-sponsored [[orphanage]] which he supervised. 
As the unwelcome press attention continued, in January 1910, Gordon arranged for Benga's relocation to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], where he lived with the McCray family.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 191–204.&lt;/ref&gt; So that Benga could more easily be part of local society, Gordon arranged for the African's teeth to be capped and bought him American-style clothes. Tutored by Lynchburg poet [[Anne Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Benga could improve his English, and he began to attend elementary school at the Baptist Seminary in Lynchburg.&lt;ref name="Spiro 48" /&gt;

Once he felt his English had improved sufficiently, Benga discontinued his formal education. He began working at a Lynchburg [[tobacco]] factory. He proved a valuable employee because he could climb up the poles to get the tobacco leaves without having to use a ladder. His fellow workers called him "Bingo".  He often told his life story in exchange for sandwiches and root beer. He began to plan a return to Africa.&lt;ref name="Spiro 49"&gt;Spiro (2008), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 when [[World War I]] broke out, a return to the Congo became impossible as passenger ship traffic ended. Benga became depressed as his hopes for a return to his homeland faded.&lt;ref name="Spiro 49" /&gt; On March 20, 1916, at the age of 32, he built a ceremonial fire, chipped off the caps on his teeth, and shot himself in the heart with a stolen pistol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Benga_Ota_ca_1883-1916 "Ota Benga"], ''Encyclopedia Virginia''&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried in an unmarked grave in the black section of the [[Old City Cemetery (Lynchburg, Virginia)|Old City Cemetery]], near his benefactor, Gregory Hayes. At some point, the remains of both men went missing.  Local oral history indicates that Hayes and Ota Benga were eventually moved from the Old Cemetery to White Rock Cemetery, a burial ground that later fell into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford and Blume (1992), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Phillips Verner Bradford, the grandson of Samuel Phillips Verner, wrote a book on the Mbuti man, entitled ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo'' (1992). During his research for the book, Bradford visited the [[American Museum of Natural History]], which holds a life mask and body cast of Ota Benga. The display is still labeled "Pygmy", rather than indicating Benga's name, despite objections beginning a century ago from Verner and repeated by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Darrel |last=Laurent |url=http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/ |title=Demeaned in Life, Forgotten in Death |publisher=The Lynchburg News &amp; Advance |date=May 29, 2005 |accessdate=2006-04-03 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of Bradford's book in 1992 inspired widespread interest in Ota Benga's story and stimulated creation of many other works, both fictional and non-fiction, such as:

* 1994 – John Strand's play, ''Ota Benga'', was produced by the Signature Theater in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.broadwayplaypubl.com/otabenga.htm |title=''Ota Benga'' |publisher=Broadway Plays |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817192756/http://www.broadwayplaypubl.com/OTABENGA.htm |archivedate=August 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997 – The play, ''Ota Benga, Elegy for the Elephant,'' by Dr. Ben B. Halm, was staged at [[Fairfield University]] in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/pr_memdetails1.html|title=Memorial details&amp;nbsp;— Ben Halm|publisher=Fairfield University|accessdate=2009-01-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071102145744/http://www.fairfield.edu/pr_memdetails1.html |archivedate = November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002 – The Mbuti man was the subject of the short documentary, ''Ota Benga: A Pygmy in America,'' directed by Brazilian [[Alfeu França]]. He incorporated original movies recorded by Verner in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Ota Benga:A Pygmy in America |people=Alfeu França |date=2002 |medium=film}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2005 – A fictionalized account of his life portrayed in the film ''[[Man to Man (2005 film)|Man to Man]]'', starring Joseph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas. 
* 2006 – The Brooklyn-based band [[Piñataland]] released a song titled "Ota Benga's Name" on their album ''Songs from the Forgotten Future Volume 1'', which tells the story of Ota Benga.&lt;ref name="nyt2006" /&gt;
* 2007 – McCray's early poems about Benga were adapted as a performance piece; the work debuted at the [[Columbia Museum of Art]] in 2007, with McCray as narrator and original music by Kevin Simmonds.
* 2008 – Benga inspired the character of Ngunda Oti in the film ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/02/AR2009010202444.html |title=Basest Instinct: Case of the Zoo Pygmy Exhibited a Familiar Face of Human Nature |last=Hornaday |first=Ann |date=January 3, 2009 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2012 – ''Ota Benga the Documentary Film'' appeared (http://www.otabengathedocumentaryfilm.com/).
* 2015 – Journalist Pamela Newkirk published the biography ''Spectacle: The Astonishing Life of Ota Benga''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spectacle: The Astonishing Life of Ota Benga|author=Newkirk, Pamela|date=June 2, 2015 |publisher=Amistad|isbn= 9780062201003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2016 – Radio Diaries, a Peabody Award-winning radio show, tells the story of Ota Benga in "The Man in the Zoo" on the Radio Diaries podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=The Man in the Zoo|url=http://www.radiodiaries.org/the-man-in-the-zoo/|author=Radio Diaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar case==
[[File:Ishi 1914.jpg|thumb|upright|Ishi, a Native American that has been compared to Benga]]
Similarities have been observed between the treatment of Ota Benga and [[Ishi]]. The latter was the sole remaining member of the [[Yana people|Yahi]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe, and he was displayed in [[California]] around the same period. Ishi died on March 25, 1916, five days after Ota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weaver |first=Jace |title=Ishi in Three Centuries |chapter=When the Demons Came: (Retro)Spectacle among the Savages |editor-first=Karl |editor-last=Kroeber |editor2-first=Clifton B. |editor2-last=Kroeber |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |location=Lincoln |year=2003 |isbn=0-8032-2757-4 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFghGGXLJ7IC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41|page=41|title=Ishi in Three Centuries|authors=Kroeber, Karl &amp; Kroeber, Clifton B.

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''Persianism''' is used to describe any process of forming or transforming a phenomenon into something which has [[Iranian peoples|Persian]] (Iranian) traits and peculiarities.

Persianism can also mean a school of thought which emphasises the study of Persian culture and informing others about it. It is said by the scholar Ofira Seliktar that Shi'ism and Persianism overlap in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;P. 138 ''Failing the crystal ball test the Carter administration and the fundamentalist revolution in Iran'' by Ofira Seliktar;  NetLibrary, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar [[Muhammad Iqbal]] wrote, "''The conquest of Persia meant not the conversion of Persia to Islam, but the conversion of Islam to Persianism!''"&lt;ref&gt;P. 82 ''Thoughts and Reflections of Iqbal.'' By Muhammad Iqbal&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of how the Persians regained governance of their country, the scholar [[Philip Khuri Hitti]] writes, "Arabianism fell, but Islam under a new guise, that of Persianism, marched on triumphantly."&lt;ref&gt;P. 536 ''History of Syria, Including Lebanon and Palestine'' By Phillip K. Hitti&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of linguistics, Persianism is the [[Persian language|Persian]] pronunciation of a word.

In [[Library science|library]] and [[archival science]], '''preservation''' is a set of activities aimed at prolonging the life of a record while making as few changes as possible. Relevant [[metadata]], enhancement of cultural value, and improvement of access are also important aspects of preservation work. Actions taken to influence record creators prior to selection and acquisition must be avoided for proper preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/preservation|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists|website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Technical statement|date=September 2018}} Preservation, in this definition, is practiced in a [[library]] or an [[archive]] by a [[librarian]], [[archivist]], or other professional when they perceive a record is in need of care.

Preservation should be distinguished from [[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage]], which refers to the treatment and repair of individual items to slow the process of decay, or restore them to a usable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/conservation |title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists |website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|title=Preservation of Cultural Artifacts|accessdate=2007-05-11|publisher=Southern Polytechnic State University|website=wiki.spsu.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611203338/http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|archive-date=2007-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

===Standard functions of preservation programs===
*[[Collections care]] is the general maintenance and preventive care of a collection as a whole. This can include activities such as [[security]], [[environmental monitoring]], [[preservation surveys]] and more specialized activities such as [[mass deacidification]].
*[[Art conservation|Conservation]] is the treatment and repair of individual items to slow decay or restore them to a usable state. Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.
*[[Digital preservation]] is the maintenance of digitally stored information. Some means of digital preservation include refreshing, migration, replication and emulation. This should not be confused with [[digitization]], which is a process of creating digital information which must then itself be preserved digitally.
*[[Emergency management|Disaster preparedness]] (RT: Disaster Plan / [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuation]] / [[Disaster Recovery]] / Disaster Mitigation Plan) is the practice of arranging for the necessary resources and planning the best course of action to prevent or minimize damage to a collection in the event of a disaster of any level of magnitude, whether natural or man-made.
*Reformatting is the practice of creating copies of an object in another type of [[data storage device|data-storage device]]. Reformatting processes include [[microform|microfilming]] and digitization.

===Digitization===
{{Main|Digitizing}}

A relatively new concept, [[digitization]], has been hailed as a way to preserve historical items for future use. "Digitizing refers to the process of converting analog materials into digital form."&lt;ref&gt;Oya Y. Rieger, ''Preservation in the Age of Large-Scale Digitization: A White Paper'', (Washington, D.C.: Council on Library and Information Resources, 2008): 10, http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919051600/http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf |date=2015-09-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts, digitization is achieved through scanning an item and saving it to a digital format. For example, the Google Book Search program has partnered with over forty libraries around the world to digitize books. The goal of this library partnership project is to "make it easier for people to find relevant books – specifically, books they wouldn't find any other way such as those that are out of print – while carefully respecting authors' and publishers' copyrights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/googlebooks/library/|title=Google Books Library Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although digitization seems to be a promising area for future preservation, there are also problems. The main problems are that digital space costs money, formats change, and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-quality images take a longer time to scan, but are often more valuable for future use. Fragile items are often more difficult or more expensive to scan, which creates a selection problem for preservationists. Other problems include scan quality, redundancy of digitized books among different libraries, and copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these problems are being solved through educational initiatives. Educational programs are tailoring themselves to fit preservation needs and help new students understand preservation practices. Programs teaching graduate students about digital librarianship are especially important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Paul|year=2010|title=Preservation in the Age of Google: Digitization, Digital Preservation, and Dilemmas|url=|journal=Library Quarterly|volume=80|issue=1|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as the Digital Preservation Network strive to ensure that "the complete scholarly record is preserved for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpn.org/|title=Digital Preservation Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress maintains a Sustainability of Digital Formats web site that educates institutions on various aspects of preservation: most notably, on approximately 200 digital format types and which are most likely to last into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/intro/format_eval_rel.shtml|title=Library of Congress: Sustainability of Digital Formats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital preservation|Digital Preservation]] is another name for digitization, and is the term more commonly used in archival courses. The main goal of digital preservation is to guarantee that people will have access to the digitally preserved materials long into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/defdigpres0408|title=Definitions of Digital Preservation|last=admin|date=2008-02-21|work=Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services (ALCTS)|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
When practicing preservation one has several factors to consider to properly preserve a record: 1) the environment the record is store in, 2) the criteria to determine when preservation is necessary, 3) what standard practices will be laid down for preservation in an individual institution, 4) research and testing, and 5) vendor services needed for preservation. 

===Storage environment===
Environmental controls are necessary to facilitate the preservation of organic materials and are especially important to monitor in rare and [[special collections]]. Key environmental factors to watch include [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]], pests, pollutants, and [[light]] exposure.

In general, the lower the temperature is, the better it is for the collection. However, since books and other materials are often housed in areas with people, a compromise must be struck to accommodate human comfort. A reasonable temperature to accomplish both goals is 65-68˚F however, if possible, film and photography collections should be kept in a segregated area at 55˚F.&lt;ref&gt;Lull, W.P. (1990). ''Conservation environment guidelines for libraries and archives; with the assistance of Paul N. Banks.'' Albany, NY:  The University of the State of New York, The State Education Dept., The New York State Library, Division of Library Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books and other materials take up and give off moisture making them sensitive to relative humidity. Very high humidity encourages mold growth and insect infestations. Low humidity causes materials to lose their flexibility. Fluctuations in relative humidity are more damaging than a constant humidity in the middle or low range. Generally, the relative humidity should be between 30-50% with as little variation as possible, however recommendations on specific levels to maintain vary depending on the type of material, i.e. paper-based, film, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|title=Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193142/http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|archive-date=2007-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A specialized dew point calculator for book preservation is available.&lt;ref&gt;"Dew Point Calculator." Image Permanence Institute. Retrieved May 16, 2011 from http://www.dpcalc.org/
&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Pests, such as insects and vermin, eat and destroy paper and the adhesive that secures book bindings. Food and drink in libraries, archives, and museums can increase the attraction of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |title=UCSD Libraries Preservation Department. "Why is Eating and Drinking in the Library Discouraged?" 2006. UCSD. 18 June 2008 |access-date=2008-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830091329/http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |archive-date=2006-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Integrated Pest Management]] system is one way to control pests in libraries.

Particulate and gaseous pollutants, such as soot, [[ozone]], [[sulfur dioxide]], oxides of nitrogen, can cause dust, soiling, and irreversible molecular damage to materials. Pollutants are exceedingly small and not easily detectable or removable. A special filtration system in the building's [[HVAC]] is a helpful defense.

Exposure to light also has a significant effect on materials. It is not only the light visible to humans that can cause damage, but also [[ultraviolet]] light and [[infrared]] radiation. Measured in [[lux]] or the amount of lumens/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the generally accepted level of illumination with sensitive materials is limited to 50 lux per day. Materials receiving more lux than recommended can be placed in dark storage periodically to prolong the original appearance of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, G. ''The Museum Environment''. 2nd ed. London: Butterworths, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent concerns about the impact of climate change on the management of cultural heritage objects as well as the historic environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/2082/ |title=Climate change and the historic environment |publisher=Centre for Sustainable Heritage, University College London |accessdate=2008-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504150330/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/2082/ |archive-date=2008-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has prompted research efforts to investigate alternative climate control methods and strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_1/index.html|title=From the Outside in: Preventive conservation, sustainability, and environmental conservation|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that include the implementation of alternative climate control systems to replace or supplement traditional high-energy consuming HVAC systems as well as the introduction of passive preservation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_1/index.html|title=Collections care, human comfort, and climate control: A case study at the Casa de Rui Barbosa Museum|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than maintaining a flat line, consistent 24/7 condition for a collection's environment, fluctuation can occur within acceptable limits to create a preservation environment while also thinking of energy efficiency and taking advantage of the outside environment.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Herzog, "Energy Savings and Collection Management," Accessed on May 16, 2011, https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/resources/newsletter-archive/v2/energy-savings&lt;/ref&gt;

Bound materials are sensitive to rapid temperature or humidity cycling due to differential expansion of the binding and pages, which may cause the binding to crack and/or the pages to warp. Changes in temperature and humidity should be done slowly so as to minimize the difference in expansion rates. However, an accelerated aging study on the effects of fluctuating temperature and humidity on paper color and strength showed no evidence that cycling of one temperature to another or one RH to another caused a different mechanism of decay.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis Bigourdan and James M. Reilly. "Effects of Fluctuating Environments on Paper Materials--Stability and Practical Significance for Preservation." Accessed on May 16, 2011 https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/305&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination can occur at the time of manufacture, especially with electronic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/preservation-conservation-restoration-whats-the-difference/|title=Preservation, Conservation, Restoration: What’s the Difference? {{!}} Computer History Museum|website=www.computerhistory.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be stopped before it spreads, but it is usually irreversible.[[File:"Banana Book".jpg|thumb|The Flickr user describes an incident of putting a banana stained book in their backpack and leaving it for a couple weeks with this result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/vblibrary/5334339828|title=Banana Book|work=Flickr|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Preservation criteria===
Making a proper decision is an important factor before starting preservation practices. [[Decision making]] for preservation should be made considering significance and value of materials. Significance is considered to have two major components: importance and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf|title=A Significance Recognition Scheme for Non-National Museums and Galleries in Scotland|publisher=Scottish Museums Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106213355/http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2007-11-06|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Importance" relates to the collection's role as a record, and "quality" covers comprehensiveness, depth, uniqueness, authenticity and reputation of the collection. Moreover, analyzing the significance of materials can be used to uncover more about their meaning.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|title=A Regional Approach to Identifying Items of National Significance Held by Small Cultural Institutions in New Zealand|last=Dorner|first=Daniel|last2=Young|first2=Sophie|publication-date=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328010251/http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|archivedate=2007-03-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment of significance can also aid in documenting the provenance and context to argue the case for grant funding for the object and collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/sector_info_item/5|title=Significance - A Guide to Assessing the Significance of Cultural Heritage Objects and Collections|publisher=Heritage Collections Council (Australia)|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of significance can be historically, culturally, socially, or spiritually significant. In the preservation context, libraries and archives make decisions in different ways. In libraries, decision-making likely targets existing holding materials, whereas in archives, decisions for preservation are often made when they acquire materials. Therefore, different criteria might be needed on different occasions. In general, for archive criteria, the points include:

# the characteristics of a record (purpose, creator, etc.);
# the quality of the information in the record;
# the record in context (part of a series or not);
# potential use and possible limitations; and
# the cost against the benefits from its existence.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach" /&gt; 

[[File:Old book bindings.jpg|thumb|Worn books at the library of [[Merton College]], Oxford.|300x300px]]For archival criteria, the following are evidence of significance:

# uniqueness,
# irreplaceability,
# high level of impact – over time or place,
# high level of influence,
# representation of a type, and
# comparative value (rarity, completeness, integrity relative to others of its kind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pymm|first=Bob|year=2006|title=Building Collections for All Time: the Issue of Significance|journal=AARL (Australian Academic Research Libraries)|volume=37|issue=1|pages=61–73|doi=10.1080/00048623.2006.10755323|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards===
Since the 1970s, the [[Northeast Document Conservation Center]] has stated that the study of understanding the needs of the archive/library is inherently important to the survival of archives and libraries. In order for the preservation of a collection to survive for a long time it is important that a systematic preservation plan is in place. The first step in planning a preservation program is to assess the institution's existing preservation needs. This process entails identifying the general and specific needs of the collection, establishing priorities, and gathering the resources to execute the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patkus|first=Beth|title=Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|publication-place=Andover|publication-date=2003|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because budget and time limitations require priorities to be set, standards have been established by the profession to determine what should be preserved in a collection.  Considerations include existing condition, rarity, and evidentiary and market values.  With non-paper formats, the availability of equipment to access the information will be a factor (for example, playback equipment for audio-visual materials, or microform readers).  An institution should determine how many, if any, other repositories hold the material, and consider coordinating efforts with those that do.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub103abst.html|title=The Evidence in Hand: Report of the Task Force on the Artifact in Library Collections|last=Nichols|first=Stephen G.|last2=Smith|first2=Abby|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|year=2001|isbn=1-887334-88-2|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=2001|oclc=48623491|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions should establish an environment conducive to preservation changes, involve staff, and create an understanding among administration and staff. The first steps an institution should implement, according to the NEDCC, are to establish a policy that defines and charts the course of action and create a framework for carrying out goals and priorities.

There are three methods for carrying out a preservation survey: general preservation assessment, collection condition surveys, and an item-by-item survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Graham|title=Surveying Collections: The importance of Condition Assessment for Preservation Management|publisher=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science 27, no. 4|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=1995|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; General condition surveys can be part of a library [[inventory (library)|inventory]].

Selection for treatment determines the survival of materials and should be done by a specialist, whether in relation to an established collection development policy or on an item by item basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preservation: Issues and Planning |last=Harris |first=Carolyn |publisher=American Library Association |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-585-37626-4 &lt;!-- |ISBN=0-585-37626-3 --&gt;|editor-last=Banks |editor-first=Paul N. |place=Chicago |pages=206–224 |contribution=Selection for Preservation |oclc=48139650 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author-link=Carolyn_Harris |editor2-last=Pilette |editor2-first=Roberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an object or collection has been chosen for preservation, the treatment must be determined that is most appropriate to the material and its repository. If the information is most important, reformatting or creation of a surrogate is a likely option. If the artifact itself is of value, it will receive conservation treatment, ideally of a reversible nature.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

===Research and testing===
With old media deteriorating or showing their vulnerabilities and new media becoming available, research remains active in the field of conservation and preservation. Everything from how to preserve paper media to creating and maintaining electronic resources and gauging their [[digital permanence]] is being explored by students and professionals in archives/libraries. The two main issues that most institutions tend to face are the rapid disintegration of acidic paper and water damage (due to flooding, plumbing problems, etc.). Therefore, these areas of preservation, as well as new digital technologies, receive much of the research attention.

The [[American Library Association]] has many scholarly journals that publish articles on preservation topics, such as ''College and Research Libraries, Information Technology and Libraries,'' and ''Library Resources and Technical Services''. Scholarly periodicals in this field from other publishers include ''International Preservation News, Journal of the American Institute for Conservation'', and ''Collection Management'' among many others.

===Vendor services===
Many private entities provide preservation and conservation services and supplies. One of the most well known companies in preservation is Hollinger Metal Edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollingermetaledge.com/|title=Hollinger Metal Edge - Since 1945!|website=www.hollingermetaledge.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sell [[Hollinger box]]es, folders, AV preservation tools, archival paper, exhibit material, and even furniture. Another company that produces many preservation tools is University Products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityproducts.com/|title=University Products - Thinking in and out of the box since 1968.|website=www.universityproducts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Globalize section|date=May 2018}}

Learning the proper methods of preservation is important and most archivists are educated on the subject at academic institutions that specifically cover archives and preservation. In the United States most repositories require archivists to have a degree from an ALA-accredited library school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-preservation-rankings|title=Best Archives and Preservation Programs|last=|first=|date=2017|website=US News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar institutions exist in countries outside the US.

Since 2010, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has enhanced funding for library and archives conservation education in three major conservation programs.&lt;ref&gt;https://mellon.org/programs/scholarly-communications/preservation-and-conservation/&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are all part of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~anagpic/|title=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property|publisher=University of Texas School of Information|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another educational resource available to preservationists is the Northeast Document Conservation Center or  NEDCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/home.php|title=NEDCC|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preservation, Planning and Publications Committee of the Preservation and Reformatting Section (PARS) in the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services has created a Preservation Education Directory of ALA Accredited schools in the U.S. and Canada offering courses in preservation. The directory is updated approximately every three years. The 10th Edition was made available on the ALCTS web site in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preservation/educationdirectory|title=Preservation Education Directory 10th Edition|publisher=ALCTS|accessdate=2015-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Information science}}Additional preservation education is available to librarians through various professional organizations, such as:

==Preservation in non-academic facilities==

===Public libraries===
Limited, tax-driven funding can often interfere with the ability for public libraries to engage in extensive preservation activities. Materials, particularly books, are often much easier to replace than to repair when damaged or worn. Public libraries usually try to tailor their services to meet the needs and desires of their local communities, which could cause an emphasis on acquiring new materials over preserving old ones. Librarians working in public facilities frequently have to make complicated decisions about how to best serve their patrons. Commonly, public library systems work  with each other and sometimes with more academic libraries through interlibrary loan programs. By sharing resources, they are able to expand upon what might be available to their own patrons and share the burdens of preservation across a greater array of systems.

===Archival repositories and special collections===
Archival facilities focus specifically on rare and fragile materials. With staff trained in appropriate techniques, archives are often available to many public and private library facilities as an alternative to destroying older materials. Items that are unique, such as photographs, or items that are out of print, can be preserved in archival facilities more easily than in many library settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|website=www.clir.org|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===
Because so many museum holdings are unique, including print materials, art, and other objects, preservationists are often most active in this setting; however, since most holdings are usually much more fragile, or possibly corrupted, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] may be more necessary than preservation. This is especially common in [[Art museum|art museums]]. Museums typically hold to the same practices lead by archival institutions.

==History==

===Antecedents===
Preservation as a formal profession in libraries and archives dates from the twentieth century, but its philosophy and practice has roots in many earlier traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Lynn |last=Ritzenthaler |year=1993 |title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts |chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |location=Chicago |publisher=Society of American Archivists |url= |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ancient societies, appeals to heavenly protectors were used to preserve books, scrolls and manuscripts from insects, fire and decay. 
* To the ancient Egyptians, the scarab or dung beetle (see: [[Scarab (artifact)]]) was a protector of written products. 
* In ancient [[Babylon]], [[Nabu]] is the heavenly patron of books and protector of clay tablets. Nabu is the Babylonian god of wisdom and writing, and is the patron of the scribes, librarians and archivists. 
* In Arabic and other eastern societies, sometimes a traditional method to protect books and scrolls was a metaphysical appeal to "Kabi:Kaj", the "King of the Cockroaches".&lt;ref&gt;Gacek, Adam. "The Use of Kabikaj in Arabic Manuscripts." Manuscripts of the Middle East. Volume I, 1986. Page 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are three saints in the Christian church that are closely associated with libraries as patrons: [[Saint Lawrence]], [[Saint Jerome]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaschins, Elizabeth and Jane Kemp. "Saint Jerome, the Patron Saint of Librarians." Library Journal. September 1, 1988, pages 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Saint Catharine of Alexandria or [[Catherine of Alexandria]].
* In some Christian monasteries, prayers and curses were placed at the end of books to prevent theft, or to damn the thieves. Frequently called a "[[book curse]]", these were placed in the book to deter theft. 
* The ancient Chinese god Wei T'O is the patron god of libraries and books. Many examples of appeals to Wei T'O can be found in Chinese manuscripts dated five hundred or more years ago. &lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.weito.com/ accessed July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wei T'O is especially invoked for the protection of books and libraries against fire. Since the modern books are suffering from acid decomposition ([[slow fires]]), Wei T'O is especially relevant to modern librarianship. A modern product to de-acidify paper is named in his honor.
* Sri Lankan symbols or images of the Sinhalese "Fire Demons" are hung in the corners of libraries and other buildings to appease the incendiary demons and to avert fire, lightning and cataclysm, according to Sinhalese mythology. Since fire and acid decomposition (also known as "slow fires") are a special problem for libraries because of the concentration of paper products, the "Fire Demons" are also included when used to assuage these destroyers of libraries and books.
* The Aztec and Mayan Indians of Latin America also had deities concerned with libraries. The major god, [[Quetzalcoatl]], is credited with the discoveries of the arts, the calendar, and of writing. A single feather or plume at the beginning or at the end of a document or stone carving would indicate a dedication to the "Feathered Serpent." This symbol degenerated over time to a single fringed line.
Human record-keeping arguably dates back to the [[cave painting]] boom of the [[upper paleolithic]], some 32,000-40,000 years ago. More direct antecedents are the [[History of writing|writing systems]] that developed in the 4th millennium B.C. Written record keeping and information sharing practices, along with [[oral tradition]], sustain and transmit information from one group to another. This level of preservation has been supplemented over the last century with the professional practice of preservation and conservation in the cultural heritage community.

#[[Oral tradition]] or [[oral culture]], the transmission of information from one generation to the next without a writing system.
#Antiquarian practices, including [[Scribe|scribal practice]], [[Burial| burial practice]], the libraries at [[Library of Pergamum|Pergamum]], [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and other ancient archives.
#Medieval practices, including the [[scriptorium]] and [[relic]] collection
#[[Renaissance]] and the changing conception of artists and works of art
#[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[Encyclopedists]]
#[[Romanticism|Romantic movement]]'s imperative to preserve

===Significant events===
*1933: [[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] introduces the field of conservation to paper deacidification when he publishes a paper on the [[acid paper]] problem. In later studies, Barrow tested paper from American books made between 1900 and 1949, and learned that after forty years the books had lost on average 96 percent of their original strength; after less than ten years, they had already lost 64 percent. Barrow determined that this rapid deterioration was not the direct result of using wood-pulp fibers, since rag papers of this period were also aging rapidly, but rather due to the residual [[sulfuric acid]] produced in both [[Cotton paper|rag]] and wood pulp papers. Manufacturing methods used after 1870 employed sulfuric acid for [[sizing]] and bleaching the paper. Earlier papermaking methods left the final product only mildly alkaline or even neutral.  Such paper has maintained its strength for 300 to 800 years, despite [[sulfur dioxide]] and other air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stevens |first=Rolland E. |date=October 1968 |title=The Library |journal=The Journal of Higher Education |pages=407–409|doi=10.2307/1980093 |volume=39 |issue=7 |jstor=1980093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow's 1933 article on the fragile state of wood pulp paper predicted the life expectancy, or "LE", of this paper was approximately 40–50 years. At that point the paper would begin to show signs of natural decay, and he concluded that research for a new media on which to write and print was needed.
*1966: [[The Flood of the River Arno in Florence, Italy]] damaged or destroyed millions of rare books and led to the development of restoration laboratories and new methods in conservation. Instrumental in this process was conservationist [[Peter Waters]], who led a group of volunteers, called "mud angels", in restoring thousands of books and papers. This event awakened many historians, librarians, and other professionals to the importance of having a preservation plan. Many consider this flood to be one of the worst disasters since the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|burning of the Library of Alexandria]]. It spurred a resurgence in the profession of preservation and conservation worldwide.
*1987: Terry Saunders releases the film [[Slow fire|Slow Fires: On the Preservation of the Human Record]] which examines paper embrittlement resulting from acid decay
*1989: March 7 ["[[Commitment Day]]"] Major US print publishers convene at NYPL to endorse a community-wide commitment to utilizing [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 9706 certified permanent durable paper in order to combat the acid paper epidemic.

===Significant people===
*[[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] (1904–1967) was an American chemist and paper conservator, and a pioneer of library and archives conservation. He introduced the field of conservation to paper deacidification through alkalization.
*[[Paul N. Banks]] (1934–2000) was Conservator and Head of the Conservation Department at the [[Newberry Library]] from 1964 to 1981, and published regularly on [[bookbinding]], [[book and paper conservation]], and problems related to conservation.  He designed and implemented a curriculum for [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] School of Library Science that dealt directly with preservation training.
*[[Pamela Darling]], author and historian, was Preservation Specialist for the [[Association of Research Libraries]]. Her works include materials to aid libraries in establishing their own comprehensive preservation programs.
*[[Carolyn Harris (librarian)|Carolyn Harris]] worked as head of Columbia University Libraries' Preservation Division from 1981 until 1987, where she worked closely with Paul Banks. She published extensive research throughout her career, especially dealing with [[mass deacidification]] of wood-pulp paper.
*[[Peter Waters]], former Conservation Officer at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, worked in the areas of disaster recovery and preparedness, and the salvaging of water-damaged paper goods.
*[[Nicholson Baker]] is a contemporary American novelist and author of ''[[Double Fold]]'', a criticism of libraries' destruction of paper-based media.
*[[Patricia Battin]], as the first president of the Commission on Preservation and Access, worked to organize a national campaign both for the use of alkaline paper in publishing companies and for a national program of preservation [[microform|microfilming]].
*John F. Dean, Preservation and Conservation Librarian at Cornell University, has made contributions towards improving [[Book preservation in developing countries|preservation efforts in developing countries]]. Specifically, Dean has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East.

The [[Paul Banks and Carolyn Harris Preservation Award]] for outstanding preservation specialists in library and archival science, is given annually by the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214195255/http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm |date=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subdivision of the [[American Library Association]]. It is awarded in recognition of professional preservation specialists who have made significant contributions to the field.

==Legal &amp; Ethical Issues==
Reformatting, or in any other way copying an item's contents, raises obvious [[copyright]] issues. In many cases, a library is allowed to make a limited number of copies of an item for preservation purposes. In the United States, certain exceptions have been made for libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108- |title=U.S. Code: Title 17,108. Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=Legal Information Institute |website=www.law.cornell.edu]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics will play an important role in many aspects of the conservator's activities. When choosing which objects are in need of treatment, the conservator should do what is best for the object in question and not yield to pressure or opinion from outside sources. Conservators should refer to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice,&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|title=AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304161903/http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|archivedate=March 4, 2000|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that the conservation professional must "strive to attain the highest possible standards in all aspects of conservation."

One instance in which these decisions may get tricky is when the conservator is dealing with cultural objects. The AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt; has addressed such concerns, stating "All actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for cultural property, its unique character and significance and the people or person who created it." This can be applied in both the care and long-term storage of objects in archives and institutions.

It is important that preservation specialists to be respectful of cultural property and the societies that created it, it is also important for them to be aware of international and national laws pertaining to stolen items. In recent years there has been a rise in nations seeking out artifacts that have been stolen and are now in museums. In many cases museums are working with the nations to find a compromise to balance the need for reliable supervision as well as access for both the public and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;"Rightful Owners." ''Nature'', Vol. 440 (6) 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservators are not just bound by ethics to treat cultural and religious objects with respect, but also in some cases by law. For example, in the United States, conservators must comply with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ([[NAGPRA]]). The [http://www.firstarchivistscircle.org/ First Archivists Circle], a group of Native American archivists, has also created [http://www2.nau.edu/libnap-p/index.html Protocols for Native American Archival Materials]. The non-binding guidelines are suggestions for libraries and archives with Native American archival materials.

The care of cultural and sacred objects often affects the physical storage or the object. For example, sacred objects of the native peoples of the Western United States are supposed to be stored with sage to ensure their spiritual well being. The idea of storing an object with plant material is inherently problematic to an archival collection because of the possibility of insect infestation. When conservators have faced this problem, they have addressed it by using freeze-dried sage, thereby meeting both conservation and cultural needs.

Some individuals in the archival community have explored the possible moral responsibility to preserve all cultural phenomena, in regards to the concept of monumental preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Cloonan, Michele V. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1387/is_3_55/ai_n19311179 "The Moral Imperative to Preserve"], "[[Library Trends]]", Winter 2007. Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates argue that such an undertaking is something that the indigenous or native communities that produce such cultural objects are better suited to perform. Currently, however, many indigenous communities are not financially able to support their own archives and museums. Still, indigenous archives are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Amy|year=2002|title=Issues in Native American Archives|url=|journal=Collection Management|volume=27|issue=2|pages=43–54|doi=10.1300/j105v27n02_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is a longstanding tension between preservation of and access to library materials, particularly in the area of [[special collections]]. Handling materials promotes their progression to an unusable state, especially if they are handled carelessly. On the other hand, materials must be used in order to gain any benefit from them. In a collection with valuable materials, this conflict is often resolved by a number of measures which can include heightened security, requiring the use of gloves for photographs, restricting the materials researchers may bring with them into a reading room, and restricting use of materials to patrons who are not able to satisfy their research needs with less valuable copies of an item. These restrictions are annoyances to researchers who feel that these measures are in place solely to keep materials out of the hands of the public.

There is also controversy surrounding preservation methods. A major controversy at the end of the twentieth century centered on the practice of discarding items that had been microfilmed. This was the subject of novelist [[Nicholson Baker]]'s book ''Double Fold'', which chronicled his efforts to save many old runs of American newspapers (formerly owned by the British Library) from being sold to dealers or pulped. A similar concern persists over the retention of original documents reformatted by any means, analog or digital. Concerns include scholarly needs and legal requirements for authentic or original records as well as questions about the longevity, quality and completeness of reformatted materials.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert B. Townsend, {{cite web |url=http://blog.historians.org/articles/204/google-books-whats-not-to-like |title=Google Books: What’s Not to Like? |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=American Historical Association |website=www.historians.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Paul Duguid, {{cite web |url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_8/duguid/ |title=Inheritance and loss? A brief survey of Google Books |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=First Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retention of originals as a source or fail-safe copy is now a fairly common practice. Another controversy revolving around different preservation methods is that of digitization of original material to maintain the intellectual content of the material while ignoring the physical nature of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle, G.T. (1998). Texts and artifacts in the electronic era. 21stC, 3.2. 
[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-3.2/tanselle.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Future of the Print Record structured its "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records" on the inherent theoretical ideology that there is a need to preserve as many copies of a printed edition as is possible as texts and their textual settings are, quite simply, not separable, just as the artifactual characteristics of texts are as relevant and varied as the texts themselves (in the report mentioned herewith, [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] suggests that presently existing book stacks need not be abandoned with emerging technologies; rather they serve as vitally important original (primary) sources for future study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|title=Statement on the Significance of Primary Records|accessdate=2008-07-27|publisher=Modern Language Association|website=www.mla.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701014009/http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|archive-date=2008-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many digitized items, such as back issues of periodicals, are provided by publishers and databases on a subscription basis. If these companies were to cease providing access to their digital information, facilities that elected to discard paper copies of these periodicals could face significant difficulties in providing access to these items. Discussion as to the best ways to utilize digital technologies is therefore ongoing, and the practice continues to evolve. Of course, the issues surrounding digital objects and their care in libraries and archives continues to expand as more and more of contemporary culture is created, stored, and used digitally. These [[born-digital]] materials raise their own new kinds of preservation challenges and in some cases they may even require use new kinds of tools and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Ross |first =Seamus |last2 =Gow |first2 =Ann |publication-date = 1999 |title = Digital archaeology?

===The library as a sacred institution===
In her book "Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship", Nancy Kalikow Maxwell discusses how libraries are capable of performing some of the same functions as religion.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship|last=Maxwell|first=Nancy Kalikow|publisher=American Library Association|year=2006|isbn=0-8389-0917-5|place=Chicago|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many librarians feel that their work is done for some higher purpose.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;  The same can be said for preservation librarians. One instance of the library's role as sacred is to provide a sense of [[immortality]]: with the ever-changing world outside, the library will remain stable and dependable.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; Preservation is a great help in this regard. Through digitization and reformatting, preservation librarians are able to retain material while at the same time adapting to new methods. In this way, libraries can adapt to the changes in user needs without changing the quality of the material itself. Through preservation efforts, patrons can rest assured that although materials are constantly deteriorating over time, the library itself will remain a stable, reliable environment for their information needs. Another sacred ability of the library is to provide information and a connection to the past.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; By working to slow down the processes of deterioration and decay of library materials, preservation practices help keep this link to the past alive.

'''Procatalepsis''', also called '''prolepsis''' or '''prebuttal''', is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker raises an objection to their own argument and then immediately answers it. By doing so, they hope to strengthen their argument by dealing with possible counter-arguments before their audience can raise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialog Theory for Critical Argumentation|author=Douglas N. Walton|pages=106|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=978-90-272-1885-8|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]] anticipating future responses and answering possible objections will set up one's argument for a strong defense. The ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' states that there are three distinct theoretical uses of prolepsis: argumentation, literary discussion, and conjunction with narratological analyses of the order of events.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childers|first1=Joseph|last2=Hentzi|first2=Gary|title=The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism|year=1995|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07243-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}}

In argumentation, procatalepsis is used to answer the opponent's possible objections before they can be made. In literary discussion, procatalepsis is used as a figure of speech in which a description is used before it is strictly applicable. Sayings such as "I'm a dead man" exemplify the suggestion of a state that has not yet occurred. In [[Narratology|narratological analyses]] prolepsis can be used with the order of events and presentation of events in texts. This refers to the study of narrative in respect to "flash-forwards" in which a future event serves as an interruption of the present time of the text.&lt;ref name="ColumbiaDict" /&gt;

Example:
* "It is difficult to see how a pilot boat could be completely immune to capsizing or plunging, but pilot boat design criteria must meet the needs of the industry and pilotage authorities."

As a linguistic phenomenon found in both classic and current languages, prolepsis is described as the construction whereby the subject of a subordinate clause occurs by anticipation as an object in the main clause.&lt;ref&gt;Panhuis, Dirk. "Prolepsis in Greek as a Discourse Strategy." ''Glotta'' 62.1/2 (1984): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 30 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition is strictly technical as used in linguistics, it has also been used to describe the more general phenomenon of objects or phrases appearing earlier than intended or expected. 

==Other examples in rhetoric and argument== 

Procatalepsis as a rhetorical technique is also related to and used in other forms and techniques. A [[hypophora]] is described as a figure of speech in which a speaker raises a question then immediately answers it. Since these questions are often raised as possible dissenting opinions or audience objections, the hypophora can be said to be a use of procatalepsis.

The [[Straw Man]] argument, an informal fallacy in which one misrepresents an opposing argument in order to further one's own, can serve as an example of misused procatalepsis. In this fallacy, the rhetor misconstrues the words, arguments, or views of an opponent, most often on purpose, to facilitate rebuttal or create a false impression on the audience. This, in effect, creates a "straw man" against which the rhetor will then defend and strengthen his or her argument. &lt;ref&gt;Douglas Walton, "The Straw Man Fallacy." ''In Logic and Argumentation'', ed. Johan van Bentham, Frans H. van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst and Frank Veltman. Amsterdam, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, North-Holland, 1996. pp. 115-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct use of procatalepsis is still an effective tactic in an argument, since it allows the rhetor to answer opponents before they have a chance to raise the counterargument themselves. This "inoculation" can be subtle, but also signaled rather obviously (e.g. "Now, my opponent might argue that X. But, as you can see, Y"). The unique benefit to this more overt approach is twofold: The rhetor successfully replies to an opposing argument or audience objection, but also builds a sort of trust and authority with the audience. Then, if the opponent does in fact bring up the argument that the rhetor anticipated, the rhetor appears to be correct not only in the subject matter of the argument but in the general course of the argument itself.

==Inoculation==
Procatalepsis is linked to the rhetorical term [[Inoculation theory|inoculation]]. The ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory'' describes this rhetorical technique in relation to its medical definition: introducing small doses of viruses to the body in order to build up immunization.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Littlejohn|first1=Stephen W.|last2=Foss|first2=Karen A.|title=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory|year=2009|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2013}} In rhetoric, the small dose of the threat parallels to the awareness of the opposing argument that is used to build up one's argument by defense in prolepsis. William McGuire proposed the Inoculation Theory in 1964 to challenge attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that make an argument more resistant when exposed to counter views in weakened, small doses. Persuasion research in the 1950s found that providing two sides of an issue created a greater resistance to later arguments.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt; This is closely related to the rhetorical use of procatalepsis as an opposing argument to defend the intended view of the argument.

Inoculation and procatalepsis are both present in certain courtroom situations, as described in the ''Encyclopedia of Communication Theory''. An attorney may set up their defense by disclaiming the negative views or classifications of the accused as untrue: "The prosecutor will call Ms. Jones evil, a bad mother, and a poor member of society, but these labels are not true. I will prove to you their inaccuracy." When the prosecutor asserts an attack on Ms. Jones' character, the jury is already prepared and expecting to hear it and they may question or even discount these accusations. The goal is not to overwhelm the audience members with anticipation or the opposing view of the argument, but rather to use the inverse argument to one's advantage through strategic rhetoric.&lt;ref name="EnclopedComm" /&gt;

{{sociology}}
'''Rational-legal authority''' (also known as '''rational authority''', '''legal authority''', '''rational domination''', '''legal domination''', or '''bureaucratic authority''') is a form of [[leadership]] in which the [[authority]] of an [[organization]] or a ruling [[regime]] is largely tied to legal [[rationality]], [[Legitimacy (political science)|legal legitimacy]] and [[bureaucracy]]. The majority of the modern [[State (polity)|states]] of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are rational-legal authorities, according to those who use this form of classification.

==Rational-legal authority==
In [[sociology]], the concept of rational-legal domination comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]] (one of several classifications of government used by sociologists); the other two forms being [[traditional authority]] and [[charismatic authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition. Charismatic authority is legitimized by the personality and leadership qualities of the ruling individual. Finally, rational-legal authority derives its powers from the system of [[bureaucracy]] and [[legality]].

==Legal rationality and legitimate authority ==
Under rational-legal authority, legitimacy is seen as coming from a legal order and the laws that have been enacted in it (see also [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]]).

Weber defined legal order as a system where the rules are enacted and obeyed as legitimate because they are in line with other laws on how they can be enacted and how they should be obeyed. Further, they are enforced by a government that monopolizes their enactment and the [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|legitimate use of physical force]].

If society, as a whole, approves the exercise of the power in a certain way, then the power is considered "legitimate authority". 
* An example of this type of authority would be the viewing of a police car in our rear view mirrors.

== Max Weber's theory: type of authority ==
Max Weber broke down legitimate authority into three different types of societies: Traditional Authority, Rational-legal Authority, and Charismatic Authority. Each of these authorities have their own unique complex societies that have evolved from simple definitions.

=== 1.Traditional authority: traditional grounds ===

* Is the type of power that has been around longer, it is the type of power that is traditionally rooted in beliefs and the practices of society. This authority is liked by many individuals because of two main reasons: the inheritance of past generations and religiousness that the societies have.
* Traditional authority is based on a tradition or custom that is followed by the traditional leaders. In traditional authority, status is a key concept. There are no requirements to serving a traditional leader but there are no salaries. The consequences to traditional authority are discouragement of education and rational calculation.
* Traditional authority consists of a dominant profile, one who embodies tradition and rule. This type of leadership exemplifies the power to construct order.

=== 2. Rational-legal authority: rational grounds ===

* Acquire from law and is constructed from the reliance of society's rules and laws. This type of authority has the confidence to leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy. Rational-legal authority is the basis of modern democracies. Examples of this type of authority: officials elected by voters, rules that are in the constitution, or policies that are written in a formal document.
* Rational-legal authority is built on a structure of bureaucr
* Rational-legal authority requires a logical and systematic approach to leadership. Weber's rational leadership prevails in decision making.

=== 3. Charismatic authority: charismatic grounds ===

* Comes from individuals and their personal qualities that they have to offer. Certain individuals are influential to others with their unique qualities which help them gain followers. The "charismatic" individuals exercise power and authority over a whole society or even a specific group of within a bigger society. The exercise of their power of these individuals are either for good or bad. Examples of these charismatic leaders can range from: Joan of Arc to Adolf Hitler or Martin Luther king Jr to Jesus Christ.
* Charismatic authority has no clear structure. It is based one's individual influence.  One is chosen to be staff by their charismatic characteristics. Someone under a charismatic authority lives under gifts not salary. As long as someone has influence they will be a legitimate power.
* In charismatic authority, confidence is the driving force for leadership. With charismatic authority leadership has the ability to connect distinct groups and lead them to the finish line.

==Emergence of the modern state==
Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see [[traditional authority]]) uniquely in the [[Western culture|Occidental civilization]]. The prerequisites for the modern Western state are:
* Monopolization by central authority of the means of administration and control based on a centralized and stable system of taxation and use of physical force
* Monopolization of legislative
* Organisation of an officialdom, dependent upon the central authority

Weber argued that some of those attributes have existed in various time or places, but together they existed only in Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were
* Emergence of rational-legal rationality (various [[status class|status groups]] in the [[Western world|Occident]] promoted that emergence)
* Emergence of modern officialdom (bureaucracy), which required
** Development of the money economy, where officials are compensated in money instead of kind (usually land grants)
** Quantitative and qualitative expansion of administrative tasks
** Centralization and increased efficiency of administration.

Weber's belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in [[History of China|Imperial China]] has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century.

==Modern state==
According to Max Weber, a modern state exists where a political community has:
* An administrative and legal order that has been created and can be changed by legislation that also determines its role
* Binding authority over citizens and actions in its jurisdiction
* The right to legitimately use the physical force in its jurisdiction

An important attribute of Weber's definition of a modern state was that it is a [[bureaucracy]].

The vast majority of the modern states from the 20th century onward fall under the rational-legal authority category.

==Rational-legal leaders==
The majority of modern [[bureaucrat|bureaucratic officials]] and [[politician|political leaders]] represent this type of authority.

&lt;u&gt;Officials:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are personally free.
* Serve a higher authority.
* Are appointed on the basis of conduct and their technical qualifications.
* Are responsible for the impartial execution of assigned tasks.
* Their work is a full-time occupation.
* Their work is rewarded by a salary and prospects of career advancement.

&lt;u&gt;Politicians:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are solely responsible for independent action.
* Must recognize that public actions that conflict with their basic policy must be rejected.
* Should have [[charismatic authority|charismatic appeal]] to win [[election]]s under conditions of [[universal suffrage]].
&lt;u&gt;Additional, Weber provided ten necessities addressing: "how individual officials are appointed and work". The administrative staff are under the supreme authority for legal authority in a bureaucratic administrative style.&lt;/u&gt;

# They are personally free and subject to authority only with respect to their impersonal official obligation.
# They are organized in a clearly defined hierarchy of offices.
# Each office has a clearly defined sphere of competence in the legal sense.
# The office is filled by a free contractual relationship or free selection.
# Candidates are selected on the basis of technical qualification.
# They are remunerated by fixed salaries in money for the most part, with a right to pensions.
# The office is treated as the sole, or at least primary, occupation of incumbent.
# It constitutes a career. Promotions are dependent on the judgement of superiors.
# The official works entirely separated from ownership of the means of administration and without appropriation of his/her position.
# He is subject to strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of the office.

On Christmas Day 1950, four Scottish students from the [[University of Glasgow]] ([[Ian Hamilton (lawyer)|Ian Hamilton]], [[Gavin Vernon]], Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart) removed the [[Stone of Scone]] from [[Westminster Abbey]] in [[London]] and took the Stone back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1457731/Gavin-Vernon.html |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/defining-our-destiny-1-519098 |title=Defining our destiny |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The students were members of the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a group that supported [[Scottish Home Rule|home rule]] for Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; In 2008 the incident was made into a film called ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''.&lt;ref name="scotsman2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/film-review-stone-of-destiny-1-1438029 |title=Film review: Stone of Destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Stone of Scone, the ancient Stone upon which Scottish monarchs had been crowned, was taken from [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]] near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland by King [[Edward I of England]] (Longshanks) in 1296 during the struggles against English invasion, which historians call the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]] as a [[looting|spoil of war]], kept in Westminster Abbey in London and fitted into [[King Edward's Chair]].&lt;ref name="destiny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk/highlights-stone-of-destiny |title=Stone of Destiny |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |year=2012 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent [[England|English]] and then [[United Kingdom|British]] monarchs were crowned sitting upon the chair and Stone.&lt;ref name="destiny" /&gt;  At the time, the Stone was viewed as a symbol of Scottish nationhood; by removing the Stone to London, Edward I was declaring himself 'King of the Scots'.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In 1950, Ian Hamilton, a student at the [[University of Glasgow]], approached Gavin Vernon with a plan to remove the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey in London and return it to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The plan was funded by a [[Glasgow]] businessman, Robert Gray, who was a councillor on the [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways|Glasgow Corporation]].&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scotsman3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/top-stories/first-stone-raider-meets-his-final-destiny-1-519088 |title=First Stone raider meets his final destiny |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vernon agreed to participate in the plan along with Kay Matheson and Alan Stuart who were also students in Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  By removing the Stone the group hoped to promote their cause for Scottish [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] and to reawaken a sense of national identity amongst the Scottish people.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;

==Removal of the Stone of Scone==
In December 1950, a few days before Christmas, the four students from Glasgow drove to London in two [[Ford Anglia]]s, a journey which took them eighteen hours.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/gavin-vernon-engineer-who-helped-return-the-stone-of-destiny-to-scotland-1.89326 |title=Gavin Vernon Engineer who helped return the Stone of Destiny to Scotland |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]] |date=1 April 2004 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On arrival in London they had a brief meeting at [[Lyons Corner House]] and decided to make an immediate attempt at removing the Stone from the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Later that day Ian Hamilton hid under a trolley in the Abbey, but was caught by a nightwatchman after the Abbey doors had been closed, briefly questioned, and then let go.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The following day Vernon and Stuart returned to Westminster Abbey and learned some information on the watchmen's shifts.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  In the middle of that night, the three men entered a works yard and gained entrance into [[Poet's Corner]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Reaching the Chapel containing the tomb of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and [[King Edward's Chair]], they pulled down the barrier.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On removing the Stone from under the Chair, it crashed to the floor and broke into two pieces&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The three men, using Hamilton's coat, dragged the larger piece down the high altar steps, then Hamilton took the smaller piece to one of the cars waiting outside.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

Ian Hamilton placed the small piece of Stone in the boot of the car and got into the passenger seat.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he did this, Kay Matheson noticed a policeman in the gaslight; Hamilton and Matheson immediately fell into a lovers' clinch.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The policeman stopped and the three proceeded to have a conversation even though it was 5 A.M.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Having shared some jokes and a cigarette Matheson and Hamilton drove off to [[Victoria, London|Victoria]], Hamilton getting out on the way to walk back to the Abbey.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

On his arrival there was no sign of Vernon and Stuart, so he proceeded to drag the large piece of stone to the car himself.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  As he was driving away he saw Vernon and Stuart walking towards him.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

The stone was so heavy that the springs on the car were sagging, so Vernon, fearing the alarm had been raised, made his way to [[Rugby, Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Hamilton and Stuart drove to [[Kent]], hid the large piece of stone in a field and made their way back to Scotland.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  Matheson left her car, containing the small piece of the Stone, with a friend in the Midlands, and like Vernon made her way back to Scotland by train.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  On discovering that the Stone was missing, the authorities closed the border between Scotland and England for the first time in four hundred years.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

A fortnight later Hamilton and some friends – including John Josselyn, whose 21st great grandfather was, ironically, Edward I &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trees.ancestry.co.uk/tree/25017403/person/1650035497 | title=John Rodney Josselyn - Overview - Ancestry.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; – recovered the two pieces of stone and brought them to Glasgow.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  They hired a stonemason, Baillie [[Robert Gray (Scottish politician)|Robert Gray]], to mend the Stone.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  Gray placed a brass rod inside the Stone containing a piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  To this day, nobody knows what was written on the piece of paper.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

In April 1951 the police received a tip-off and the Stone was found on the site of the High Altar at [[Arbroath Abbey]] where in 1320 the assertion of Scottish nationhood was made in the [[Declaration of Arbroath]].&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The Stone was returned to Westminster Abbey in February 1952.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

The police conducted an investigation with specific focus on Scotland.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;  All four of the group were interviewed and all later confessed to their involvement with the exception of Ian Hamilton.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  The authorities decided not to prosecute as the potential for the event to become politicised was far too great.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;  [[Hartley Shawcross, Baron Shawcross|Sir Hartley Shawcross]], addressing Parliament on the matter, said: "The clandestine removal of the Stone from Westminster Abbey, and the manifest disregard for the sanctity of the abbey, were vulgar acts of vandalism which have caused great distress and offence both in England and Scotland.  I do not think, however, that the public interest required criminal proceedings to be taken."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/319077062/13B6B8FC20016577E13/1?accountid=15842 |title=Gavin Vernon |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2 April 2004 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
To understand the implications of the raid, one must understand the political landscape in the United Kingdom just after the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3743946/Ian-Hamilton-on-Stone-of-Destiny-I-felt-I-was-holding-Scotlands-soul.html |title=Ian Hamilton on Stone of Destiny: I felt I was holding Scotland's soul |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=14 December 2008 |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Kingdom was a unified nation and even in an era of post-war austerity, devolution was not on the political agenda.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  At the time, the [[Scottish National Party]] had 0.7% of the vote, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had withdrawn its commitment to devolution, and the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Conservative Party]] was at the high point of its popularity in Scotland.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The raid was completely unexpected and gave the cause of Scottish devolution and nationalism a brief sense of prominence in the public conscience throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

The students became notorious for the daring heist and in Scotland they achieved nigh-on hero status, while in contrast the English were somewhat bewildered.&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt;  The heist and the students became synonymous with the devolution and [[Scottish National Party|nationalist]] political movements in Scotland from 1950 onwards.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt;

Over time the incident encouraged a belief in change, throwing open to scrutiny the Union, which had existed since [[Acts of union 1707|1707]].&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;   Long before the Stone was officially returned to Scotland in 1996 and the Scottish people voted for devolution in 1997, the removal of the Stone of Scone in 1950 contributed to those events.&lt;ref name="scotsman1" /&gt;

== Portrayals in popular culture ==

The removal of the stone was the subject of a contemporary [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] song by Donald MacIntyre, "''[[Òran na Cloiche]]''" ("The Song of the Stone"). Its return to England was the subject of an accompanying [[lament]], "''Nuair a Chaidh a' Chlach a Thilleadh''" ("When the Stone Was Returned").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacMillan |first=Somerled |date=1968 |title=Sporan Dhòmhnaill - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre, the Paisley Bard |trans-title=Donald's Purse - Gaelic Poems and Songs by the late Donald Macintyre |url= |language=gd |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |isbn= |page=xxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hamilton's book, ''The Taking of the Stone of Destiny'', was made into a film entitled ''[[Stone of Destiny (film)|Stone of Destiny]]''. The film depicted Hamilton (played by [[Charlie Cox]]) as the protagonist leading a team of students to reclaim the [[Stone of Scone]]. Additionally, Hamilton had a small, [[cameo role]].&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037156/ Stone of Destiny]," ''[[The Internet Movie Database]]''. ''(Retrieved 2010-01-09.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Alba]] released an hourlong bilingual (Scottish Gaelic and English) dramatization of Kay Matheson's (played by [[Kathleen MacInnes]]) interrogation by the police. In this version Matheson pretends not to speak English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNJgudcRi64|title=AN CEASNACHADH - Interrogation of a Highland Lass|first=|last=Gaelic Filmz|date=19 February 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' the episode "The Stone of Scone" (1997) reveals the Stone of Destiny was swiped and duplicated by immortals: the Scotsman [[Duncan MacLeod]] and his friends [[Hugh Fitzcairn]] and [[Amanda (Highlander)|Amanda Darieux]]. A cover story involving students was concocted to conceal their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/highlander/the-stone-of-scone-55212/|title=Highlander: The Stone of Scone|first=|last=TV.com|website=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14269">The '''Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf''' was (despite the name) the first international [[Meeting|conference]] of [[deaf]] educators held in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1880. It is commonly known as "the '''Milan Conference'''". After deliberations from September 6 to 11, 1880, the conference declared that [[oral education]] (oralism) was superior to [[sign language|manual education]] and passed a resolution banning the use of sign language in school. After its passage in 1880, [[schools]] in European countries and [[History of deaf education in the United States|the United States]] switched to using [[speech therapy]] without [[sign language]] as a method of [[education for the deaf]]. A formal apology was made by the board at the 21st International Congress on Education of the Deaf in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]], in 2010 accepting the dangerous ramifications of such ban as an act of discrimination and violation of human and constitutional rights.

== Background ==

[[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], both prominent U.S. figures in deaf education, had been debating the effectiveness of oral-only education versus an education that utilizes [[sign language]] as a means of visual communication, culminating in the Milan Conference in 1880 that passed eight resolutions on deaf education.

The Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf (which, despite its name, was actually the first) was an international meeting of deaf educators from at least seven countries. There were five delegates from America and approximately 164 delegates total in attendance. The Congress was planned and organized by a committee created by the Pereire Society, a group that was against sign language. More than half of the people invited were known oralists; therefore, the Congress was biased and most, if not all, of the resolutions that were voted on by the delegates gave results in favor of the oral method. Many of the resolutions were worded in ways that supported the oral method, such as "Considering the incontestable superiority of speech over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society, and in giving him a more perfect knowledge of language,/Declares –/That the Oral method ought to be preferred that of signs for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb".&lt;ref name=Milan1880&gt;

{{cite web |url=http://milan1880.com/milan1880congress/eightresolutions.html |title=Eight Resolutions |last=Sturley |first=Nick |year=2010 |work=Milan 1880 |publisher= |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Milan Conference was organized by the Pereire Society, an organization formed by the family of [[Jacob Rodrigues Pereira]] of France and financed by their numerous railroad and bank holdings (including the [[Société Générale du Crédit Mobilier]]). The Pereire Society was a strong supporter of oralism. They organized the Milan conference with the intent to ban sign language. They secured this outcome by carefully selecting who was invited, inviting the delegates to see the oralist success in a local school, and by encouraging negative reactions to those giving speeches supporting sign language and cheering those supporting [[oralism]].

== Delegates ==

The Milan Conference was attended by 164 delegates of various countries. Out of these 164 delegates only one, James Denison, was deaf. The conference president was [[Abbot|Abbe]] Giulio Tarra.

The nationality of the remaining delegates is unknown. The five U.S. delegates present were James Denison, [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]], [[Thomas Gallaudet (1822–1902)|Reverend Thomas Gallaudet]], Isaac Lewis Peet and Charles A Stoddard.

== Conference ==

The Conference was held in the Regio Instituto Tenico di Santa Martha, Milan. It was held from 6 September to 11 September 1880. The aim of the conference was to ban sign language from deaf education. During the conference there were 12 speakers who gave their opinions on the issues connected with deaf education. Nine of the twelve speakers gave an oralist view, and three (the Gallaudet father and son, and Richard Elliot, a teacher from England) supported the use of sign language.

== Eight resolutions ==

1. The Convention, considering the incontestable superiority of articulation over signs in restoring the deaf-mute to society and giving him a fuller knowledge of language, declares that the oral method should be preferred to that of signs in education and the instruction of deaf-mutes.
::Passed 160 to 4

2. The Convention, considering that the simultaneous use of articulation and signs has the disadvantage of injuring articulation and lip-reading and the precision of ideas, declares that the pure oral method should be preferred.
::Passed 150 to 16

3. Considering that a great number of the deaf and dumb are not receiving the benefit of instruction, and that this condition is owing to the impotence of [[family|families]] and of [[institution]]s, recommends that [[government]]s should take the necessary steps that all the deaf and dumb may be educated.
::Passed unanimously.

4. Considering that the teaching of the speaking deaf by the Pure Oral method should resemble as much as possible that of those who hear and speak, declares 
:a) That the most natural and effectual means by which the speaking deaf may acquire the knowledge of language is the "intuitive" method, viz., that which consists in setting forth, first by [[speech]], and then by writing the objects and the facts which are placed before the eyes of the pupils.
:b) That in the first, or maternal, period the [[deaf]]-[[Muteness|mute]] ought to be led to the observation of [[grammar|grammatical]] forms by means of examples and of practical exercises, and that in the second period he ought to be assisted to deduce from these examples the grammatical rules, expressed with the utmost simplicity and clearness.
:c) That books, written with words and in forms of [[language]] known to the pupil, can be put into his hands at any time.
::Motion carried.

5. Considering the want of books sufficiently elementary to help the gradual and progressive development of language, recommends that the [[teacher]]s of the Oral system should apply themselves to the publication of special works on the subject.
::Motion carried.

6. Considering the results obtained by the numerous inquiries made concerning the deaf and dumb of every age and every condition long after they had quit school, who, when interrogated upon various subjects, have answered correctly, with sufficient clearness of articulation, and [[lip reading|read]] the lips of their questioners with the greatest facility, declares:
:a) That the deaf and dumb taught by the Pure Oral method do not forget after leaving school the knowledge which they have acquired there, but develop it still further by conversation and reading, when have been made so easy for them.
:b) That in their [[conversation]] with [[speech|speaking]] persons they make use exclusively of speech.
:c) That speech and lip-reading so far from being lost, are developed by practice.
::Motion carried.

7. Considering that the education of the deaf and dumb by speech has peculiar requirements; considering also that the experienced of teachers of deaf-mutes is almost unanimous, declares
:a) That the most favourable age for admitting a deaf child into school is from eight to ten years.
:b) That the school term ought to be seven years at least; but eight years would be preferable.
:c) That no teacher can effectually teach a class of more than ten children on the Pure Oral method.
::Motion carried.

8. Considering that the application of the Pure Oral method in institutions where it is not yet in active operation, should be to avoid the certainty of failure prudent, gradual, progressive, recommends 
:a) That the pupils newly received into the schools should form a class by themselves, where instruction could be given by speech.
:b) That these pupils should be absolutely separated from others too far advanced to be instructed by speech, and whose education will be completed by signs.
:c) That each year a new speaking class be established, until all the old pupils taught by signs have completed their education.
::Motion carried.

== Opposition ==

Delegates from the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] were the only ones who opposed the use of oralism as a sole method of instruction, but were unsuccessful in their efforts at the congress. Edward Miner Gallaudet and Reverend Thomas Gallaudet were among the protesters who fought against the oralist method. Since failing to overturn the Milan resolutions, Gallaudet ensured that the United States would not be completely converted to oralism-only, which included allowing high school students in institutes for the deaf to use sign language and maintaining [[Gallaudet University|Gallaudet College]] (now Gallaudet University) as a [[university]] that permits full usage of [[sign language]].

The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] was also formed in the United States in response to the Milan Conference and was dedicated toward preserving [[American Sign Language]].

== First repudiation 100 years later in Hamburg ==

At the 15th International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) held in Hamburg, West Germany in 1980, the first major precedent for the repudiation of the 1880 resolutions was set by a large group of attendees who rejected the 1880 resolutions in practical-moral terms by the method of informal consensus in deciding that the 1880 resolutions had no appropriate standing, originally, in 1880. As explained by Richard G. Brill: "At the International Congress in Hamburg in 1980, however, the Milan resolutions were challenged head-on in major professional addresses at the opening of the congresses. It was recognized and accepted that resolutions concerning methodology were not appropriate at such international congresses because of the unlikelihood that the delegates fully represented the practices and philosophies of their home countries."&lt;ref&gt;Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garretson, Merv. 2010. ''My Yesterdays'', Xlibris, pp. 127-128.{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seek to directly overturn the 1880s resolutions, the Congress put forward "Recommendations" for informational purposes, including the following: "Recommended that this International Congress on Education of the Deaf, in convocation gathered at Hamburg, West Germany, in August 1980, affirms and declares that all deaf children have the right to flexible communication in the mode or combination of modes which best meets their individual needs."&lt;ref&gt;Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharkey and Hikins deemed this Recommendation, along with the others, as constituting overturning the 1880 Milan Congress's resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, William F. and James W. Hikins. 1993. Edward Miner Gallaudet's "Remarks on the Combined System": An Analysis of the "Preservative" Function of Rhetoric of Education, ''Communication Education'', Vol. 42, No. 1, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the previous precedent set in 1980, in July 2010 in Vancouver, Canada, the board of the 21st International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) formally voted to reject all of the 1880 Milan resolutions.&lt;ref name="ICED"&gt;Tucker, James.

{{sociology}}

'''Sociology of architecture''' is the sociological study of  the [[built environment]] and the role and occupation of architects in modern societies.

Architecture is basically constituted of the aesthetic, the engineering and the social aspects. The built environment which is made up of designed spaces and the activities of people are inter-related and inseparable. It is for us to understand this interrelationship and put it down appropriately on paper.
[[Social organization|Social institutions]] are many and these social institutions sometimes need functional spaces to allow the people using the building to benefit from all aspects of both, the purpose of what inhabits the building and by the varied structure and organized flow of communication. The way the buildings are designed to fulfill the needs of these social institutions /social requirements can be said to be the compliance of social aspects in architecture.

==Cultural sociology==
Architecture is the visual shape ("Gestalt") of society. And within that, all the various building types (architecture of consumption, of mobility, of the political and religious, as well as factories, prisons, cinema buildings, etc.) could become objects of architectural sociology. For example: how a specific architecture 'expresses' the structure and principles of a given society.

==Classical sociology of architecture==
Such [[Social research|sociological analysis]] of architecture can be found in the classic authors of sociology in [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Norbert Elias]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Siegfried Kracauer]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Maurice Halbwachs]], [[Karel Teige]] and others.

==Sociology of architectonic artifacts==
The sociology of technology offers approaches to a sociology of (architectonic) artifacts. Initially, this sociology is interested in technical matters. While buildings (as art and technic) are not in the core of this discipline. The perspective of architecture as artifact would be the question of 'interactions' between architecture and subject: how a very specific architecture suggests certain ways, movements, perceptions.

==Urban sociology and sociology of space==
The term "[[social space]]" is used by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and others (in contrast to architecture or built environment) in a more abstract sense: as social constituted spatial structures. [[Georg Simmel]] founded such a [[sociology of space]] and always watched the architecture of society.

Simmel unfolded also an [[urban sociology]] (his articles were read in [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]]): in his question of the specific ways of life in big cities ( "Big cities and life of spirit", 1903). Urban sociology primarily deals with social structures ''within'' the city: their points are for instance processes of segregation, urbanization and the decline of cities. Recently, there is a research focus on "differences of cities", which will be more associated with a sociology of architecture. [[Ronald Daus]] is introducing new concepts in this area, studying the history of extra-[[Europe]]an [[Megacities]].

The '''sociology of art''' is a subfield of [[sociology]] concerned with the social worlds of [[art]] and [[aesthetics]].

Studying the sociology of art throughout history is the study of the [[social history of art]], how various societies contributed to the appearance of certain artists.

In her 1970 book ''Meaning and Expression: Toward a Sociology of Art'', Hanna Deinhard gives these defining features of a sociology of art: "The point of departure of the sociology of art is the question: How is it possible that works of art, which always originate as products of human activity ''within'' a particular time and society and ''for'' a particular time, society, or function -- even though they are not necessarily produced as 'works of art' -- can live beyond their time and seem expressive and meaningful in completely different epochs and societies? On the other hand, how can the age and society that produced them be recognized in the works?&lt;ref name="M&amp;E" /&gt;"

== Background ==
[[File:Dr. Robert Hazen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Robert Hazen|Dr. Robert Hazen]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

As the Clarence B. Robinson Professor at [[George Mason University]], [[Robert Hazen]] developed innovative courses to promote [[scientific literacy]] in both scientists and non-scientists.&lt;ref name=DistinguishedPresentation&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemley|first1=R. J.|title=Presentation of the Distinguished Public Service Medal of the Mineralogical Society of America for 2009|journal=American Mineralogist|date=25 March 2010|volume=95|issue=4|pages=666–666|doi=10.2138/am.2010.557|bibcode=2010AmMin..95..666H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a collaboration with physicist [[James Trefil]], he wrote three undergraduate textbooks: ''The Sciences: An Integrated Approach'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trefil|first1=James|last2=Hazen|first2=Robert M.|title=The sciences : an integrated approach|date=1994|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0471303008|edition=A preliminary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Physical Sciences: An Integrated Approach'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|last2=Trefil|first2=James|title=The Physical science : an integrated approach|date=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471002499}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Physics Matters: An Introduction to Conceptual Physics'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trefil|first1=James|last2=Hazen|first2=Robert M.|title=Physics matter : an introduction to conceptual physics|date=2004|publisher=J.

A fan of the overall series of [[The Great Courses]] is [[Bill Gates]], who said the courses have "incredible professors" who cover "every topic that you can think of".&lt;ref name="TIME-20180104"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gates |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Gates |title=The 4 Learning Hacks Bill Gates Swears By |url=http://time.com/5066247/bill-gates-learning-hacks/ |date=4 January 2018 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=9 May 2018 |quote=... One of my favorite sources for interesting lectures is The Teaching Company. They get incredible professors to teach courses on pretty much every topic you can think of.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16353">'''Words per minute''', commonly abbreviated '''wpm''' (sometimes uppercased '''WPM'''), is a measure of [[word]]s processed in a minute, often used as a measurement of the speed of typing, [[reading speed|reading]] or Morse code sending and receiving.

== Alphanumeric entry ==

Since the length or duration of words is clearly variable, for the purpose of measurement of text entry, the definition of each "word" is often standardized to be five characters or [[keystroke]]s long in English,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Sabbir Arif and Wolfgang Stuerzlinger. 2009.[http://www.asarif.com/pub/papers/Arif_TICSTH09.pdf Analysis of Text Entry Performance Metrics].

For example, under such a method applied to plain English text the phrase "I run" counts as one word, but "rhinoceros" and "let's talk" would both count as two.

Brandon Raziano found that one study of average [[computer user]]s in 1997, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Karat CM, Halverson C, Horn D, Karat J |year=1999 |title=Patterns of entry and correction in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems |booktitle=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '99) |publisher=ACM |location=New York, NY, US |pages=568–575 |doi=10.1145/302979.303160 |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/302979.303160 |isbn=0-201-48559-1 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, when the group was divided into "fast", "moderate", and "slow" groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm, respectively.&lt;ref name="Brown1988"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brown |first=CM |year=1988 |title=Human-computer interface design guidelines |location=Norwood, NJ |publisher=Ablex Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the era of desktop computers, fast typing skills became much more widespread.

An average professional [[Copy typist|typist]] types usually in speeds of 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.&lt;ref name="Ayres&amp;Martinás2005"&gt;{{citation |year=2005 |author=Ayres, Robert U |authorlink=Robert Ayres (scientist) |author2=Martinás, Katalin |chapter=120 wpm for very skilled typist |page=41 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=typists+%22120+words+per+minute%22#v=onepage&amp;q=typists%20%22120%20words%20per%20minute%22&amp;f=false |title=On the Reappraisal of Microeconomics: Economic Growth and Change in a Material World |place=Cheltenham, UK &amp; Northampton, Massachusetts |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-84542-272-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reappraisal+microeconomics#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as "[[hunt and peck]]" typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds.&lt;ref name="Brown1988"/&gt; From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.

== Stenotype ==
{{Main article|Stenotype}}

Stenotype keyboards enable the trained user to input text as fast as 225 wpm or faster at very high accuracy for an extended period of time, which is sufficient for real-time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning. While dropout rates are very high—in some cases, only 10%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-school-search.com/review/stenotype-institute-of-jacksonville |title=Stenotype Institute of Jacksonville Jacksonville - Review &amp; Ranking |publisher=American-school-search.com |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even less graduate—stenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100–120 wpm within six months, which is faster than most alphanumeric typists. Guinness World Records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/fastest-realtime-court-reporter-%28stenotype-writing%29/ |title=Fastest realtime court reporter (stenotype writing) |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives 360 wpm with 97.23% accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a stenotype.

== Numeric entry ==

The numeric entry or 10 key speed is a measure of one's ability to manipulate the [[numeric keypad]] found on most modern separate computer keyboards. It is used to measure speed for jobs such as [[Data entry clerk|data entry]] of number information on items such as [[remittance advice]], bills, or checks, as deposited to [[lockbox]]es. It is measured in "Keystrokes per hour," or KPH. Many jobs require a certain KPH, often 8,000 or 10,000.

== Handwriting ==
&lt;!-- The average human being [[Penmanship|hand-writes]] at 31 words per minute for [[memory|memorized]] text and 19 words per minute while copying.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Brown, C. M. (1988). Human-computer interface design guidelines. Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2016}}--&gt;

For an adult population (age range 18–64) the average speed of copying is 68 letters per minute (approximately 13 wpm), with the range from a minimum of 26 to a maximum of 113 letters per minute (approximately 5 to 20 wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bledsoe Jr.|first1=Dave|title=Handwriting Speed in an Adult Population|journal=Advance for Occupational Therapy Practitioners|date=2011|volume=27|issue=22|pages=10|url=http://occupational-therapy.advanceweb.com/Archives/Article-Archives/Handwriting-Speed-in-an-Adult-Population.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of police interview records showed that the highest speed fell in the range 120–155 characters per minute, the highest possible limit being 190 characters per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardcastle|first1=R. A.|last2=Matthews|first2=C. J.|title=Speed of writing|journal=Journal of the Forensic Science Society|date=January 1991|volume=31|issue=1|pages=21–29|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015736891731149|doi=10.1016/s0015-7368(91)73114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various studies the speed of handwriting of 3–7 graders varies from 25 to 94 letters per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zaviani|first1=Jenny|last2=Wallen|first2=Margaret|editor1-last=Henderson|editor1-first=Anne|editor2-last=Pehoski|editor2-first=Charlane|title=Hand Function in the Child: Foundations for Remediation|date=2006|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis, MO|page=228|edition=2nd|chapter=The Development of Graphomotor Skills|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2g51sanc4AMC&amp;pg=PA228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[stenography]] (shorthand) methods, this rate increases greatly. Handwriting speeds up to 350 words per minute have been achieved in shorthand competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/12/30/102911691.pdf |title=New World'S Record For Shorthand Speed |publisher=New York Times |date=1922-12-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reading and comprehension ==
Words per minute is a common metric for assessing [[reading (activity)|reading]] speed and is often used in the context of remedial skills evaluation, as well as in the context of [[speed reading]], where it is a controversial measure of reading performance.

A word in this context is the same as in the context of speech&lt;!--, above--&gt;.

Research done in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trauzettel-Klosinski|first1=Susanne|last2=Dietz|first2=Klaus|title=Standardized Assessment of Reading Performance: The New International Reading Speed Texts IReST|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science|date=August 2012|volume=53|issue=9|url=http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2166061}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured the speed at which subjects read a text aloud, and found the average speed across 17 different languages to be 184±29 wpm or 863±234 characters per minute. However, for the languages that use the Latin or [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabets, the number of wpm varied, as low as 161±18 for [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and as high as 228±30 for English. The reason for this is different word structures in each language (longer words in such languages as Finnish and shorter words in English). However, the number of characters per minute tends to be around 1000 for all the tested languages. For the tested Asian languages that use particular writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese) these numbers are lower.

Scientific studies have demonstrated that reading—defined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every page—faster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[proofreading]] materials, people are able to read English at 200 wpm on paper, and 180 wpm on a monitor.&lt;ref name=Ziefle98&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ziefle|first1=M|title=Effects of display resolution on visual performance.|journal=Human factors|date=December 1998|volume=40|issue=4|pages=554–68|pmid=9974229|doi=10.1518/001872098779649355}}&lt;/ref&gt; [Those numbers from Ziefle, 1998, are for studies that used monitors prior to 1992. See Noyes &amp; Garland 2008 for a modern tech view of equivalence.]

== Speech and listening ==

[[Audiobook]]s are recommended to be 150–160 words per minute, which is the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. R. (1998). Guidelines for the use of multimedia in instruction, Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society 42nd Annual Meeting, 1447–1451&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slideshow|Slide presentations]] tend to be closer to 100–125 wpm for a comfortable pace,&lt;ref name=wong&gt;{{cite book|last=Wong|first=Linda|title=Essential Study Skills|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1285965620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yL2iAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=conversation+words+per+minute&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U6waU7ulFMbokQfiwYCoAg&amp;ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=conversation%20words%20per%20minute&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[auctioneer]]s can speak at about 250 wpm,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and the fastest speaking [[Policy debate#Speed|policy debaters]] speak from 350&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/magazine/319debate.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Ministers of Debate | first=Zev | last=Chafets | date=2006-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 500 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9Jld9a4olgC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=540+words+per+minute |title=Falwell Inc.: Inside a Religious, Political, Educational, and Business Empire - Dirk Smillie - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet speech calculators show that various things influence words per minute including nervousness.{{Citation needed|reason=More information required to make this assertion|date=May 2014}}

[[John Moschitta, Jr.]], was listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', for a time, as the world's fastest speaker, being able to talk at 586 wpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1988/may_24_1988_161209.html |title=John Moschitta set record for fast talking...

== Morse code ==

[[Morse code]] uses variable length sequences of short and long duration ''signals'' (dots and dashes) to represent source information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Telecommunication Union|first1=ITU|title=International Morse Code Recommendation|url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/m/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I!!PDF-E.pdf|publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. sequences for the letter "K" and numeral "2" are respectively ({{morse|dash|dot|dash}}) and ({{morse|dot|dot|dash|dash|dash}}). This variability complicates the measurement of Morse code speed rated in words per minute. Using telegram messages, the average English word length is about five characters, each averaging 5.124 dot durations or baud. Spacing between words should also be considered, being seven dot durations in the USA and five in British territories. So the average British telegraph word was 30.67 dot times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morsh|first1=Joseph E.|last2=Stannard|first2=A. F. B.|title=Studies in international Morse Code. II. A simplified method of determining code speed.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology Revue Canadienne de Psychologie|date=1947|volume=1|issue=2|pages=67–70|doi=10.1037/h0084027}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the baud rate of a Morse code is {{frac|50|60}} × word per minute rate.

It is standard practice to use two different such ''standard words'' to measure Morse code speeds in words per minute. The standard words are: "PARIS" and "CODEX". In Morse code "PARIS" has 50 dot durations, while "CODEX" has 60.

Morse is still widely used by [[amateur radio]] operators (hams).  Experienced hams routinely send Morse at 20 words per minute, using manually operated hand [[telegraph key]]s; enthusiasts such as members of [[The CW Operators' Club]] routinely send and receive Morse code at speeds up to 60 wpm. Twenty words per minute (20 wpm) represents the rough upper limit for Morse operators attempting to write down Morse code received by ear using paper and pencil.  Many skilled Morse code operators can receive Morse code by ear mentally without writing down the information at speeds up to 70 wpm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} To write down the Morse code information manually at speeds higher than 20 wpm it is usual for the operators to use a typewriter or computer keyboard to enable higher speed copying.

The fastest Morse code operator was [[Theodore Roosevelt McElroy]] copying at 75.6 wpm using a typewriter at the 1939 world championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerwendell.com/morsecode.html |title=Morse code page of Roger J. Wendell - WBŘJNR (WB0JNR) |publisher=Rogerwendell.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Çekmece Nuclear Research and Training Center''' ({{lang-tr|Çekmece Nükleer Araştırma ve Eğitim Merkezi}}), known as '''ÇNAEM''', is the primary [[nuclear research]] and training center of [[Turkey]]. The organization was established on March 6, 1958 as a subunit of [[TAEK|Turkish Atomic Energy Administration]] ({{lang-tr|Türkiye Atom Enerjisi Kurumu}}, TAEK) at [[Küçükçekmece]] district in the west of [[Istanbul]]. The organization's name was coined on August 12, 1960 in conjunction with its location.&lt;ref name="taek1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/hakkimizda/bagli-kuruluslar/99-cnaem.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=Çekmece Nükleer Araştırma ve Eğitim Merkezi (ÇNAEM) |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/facilities/496/ |publisher=Nuclear Threat Inıtiative |title=Çekmece Nuclear Research and Training Centre (ÇNAEM) |accessdate=2012-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groundbreaking of the facility at the eastern shore of [[Lake Küçükçekmece]] to house the country's first [[nuclear research reactor]] was held in 1959. After completion of the construction and the start of the operation of the research reactor, the official opening of the center took place on May 27, 1962 in the presence of President [[Cemal Gürsel]].&lt;ref name="taek1"/&gt;

The center is directed by Ass. Prof. Dr. Gürsel Karahan.

==Organization==
The acquired valuable knowledge and experience at the institution led in 2010 to the reorganization of ÇNAEM. The six main service divisions newly established are:

===Nuclear Technics Division===
Application of nuclear technics in industry, medicine and research such as non-destructive (NDT)tests, radiopharmasotics.

===Nuclear Electronics Division===
Production and calibration of radiation monitors, radioactive measurement devices etc. Calibration of [[ionizing radiation]] gauges and [[dosimeter]]s in the industry, medicine and security, as well as for scientific purposes.

===Nuclear Technology Division===
Research and operation of research reactor, reactor materials in compliance with international and national regulations for [[nuclear safety]], particularly [[International Atomic Energy Agency#Safeguards|IAEA safeguards]] and subsidiary agreements.&lt;ref name="nti"/&gt;

===Radioactivity Analysis and Analytics Division===
Radioactivity analysis of all food, liquid, construction materials etc. Soil and water analysis for environmental purposes.

===Waste Management Division===
Operation of Cekmece low level radioactive waste processing and storage facility (CWPSF). R&amp;D activities in low and high level nuclear wastes, processing and shielding materials. Implementation of national waste management programme.

===Health Physics Division===
Radiation Protection, controlling before licensing and radiobiological application.

==Research reactor TR-1==
The [[pool-type reactor]] having a capacity of 1 MW that was named TR-1, achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on January 6, 1962 at 19:14 local time.&lt;ref name="taek1"/&gt;

After serving 15-year long for the production of [[radioisotope]]s and the neutronics experiments with the help of beam tubes, the TR-1 was shut down in September 9, 1977 as its capacity became insufficient.&lt;ref name="e2023d"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enerji2023.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=230:tuerkye-de-nuekleer-enerjnn-tarhces&amp;catid=6:nuekleer&amp;Itemid=156 |publisher=Enerji 2023 Derneği |title=Türkiye'de Nükleer Enerjinin Tarihçesi |author=Adalıoğlu, Ulvi |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taek3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/eng/cnaem/201-nuclear-facility-division/765-reactor-operation-unit.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=ÇNAEM-Nuclear Facility Division-Reactor Operation Unit |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2012-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research reactor TR-2==
Due to increased demand in the 1970s on nuclear research and radioisotopes in the country, the installation of a second nuclear research reactor with higher capacity was projected for the production of radioisotopes only. The reactor with an output capacity of 5 MW, called TR-2, went into service in the same building and the existing pool after becoming criticality in December 1981.&lt;ref name="e2023d"/&gt; The reactor started radioisotope production in 1984.&lt;ref name="taek3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taek.gov.tr/cnaem/26-nukleer-tesisler-bolumu/375-reaktor-isletme-birimi.html |publisher=[[TAEK]] |title=ÇNAEM-Nükleer İşletme Bölümü-Reaktör İşletme Birimi |date=2009-09-09 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
