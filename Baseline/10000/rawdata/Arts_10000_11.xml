'''1917 in film''' was a particularly fruitful year for the art form, and is often cited as one of the years in the decade which contributed to the medium the most, along with [[1913 in film|1913]]. 
Secondarily the year saw a limited global embrace of narrative film-making and featured innovative techniques such as continuity cutting. Primarily, the year is an American landmark, as 1917 is the first year where the narrative and visual style is typified as [[Classical Hollywood cinema|"Classical Hollywood"]].

In theoretical physics, '''3D mirror symmetry''' is a version of [[mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]] in 3-dimensional gauge theories with N=4 [[supersymmetry]], or 8 [[supercharge]]s. It was first proposed by [[Kenneth Intriligator]] and [[Nathan Seiberg]] in their 1996 paper, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0370-2693(96)01088-X Mirror symmetry in three-dimensional gauge theories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Intriligator|first=Kenneth|author2=N. Seiberg|title=Mirror symmetry in three-dimensional gauge theories|journal=Phys. Lett. B|date=October 1996|volume=387|issue=3|page=513|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(96)01088-X|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9607207v1}}&lt;/ref&gt;], as a relation between pairs of 3-dimensional gauge theories, such that the Coulomb branch of the [[moduli (physics)|moduli]] space of one is the Higgs branch of the moduli space of the other.  It was demonstrated using [[D-brane]] cartoons by [[Amihay Hanany]] and [[Edward Witten]] 4 months later,&lt;ref&gt;In [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9611230v3 Type IIB superstrings, BPS monopoles, and three-dimensional gauge dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; where they found that it is a consequence of [[S-duality]] in type IIB string theory.

Four months later '''3D mirror symmetry''' was extended to N=2 gauge theories resulting from [[supersymmetry breaking]] in N=4 theories.&lt;ref&gt;In the article [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9703110v1 Aspects of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in three-dimensions].&lt;/ref&gt;  Here it was given a physical interpretation in terms of vortices. In 3-dimensional gauge theories, vortices are particles. [[Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound|BPS]] vortices, which are those vortices that preserve some supersymmetry, have masses which are given by the FI term of the gauge theory. In particular, on the Higgs branch, where the [[squarks]] are massless and condense yielding nontrivial vacuum expectation values (VEVs), the vortices are massive. On the other hand, Intriligator and Seiberg interpret the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory, where the scalar in the vector multiplet has a VEV, as being the regime where massless vortices condense. Thus the duality between the Coulomb branch in one theory and the Higgs branch in the dual theory is the duality between squarks and vortices.

In this theory, the [[instanton]]s are [[Hooft–Polyakov monopole|Hooft–Polyakov magnetic monopoles]] whose actions are proportional to the VEV of the scalar in the vector multiplet. In this case, instanton calculations again reproduce the nonperturbative super potential.  In particular, in the N=4 case with SU(2) gauge symmetry, the metric on the moduli space was found by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten&lt;ref&gt;In [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9607163v1 Gauge dynamics and compactification to three-dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt; using [[holomorph (mathematics)|holomorph]]y and [[supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems|supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems]] several days before Intriligator and Seiberg's 3-dimensional mirror symmetry paper appeared. Their results were reproduced using standard instanton techniques.&lt;ref&gt;In [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9803065v1 Instanton effects in three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Million Little Pieces''''' is a book by [[James Frey]], originally sold as a [[memoir]] and later marketed as a [[semi-fiction]]al novel following accusations of [[literary forgery]].&lt;ref&gt;Frey admitted in interviews that he had embellished central details of his purported incarceration for "obvious dramatic reasons". [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/million-little-lies The Man Who Conned Oprah]&lt;/ref&gt; It tells the story of a 23-year-old alcoholic and drug abuser and how he copes with rehabilitation in a [[Twelve-step program|twelve steps]]-oriented treatment center. While initially promoted as a memoir, it was later discovered that many of the events described in the book never happened.

==Summary==

A badly tattered James awakens on an airplane to Chicago, with no recollection of his injuries or of how he ended up on the plane. He is met by his parents at the airport, who take him to a rehabilitation clinic.  We find out that James is 23 years old, and has been an alcoholic for ten years, and a crack addict for three.  He is also wanted by the police in three different states on several charges.

As he checks into the rehab clinic, he is forced to quit his substance abuse, a transition that we find out later probably saves his life, but is also an incredibly agonizing event.  As part of this, he is forced to undergo a series of painful [[root canal]]s, without any [[anesthesia]] because of possible negative reactions to the drugs.  He copes with the pain by squeezing tennis balls until his nails crack (when challenged on this specific incident during his second ''Oprah'' appearance, Frey said that it ''may'' have been "more than one" root canal procedure and may or may not have included [[Novocaine]], as he remembers it).

The book follows Frey through the painful experiences that lead up to his eventual release from the center, including his participation in the clinic's family program with his parents, despite his strong desire not to.  Throughout the novel, Frey speaks of the "Fury" he is fighting, which he sees as the cause of his desire to drink alcohol and use drugs.  The "Fury" could be seen as the antagonist of the novel, because he believes that he will not be able to recover until he learns to ignore it or "kill it".

Frey meets many interesting people in the clinic, with whom he forms relationships and who play an important role in his life both during and after his time in the clinic.  These people include a [[mafia boss]] who plays a vital role in his recovery (subject of Frey's subsequent book ''[[My Friend Leonard]]''), and a woman drug addict with whom he falls in love, despite strict rules forbidding contact between men and women at the clinic. James finally recovers and never relapses.

A notable feature of ''Pieces'' is its lack of [[quotation marks]] to indicate direct quotes or dialogue. Instead, a new line is started each time someone speaks. The fact that the author uses this same style to indicate his internal thoughts, often interspersed between direct dialogue from himself and others, gives the book a unique and sometimes confusing writing style, purportedly reflecting the nature of his experience in the treatment center.  Frey makes frequent use of this [[stream of consciousness writing]] technique, which is intended to allow the reader to better understand his version of the events.  Frey's unique writing style also involves his capitalizing nouns throughout the book for unclear reasons. Frey also uses heavy repetition of words throughout the text.

==Reception==
The book was released on April 15, 2003, by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Books]], a division of [[Random House]], and received mixed feedback. While some critics, such as [[Pat Conroy]],&lt;ref&gt;Conroy is quoted in an article by David Kamp titled "Step 13: Write a Book" published in ''Vanity Fair''&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book, calling it "the ''[[War and Peace]]'' of addiction", others were not as impressed by the gruesome nature of the book and Frey's overall attitude that sets the tone for the book. For example, critic Julian Keeling,&lt;ref&gt;Keeling's article in the New Statesman [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/145539 ''The yellow gloom of sleepless nights''] is a review of Frey's work and the similarities of his own experiences&lt;/ref&gt; a recovering addict, stated that "Frey's stylistic tactics are irritating...none of this makes the reader feel well-disposed towards him". Also, author Heather King said that "''A Million Little Pieces'' rings false".&lt;ref&gt;Heather King is the author of the memoir ''Parched'' and wrote the article in Publisher's Weekly [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/soapbox/article/6642-why-james-frey-doesn-t-get-it-.html ''Why James Frey Doesn't Get It''], which tears down Frey's work and intention&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet and author [[John Dolan (writer)|John Dolan]] roundly criticized the book, saying:
:''Frey sums up his entire life in one sentence from p. 351 of this 382-page memoir: "I took money from my parents and I spent it on drugs." Given the simplicity and familiarity of the story, you might wonder what Frey does in the other 381 pages. The story itself is simple: he goes through rehab at an expensive private clinic, with his parents footing the bill. That's it. 400 pages of hanging around a rehab clinic.''

He was also scathing about the writing style, which he described as a "childish impersonation of the laconic Hemingway style", and referred to it as a "novel" several times.&lt;ref name=dolan&gt;Dolan, John  [http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=6948&amp;I6BLOCK_ID=35 "A Million Pieces Of Shit"], ''The Exile'', May 29, 2003, accessed December 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, the book was picked as an [[Oprah's Book Club]] selection, and shortly thereafter became the number one paperback non-fiction book on [[Amazon.com]], and topped the [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for fifteen straight weeks. By January 28, 2006, it had fallen to number four on the Amazon.com list with Winfrey's following selection, ''[[Night (book)|Night]]'' by [[Elie Wiesel]], taking over the top position.

The book garnered international attention in January 2006 after it was reported that it contained fabrications and was not, as originally represented by the author and publisher, a completely factual memoir.&lt;ref name="conned"/&gt;

In October 2017, it was announced that director [[Sam Taylor-Johnson]] and actor [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were working on a film adaptation of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/sam-aaron-taylor-johnson-million-little-pieces-1202597903/|title=Sam Taylor-Johnson and Aaron Taylor-Johnson Team on ‘Million Little Pieces’|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=October 24, 2017|work=Variety|accessdate=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
After a six-week investigation, ''[[The Smoking Gun]]'' published an article on January 8, 2006, called "A Million Little Lies".  The article described fabrications in Frey's account of his drug abuse experiences, life, and criminal record.&lt;ref name="conned"&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/million-little-lies The Man Who Conned Oprah]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[CNN]], ''The Smoking Gun'''s editor, [[William Bastone]], said "the probe was prompted after the Oprah show aired".  He further stated, "We initially set off to just find a mug shot of him... It basically set off a chain of events that started with us having a difficult time finding a booking photo of this guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/01/11/frey.lkl/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com - Winfrey stands behind 'Pieces' author - Jan 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minneapolis ''[[Star Tribune]]'' had questioned James Frey's claims as early as 2003. Frey responded, then, by saying, "I've never denied I've altered small details."

Stories surfaced about [[Random House]], publisher of ''A Million Little Pieces'', deciding to give full refunds to anyone who had purchased the book directly through it. According to a [[Gawker.com]] report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/news/james-frey/james-frey-settlement-website-imminent-245978.php James Frey Settlement Website Imminent] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625023344/http://gawker.com/news/james-frey/james-frey-settlement-website-imminent-245978.php |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; customers could have a claim to money if they truly felt deceived by Frey.

In an article detailing the book, Frey is quoted saying he "stands by the book as being the essential truth of my life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2134203/ Picking Up the Pieces - How James Frey flunked rehab, and why his fakery matters.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on January 26, 2006, Frey once again appeared  on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and this time admitted that the same "Demons" that had made him turn to alcohol and drugs had also driven him to fabricate crucial portions of his "memoir"; it first having been shopped as being a novel but declined by many, including Random House itself. Winfrey told Frey that she felt "really duped" but that, "more importantly, I feel that you betrayed millions of readers." She also apologized for her previous telephoned statement to ''[[Larry King Live]]'' — during Frey's appearance on that show on January 11, 2006 — that what mattered was not the truth of Frey's book, but its value as a therapeutic tool for addicts. She said, "I left the impression that the truth is not important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-01-25-frey-oprah_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Carol | last1=Memmott | title=Oprah grills Frey | date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show, Winfrey interrogated Frey about everything from the number of root canals he had to the existence of his girlfriend, Lilly.  Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher, [[Nan Talese]], to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as "brutally honest" in a press release.

[[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of the ''New York Times'' wrote, "Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs."&lt;ref name="truthiness"&gt;{{cite news | last =Carr | first =David | coauthors = | title =How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =January 30, 2006 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html?ex=1296277200&amp;en=1c0e8843da5b43d6&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Oprah annihilates Frey", proclaimed Larry King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/01/lkl.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] wrote, "It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into [[Swift boating|swiftboating]] and swift bucks, into [[George W.

All of Winfrey's reactions, as well as video clips of her interview with Frey, are found within her book club's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200601/tows_past_20060126.jhtml James Frey and the "A Million Little Pieces" Controversy]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2006, [[Steven Levitt]], co-author of the book ''[[Freakonomics]]'', stated in his blog that, having searched the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] database of mortality detail records, he was unable to identify a single death that reasonably closely matched Frey's description of the circumstances of the death of "Lilly", Frey's alleged girlfriend in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/01/13/further-fact-checking-of-james-freys-memoirs/ | work=The New York Times | title=Further fact-checking of James Frey's memoirs | date=January 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Frey's admission to Winfrey that he had altered Lilly's method of suicide in the book from cutting her wrists to hanging, on January 27, 2006, Levitt recorded on his blog that he was again unable to find a recorded death consistent with Frey's revised description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/one-last-post-on-james-frey/ | work=The New York Times | title=One last post on James Frey | first=Steven D. | last=Levitt | date=January 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Levitt states,
:"Frey’s primary defense has been to say that his criminal history is a minor part of the book and these inconsistencies do not substantively change the meaning of the story. Of course, his criminal history is the only thing that thesmokinggun.com actually looked into. Given that virtually nothing checked out, it doesn’t bode well for the veracity of the rest of the book."

==Reactions to controversy==
The publishers of the book, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and Anchor Books, initially stood by Frey, but further examination of the evidence eventually caused the publishers to alter their stances. They released a statement noting, "When the Smoking Gun report appeared, our first response, given that we were still learning the facts of the matter, was to support our author. Since then, we have questioned him about the allegations and have sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/27/ltm.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the publishers decided to include a publisher's note and an author's note from Frey as disclaimers to be included in future publications. According to the source at the company, there had been some disagreement among editors at the publishing house about Mr. Frey’s authenticity, but the early dissenters had been silenced by the book's commercial success, both pre- and post-Oprah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.observer.com/2006/01/the-awful-untruth-4/|title= The Awful Untruth - New York Observer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416084726/http://www.observer.com/20060123/20060123_Sheelah_Kolhatkar_pageone_coverstory2.asp |archivedate=April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Random House issued a statement regarding the controversy. It noted that future editions of the book would contain notes from both the publisher and Frey on the text, as well as prominent notations on the cover and on their website about the additions. On September 12, 2006, Frey and publisher Random House, Inc. reached a tentative legal settlement, where readers who felt that they had been defrauded by Frey's ''A Million Little Pieces'' would be offered a refund. In order to receive the refund, customers must submit a proof of purchase, pieces of the book itself (page 163 from the hard cover or the front cover from the paperback), and complete a sworn statement indicating that they purchased the book under the assumption that it was a memoir.

In Frey's note to readers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.biz/media/pdfs/AMLP020106.pdf A note to the reader]&lt;/ref&gt; which will be included in future editions of the book, he apologized for fabricating portions of his book and for having made himself seem "tougher and more daring and more aggressive than in reality I was, or I am." He added,
:"People cope with adversity in many different ways, ways that are deeply personal. [...] My mistake [...] is writing about the person I created in my mind to help me cope, and not the person who went through the experience."
Frey admitted that he had literary reasons for his fabrications, as well:
:"I wanted the stories in the book to ebb and flow, to have dramatic arcs, to have the tension that all great stories require."
Nevertheless, he defended the right of memoirists to draw upon their memories, not simply upon documented facts, in creating their memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-ap-books-disputed-memoir-story.htmlJames Frey Admits Memoir's Alterations]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Frey has discussed the controversy and stated his side of the argument on his blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigjimindustries.com/wordpress/ James Frey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Frey's return to the Oprah Winfrey show, the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] went as far as recataloging Frey's book as fiction, although it appears most other libraries have not followed suit. The [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] still includes it on the Paperback Nonfiction List as of September 2006.

Regardless of this controversy, the book has been published in twenty-nine languages worldwide and has sold over 5 million copies. The majority of these sales occurred after Oprah announced it as the new [[Oprah's Book Club]] book.

On January 18, 2006, [[Marty Angelo]], prison minister and author of the book ''Once Life Matters: A New Beginning'', came to the defense of James Frey in a press release. While Angelo did not condone the inclusion of fictional elements in a book marketed as non-fiction, he stated, “The controversy surrounding the recent accusations that Frey embellished some of his statements in his book is relatively minor compared to the fact this man claims he cleared one of the biggest hurdles in his life—his substance abuse. That’s the bottom line issue.”

“Right now the media seems to be negatively attacking the messenger instead of concentrating on promoting the positive message of redemption...” Angelo added. “In terms of the benefit to readers as a self-help book, the message is the key issue, not the minor story details. One needs to stay focused on what the real message is—overcoming addiction.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martyangelo.com/book_press.htm Christian Prison Evangelist Sides with Oprah Winfrey @ Marty Angelo Ministries&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2007, at a literary convention in Texas, [[Nan Talese]] spoke of Oprah Winfrey as having been "mean and self-serving" and having had a "holier-than-thou attitude" and "fiercely bad manners" during Winfrey's debate with Talese and James Frey on January 26, 2006. Talese said she and Frey were led to believe the show was going to be a panel discussion on "Truth in America". Just before air time, both Talese and Frey were told the topic of the show had been changed to "The James Frey Controversy", thus the ambush began. Talese stated that Oprah needed to apologize for her behavior on the show. However [[Joyce Carol Oates]] said "This is an ethical issue which can be debated passionately and with convincing arguments on both sides. In the end, Oprah Winfrey had to defend her own ethical standards of truth on her television program, which was courageous of her." Talese was unapologetic about publishing Frey's ''A Million Little Pieces'' and commented the book has great value for anyone who must deal with a loved one who is an addict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1648140,00.html?cnn=yes | accessdate = July 30, 2007 | work=Time | title=Oprah vs. James Frey: The Sequel | date=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[https://aforsay.org/ AFMO]''', the American Friends [[Musée d'Orsay]] and the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]], is a public [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] charitable organization. Since its beginnings in 2009, AFMO has been committed to nurturing a collaborative French-American partnership in the arts by building support for the Orsay and Orangerie museums. About one million Americans visit the museums annually, the largest number of foreign visitors. AFMO's support for exhibitions, collection care and acquisitions, education, and building renovations, enriches the experiences of Americans and French citizens in the U.S. and in [[Paris]].

This support also enables paintings from the Musée d'Orsay to travel to American museums: stunning exhibitions such as ''Cezanne Portraits'' at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], D.C. and ''Renoir:  Father and Son/Painting and Cinema'' at the [[Barnes Foundation]] in [[Philadelphia]] illustrate the quality and importance of cultural exchange.

AFMO acquires works of art to lend and gift to the museums. Through its [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status, AFMO is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as an American 501(c)(3) organization.

AFMO was incorporated in 2009 by co-founders Seonaid McArthur and Sherry Johnson, and the first Board of Directors Jane Roberts, Mary Emory, and Steve Schliesman. The official announcement of the organization's debut took place April 7, 2011 at the Residence of the [[United States]] Ambassador to France. AFMO's current Board Chair is Elizabeth Kehler.

'''Art Workshop Lazareti''' ({{lang-hr|Art radionica Lazareti}} ARL) in [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]], is an independent [[cultural center]], with an integrated club, for [[contemporary art]] that brings together artists, philosophers, writers and theoreticians and promotes an active and investigative approach to contemporary art and culture, society, politics and its inter-relations. The Art Workshop Lazareti was established in 1988 and it is located in the old Dubrovnik harbour [[quarantine]] called Lazareti, built in 1642, immediately overlooking the Dubrovnik city beach and old harbour. The workshop has revitalized the historic building, which in 2002 had been included in the [[2002 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]], and was subsequently restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/project/maritime-quarantine-lazareti World Monuments Fund – Maritime Quarantine-Lazareti]&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Workshop Lazareti is directed by [[Slaven Tolj]].

The '''Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts''' ('''AACTA''') is a professional organisation of film and television practitioners in Australia. The Academy's aim is "to identify, award, promote and celebrate Australia's greatest achievements in film and television."&lt;ref name="academyoverview" /&gt;

It was established in August 2011 with the backing of the [[Australian Film Institute]] (AFI) to act as its industry engagement arm and to administer the [[AACTA Awards]] (formerly the Australian Film Institute Awards, also known as the AFI Awards) which rewards achievements in Australian feature film, television, documentary and short films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-19/geoffrey-rush-australian-academy/2846536|title=Rush named president of Australian Oscars|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC)|author=Staff|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AACTAoverview" /&gt;

The Academy is composed of 15 Chapters, each of which represents different screen artists including actors, directors, producers and writers, and it is overseen by the Academy's president and the Honorary Council. Australian actor [[Geoffrey Rush]] is the inaugural President and hosted the [[2011 AACTA Film Awards|inaugural AACTA Awards]] in January 2012.&lt;ref name="AACTAoverview" /&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Australian Film Institute}}
The Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA), is a not for profit, membership based, organisation whose aim is "to identify, award, promote and celebrate Australia's greatest achievements in film and television."&lt;ref name="academyoverview" /&gt; The Academy is a subsidiary of the [[Australian Film Institute]] (AFI), a non-profit organisation which was established in 1958 to develop an active film culture in Australia and to foster engagement between the general public and the Australian film industry.&lt;ref name=AFI2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12382&amp;Section=About |title=The Australian Film Institute - About AFI |publisher=[[Australian Film Institute]] (AFI) |accessdate=15 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613035907/http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12382&amp;Section=About |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH19Aug2011" /&gt; The AFI was also responsible for administering the Australian Film Institute Awards (more commonly known as the AFI Awards), which until 2011 rewarded Australian practitioners in feature film, television, documentary and short film screen crafts.&lt;ref name=AFI2010 /&gt; The Academy receives funding by the AFI, and Australian [[States and territories of Australia|state]] and [[Government of Australia|federal governments]].&lt;ref name="AFI2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=13084&amp;Section=Sponsors_and_Partners|title=The Australian Film Institute - Sponsors and Partners|publisher=Australian Film Institute (AFI)|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the AFI proposed the establishment of an "Australian Academy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/afi-looks-to-academy-awards-in-reinvention-20110628-1gp2j.html |title=AFI looks to Academy Awards in reinvention |author=Paul Kalina|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=23 July 2011|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives for the proposed academy was to raise the profile of Australian film and television in Australia and abroad, and to change the way it rewards talent by mimicking the methods used in foreign film organisations, such as [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) and [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA).&lt;ref name="AFIannouncement"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12535&amp;Section=Consultation#prop_dev| title = Proposed AFI Developments| publisher = Australian Film Institute (AFI) | date = | accessdate = 21 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110613041738/http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12535&amp;Section=Consultation| archivedate= 13 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voting system would change through the establishment of an "Honorary Council", which will govern fifteen chapters composed of professionals from industry guilds and organisations including [[actor]]s, [[Film director|directors]], [[Film producer|producers]] and [[screenwriter]]s.&lt;ref name="AFIannouncement" /&gt; It was also stated that the Academy would not replace the AFI and past winners of the AFI Awards would "[...] constitute the founding heritage of an ‘Australian Academy.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12535&amp;Section=Consultation#prop_dev| title = Building the Australian Film and Television brand| publisher = Australian Film Institute (AFI)| date = | accessdate = 21 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110613041738/http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12535&amp;Section=Consultation| archivedate= 13 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the announcement of the proposal was made, the AFI began the consultation phase where members of the public and screen industry gave their feedback on the proposed changes throughout June, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skynews.com.au/showbiz/article.aspx?id=620194&amp;vId= |title=AFI awards to move to January |author=Staff|work=[[Sky News Australia]]|publisher=Australian News Channel Pty Ltd  |accessdate=30 August 2011|date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the announcement Damian Trewhella, CEO of the AFI said, "We thought a better way to engage with the industry would be to try and improve our professional membership structure[...] It's quite a big improvement on the way the AFI does things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.filmink.com.au/news/change-ahead-for-the-afi/ |title=AFI looks to Academy Awards in reinvention |author=Cara Nash |publisher=''[[Filmink]]'' |accessdate=19 August 2011 |date=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605014218/http://www.filmink.com.au/news/change-ahead-for-the-afi/ |archivedate= 5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
{{Main|AACTA Awards}}
The [[AACTA Awards]] replaced the previous Australian Film Institute Awards, but serve as a continuum to past ceremonies.&lt;ref name="AACTAoverview" /&gt; The awards were first instituted by the Australian Film Institute in 1958 (as the Australian Film Awards) as part of the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]], until 1972.&lt;ref name="shinelight29"&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=Lisa|last2=Poole|first2=Mark|title=Shining a Light: 50 Years of the Australian Film Institute|publisher=Australian Teachers of Media|year=2009|isbn=1-876467-20-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1969, awards were presented as a prize to non-feature films due to a lack of feature films produced in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=Lisa|last2=Poole|first2=Mark|title=Shining a Light: 50 Years of the Australian Film Institute|publisher=Australian Teachers of Media|year=2009|isbn=1-876467-20-7|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976 competitive film awards were established and in 1987, awards for television was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=Lisa|last2=Poole|first2=Mark|title=Shining a Light: 50 Years of the Australian Film Institute|publisher=Australian Teachers of Media|year=2009|isbn=1-876467-20-7|page=|pages=142–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=Lisa|last2=Poole|first2=Mark|title=Shining a Light: 50 Years of the Australian Film Institute|publisher=Australian Teachers of Media|year=2009|isbn=1-876467-20-7|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were usually held at the end of each year in [[Melbourne]] but, prior to the announcement of the Academy, the AFI announced that it would move the awards to January 2012 at the [[Sydney Opera House]], in order to align them with the international film awards season.&lt;ref name="SMH19Aug2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/geoffrey-rush-at-the-helm-for-aussie-oscars/story-e6frg6nf-1226117741894|title=Geoffrey Rush at the helm for Aussie Oscars|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited (News Corporation)|author=Staff|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards are held over two events: the AACTA Awards Luncheon, a black tie event where accolades are handed out for non-feature and short films, film production, non-drama related television programs and the [[Raymond Longford Award]], and the AACTA Awards Ceremony which hands out the awards in all other categories at a larger venue and is broadcast on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacta.org/the-awards/dates.aspx |title=AACTA - The Awards - Dates |publisher=Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) |date= |accessdate=8 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daly|first=Brooke|title=Australian Academy Launches New International Awards in Los Angeles|url=http://aacta.org/media/173365/australian%20academy%20launches%20new%20international%20awards%20in%20los%20angeles.pdf|publisher=Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA)|date=15 January 2012|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, awards for achievements in foreign film were presented once at the AACTA International Awards in [[Los Angeles]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://aacta.org/media/173365/australian%20academy%20launches%20new%20international%20awards%20in%20los%20angeles.pdf| title = AACTA - Awards Presented| publisher = Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) | date = | accessdate = 12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boat Quay''' is a historical [[quay]] in Singapore which is situated upstream from the mouth of the [[Singapore River]] on its southern [[river bank|bank]]. It spans from the shophouses near UOB Centre, stretching along one bank of the Singapore River, all the way till [[Elgin Bridge (Singapore)|Elgin Bridge]].

It was the busiest part of the old [[Port of Singapore]], handling three-quarters of all shipping business during the 1860s. Because the south of the river here resembles the belly of a [[carp]], which according to [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese belief]] is where wealth and prosperity lay, many shophouses were built, crowded into the area.

Though serving aquatic trade is no longer Boat Quay's primary role, the [[shophouse]]s on it have been carefully conserved and now house various bars, pubs and restaurants. Therefore, Boat Quay's social-economic role in the city has shifted away from that of trade and [[sea|maritime]] commerce, and now leans towards more of a role accommodated for tourism and [[aesthetics]] for the commercial zone of which encloses the Singapore River. It is the soft front to the composolitian banking and financial sectors lying immediately behind it.

Boat Quay is also the name of the road along the quay, which has since been converted into a pedestrian mall.

==History==
{{copy-paste|url=http://www.edmbooks.com/Book/6907/Singapores-100-Historic-Places.html|date=January 2017}}
[[File:boat quay night 2009n.JPG|thumb|left|The quay and the Singapore skyline at night]]
Since the [[founding of modern Singapore]] in 1819, the [[Singapore River]] was the artery for much of the island's trade and economic activities. The south [[river bank|bank]] of the river, where most of the commerce took place, is known as Boat Quay.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Ee: [http://www.edmbooks.com/Book/6907/Singapores-100-Historic-Places.html ''Singapore's 100 Historic Places.''] {{ISBN|978-981-4068-23-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s, the area was [[swamp]]y and built over with [[raft]] houses occupied by local traders. It was [[Land reclamation|reclaimed]] with earth taken from a small hill where Commercial Square, now [[Raffles Place]], stands.

As early as 1822, [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] had already designated the area south of the river to be developed as a Chinese settlement. Boat Quay was completed in 1842 and the Chinese, mostly traders and labourers, settled there in large numbers. Conditions were squalid but Boat Quay flourished, rapidly exceeding in volume the trade on the north bank where the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s had their offices, houses and government buildings.

In the midst of Boat Quay were the trading offices of some of Singapore's leading [[:wikt:towkay|towkay]] ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]] for business owners) and philanthropists, such as [[Tan Tock Seng]] and [[Tan Kim Seng]]. The level of activity on the river was an indicator of the island's economic status. In prosperous times, hundreds of bumboats would fight for limited [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]ing space. Goods were carried from ships anchored in the river, to the road by lighters and coolies. Traders bought and sold many items, from raw materials such as rubber, tin, and steel, to perishables such as rice and coffee, and many other manufactured goods.

Boat Quay was very resilient to change. Its role did not diminish even when a new [[harbour]] was built at [[Tanjong Pagar]] in 1852. On the contrary, it continued to grow, spurred on by the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869, when [[steamship]]s started calling at the [[port of Singapore]]. In fact, during that period, three-quarters of Singapore's overall trading business was transacted from Boat Quay.

Its decline really began in the 1960s, as mechanisation and computerisation gradually usurped the bumboat's role in the [[shipping industry]]. In September 1983, the government opened a modern, high-tech cargo centre in [[Pasir Panjang]]. This led to the rapid demise of Boat Quay's river trade, as the highly mechanised [[container port]] replaced the laborious and hazardous lighter system. Therefore, during the mid-1980s, after all the trading companies had moved out and the lighters removed, Boat Quay was devoid of activity, with the river deserted.

Boat Quay is now a business, dining, nightlife, and entertainment district for a mixture of locals, Western expats, and Western, Asian, and global tourists.

== Adaptive re-use of the historic buildings ==
[[File:Boat Quay 4, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Since the 1990s, Boat Quay has been transformed into a pedestrian mall with restaurants, pubs, cafes and clubs.]]
The Singapore government cleaned-up the river in 1983 and moved the remaining shipping industry's lighters were moved to a new quay near Pasir Panjang. Therefore, the Boat Quay was deserted and unused from 1983 to 1989.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;Eunice M.

In 1986, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] announced plans to preserve Boat Quay as part of a master plan for conserving the whole of the Singapore River and its environs.

On 7 July 1989, an area encompassing [[South Bridge Road]], Circular Road, Lorong Telok and North Canal Road was gazetted. The two- and three-storey [[shophouse]]s in that area, with their characteristic [[five-foot way]] beneath projecting upper floors, were preserved and transformed into new businesses. The shophouses and [[godown]]s along the river bank were restored in the 1990s and are now bustling shops, restaurants and bars.

When the area became a conservation area in 1989, redevelopment began and by 1993 all historic shophouses were under reconstruction. The Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority issued stringent guidelines for the restoration but did not provide cash grants or tax relief for conservation projects but waived some of the development charges, car parking requirements and car park deficiency charges.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;

The historic shophouses could now easily be re-used for modern businesses, such as restaurants, cafes, bars and small shops. The interior of the buildings could be modified with the new use in mind, in some cases using new non-traditional interior ornamentation, materials, and colours. For instance, the interior of the Opera Cafe at No. 40 Boat Quay was modified to create an ambiance similar to an opera stage-set. The ground floor of the Lim Family Shophouse at No. 58 Boat Quay was converted into a Japanese restaurant. The upper floor is used as a weekend flat for the Lim family, who lived in the building since 1908. The architect Mok Wei Wei created more open space by demolishing some of the original partition walls, but kept and restored the original teak floors, paint colour on the window frames, wooden balcony doors, and tile roofs. The historic blackwood furniture and art pieces were also restored and re-used.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;

Multiple startup companies also rent offices around the Boat Quay and nearby Circular Road area.

==Historical names==
[[File:Singa River Boat Quay in the mid-nineteenth century.jpg|thumb|Boat Quay during its heyday around 1865, when as many as 150 boats moored on the river, trading everything from rubber, tin and iron, to silk, porcelain, rice, opium, spices and coffee.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;]]
Boat Quay is one of the early roads established when the [[Singapore River]] was the main port area of the colonial city. In the 19th century, the Chinese had several names for this road, referring to different sections of it:
*''tiam pang lo thau'' or "the place to go for [[sampan]]s";
*''chap sa hang'' (十三行) or "the thirteen shops" (the part near Canton Street);
*''chap peh keng'' (十八间) or "the eighteen houses" (the part near Circular Road);
*''chui chu boi'' or "bathing house end";&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;
*''khoi ki'' or "steam bank";
*''bu ye tian'' (不夜天) or "place of ceaseless activity"; and
*''tiam pang lo thau'' (place to go for sampans)&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; or "sampan ghaut or landing-place" (referring to the lower part of Boat Quay near Purvis Creek).
*''cha chun tau'' (柴船头), meaning "[[jetty]] for boats carrying [[firewood]]" (the part around Read Bridge)
*''chap poet heng'', meaning the eighteen houses&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;

Some of the quay's colloquial English names included:
*[[Suspension bridge]] Quay (after [[Cavenagh Bridge]]); and
*"The Belly of the [[Carp]]" because of the shape of the river at this point.

'''Bonfils Memorial Theatre''', also known as '''Lowenstein Theatre''', was a [[community theatre]] in Northeast [[Denver]], Colorado, which operated from 1953 to 1986. Built by Denver philanthropist [[Helen Bonfils]] in memory of her parents, [[Frederick Gilmer Bonfils]] and Belle Barton Bonfils, it staged plays, operas, concerts, films, lectures, and television shows, presenting more than 400 productions. In 1985 it was renamed the Lowenstein Theatre in honor of its longtime producer, [[Henry Lowenstein]]. The theatre closed in 1986 and sat vacant for two decades. It was purchased in 2005 by Charles Woolley of the St. Charles Town Company, which renovated and reopened the building in 2006 as a [[Tattered Cover]] bookstore. The theatre building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Northeast Denver|National Register of Historic Places]].

==Location==
The theatre building is located at 1475 Elizabeth Street, on the southwest corner of [[Colfax Avenue|East Colfax Avenue]], in Northeast Denver.{{sfn|Noel|2016|p=282}}

==Description==
[[File:Bonfils Memorial Theatre - historic.jpg|right|thumb|Theatre entrance]]
The theatre was designed in [[Streamline Moderne|Art Moderne]] style by Denver architect John K. Monroe.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;&lt;ref name=renew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renewdenver.org/projects/lowenstein-theatre/ |title=Lowenstein Theater|publisher=Denver Urban Renewal Authority|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-story structure, covering {{convert|66000|sqft}},{{sfn|Riley|2006|p=84}} was faced in cream-colored brick and trimmed in buff-colored terra cotta and red sandstone.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;{{sfn|Noel|2016|p=282}} Below the "wing-swept" [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]], a contoured aluminum canopy overhung the entrance.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;&lt;ref name=rocky/&gt;

Inside, the [[travertine]] lobby sported a "[[Prussian blue]] rug, wood-paneled walls, pumpkin-colored plaster, and tall windows".&lt;ref name=colo/&gt; On one side of the lobby stood a [[shrine]] to the [[Abbey Theatre (England)|Abbey Theatre]] in England. The lower lobby and bar was accessed via a grand staircase.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

The theatre had seating for 550. Its Prussian-blue [[Theatre drapes and stage curtains|stage curtain]] was complemented by gray side walls and red carpeting. Backstage were nine dressing rooms. Monroe designed an electronic lighting switchboard – a "smaller version of the system used in New York City's Metropolitan Opera House" – to accommodate a variety of productions, including plays, operas, concerts, films, and lectures.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=97}} The venue was also appropriate for use as a [[television studio]].&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

Helen Bonfils consulted with actor [[Raymond Burr]] on the theatre layout. Decades later, the [[Perry Mason (TV movies)|''Perry Mason'' TV movies]] starring Burr used the premises as a filming location between 1987 and 1989.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==History==
The Bonfils Memorial Theatre was built at a cost of $1.25 million by Helen Bonfils, a Denver philanthropist and owner of ''[[The Denver Post]]'', in memory of her parents, [[Frederick Gilmer Bonfils]] and Belle Barton Bonfils.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=97}}&lt;ref name=colo/&gt; Bonfils designated the theatre as the new home for the University Civic Theatre, an amateur theatre which since 1929 had operated on the campus of the [[University of Denver]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 1942 Bonfils gifted a different site, at 1425 Cleveland Place, to the University Civic Theatre, but due to World War II the building could not be remodeled. In 1948 Bonfils acquired the property at 1425 Elizabeth Street and arranged for the removal of a ten-room house to make room for construction of a theatre, which she rented to the newly renamed Denver Civic Theatre for one dollar a year.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

With its opening on October 14, 1953, the Bonfils Memorial Theatre was the first live-performance theatre to open in Denver in four decades.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coloradoencyclopedia.org/article/bonfils-memorial-theatre|title=Bonfils Memorial Theatre|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=15 March 2017|work=Colorado Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly became the "social center of the city", with [[Premiere|opening nights]] presided over by Bonfils and attended by society figures.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2009/06/26/a-history-of-the-bonfils-theatre/|title=A History of the Bonfils Theatre|first=John|last=Moore|date=26 June 2009|accessdate=15 March 2017|work=[[The Denver Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] dispatched a congratulatory telegram to Helen Bonfils upon the theatre's opening.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt; The first production, ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', was seen by an audience of 500.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;{{sfn|Riley|2006|p=84}}

===Productions and performers===
The theatre presented [[main stage]], [[cabaret]], and children's theatre.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=colo/&gt; It staged more than 400 productions from 1953 to 1986.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt; Performers at the Bonfils Memorial Theatre included [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]], [[Tony Church]], and [[Cleo Parker Robinson]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Celebrities who appeared in theatrical productions included Helen Bonfils (herself an actress and theatrical producer),{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=97}} [[Mary Jo Catlett]], [[Julia Child]] (she gave a cooking demonstration), [[Kevin Kline]], [[Patti LuPone]], [[Ted Shackelford]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Marilyn Van Derbur]] ([[Miss Colorado]] 1957 and [[Miss America 1958]]), [[Joan Van Ark]], [[Emlyn Williams]], and [[Paul Winfield]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Bonfils lent her extensive collection of "fur coats, jewels, silver, furniture, and rugs" as props for many productions.{{sfn|Riley|2006|page=85}}

During the summers, the theatre sent a "summer festival caravan" around to city parks to entertain audiences, and presented a free outdoor musical in [[Cheesman Park, Denver|Cheesman Park]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Henry Lowenstein, hired as a set designer in 1956, became the theatrical producer in 1967.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 1985 the theatre was renamed the Lowenstein Theatre in his honor.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

===Closure===
The theatre remained open for more than a decade after Helen Bonfils' death in 1972. In 1973 the Denver Civic Theatre moved to the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts]] (DCPA),&lt;ref name=renew/&gt; and in 1974 the Bonfils Memorial Theatre came under the jurisdiction of the governing board of the DCPA, which had been formed from Bonfils' estate.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt; The board continued to operate the Bonfils Memorial Theatre as a community theatre, but in 1984, as professional theatre gained popularity at the DCPA, the board closed the main stage.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;{{sfn|Noel|2016|p=282}} The cabaret and children's shows continued to be staged until 1986, when the board closed the theatre permanently.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

==Renovation==
[[File:Tattered Cover Book Store, East Colfax Avenue, Denver.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tattered Cover]] bookstore in the former theatre; the [[orchestra pit]] is in the foreground]]
The theatre sat vacant for two decades. In May 2005&lt;ref name=renew/&gt; Charles Woolley of the St. Charles Town Company purchased the property from the Bonfils Foundation for $1.9 million.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt; The development company undertook a $16 million preservation and renovation project to convert the theatre into a bookstore and add a record shop, [[Art film|art cinema]], and 230-space parking garage to the adjoining lot.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;&lt;ref name=renew/&gt;

In June 2006 the theatre building reopened as a [[Tattered Cover]] bookstore.&lt;ref name=rocky&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147159951.html|title=Encore for a classic Tattered Cover transforms historic Lowenstein Theater|first=Mary Voelz|last=Chandler|date=17 June 2006|accessdate=12 March 2017|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While few changes were made to the exterior, the sloped flooring of the theatre had to be leveled and the interior redesigned for retail trade.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;&lt;ref name=rocky/&gt; The redesign, executed by architect Josh Comfort, retained many "historical details and finishes"; for example, some original red mohair-covered seats were retained in two rear balcony areas, and the original [[orchestra pit]], accessed via a ramp, was filled with a display of "books on the performing arts".&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;&lt;ref name=rocky/&gt; The backstage dressing rooms, rehearsal area, and offices made way for a restaurant and coffee shop. The development company received the 2006 Community Preservation Award from Historic Denver for the project.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;&lt;ref name=renew/&gt;

The theatre building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Northeast Denver|National Register of Historic Places]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=colo/&gt;

'''Documentary research''' is the use of outside sources, [[documents]], to support the viewpoint or argument of an [[academic]] work. The process of documentary research often involves some or all of conceptualising, using and assessing documents. The analysis of the documents in documentary research would be either quantitative or qualitative analysis (or both).&lt;ref&gt;Balihar, Sanghera, Qualitative research methods: documentary research.

'''Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones, 1st Baronet''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|ARA}} (28 August 1833{{snd}}17 June 1898) was an English artist and designer closely associated with the later phase of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite movement]], who worked closely with [[William Morris]] on a wide range of decorative arts as a founding partner in [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co]]. Burne-Jones was closely involved in the rejuvenation of the tradition of [[stained glass]] art in Britain; his stained-glass include windows in [[St. Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham]], [[St Martin in the Bull Ring]], Birmingham, [[Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Square, Chelsea]], St Peter and St Paul parish church in [[Cromer]], [[St Martin's Church, Brampton|St Martin's Church]] in [[Brampton, Carlisle, Cumbria|Brampton]], [[Cumbria]] (the church designed by [[Philip Webb]]), [[St Michael's Church, Brighton]], [[All Saints, Jesus Lane]], [[Cambridge]], [[St Edmund Hall]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], two colleges of the University of Oxford. His stained glass works also feature in St. Anne's Church, Brown Edge, Staffordshire Moorlands and St.Edward the Confessor church at Cheddleton Staffordshire.
Burne-Jones's early paintings show the heavy inspiration of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], but by the 1860s Burne-Jones was discovering his own artistic "voice". In 1877, he was persuaded to show eight oil paintings at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] (a new rival to the [[Royal Academy]]). These included ''[[The Beguiling of Merlin]]''. The timing was right, and he was taken up as a herald and star of the new [[Aesthetic Movement]].

In addition to painting and stained glass, Burne-Jones worked in a variety of crafts; including designing ceramic tiles, jewellery, [[tapestries]], and [[mosaics]].

==Early life==

Edward Coley Burne Jones (the hyphen came later) was born in [[Birmingham]], the son of a Welshman, Edward Richard Jones, a frame-maker at [[Bennetts Hill]], where a [[blue plaque]] commemorates the painter's childhood. His mother Elizabeth Coley Jones died within six days of his birth, and he was raised by his grieving father and the family housekeeper, Ann Sampson, an obsessively affectionate but humourless and unintellectual local girl.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|pp= 42–43}}{{sfn|Daly|1989|pp=249–251}} He attended Birmingham's [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward VI grammar school]] from 1844&lt;ref name="DNB1909"&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Burne-Jones, Edward Coley|last=Ward|first=Thomas Humphry }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Birmingham School of Art]] from 1848 to 1852, before studying [[theology]] at [[Exeter College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|last=Newall|first=Christopher|title=Jones, Sir Edward Coley Burne-, first baronet (1833–1898)|id=4051}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford he became a friend of [[William Morris]] as a consequence of a mutual interest in poetry. The two Exeter undergraduates, together with a small group of Jones' friends from Birmingham known as the [[Birmingham Set]],{{sfn|Rose|1981|p=78}} speedily formed a very close and intimate society, which they called "The Brotherhood". The members of the Brotherhood read [[John Ruskin]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]], visited churches, and worshipped the [[Middle Ages]]. At this time Burne-Jones discovered [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' which was to be so influential in his life. At that time neither Burne-Jones nor Morris knew [[Gabriele Rossetti]] personally, but both were much influenced by his works, and met him by recruiting him as a contributor to their ''Oxford and Cambridge Magazine'' which Morris founded in 1856 to promote their ideas.&lt;ref name="DNB1909" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Morris, William (1834–1896)
|last=Mackail|first=John William  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burne-Jones had intended to become a church minister, but under Rossetti's influence both he and Morris decided to become artists, and Burne-Jones left college before taking a degree to pursue a career in art. In February 1857, Rossetti wrote to [[William Bell Scott]]
{{quotation|Two young men, projectors of the ''Oxford and Cambridge Magazine,'' have recently come up to town from Oxford, and are now very intimate friends of mine. Their names are Morris and Jones. They have turned artists instead of taking up any other career to which the university generally leads, and both are men of real genius. Jones's designs are marvels of finish and imaginative detail, unequalled by anything unless perhaps [[Albert Dürer]]'s finest works.&lt;ref name="DNB1909" /&gt;}}

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Georgiana Burne-Jones by Edward Coley Burne-Jones.jpg|left|thumb|''Portrait of Georgiana Burne-Jones, with Philip and Margaret'', 1883]]
[[File:Margaret, daughter of Edward Coley Burne-Jones.jpg|left|thumb|Margaret, daughter of Burne-Jones]]
In 1856 Burne-Jones became engaged to [[Georgiana Burne-Jones|Georgiana "Georgie" MacDonald]] (1840–1920), one of the [[MacDonald sisters]]. She was training to be a painter, and was the sister of Burne-Jones's old school friend. The couple married in 1860, after which she made her own work in [[woodcut]]s and became a close friend of [[George Eliot]]. (Another MacDonald sister married the artist Sir [[Edward Poynter]], a further sister married the ironmaster [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred Baldwin]] and was the mother of the Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], and yet another sister was the mother of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Kipling and Baldwin were thus Burne-Jones's nephews by marriage).

Georgiana bore a son, [[Philip Burne-Jones|Philip]], in 1861. A second son, born in the winter of 1864 while Georgiana was gravely ill with scarlet fever, died soon after birth. The family soon moved to 41 Kensington Square, and their daughter Margaret was born there in 1866.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p= 107}} In 1867 Burne-Jones and his family settled at the Grange, an 18th-century house set in a large garden in [[North End, Fulham]], London. For much of the 1870s Burne-Jones did not exhibit, following a spate of bitterly hostile attacks in the press, and a passionate affair (described as the "emotional climax of his life"{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p= 114}}) with his Greek model [[Maria Zambaco]], which ended with her trying to commit [[suicide]] by throwing herself in [[Regent's Canal]].{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p= 114}}{{sfn|Flanders|2001|pp=118–120}} During these difficult years Georgiana developed a close friendship with Morris, whose wife [[Jane Morris|Jane]] had fallen in love with Rossetti. Morris and Georgie may have been in love, but if he asked her to leave her husband, she refused. In the end, the Burne-Joneses remained together, as did the Morrises, but Morris and Georgiana were close for the rest of their lives.{{sfn|Flanders|2001|p=136}}

In 1880 the Burne-Joneses bought [[Prospect House, Rottingdean|Prospect House]] in [[Rottingdean]], near [[Brighton]] in Sussex, as their holiday home, and soon after the next door [[Aubrey Cottage]] to create [[North End House]], reflecting the fact that their Fulham home was in North End Road. (Years later, in 1923, [[Sir Roderick Jones]], head of [[Reuters]], and his wife, playwright and novelist [[Enid Bagnold]], were to add the adjacent [[Gothic House]] to the property, which became the inspiration and setting for her play ''[[The Chalk Garden]]'').

His troubled son Philip, who became a successful portrait painter, died in 1926. His adored daughter Margaret (died 1953) married [[John William Mackail]] (1850–1945), the friend and biographer of Morris, and Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1911–1916. Their children were the novelists [[Angela Thirkell]] and [[Denis Mackail]]. In an edition of the boys' magazine, Chums (No.&amp;nbsp;227, Vol.&amp;nbsp; V, 13&amp;nbsp;January 1897), an article on Burne-Jones stated that "....his pet grandson used to be punished by being sent to stand in a corner with his face to the wall. One day on being sent there he was delighted to find the wall prettily decorated with fairies, flowers, birds, and bunnies. His indulgent grandfather had utilised his talent to alleviate the tedium of his favourite's period of penance."

==Artistic career==

===Early years: Rossetti and Morris===
[[Image:Edward Burne-Jones Sidonia von Bork.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Sidonia von Borcke]]'', 1860]]
Burne-Jones once admitted that after leaving Oxford he "found himself at five-and-twenty what he ought to have been at fifteen". He had had no regular training as a draughtsman, and lacked the confidence of science. But his extraordinary faculty of invention as a designer was already ripening; his mind, rich in knowledge of classical story and medieval romance, teemed with pictorial subjects, and he set himself to complete his set of skills by resolute labour, witnessed by innumerable drawings. The works of this first period are all more or less tinged by the influence of Rossetti; but they are already differentiated from the elder master's style by their more facile though less intensely felt elaboration of imaginative detail. Many are pen-and-ink drawings on [[vellum]], exquisitely finished, of which his ''Waxen Image'' (1856) is one of the earliest and best examples. Although the subject, medium and manner derive from Rossetti's inspiration, it is not the hand of a pupil merely, but of a potential master. This was recognized by Rossetti himself, who before long avowed that he had nothing more to teach him.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Burne-Jones, Sir Edward Burne|volume=4|pages=848–850|noicon=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils dates from this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for [[Bradfield College]] the first of what was to be an immense series of cartoons for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the ''Prioress's Tale'' from [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects. Thus early, therefore, we see the artist busy in all the various fields in which he was to labour.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

In the autumn of 1857 Burne-Jones joined Morris, [[Valentine Prinsep]], [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope|J.&amp;nbsp;R. Spencer Stanhope]]&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, ''Letters and Diaries'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; and others in Rossetti's ill-fated scheme to decorate the walls of the [[Oxford Union]]. None of the painters had mastered the technique of [[fresco]], and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed. In 1859 Burne-Jones made his first journey to Italy. He saw [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]], [[Venice]] and other places, and appears to have found the gentle and romantic [[Sienese School|Sienese]] more attractive than any other school. Rossetti's influence still persisted, and is visible, more strongly perhaps than ever before, in the two [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] of 1860, ''Sidonia von Bork'' and ''Clara von Bork.''&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; Both paintings illustrate the 1849 [[gothic novel]] ''Sidonia the Sorceress'' by [[Jane Wilde|Lady Wilde]], a translation of ''Sidonia Von Bork: Die Klosterhexe'' (1847) by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p= 66}}

===Decorative arts: Morris &amp; Co.===
[[File:Burne-Jones, Sir Edward, Saint Cecilia, ca. 1900.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Saint Cecilia]]'', {{c.}} 1900, [[Princeton University Art Museum]], one of nearly thirty versions of a window designed by Burne-Jones and executed by Morris &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Cecilia (y1974–84)|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/32015|website=Princeton University Art Museum|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main article|Morris &amp; Co.}}
In 1861, William Morris founded the [[decorative arts]] firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. with Rossetti, Burne-Jones, [[Ford Madox Brown]] and Philip Webb as partners, together with [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]] and [[Peter Paul Marshall]], the former of whom was a member of the Oxford Brotherhood, and the latter a friend of Brown and Rossetti.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; The prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, [[stained glass]], metal-work, paper-hangings, [[chintz]]es (printed fabrics), and [[carpet]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. The work shown by the firm at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] attracted much notice, and within a few years it was flourishing. Two significant secular commissions helped establish the firm's reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at [[St. James's Palace]] and the "green dining room" at the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert]]) of 1867 which featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones.{{sfn|Parry|1996|loc=Domestic Decoration|pp=139–140}}

In 1871 Morris &amp; Co. were responsible for the windows at [[All Saints Church, Wilden|All Saints]], designed by Burne-Jones for [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred Baldwin]], his wife's brother-in-law. The firm was reorganized as Morris &amp; Co. in 1875, and Burne-Jones continued to contribute designs for stained glass, and later tapestries until the end of his career.

It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of tapestries based on the story of the [[Holy Grail]] for the dining room, with figures by Burne-Jones.{{sfn|Parry|1996|loc=Domestic Decoration|pp=146–147}}

In 1891 Jones was elected a member of the [[Art Workers Guild]].

===Illustration work===
Although known primarily as a painter, Burne-Jones was also an illustrator, helping the Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic to enter mainstream awareness. In addition, he designed books for the [[Kelmscott Press]] between 1892 and 1898. His illustrations appeared in the following books, among others:{{sfn|Souter|Souter|2012|p=19}}

* ''The Fairy Family'' by [[Archibald Maclaren]] (1857)
* ''[[The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' by William Morris (1872)
* ''[[The Earthly Paradise]]'' by William Morris (not completed)
* ''The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1896)
* ''Bible Gallery'' by [[Dalziel]] (1881)

===Painting===
[[Image:Beguiling of Merlin.jpg|right|thumb|''The Beguiling of Merlin'', 1874]]
In 1864 Burne-Jones was elected an associate of the [[Royal Watercolour Society|Society of Painters in Water-Colours]] (also known as the Old Water-Colour Society), and exhibited, among other works, ''[[The Merciful Knight]]'', the first picture which fully revealed his ripened personality as an artist. The next six years saw a series of fine watercolours at the same gallery.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;
In 1866 Mrs Cassavetti commissioned Burne-Jones to paint her daughter, Maria Zambaco, in ''Cupid finding Psyche'', an introduction which led to their tragic affair. In 1870, Burne-Jones resigned his membership following a controversy over his painting ''Phyllis and Demophoön''. The features of Maria Zambaco were clearly recognizable in the barely draped Phyllis (as they are in several of Burne-Jones's finest works), and the undraped nakedness of Demophoön coupled with the suggestion of female sexual assertiveness offended [[Victorian era|Victorian]] sensibilities. Burne-Jones was asked to make a slight alteration, but instead "withdrew not only the picture from the walls, but himself from the Society."{{sfn|Roget|1891|p=116}}{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p= 138}}

During the next seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the [[Dudley Gallery]] in 1873, one of them being the beautiful ''Love among the Ruins,'' destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed it to be an oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a number of large pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first ''Briar Rose'' series, ''Laus Veneris,'' the ''Golden Stairs,'' the ''Pygmalion'' series, and ''The Mirror of Venus'' are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; These years also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer [[Frederick Hollyer]], whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works in the coming decades.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|pp= 197–198}}
[[Image:Burne-jones cophetua.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The King and the Beggar-maid|King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid]]'', 1884, currently in the [[Tate Gallery]], London.]]

At last, in May 1877, the day of recognition came, with the opening of the first exhibition of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]], when the ''Days of Creation,'' ''[[The Beguiling of Merlin]],'' and the ''Mirror of Venus'' were all shown. Burne-Jones followed up the signal success of these pictures with ''Laus Veneris,'' the ''Chant d'Amour,'' ''Pan and Psyche,'' and other works, exhibited in 1878. Most of these pictures are painted in brilliant colours. A change is noticeable the next year, 1879, in the ''Annunciation'' and in the four pictures making up the second series of ''Pygmalion and the Image''; the former of these, one of the simplest and most perfect of the artist's works, is subdued and sober; in the latter a scheme of soft and delicate tints was attempted, not with entire success. A similar temperance of colours marks ''[[The Golden Stairs]],'' first exhibited in 1880. The almost sombre ''Wheel of Fortune'' was shown in 1883, followed in 1884 by ''[[King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid (painting)|King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid]],'' in which Burne-Jones once more indulged his love of gorgeous colour, refined by the period of self-restraint. He next turned to two important sets of pictures, ''The Briar Rose'' and ''The Story of Perseus,'' though these were not completed for some years.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

Burne-Jones was elected an Associate of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1885, and the following year he exhibited (for the only time) at the Academy, showing ''The Depths of the Sea,'' a painting of a mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her love. This picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic irony of conception and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne-Jones's works. He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893. One of the ''Perseus'' series was exhibited in 1887, two more in 1888, with ''The Brazen Tower,'' inspired by the same legend. In 1890 the second series of ''[[The Legend of Briar Rose]]'' were exhibited by themselves, and won the widest admiration. The huge watercolor, ''[[Star of Bethlehem (painting)|The Star of Bethlehem]],'' painted for the corporation of Birmingham, was exhibited in 1891. A long illness for some time checked the painter's activity, which, when resumed, was much occupied with decorative schemes. An exhibition of his work was held at the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]] in the winter of 1892–1893. To this period belong several of his comparatively few portraits. In 1894 Burne-Jones was made a [[baronet]]. Ill-health again interrupted the progress of his works, chief among which was the vast ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon|Arthur in Avalon]]''. In the winter following his death a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery, and an exhibition of his drawings (including some of the charmingly humorous sketches made for children) at the [[Burlington Fine Arts Club]].&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

===Design for the theatre===
In 1894, theatrical manager and actor [[Henry Irving]] commissioned Burne-Jones to design sets and costumes for the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] production of ''King Arthur'' by [[J. Comyns Carr]], who was Burne-Jones's patron and the director of the New Gallery as well as a playwright. The play starred Irving as King Arthur and [[Ellen Terry]] as [[Guinevere]], and toured America following its London run.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p= 315}}{{sfn|Wood|1999| p= 119}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Miss Terry as Guinevere; In a Play by Comyns Carr, Dressed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones|date=5 November 1895|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9802E7DF1E3DE433A25756C0A9679D94649ED7CF|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burne-Jones accepted the commission with some enthusiasm, but was disappointed with much of the final result. He wrote confidentially to his friend Helen Mary Gaskell (known as May), "The armour is good—they have taken pains with it ... Perceval looked the one romantic thing in it ... I hate the stage, don't tell—but I do."{{sfn|Wood|1999| p= 120}}

===Aesthetics===
[[Image:Edward Burne-Jones The Golden Stairs.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Golden Stairs]]'', 1880]]
Burne-Jones's paintings were one strand in the evolving tapestry of [[Aestheticism]] from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued as an object of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|pp= 112–113}}
Burne-Jones's aim in art is best given in some of his own words, written to a friend:
{{quotation|I mean by a picture a beautiful, romantic dream of something that never was, never will be – in a light better than any light that ever shone – in a land no one can define or remember, only desire – and the forms divinely beautiful – and then I wake up, with the waking of Brynhild.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;}} No artist was ever more true to his aim. Ideals resolutely pursued are apt to provoke the resentment of the world, and Burne-Jones encountered, endured and conquered an extraordinary amount of angry criticism. Insofar as this was directed against the lack of realism in his pictures, it was beside the point. The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, the men and women of Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, it has nothing of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred "revolt from fact" which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

==Honours==
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones.The last sleep of Arthur.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Burne-Jones' ''The last sleep of Arthur'' at [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]]]
In 1881 Burne-Jones received an honorary degree from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1882.&lt;ref name="DNB1909"/&gt; In 1885 he became the President of the [[Birmingham Society of Artists]]. At about that time he began hyphenating his name, merely—as he wrote later—to avoid "annihilation" in the mass of Joneses.{{sfn|Taylor|1987|pp=150–151}} In November 1893, he was approached to see if he would accept a Baronetcy on the recommendation of the outgoing Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], the following February he legally changed his name to Burne-Jones{{sfn|Flanders|2001|p=258}} He was formally created a [[baronet]] of Rottingdean, in the county of Sussex, and of the Grange, in the parish of Fulham, in the county of London in the [[baronetage of the United Kingdom]] on 3 May 1894,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26509|page=2613|date=4 May 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained unhappy about accepting the honour, which disgusted his socialist friend Morris and was scorned by his equally socialist wife Georgiana.{{sfn|Taylor|1987|pp=150–151}}{{sfn|Flanders|2001|p=258}} Only his son Philip, who mixed with the set of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and would inherit the title, truly wanted it.{{sfn|Flanders|2001|p=258}}

Morris died in 1896, and the health of the devastated Burne-Jones declined substantially. In 1898 he suffered an attack of [[influenza]], and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17&amp;nbsp;June 1898.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26988|page=4396|date=19 July 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at [[Westminster Abbey]]. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured. Burne-Jones was buried in the churchyard at [[St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean]],{{sfn | Dale | 1989 | p=212}} a place he knew through summer family holidays.

==Influence==
[[Image:Blue plaque Edward Burne-Jones.jpg|right|thumb|[[Blue plaque]] on [[Bennetts Hill]], Birmingham]]

Burne-Jones exerted a considerable influence on French painting. He was also highly influential among French [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] painters, from 1889.&lt;ref name="Sym"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmagick.com/exhibitions/exhibition.aspx?id=360|title=The Age of Rossetti, Burne-Jones and Watts: Symbolism in Britain 1860–1910|accessdate=12 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328043558/http://www.artmagick.com/exhibitions/exhibition.aspx?id=360|archivedate=28 March 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired poetry by [[Swinburne]]&amp;nbsp;– Swinburne's 1866 ''Poems &amp; Ballads'' is dedicated to Burne-Jones.

Three of Burne-Jones's studio assistants, [[John Melhuish Strudwick]], T.&amp;nbsp;M. Rooke and [[Charles Fairfax Murray]], went on to successful painting careers. Murray later became an important collector and respected [[art dealer]]. Between 1903 and 1907 he sold a great many works by Burne-Jones and the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] to the [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery|Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], at far below their market worth. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery now has the largest collection of works by Burne-Jones in the world, including the massive watercolour ''Star of Bethlehem'', commissioned for the Gallery in 1897. The paintings are believed by some to have influenced the young [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], then growing up in Birmingham.&lt;ref name="Ink"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5890655/Echoes_of_Fellowship_William_Morris_and_J._R._R._Tolkien|title=Echoes of Fellowship: The PRB and the Inklings|last=Bracken|first=Pamela|date=4 March 2006|publisher=Conference paper, C. S. Lewis &amp; the Inklings|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burne-Jones was also a very strong influence on the [[Birmingham Group (artists)|Birmingham Group]] of artists, from the 1890s onwards.

==Neglect and rediscovery==
On 16 June 1933, Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]], a nephew of Burne-Jones, officially opened the centenary exhibition featuring Burne-Jones's drawings and paintings at the [[Tate Britain|Tate Gallery]] in London. In his opening speech at the exhibition, Baldwin expressed what the art of Burne-Jones stood for:
{{quotation|In my view, what he did for us common people was to open, as never had been opened before, magic casements of a land of faery in which he lived throughout his life ... It is in that inner world we can cherish in peace, beauty which he has left us and in which there is peace at least for ourselves. The few of us who knew him and loved him well, always keep him in our hearts, but his work will go on long after we have passed away. It may give its message in one generation to a few or in other to many more, but there it will be for ever for those who seek in their generation, for beauty and for those who can recognise and reverence a great man, and a great artist.&lt;ref name="centenary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Centenary exhibition of Sir Edward Burne-Jones at London Tate Gallery|publisher=Straits Times|date=24 July 1933|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
But, in fact, long before 1933, Burne-Jones was hopelessly out of fashion in the art world, much of which soon preferred the major trends in [[Modern art]], and the exhibit marking the 100th anniversary of his birth was a sad affair, poorly attended.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p= 1}} It was not until the mid-1970s that his work began to be re-assessed and once again acclaimed. [[Penelope Fitzgerald]] published a biography of him in 1975, her first book.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1975|p=}} A major exhibit in 1989 at the [[Barbican Art Gallery]], London (in book form as: John Christian, ''The Last Romantics'', 1989), traced Burne-Jones's influence on the next generation of artists, and another at [[Tate Britain]] in 1997 explored the links between British Aestheticism and Symbolism.&lt;ref name="Sym" /&gt;

A second lavish centenary exhibit&amp;nbsp;– this time marking the 100th anniversary of Burne-Jones's death&amp;nbsp;– was held at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York in 1998, before traveling to the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] and the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|loc=Front matter}}

[[Fiona MacCarthy]], in a review of Burne-Jones's legacy, notes that he was "a painter who, while quintessentially Victorian, leads us forward to the psychological and sexual introspection of the early twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/visionary-oddity Tate: "A Visionary Oddity: Fiona MacCarthy on Edward Burne-Jones"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Exiles on Asperus''''' ({{ISBN|0-340-24046-6}}) is a collection of [[science fiction]] short stories by [[John Wyndham]], writing as John Benyon, published in 1979 after his death by [[Coronet Books]].

The collection contains:

*Exiles on Asperus (1933)
*No Place Like Earth (1951)
*The Venus Adventure (1932)

Exiles tells the story of a human crew who are transporting a group of Martian dissidents to a penal colony only for the captives to revolt leading to the crew, prisoners, and the survivors of a previous crash becoming embroiled in a battle for survival against the indigenous life form of the planet Asperus.

No Place Like Earth sees a survivor of the Earth's destruction facing a slow, quiet life on Mars or becoming part of the efforts to keep humanity alive on Venus, and the repercussions of his decision.

The Venus Adventure tells of an early flight to Venus and the surprising world the crew of the Fyra discover. Not only are there intelligent indigenous lifeforms, and a breathable atmosphere, there are also fellow humans.

'''Feminist views on [[BDSM]]''' vary widely from rejection to acceptance. BDSM refers to bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and Sado-Masochism. In order to evaluate its perception, two polarizing frameworks are compared. Some feminists, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Susan Griffin]], have stated that they regard [[BDSM]] as a form of [[violence against women|woman-hating violence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffen|first=Susan|title="Sadomasochism and the Erosion of Self:A Critical Reading of Story of O" in [[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]|year=1982|location=East Palo Alto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Woman Hating|year=1974|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other feminists, such as [[Gayle Rubin]] and [[Patrick Califia]], perceive BDSM as a valid form of expression of [[human female sexuality|female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Jaclyn|title=Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World without Rape|year=2008|publisher=Seal Press|location=Seattle|isbn=1-58005-257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lesbian feminists practice BDSM and regard it as part of their sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sana Loue |author2=Martha Sajatovic |author3=Keith B. Armitage |title=Encyclopedia of Women's Health|year=2004|pages=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical relationship between feminists and BDSM practitioners has been controversial.  The two most extreme positions reflect those who believe that feminism and BDSM are mutually exclusive beliefs, and those who believe that BDSM practices are a fundamental expression of sexual freedom. Much of the controversy is left over from the [[feminist sex wars]] (acrimonious debates over sex issues) and the battle between the [[Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminists]] and the [[pro-sex feminist|pro-pornography feminists]].

== History ==

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, many different divisions of the feminist movement emerged.   As Andrew McBride writes, "During the 1970s, much of the discourse in the feminist movement was dominated by discussions of [[lesbian feminism]]. Toward the end of the decade, however, the conversations within feminism began to focus on a new topic: sexuality. This included sexuality of all types, not just lesbian sexuality. Included in the discussions and debates were heterosexuality, pornography, sadomasochism, butch/femme roles, and sex work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History:  The Sex Wars|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lavender Menace]] and their concept of [[The Woman-Identified Woman|the woman identified woman]] and the [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] both came out strongly believing that engaging in BDSM play was contradictory to being a feminist. [[Samois]], a San Francisco-based lesbian BDSM group, maintained that feminists could engage in BDSM without being hypocritical.

=== 1980s ===
During the 80s, this sex war continued and reached the attention of several academics who attempted to dissect why such a division had occurred. Ardill and O'Sullivan explained the history using the conflict in the [[London Lesbian and Gay Centre|London Lesbian and Gay Center]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ardill|first=S|author2=O'Sullivan, S|title=Upsetting an applecart: Difference, desire and lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Feminist Review|year=2005|volume=80|pages=98–126|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400223}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar conflicts were continuations of the issues in the 1970s.
The [[Lesbian Sex Mafia]] founded by [[Dorothy Allison]] appeared in New York advocating [[sex positive feminism]] and promoting the idea that all women had the right to explore their sexuality in whatever ways they saw fit. The controversial [[1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality]], which brought these issues to the attention of academic feminists, is often regarded as officially launching the feminist sex wars.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth|date=1983-01-01|title=The Context of 'Between Pleasure and Danger': The Barnard Conference on Sexuality|jstor=1394680|journal=Feminist Review|issue=13|pages=35–41|doi=10.2307/1394680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s feminist scholars continued to research and apply different feminist academic [[:wikt:framework|frameworks]] to the questions of sexuality and BDSM in an effort to find a way to bridge the gap between the two groups.  Hopkins, in 1994 applied critical analysis to the feminist viewpoints against Sadomasochistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=P.D.|title=Rethinking sadomasochism: Feminism, interpretation and simulation|journal=Hypatia|year=1994|volume=9|issue=1|page=116|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1994.tb00112.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She takes each argument put forth against BDSM practice by women and answers it from within a feminist framework.   In the end, she points out that the issue is not as concrete as feminists may try and paint it and that they may need to examine the concepts in more detail.    In 1995, Teresa Hornsby also applied feminist frameworks to the subject of BDSM and came down on the side that the two were not contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Teresa|title=Gender role reversal and the violated lesbian body: Toward a feminist hermeneutic of lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=61–72|doi=10.1300/j155v03n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Hornsby went further to examine whether or not violence itself was only a masculine activity.

=== 2000s ===
After 2000, advances in technology were opening up the world to more people and BDSM started coming out more and more in popular culture.  [http://law.uvic.ca/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/deckha.php Maneesha Deckha] applied a [[postcolonial feminist]] approach where she suggests treating BDSM as a cultural practice as a means to put to rest the divide between feminists and BDSM practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as culture: A postcolonial feminist approach to S/M and women’s agency.|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|issue=2|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came to the conclusion as did those in the 90's that perhaps a more in depth look is needed to determine if feminist viewpoints on BDSM hold up under closer scrutiny.     In addition, Deckha did some work on the concepts of consent and the legality of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/m and its legal regulation in Canada through [[Elfriede Jelinek|Jelinek's]] ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]''.|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=425–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically addressing the question on whether or not women can give consent and whether BDSM activities should be regulated in the context of violence or the context of sexuality.  One point she makes is if legislation is made in the context of regulating it around sex then aren't we simply giving the patriarchy further control over women's expression of sexual identity.

=== Current feminist viewpoints ===
Current feminist viewpoints on BDSM practices continue to be controversial and at odds with one another. Some feminists view SM as an ideal feminist expression of sexual freedom while other feminists say that BDSM, and more particularly SM, reinforce patriarchy and that these practices are contradictory to feminism. Feminists who view BDSM as contradictory to feminism also often believe that women who engage in BDSM practices, and specifically those who play a submissive role in them, have been led by sexist power structures to believe that they enjoy these acts. This feminist viewpoint argues that the individuals who enjoy playing a submissive role in the bedroom only enjoy it because they have been led to believe that it is what is expected of them and that they should enjoy it. This viewpoint argues that if these individuals, particularly women, were able to explore their sexual desires without the influence of a sexist power structure that they would come to very different conclusions about what they enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as a Culture: A Postcolonial Feminist Approach to S/M and Women's Agency|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|issue=129|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perspectives on lesbian BDSM ===
Lesbian SM (Sadism, Submission, Masochism) has been problematic in the analysis of feminist viewpoints on BDSM, especially with regards to whether or not lesbians are recreating patriarchal structures.    Many academic critics do not even tackle the idea of lesbian BDSM. Maneesha Deckha in her article, "Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/M and its legal regulation in Canada through [[Elfriede Jelinek|Jelinek's]] ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]'' admitted that covering lesbian BDSM made her theories too convoluted to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=M.|title=Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/m and its legal regulation in Canada through Jelinek's the piano teacher|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2007|volume=30|series=2|pages=425–459|accessdate=5 February 2012|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol302/425-460_Deckha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such lesbian erasure has been fairly common in second and third wave feminism as lesbian identity has frequently been subsumed in feminist identity. This concept is explained by Calhoun in "The Gender Closet: Lesbian disappearance under the sign 'woman'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calhoun|first=C|title=gender closet: Lesbian disappearance under the sign `women'|journal=Feminist Studies|year=1995|volume=21|series=1|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some, such as Deckha, believe  that although lesbians do practice BDSM, they are doing so in an effort to merely recreate the patriarchal power structure in the rest of society. Be it through domination and submission exchange of power, or the butch/femme dynamic, lesbians who interact in this way are convincing themselves that they are outside of patriarchy, when in reality they are reinforcing it because their sexuality is trapped within the patriarchal structure, true consent cannot occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as culture: A postcolonial feminist approach to S/M and women’s agency|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|series=2|pages=129–150|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Hornsby, believe that lesbians can in fact practice BDSM without recreating patriarchal systems because they have already declared themselves to be outside of those systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Teresa|title=Gender role reversal and the violated lesbian body: Toward a feminist hermeneutic of lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|year=1999|volume=3|series=3|pages=61–72|doi=10.1300/j155v03n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BDSM practitioners ===
Feminist writer Clarisse Thorn released a book in 2012 called ''The S&amp;M Feminist,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clarisse Thorn |title=The S&amp;M Feminist | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6D_AMgEACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781477472040&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4b4fU8bNLYP7kAWYyoDoDA&amp;redir_esc=y | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012 | ISBN=978-1477472040}} (Essays on BDSM, gender and culture)&lt;/ref&gt; in which she often discusses her own experiences. The high-profile feminist anthology ''[[Yes Means Yes]],'' published in 2008, also featured an essay about BDSM and feminism by Stacey May Fowles.

Jessica Wakeman wrote of her own experience with SM activities in a follow-up interview after her article [http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-06-01/first-time-for-everything-spanking/ First Time For Everything: Getting Spanked] was published in 2009. At the time of the interview in October, 2010, Wakeman had been writing about feminist issues, including feminism and media criticism, feminism and politics, and feminism and sex for about eight years and considered herself to be a rather active feminist.&lt;ref name =carpm&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpentier|first=Megan|title=BDSM And Feminism: "Stop Telling Me What I’m Supposed To Like, D*mn It."|url=http://jezebel.com/5666107/bdsm-and-feminism-%20stop-telling-me-what-im-supposed-to-like-dmn-it|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wakeman discussed how she is able to enjoy spanking play and being dominated and still be a feminist. She discussed how spanking play is a fetish and is no different from other fetishes that individuals have, even though it does involve being hit by one's partner. She also commented that it is important to remember that when an individual is involved with BDSM play, such as spanking, if it is true BDSM play it has been discussed by both partners and either of them can stop the play at any time with a safe word. Furthermore, a real physically or emotionally abusive relationship is not safe and consensual like BDSM play is. There is a difference between what happens in the bedroom and what happens in real life. Wakeman wrote that she is able to enjoy things in the context of sex or flirting that she wouldn't want to happen in her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name =carpm/&gt;

Like other feminist BDSM practitioners, Wakeman rejects the argument that women are taught what they enjoy and led to be submissive by a dominant sexist power structure. Within BDSM communities, it is often said that submissive practitioners are the real dominants because they have the ultimate control over the situation with a safe word.&lt;ref name =carpm/&gt;

[[File:Flag of Montreal (1939-2017).svg|thumb|Flag of Montreal from 1939 to 2017]]
The '''flag of [[Montreal]]''' was first displayed in May 1935 and is based on the [[Coat of arms of Montreal|city's coat of arms]]. It was revised in May 1939 and again in 13 September 2017. The flag's proportions are 1:2 in a [[Flag terminology|symmetric cross]].

==Symbolism==
The red [[heraldry|heraldic]] cross represents the "Christian motives and principles which governed the founders of the city," according to the city's official web site.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,42249635&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL What do the symbols on Montréal's coat of arms mean?]", Centre d'histoire de Montréal, Ville de Montréal, retrieved May 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
The five emblems represent the ancestral presence of Indigenous peoples and the four main European ethnic groups that were settled in the city in the 19th century, and which are also represented on the [[Canadian Red Ensign]].  They are:

==Previous flag==
[[File:Armoiries Montreal 1833.jpg|right|thumb|Original 1833 [[Coat of arms of Montreal]]]]
Montreal's flag is based on its coat of arms. The original coat of arms was designed in 1833 by the first mayor of Montreal, Jacques Viger. It was similar to the current version with the difference that the red cross was a [[saltire]] and a beaver stood in the place of what is now a fleur-de-lys. The arms were revised in 1938.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}}

Four years prior to the first raising of the revised flag, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], the sovereign of Canada, celebrated his Silver Jubilee (25th year on the throne) on Monday May 6, 1935. An article in the Montreal Gazette from May 3, 1935&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h5MuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FpkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4083,362980&amp;dq=montreal%27s-flag&amp;hl=en Montreal to have city flag to fly]", Montreal Gazette May 3-1935, retrieved November 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the city’s Jubilee committee had discovered a rule whereby official coats of arms of British corporations could be interpreted into flag banners. Per the article, Montreal prepared to raise its own distinct flag for the first time ever on the King’s Jubilee day based on the original coat of arms by Jacques Viger.{{citation needed|date = July 2017}}

==Current flag==
On February 12, 2017, the Mayor of Montreal [[Denis Coderre]] announced a modification to the flag of Montreal to include a First Nations symbol.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/montreal/201702/14/01-5069456-les-autochtones-choisiront-le-nouveau-symbole-du-drapeau-de-montreal.php Les autochtones choisiront le nouveau symbole du drapeau de Montréal]"(In French), La Presse Feb 14-2017, retrieved February 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made in 2017 during the city's 375th anniversary of the founding of the city. The symbol was chosen by the First Nations communities of Montreal, those being [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] and [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] although there are large [[Inuit]], [[Métis]] and [[Anishinaabe]]g populations.

The '''Museum of Gold''' ({{lang-es|El Museo del Oro}}) is a [[museum]] located in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. It is one of the most visited touristic highlights in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bogotatravelguide.com/places-to-go-in-bogota/gold-museum.php | title=The 22 Places To Go in Bogotá: Museum of Gold | publisher=Bogotá Travel Guide] | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum receives around 500,000 tourists per year.&lt;ref name=SemanaMuseo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.semana.com/cultura/articulo/los-75-del-museo-del-oro/409766-3 Los 75 del Museo del Oro] - [[Semana (Colombia)|Semana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum displays a selection of [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] gold and other metal alloys, such as ''[[Tumbaga]]'', and contains the largest collection of gold artifacts in the world in its exhibition rooms on the second and third floors. Together with [[pottery]], stone, [[Animal shell|shell]], wood and textile objects, these items, made of a– to [[amerindian|indigenous]] cultures – sacred metal, testify to the life and thought of the different societies which lived in present-day Colombia before the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas]].

== History ==
In 1934, the [[Bank of the Republic]] began helping to protect the [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[National patrimony|patrimony]] of [[Colombia]].{{fact|date=January 2014}} The object known as [[Poporo Quimbaya]] was the first one in a collection. It has been on exhibition for 70 years.{{when|date=January 2014}}  The Museum is today administered by [[Bank_of_the_Republic_(Colombia)#Banrepcultural|Banrepcultural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Banrepcultural |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/en |website=Red Cultural del Banco de la República en Colombia |accessdate=13 September 2018 |quote=The cultural activity of Banco de la República extends as a network through 29 cities in the Colombian territory, and is carried out in the Gold Museum in Bogota, five Gold Museums in Armenia, Cali, Cartagena, Pasto and Santa Marta, the Ethnographic Museum in Leticia, the Luis Ángel Arango Library and the Casa Gómez Campuzano in Bogotá, the Library Network that extends through 28 Colombian cities, the Luis Ángel Arango Library Concert Hall, and Bogotá museums: Casa de Moneda, Botero Museum and, Miguel Urrutia Museum of Art (MAMU).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum houses the famous [[Muisca raft|Muisca golden raft]] found in [[Pasca]] in 1969, that represents the ceremony of the new ''[[zipa]]'' (ruler) of Bacatá, the basis for the ''[[El Dorado]]'' myth. The heir to the chieftaincy assumed power with a great offering to the gods. In this representation he is seen standing at the centre of a raft, surrounded by the principal chieftains, all of them adorned with [[gold]] and feathers.

After a decade of work, the museum was expanded and renovated in October 2008. With the renovation, the museum organized the permanent exhibition in five rooms with archaeological objects and an interactive room. It also added an auditorium, some temporary exhibitions rooms, a cafe, a restaurant, and a souvenir store.

== Description ==
The museum has a collection of 55,000 pieces, 6,000 of which are on display in their expanded building. There are bilingual descriptions of almost all exhibits. On the first floor houses the museum's main entrance, a shop, and a restaurant.

Exhibitions begin on the second floor. The main room is called "People and Gold in pre-Hispanic [[Colombia]]". In glass vitrines display goldsmiths' work from the different cultures which inhabited Colombia before the Spanish colonists arrived. The permanent exhibition is divided into different halls for every culture: [[Calima culture|Calima]], [[Quimbaya]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Zenú]], [[Tierradentro]], [[San Agustín Archaeological Park|San Agustín]], [[Panche people|Tolima]], [[Tairona]], and Urabá, and a special room called "After [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]" (''Después de Colón'').

The exposition continues on the third floor, with "The Flying Chamanic" and "The Offering." The first shows the process of a [[shaman]]ic ceremony with its different gold pieces, the second is divided into three parts: the "Offering Room", the "Offering Boat", and the "Lake".

At the end of the exposition, there is a "Profunditation Room" with artistic videos about the most important gold pieces of the museum.

'''Hue''' is one of the main properties (called [[Color appearance model#Color appearance parameters|color appearance parameters]]) of a [[color]], defined technically (in the [[CIECAM02]] model), as "the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as [[red]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[yellow]]",&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fairchild, "Color Appearance Models: CIECAM02 and Beyond". Tutorial slides for IS&amp;T/SID 12th Color Imaging Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; (which in certain theories of color vision are called [[unique hues]]). Hue can typically be represented quantitatively by a single number, often corresponding to an angular position around a central or neutral point or axis on a colorspace coordinate diagram (such as a [[chromaticity diagram]]) or [[color wheel]], or by its [[dominant wavelength]] or that of its [[complementary color]]. The other color appearance parameters are [[colorfulness]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] (also known as intensity or chroma)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/|title=Hue, Value, Saturation {{!}} learn.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630065346/http://learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/|archive-date=2017-06-30|dead-url=no|access-date=October 27, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[lightness]], and [[brightness]].

Usually, colors with the same hue are distinguished with adjectives referring to their lightness or colorfulness, such as with "light blue", "pastel blue", "vivid blue". Exceptions include [[brown]], which is a dark [[Orange (colour)|orange]].&lt;ref name="Bartleson1976"&gt;C J Bartleson, "Brown". ''Color Research and Application,'' '''1''' : 4, p 181-191 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[painting]] [[color theory]], a hue is a ''pure'' [[pigment]]—one without [[Tints and shades|tint or shade]] (added white or black pigment, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creativecurio.com/2008/05/the-color-wheel-and-color-theory/ |title=The Color Wheel and Color Theory |publisher=Creative Curio |date=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2011-06-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705211646/http://creativecurio.com/2008/05/the-color-wheel-and-color-theory/ |archivedate=2011-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hues are first processed in the [[Human brain|brain]] in areas in the extended V4 called [[glob (visual system)|globs]].&lt;ref name="Conway07"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.008 | last1 = Conway | first1 = BR | last2 = Moeller | first2 = S | last3 = Tsao | first3 = DY. | year = 2007 | title = Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 560–73 | pmid = 17988638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = BR | last2 = Tsao | first2 = DY | title = Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 42 | pages = 18034–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19805195 | pmc = 2764907 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0810943106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computing hue ==

In [[opponent process|opponent color spaces]] in which two of the axes are perceptually orthogonal to lightness, such as the CIE 1976 (''L''*, ''a''*, ''b''*) ([[CIELAB]]) and 1976 (''L''*, ''u''*, ''v''*) ([[CIELUV]]) color spaces, hue may be computed together with chroma by converting these coordinates from [[rectangular coordinates|rectangular]] form to [[polar coordinates|polar]] form. Hue is the angular component of the polar representation, while chroma is the radial component.

Specifically, in CIELAB&lt;ref name="CIE1986"&gt;''Colorimetry,'' second edition: CIE Publication 15.2. Vienna: Bureau Central of the CIE, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h_{ab} = \mathrm{atan2}(b^*, a^*),&lt;/math&gt;

while, analogously, in CIELUV&lt;ref name = "CIE1986"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;h_{uv} = \mathrm{atan2}(v^*, u^*) =  \mathrm{atan2}(v', u'),&lt;/math&gt;

where, [[atan2]] is a two-argument inverse tangent.

=== Defining hue in terms of RGB ===

Preucil&lt;ref name = "Preucil1953"&gt;Frank Preucil, "Color Hue and Ink Transfer … Their Relation to Perfect Reproduction, ''TAGA Proceedings,'' p 102-110 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; describes a color hexagon, similar to a trilinear plot described by Evans, Hanson, and Brewer,&lt;ref name = "Evans1953"&gt;Ralph Merrill Evans, W T Hanson, and W Lyle Brewer, ''Principles of Color Photography.'' New York: Wiley, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; which may be used to compute hue from [[RGB]]. To place [[red]] at 0°, [[green]] at 120°, and [[blue]] at 240°,

:&lt;math&gt; h_{rgb} = \mathrm{atan2}\left( \sqrt{3} \cdot (G - B), 2 \cdot R - G - B \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, one may solve
:&lt;math&gt; \tan( h_{rgb}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}\cdot (G - B)}{2\cdot R - G - B}. &lt;/math&gt;

Preucil used a polar plot, which he termed a color circle.&lt;ref name = "Preucil1953"/&gt; Using R, G, and B, one may compute hue angle using the following scheme: determine which of the six possible orderings of R, G, and B prevail, then apply the formula given in the table below.

| Rose
| &lt;math&gt;60^\circ \cdot \left( 6 - \frac{B - G}{R - G}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that in each case the formula contains the fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{M - L}{H - L}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''H'' is the highest of R, G, and B; ''L'' is the lowest, and ''M'' is the mid one between the other two. This is referred to as the "Preucil hue error" and was used in the computation of mask strength in photomechanical color reproduction.&lt;ref name = "Southworth"&gt;Miles Southworth, ''Color Separation Techniques'', second edition. Livonia, New York: Graphic Arts Publishing, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hue angles computed for the Preucil circle agree with the hue angle computed for the Preucil hexagon at integer multiples of 30° (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, and the colors midway between contiguous pairs) and differ by approximately 1.2° at odd integer multiples of 15° (based on the circle formula), the maximal divergence between the two.

The process of converting an RGB color into an [[HSL color space]] or [[HSV color space]] is usually based on a 6-piece piecewise mapping, treating the HSV cone as a hexacone, or the HSL double cone as a double hexacone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Computer Graphics and Geometric Modelling v. 1: Implementation and Algorithms | author = Max K.

== Specialized hues ==

The hues exhibited by [[caramel color]]ings and [[beer]]s are fairly limited in range. The [[Linner hue index]] is used to quantify the hue of such products.

== Usage in art ==

Manufacturers of pigments use the word hue, for example, "cadmium yellow (hue)" to indicate that the original pigmentation ingredient, often toxic, has been replaced by safer (or cheaper) alternatives whilst retaining the hue of the original.  Replacements are often used for [[chromium]], [[cadmium]] and [[alizarin]].

== Hue vs. dominant wavelength ==

[[Dominant wavelength]] (or sometimes equivalent wavelength) is a physical analog to the perceptual attribute hue. On a [[chromaticity diagram]], a line is drawn from a [[white point]] through the coordinates of the color in question, until it intersects the [[CIE 1931 color space#The CIE xy chromaticity diagram|spectral locus]]. The wavelength at which the line intersects the spectrum locus is identified as the color's [[dominant wavelength]] if the point is on the same side of the white point as the spectral locus, and as the color's [[complementary wavelength]] if the point is on the opposite side.&lt;ref name = "Judd1976"&gt;Deane B Judd and Günter Wyszecki, ''Color in Business, Science, and Industry.'' New York: Wiley, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hue difference: &lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Delta H^*&lt;/math&gt;? ==

There are two main ways in which hue difference is quantified. The first is the simple difference between the two hue angles. The symbol for this expression of hue difference is &lt;math&gt;\Delta h_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELAB and &lt;math&gt;\Delta h_{uv}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELUV. The other is computed as the residual total color difference after Lightness and Chroma differences have been accounted for; its symbol is &lt;math&gt;\Delta H^*_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELAB and &lt;math&gt;\Delta H^*_{uv}&lt;/math&gt; in CIELUV.

== Names and other notations ==
There exists some correspondence, more or less precise, between hue values and [[color term]]s (names). One approach in color science is to use traditional color terms but try to give them more precise definitions. See [[spectral color#Table of spectral or near-spectral colors]] for names of highly saturated colors with the hue from ≈ 0° (red) up to ≈ 275° (violet), and [[line of purples#Table of highly-saturated purple colors]] for color terms of the remaining part of the color wheel.

Alternative approach is to use a systematic notation. It can be a standard [[angle]] notation for certain color model such as HSL/HSV mentioned above, [[CIELUV]], or [[CIECAM02]]. Alphanumeric notations such as of [[Munsell color system]], [[Natural Color System|NCS]], and [[Pantone Matching System]] are also used.

'''Imparja Television Pty Ltd''' is a commercial television company servicing remote eastern and [[central Australia]] that began broadcasting on 2 January 1988. It is based in [[Alice Springs]], where it has a studio and satellite uplink facility. Notably, it is controlled by [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aborigines]] and is widely regarded as a symbol of Aboriginal Australia.

The company produces one channel, [[Imparja Television]]. From the late 1990s to 2007, it also produced an additional channel, the Aboriginal content on it becoming known as [[Indigenous Community Television|ICTV]], which was closed on 12 July 2007 to make way for the  [[National Indigenous Television]] service.

'''''In the garden door. The artist's wife''''' is an oil painting by [[L. A. Ring]] in 1897. It is a portrait of his wife Sigrid Kähler (1874-1923), whom he married in 1896. The painting is 191 × 144&amp;nbsp;cm and is owned by the [[National Gallery of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063604/DEN_280_016.html|title=At the French Windows. The Artist's Wife|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Ring suggests in the painting human frailty by equating Sigrid's stomach with the vegetation's almost crippled stem and branch structure. It has been interpreted as the artist's "reminder of the fragility that also includes the emerging life as perceived by man and nature." The image's contrast between cold and warm colors contribute to the feeling of space. In the foreground to the left penetrates warm orange and yellow colors of the curtain and the dress while the cooler green and blue colors remain in the image's background.

Ring was 42 years old when he painted the portrait of his wife, who was 22 at the time. From this context, art historians interpret the painting as a love letter to his pregnant wife, which positions the trip looking to the spring blooming flora, symbolizing love.&lt;ref name="”SMK”"&gt;[http://www.smk.dk/udforsk-kunsten/highlights/laurits-andersen-ring-i-havedoeren-kunstnerens-hustru/ ''I havedøren.'']&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, myrtle over her head is a symbol of [[Aphrodite]] in Greek mythology, and myrtle was traditionally used to decorate the bride at weddings in Denmark. There's also an underlying gloom in this painting, assumed to be a symbol of death, "the real underlying theme, or rather, the life experience of Ring trying to handle and dispose of paint."&lt;ref name="”SMK”"/&gt;

== Style ==
L.A. Ring has been described as a pioneer of Danish [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], and his works have been described as an expression of [[social realism]]. In recent years, the field of art history has generally accepted that these two aspects of his work are equally important and complement each other. It has also been pointed out that "In the garden door" represents an alternative view of women to Romanticism's idealized view of the female figure.
: "The painting adds to a number of Danish artists monumental portraits of women and wives from the turn of the 20th century. Images that display a woman that's gradually released from the Romantic's body and intellectual motherhood towards a more independent and confident woman with both body and brains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/highlights/laurits-andersen-ring-the-artists-wife/|title=laurits andersen ring the artists wife|website=www.smk.dk|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">A '''Kunsthalle''' or '''Kunsthaus''' is a term in [[German language|German]]-speaking regions for a facility that mounts [[art exhibition]]s. The term roughly means "Art Gallery" in English but with a somewhat more specific meaning. A ''Kunsthalle'' is often operated by a non-profit ''Kunstverein'' ("Art Association") and a ''Kunsthaus'' ("Art House") refers more to a gallery or museum with associated artists, symposia, studios and workshops. A ''Kunsthalle'' is also similar to a ''Kunstmuseum'' ("Art Museum"), but the terms mean different things historically. In the strictest sense a ''Kunstmuseum'' has its own permanent collection and a ''Kunsthalle'' does not.

Today the boundaries between these terms are free flowing. In German-speaking countries there are many ''Kunstmuseum'' which are named ''Kunsthalle'' and vice versa. In addition, the activities of a traditional ''Kunsthaus'' are found in all forms of these art institutions.

The purpose of this list is to specifically list those exhibition venues, museums, and art societies which are officially named "Kunsthalle".

[[File:Detail, Thai manuscript cabinet from Thailand, British Library.png|thumb|Detail from a large wooden manuscript cabinet showing a scene from the [[Mahosadha Jataka]], one of the last [[Ten Birth Tales of the Buddha]], decorated with the ''lai rot nam'' technique]]
'''''Lai rot nam''''' ({{lang-th|ลายรดน้ำ}}) or '''gilded black lacquer''' is a technique in the [[Thai art|traditional Thai decorative arts]] consisting of the application of black [[lacquer]] with gold [[inlay]] to surfaces. It was used in the decoration of wooden furniture, especially cabinets, as well as door and window panels, in palaces and Buddhist temples. The art form developed during the [[Ayutthaya period]], reaching its zenith during the seventeenth to early eighteenth centuries, and continued during the Thonburi and [[Rattanakosin period]]s.

The technique consists of applying to the wooden panel several coats of black lacquer, a resin from the [[Burmese lacquer tree]] known in Thai as ''rak''. The drawing is then traced, and the parts to remain black are painted over with a yellow-gummy mixture known in Thai as ''namya horadan'' ({{lang|th|น้ำยาหรดาล}}). The next process is to give a thin coat of lacquer over the surface, and when it is semi-dry, [[gold leaf]] is applied over the whole surface. After about twenty hours the work is washed with water to detach the gummy-paint, exposing the lacquer and leaving the remaining gold inlay in the unpainted areas. The application of gold leaf and washing with water give the technique its name, fully ''lai pit thong rot nam'' ({{lang|th|ลายปิดทองรดน้ำ}}, "designs of applied gold leaf washed with water"), but often shortened to just ''lai rot nam'' ("designs washed with water").&lt;ref&gt;{{CC-notice|cc=by|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2016/06/exploring-thai-art-doris-duke.html|author(s)=Jana Igunma/The British Library}} {{cite web|last1=Igunma|first1=Jana|title=Exploring Thai art: Doris Duke|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2016/06/exploring-thai-art-doris-duke.html|website=Asian and African studies blog|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=7 September 2017|language=en|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of books published as the "Famous Scots Series" by the [[Edinburgh]] publishers, [[Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier]], from 1896 to 1905. Forty-two of these books were published though least one volume in the series was planned but never published.&lt;ref&gt;In some of the early books, e.g. ''The ‘Blackwood’ Group'' and ''Norman Macleod'', a list of forthcoming volumes is given at the back. These include a work entitled ''Jeffrey and the Edinburgh Reviewers'' by [[Hugh Gilzean-Reid|Sir Hugh Gilzean-Reid]] but this was apparently never published for whatever reason.&lt;/ref&gt; These books are distinctive for their bright red covers and uniform presentation. They are generally of a quite high scholarly quality.&lt;ref&gt;This list was compiled from a number of sources including [[library catalog]]ues and websites such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;/ref&gt; The authors often had access to biographical material which is no longer available. Two versions of each volume were published. An upmarket version has gilded lettering and [[motif (visual arts)|motifs]] on the front cover and has gilt tape as book marker. It is about a quarter of inch longer than the ordinary version which is gilded only on the edge. 

Thirty-three of the authors were men and five were women. It appears that all the women were educated at home, presumably by tutors or governesses. Three of the women wrote biographies of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], namely, Margaret Moyes Black, Rosaline Masson and Eve Blantyre Simpson.

[[File:POL Warszawa Muzeum Karykatury.jpg|thumb|230px|Museum of Caricature]]

'''Museum of Caricature''' ({{lang-pl|Muzeum Karykatury}}) is a museum in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. The museum was established in 1978.  It has a collection of over 20,000 pieces by Polish and foreign artists.  

The museums premises are an old [[orangery]] which was once part of the [[18th century]] Prymas Castle.  As the museum only has limited space it does not have a permanent collection on display but instead shows temporary exhibitions based on its holdings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muzeumkarykatury.pl/joomla/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74&amp;Itemid=78&lt;/ref&gt;

In aesthetics, '''nimism''' is a particular kind of [[trope (literature)|trope]] or [[symbol]] characterized  by exaggeration.  
The term is derived from [[Latin]] (''nimis''), "too much" and (''nimietas''), ''excess''.  Unlike a [[hyperbole]] or [[paradox]], it is not applied to linguistic or rhetorical phenomena only, but usually refers to other forms of disparity, e.g. disproportions in sculptures and paintings, or certain sorts of discrepancies in appearance or behaviour (in theatre plays, movies etc.).
Thus nimism, by means of symbolic parallels or analogies, is meant to help the reader, viewer etc. to see the truth. A ''negative nimism'' hints at something bad (a weakness, vice, sin, crime etc.), the less frequently used ''positive nimism'' indicates something good (a virtue or something heroic).

==Examples==

*King Duncan’s cloak, too wide for his murderous successor Macbeth. (Shakespeare's ''[[MacBeth]]'')
*The feet of the two naughty  stepsisters, too big (and bloody) to fit Cinderella’s tiny shoe, hence an obvious evidence of their wrong claim. (Brothers Grimm's "[[Cinderella|Cinderella and The Little Glass Slipper]]" )
*Elizabeth Bennet’s look at the nude male sculptures in Darcy’s art gallery, cast much too long to conceal her sexual awakening. (Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')
*The proverbial “Qui s’excuse s’accuse” ("[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/qui%20s'excuse%20s'accuse He who excuses himself accuses himself]") referring to an apology offered too early, i.e., untimely and not asked for, and thus revealing a bad conscience.

The '''Palm Sunday Handcraft Market''' ([[Tianguis]] de Domingo de Ramos), held in [[Uruapan]], is the largest event in the Mexican state of [[Michoacán]] dedicated to the sale of the [[Michoacán handcrafts and folk art|state’s traditional handcrafts]] and is reputed to be the largest of its kind in Latin America. The event draws over 1,300 artisans who offer over a million pieces for sale, which represent all of the state’s major handcraft traditions. It also includes other events such as a handcraft competition, exhibition of indigenous dress, food and other traditions, concerts, dance and more. The event is centered on the very large main plaza of the city of [[Uruapan]], but extends over to adjoining streets and to other plazas in the city.

==The tianguis==
[[File:TianguisDomingoRamos2015 038.JPG|thumb|La Calavera Catrina figures from Capula at the market]]
The tianguis (open air market) runs during [[Holy Week in Mexico|Holy Week]], officially beginning on the day before [[Palm Sunday]] and runs until the day after Easter Sunday, with the most important day being Palm Sunday (Domingo de Ramos).&lt;ref name=srangel&gt;{{cite news  |title= Se alista el Tianguis Artesanal del Domingo de Ramos en Uruapan  |newspaper= Diario ABC |location=Michoacán  |url= http://diarioabc.com.mx/mobil/noticia_completa.php?id_item=Nzc1OA== |accessdate=April 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mexdes&gt;{{cite web |title=Domingo de Ramos en Uruapan (Michoacán) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/domingo-de-ramos-en-uruapan-michoacan.html |accessdate=April 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major vacation period in Mexico, and the event draws visitors from Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name=visitmich&gt;{{cite web |title= Domingo de Ramos |publisher= State of Michoacán |url= http://www.visitmichoacan.com.mx/ss2015/domingo-ramos.html |accessdate= April 4, 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20150404231637/http://www.visitmichoacan.com.mx/ss2015/domingo-ramos.html |archivedate= April 4, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=travis&gt;{{cite book |author=Travis M.

[[File:TianguisDomingoRamos2015 053.JPG|thumb|left|Section of the market selling maque and textiles]]
The tianguis fills the large main plaza (Plaza de Martíres de Uruapan) of the city and overflows to adjoining streets and other plazas such as Morelos Plaza, Huatapera Plaza and the Garcia Ortiz alleyway next to the Casa de Cultura (cultural center). Related events occurs in these areas as well as the Plaza de la Ranita, the Casa de Cultura, and the entrance to the Barranca de Cupatizio National Park.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;&lt;ref name=gponce/&gt;

In 2015, there were over one million pieces for sale, representing all of the major handcraft traditions.&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt; These include textiles and traditional clothing, miniatures, jewelry, toys, furniture, lacquered gourds, chests, leather goods, iron, other metals, and the various types of ceramics produced, and those from stiff fibers such as wicker and palm fronds.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; Most of the items for sale are of high quality and are of styles only found in Michoacan such as clay pots from Huancito with animal heads, needlework from Charan, pre Hispanic lacquerware (maque) from Uruapan, copper pieces from [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] and wooden masks from Pamatacuaro,&lt;ref name=travis/&gt; but there are some stands selling mostly tourist and cheap items.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; For Palm Sunday, there are even more craftspeople, mostly Purépecha, on the atriums of the two main colonial churches, weaving palm fronds into intricate designs for churchgoers.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;

[[File:MuestraIndumentaria 2015 51.JPG|thumb|Purépecha children representing their community at the event in 2015]]
Over its history, the tianguis proper has since been expanded with other cultural events such as music and dance performances, a parade of artisans, a food exhibition featuring the traditional cuisine of the Purépecha and more.&lt;ref name=travis/&gt;&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;

The week is inaugurated with a parade of artisans and others in traditional dress, representing the four indigenous peoples found in the state, representing 45 communities and 25 Michoacan municipalities.&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt; The parade also include artisans with examples of their wares such as those from Santa Clara del Cobre, Pamatacuaro and Paracho along with marching bands and mojigangas (large cartonería puppet figures) .&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;&lt;ref name=gponce/&gt; The parade runs from the National Park to the center of the city along Culver City and Emilio Carranza streets, ending at the Casa de Cultura.&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;
[[File:TianguiaPurhepechaFood33.JPG|thumb|left|Corundas (similar to tamales) steaming in a huge vat at the Plaza de la Ranita]]
The Casa de Cultura host’s the state’s main handcraft competition, where winners are announced on Palm Sunday. In 2015, the competition awarded over a million pesos in prizes in 259 awards.&lt;ref name=srangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; On the same day there is the State Regional Costume Festival held at the Huatapera Museum, in which all four indigenous communities are represented, both in dress and traditions such as dance.&lt;ref name=srangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;&lt;ref name=visitmich/&gt;

At the Plaza de la Ranita, there is a demonstration and sale of traditional Purépecha food, which includes [[pozole]], [[corunda]]s, atole, enchiladas, [[buñuelos]], uchepos (tamales of sweet corn) and fish dishes. The goal of this is to provide example of more traditional and less tourist foods. [[Atole]] includes the atolenuitede from San Miguel Pomocuaran, which is salty and spice with serrano chili peppers. Churipo is a beef soup, atole de pinole (with toasted corn), tamales de chapata, made with amaranth seed.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;

==History==
The event is located in Uruapan, which has been an important commercial center since the pre Hispanic period because it is centered among the major Purépecha regions (Lake, Purepech highlands, Cañada de los Once Pueblos and Ciènega de Chapala), as well as between the highlands and the “[[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]],” the lower elevations that extend to the coast.&lt;ref name=visitmich/&gt;

Later, this area was remodeled to create the current Morelos Plaza. This posed a problem for the vendors until the current event was established in 1960.&lt;ref name=moreliainvita/&gt;

'''''Rendition''''' is a 2007 work of [[interactive fiction]] by "nespresso", written using [[Inform 7]] and published in [[Z-machine|z-code]] format, in which the player performs an interrogation of a suspected [[terrorist]]. The game describes itself as a "political art experiment in text adventure form". It was submitted to the 2007 [[Interactive Fiction Art Show]] in the "[[Portrait]]" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iffydoemain.org/iffyart/ |title=2007 IF Art Show |date= |website=iffydoemain.org |publisher= |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the seven judges at the art show reported enjoying the game, and many criticised its gameplay, though certain aspects of the game were praised. [[Jon Ingold]] stated that he stopped playing the game shortly after starting it, as he disliked the level of violence, though stated "I think this is all very powerful ... As a demonstration of the power - the impact - that a 'silly little text-game' can have, it works very well."  Another judge stopped playing the game on the same grounds, though commented "in many ways this was a clever idea, a portrait of me and what I am willing to do." Another stated that whilst the game was "painful to explore, the concept [wa]s particularly well-suited to interactive fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iffydoemain.org/iffyart/reviews7.htm |title=Judges' 2007 Reviews |website=iffydoemain.org |publisher= |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was subsequently chosen as game-of-the-day by [[playthisthing]], where it was described by [[Emily Short]] thus:
{{quote|It presents in a single atomic example the emotive power of complicity in gaming and interactive story-telling. When the player reaches the point of questioning his own involvement in a story, that story takes on a new significance, one which is not possible in non-interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Short, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080305134441/http://playthisthing.com/rendition Rendition: Quit This Thing], March 4, 2008, PlayThisThing.com as archived by archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She subsequently used the game, along  with ''[[Photopia]]'', as an example of an "approach to tragedy in interactive fiction" at the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s Hypertext 2007 conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/Emily-Short-Tragedy.pdf Interactive Tragedy: Observations from Interactive Fiction] (see slides 10-11, "Complicity") from Emily Short, Hypertext '07 Panel on Hypertext Tragedy with J. Nathan Matias, N. J. Lowe, and Dave Millard.&lt;/ref&gt; It was further discussed in a lecture at [[Cambridge University]] by Jorge Nathan Matias on 5 November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Tragedy &amp; Electronic Literature, web notes and archived audio of lecture at Cambridge University by Jorge Nathan Matias [http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/ full notes in hypertext style] [http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/TragPresentation.html lecture notes in presentation slide style][http://www.natematias.com/cam/trag-elit/note.php?id=3273474353&amp;parent=3273474342 Rendition-specific note]&lt;/ref&gt; and was mentioned in a conference paper by Alex Mitchell and [[Nick Montfort]] for the 2009 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nickm.com/if/mitchell_montfort_dac_2009.pdf Shaping Stories and Building Worlds on Interactive Fiction Platforms], Alex Mitchell and [[Nick Montfort]] at the 2009 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexposition scene in Game of Thrones.png|thumb|right|The scene that caused a critic to coin the word "sexposition": In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', [[Petyr Baelish]] ([[Aidan Gillen]]) explains his character's childhood and goals to two actresses who are simulating sexual activity.]]
In visual media such as television and film, '''sexposition''' is the technique of providing [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] against a backdrop of sex or nudity.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hann|first=Michael|title=How 'sexposition' fleshes out the story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/sexposition-story-tv-drama?newsfeed=true|accessdate=March 29, 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' defined sexposition as "keeping viewers hooked by combining complex plot exposition with explicit sexual goings-on".&lt;ref name=ft_lunch /&gt; Its purpose, according to [[James Poniewozik]], is to divert the audience and give characters something to do while exposition is being delivered, which is what distinguishes sexposition from merely gratuitous titillation.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was coined in 2011 by the blogger and critic Myles McNutt&lt;ref&gt;Originally in: {{cite web|last=McNutt|first=Myles|title=Game of Thrones – "You Win or You Die"|url=http://cultural-learnings.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-you-win-or-you-die/ |work=cultural-learnings.com |date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe scenes in the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; in which characters reveal crucial information related to plot and character development during intimate scenes. Author [[George R. R. Martin]] said this technique is in line with the purpose of sexuality in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, and acknowledged that this technique allows for the exposition of motivations and incentives not available to the TV show.&lt;ref name=ft_lunch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 2, 2012 | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sexposition" has since been retroactively applied to similar practices in many earlier works, including the older HBO shows ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (frequently set in a strip club), many older cop films (likewise) and even the 1930s comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]''. According to critic Poniewozik, the novelty of the practice is not the nudity, but the manner in which it accompanies exposition, for which older TV shows with less complex plots did not have as much need.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have  disapproved of sexposition because, in their view, it uses inappropriate tactics, insults the audience's intelligence by appealing and succumbing to carnality and covers up the screenwriter's failure to build cohesive narratives, having to rely on long drawn out sequences of exposition made watchable only through appeals to sexuality.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; Some criticize sexposition for catering almost exclusively to heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/16/game_of_thrones_fails_the_female_gaze_why_does_prestige_tv_refuse_to_cater_erotically_to_women |title="Game of Thrones" fails the female gaze: Why does prestige TV refuse to cater erotically to women? |publisher=Salon |accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Marshall]], director of the second-season episode "[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]", recalled that he was repeatedly urged to add more full-frontal nudity during filming. The producer told him, according to the director, that "[e]veryone else in the series is drama side. I represent the pervy side of the audience", an experience that Marshall described as "pretty surreal" to happen on the set of a major network production.&lt;ref name="plumb20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=34164 | title=Neil Marshall Game Of Thrones Podcast | work=Empire | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Marshall, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Game of Thrones'' showrunner David Benioff admitted that he does "pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes", while co-creator [[D. B. Weiss]] disagreed, countering that "Sex grabs people's attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/03/hbo-game-thrones-season-3-interview-david-benioff-dan-weiss | title="Game of Thrones" Creators on Shark, Sexposition, and Season 3 | work=Mother Jones | issue=March/April 2013 |date=March 5, 2013 | accessdate=March 7, 2013 | author=Mechanic, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effect is reportedly different for different directors, they say "Every one of those sex scenes is there because we wanted that particular scene in the show. There is not a sex scene quota from HBO."&lt;ref name="egner20130329"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/your-game-of-thrones-questions-answered/ | title=Your ‘Game of Thrones’ Questions, Answered | work=The New York Times | date=2013-03-29 | accessdate=March 29, 2013 | author=Egner, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported before the seventh season in 2017 that "Even if Benioff and Weiss don’t always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back".&lt;ref name="daddario2017"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=D'Addadio |first=Daniel |date=2017-07-10 |title='Game of Thrones': Inside the World's Most Popular Show |url=http://time.com/game-of-thrones-2017/ |magazine=Time |access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satire==
Fan site Winter is Coming cited an April 2012 skit on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' when discussing Marshall's anecdote.&lt;ref name="wic20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/blackwater-director-neil-marshall-on-nudity-and-creating-the-battle/ | title="Blackwater" director Neil Marshall on nudity and creating the battle | work=Winter is Coming | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Ours is the Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aired more than a month before the Marshall interview was published, the skit purported to be an episode of ''[[HBO First Look]]'' featuring Adam Friedberg, 13 year-old "creative consultant" to ''Game of Thrones''. Played by [[Andy Samberg]], the teenage boy was proud of "mak[ing] sure there are lots of boobs" and various sexual acts during expository scenes. Author Martin ([[Bobby Moynihan]]) called Friedberg "a visionary. He knows that even when I didn't write sex into a scene, I was definitely thinking about it."&lt;ref name="snl20120414"&gt;{{cite episode | title=HBO First Look: Game of Thrones | series=Saturday Night Live | url=http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones | credits=Samberg, Andy; Moynihan, Bobby; Killam, Taran | network=NBC | airdate=April 14, 2012 | number=721  | season=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sims20120415"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/josh-brolingotye,71972/ | title=Josh Brolin/Gotye, S37/E19 | work=A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3571">'''Shamstep''' is a Middle-Eastern genre of electronic dance music that combines the traditional forms of [[Dabke]] music with electronic instruments. 'Sham' is the Arabic name for the region of [[Greater Syria]], Syria-Palestine or the [[Levant]]. The term 'Shamstep' was coined by the Jordanian-Palestinian band [[47Soul]] to describe their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/28/from-shamstep-to-drill-the-top-40-newcomers-of-2018|title=From shamstep to drill: the top 40 newcomers of 2018|last=Aroesti|first=Rachel|date=2017-12-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-06-17|last2=Beaumont-Thomas|first2=Ben|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/in-depth/features/palestinian-band-47soul-politics-within-us-1735056104|title=Meet the Palestinian band 47Soul: 'Our message is universal'|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/99499-47soul-breaking-down-borders-through-music/|title=47Soul: breaking down borders through music|date=2018-03-06|work=The List|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamstep has been described as 'more than just a byword for hipsterfied East-West fusion. In 47Soul's home region, it's becoming part of the soundtrack for Arab youth.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/4x87xp/what-is-shamstep-47soul-interview|title=Is Shamstep a Made-Up Genre For Hipsters—or a Defining Movement of Arab Youth Culture?|date=2016-09-02|work=Thump|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has stated that it believes the region of Sham is "too divided with borders... In 1947, it was accessible to travel between our little cities...[but] we still see [the region] as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stepfeed.com/levant-band-47soul-will-make-shamstep-happen-3176|title=Levant Band 47Soul Will Make 'ShamStep' Happen|date=2015-03-24|work=StepFeed|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47 Soul's music is also defined by its fusion with Afro-American styles of music like Hip Hop and Reggae, due to the experiences of band member Walaa Sbeit at university in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palestinechronicle.com/47soul-shamstep/|title=47Soul: Shamstep - Palestine Chronicle|date=2015-07-04|work=Palestine Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other musicians who play similar forms of Dabke using electronic instruments include [[Omar Souleyman]], and Egyptian groups like [[Islam Chipsy]], whose music is seen as part of the Egyptian new wave called  [[Shaabi]] or Electro Shaabi. The website Rhythmpassport.com groups all these forms under the heading 'electro Dabke'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhythmpassport.com/genre/electro-dabke/|title=Electro Dabke {{!}} Genres {{!}} Rhythm Passport|website=Rhythm Passport|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

AlAraby has described 47 Soul's music as a "reinterpretation of traditional Arabic instruments, modal scales and rhythms found in ''chobi'' and ''mijwiz'' wedding music - and paralleled in the Egyptian ''electro-shaabi'' scene"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2017/3/17/big-in-exile-the-sonic-journeys-of-47-soul-1|title=Big in exile: The sonic journeys of 47SOUL|last=Armstrong|first=Martin|work=alaraby|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''''Statue of the Bear and the Strawberry Tree''''' (in Spanish “El Oso y el Madroño”) is a [[sculpture]] from the second half of the 20th century, situated in the Spanish city of [[Madrid]]. It represents the [[coat of arms of Madrid]] and is found on the east side of the [[Puerta del Sol]], between [[Calle de Alcalá]] and St. Jerónimo run, in the historical centre of the capital.

== History ==
The statue is a work of the sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Navarro Santafé|es}}(1906-1983) and was inaugurated in 1967. It was promoted by the section of Culture of the [[City Council of Madrid|City council of Madrid]], which wanted to represent the main heraldic symbols of the city and of Spain with a monument.

The first appearance of a wild [[bear]] and a [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] on the coat of arms of the city was in the 13th century. Previously, it only incorporated a bear in [[Attitude_(heraldry)#Passant|passant]] [[Attitude_(heraldry)|attitude]], until it was replaced in the aforementioned century by the two current figures. With this change, they wanted to symbolise the resolution adopted by the municipality and the Chapter of Priests and Beneficiaries after a long litigation about the control of Madrilenian pastures and trees. Since this agreement, the former became property of the Chapter and the latter of the council. From here they modified the arms, including a strawberry tree and of a bear in a new posture: leaning on the tree with both paws.

The sculpture has always been in the [[Puerta del Sol]], but in two different locations inside the square. Before 1986, it was situated in the east side of it, in the vicinity of the building between the [[Calle de Alcalá]] and the [[Carrera St. Jerónimo]]. That year, it was moved to the front of Carmen Street for the square's reform and remodeling, promoted by mayor [[Enrique Tierno Galván]]. In September 2009, with the integral renewal of the square promoted by [[Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón]], it has gone back to its original location.

== Description ==
The ''Statue of the Bear and the Strawberry Tree'' is made of stone and [[bronze]]. It weighs approximately 22 tons (20 [[tonne]]s) and stands 13&amp;nbsp;ft (4 m) tall. It rests on a staggered cubic pedestal of [[granite]].

It represents in a real-life form the [[coat of arms of Madrid]], with the tree taller than the bear, who supports his paws on the trunk and directs his attention towards one of the fruits. &lt;gallery&gt;

The stickers are usually sold in blind packs, so the purchaser does not know which stickers they are buying. Collectors then swap or sell their spares with other collectors.

===Sports===

The '''Studio Watts Workshop''' was an arts organization founded in 1964 and based in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, dedicated to providing working space for artists and offering a broad range of arts workshops for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Widener|first1=Daniel|title=Black arts West : culture and struggle in postwar Los Angeles|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=9780822346678|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The principal organizers of the Studio Watts Workshop were [[jazz]] musician [[Jayne Cortez]] and accountant and arts patron James Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Widener|first1=Daniel|title=Black arts West : culture and struggle in postwar Los Angeles|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=9780822346678|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woods, who worked at a local savings and loan, and his wife, a probation officer, provided the funding for the workshop's initial operating costs, because of their conviction that art could be a tool for social change. Woods found a location for the workshop, renting an empty furniture outlet on 104th Street and Grandee Avenue, and called together a group of eight artists to begin to plan what would become the Studio Watts Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Widener|first1=Daniel|title=Black arts West : culture and struggle in postwar Los Angeles|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=9780822346678|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Watts riots]] led to renewed attention on the neighborhood, there were new opportunities for support and donations that led to the group being able to provide training for about 150 students in the visual arts, writing, drama, dance, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colker|first1=David|last2=Lacey|first2=Marc|title=From Watts Riot Ashes: Bright Hopes, Heartaches|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-10/news/mn-2508_1_watts-riots/3|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to work in the Studio Watts Workshop space, artists had to agree to give public exhibitions of their work at least two times a year in Watts and in an artistic space outside the area and also to provide free instruction to any student with, in the words of James Woods, "the initiative and the desire to participate in the creative arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Nancy J.|title=Arts Center Born After Watts Riot|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 19, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the early 'masters' to students were Bruce Strobridge, a painter and sculptor who also had previously served in the Army with Woods and Anna Halprin, renowned international dance performer and teacher.  Marge and Gower Champion were also early supporters.  Woods also produced and directed several plays (many original) at the Studio with student actors, to some acclaim.  The celebrated poet Wanda Coleman, later known as the "Unofficial Poet Laureate of LA" was deeply engaged with early literary efforts among students at SWW.  In the late 1960s the Ford Foundation provided program funding to Woods and the Studio for its diverse initiatives.  This was complemented by significant funding from the Doris Duke Foundation.  Many Los Angeles professionals were friends of Studio Watts Workshop and donated their time and services to its governance.  Others, such as John Blaine, worked as full-time SWW staff.  In the early years, UCLA management professor Will Mc Whinney worked with Woods on strategy and leadership issues and LA native Joel Fadem, then a Yale University grad student and later at UCLA, assisted Woods in many foundation fund raising efforts.

In 1971, the Studio Watts Workshop received a $75,000 Ford Foundation grant to study how the arts could be used in low-income housing projects and Woods used the grant, together with a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and from other donations, to construct a 144-unit complex of rent-subsidized apartments. The Studio Watts Workshop became the Watts Community Housing Corporation, and spaces were set aside for arts workshops and gallery. Beginning in the 1970s, federal arts funding was drastically reduced and the Watts Community Housing Corporation could no longer support arts activity. In 1992, Woods, who was on the board of the Watts Community Housing Corporation, was continuing his efforts to advocate with the Department of Housing and Urban Development for allocating a part of the complex's rent income for arts programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colker|first1=David|last2=Lacey|first2=Marc|title=From Watts Riot Ashes: Bright Hopes, Heartaches|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-10/news/mn-2508_1_watts-riots/3|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

One of the studio's best-known projects was an annual Chalk-In, first held in 1968 as a way to encourage community participation in the arts. Young people were invited to draw on a block-long section of sidewalk on 103rd Street.  Twelve-year-old [[Richard Wyatt, Jr.|Richard Wyatt]] won the top prize at the first Chalk-In and credits the experience for starting him on his career as a prominent Los Angeles muralist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colker|first1=David|last2=Lacey|first2=Marc|title=From Watts Riot Ashes: Bright Hopes, Heartaches|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-10/news/mn-2508_1_watts-riots/3|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Studio efforts to integrate the arts into the Watts community included design programs, media production classes and facilities, a folk art archive, and dance, theater and other arts productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herbst|first1=Robby|title=Ceremony of Us|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/ceremony-of-us|website=East of Borneo|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Woods' active involvement in the Watts arts community, in 1968 he was invited by the [[Los Angeles Music Center]] to organize the first Los Angeles Festival of the Performing Arts. Even while moonlighting as a doorman at a Hollywood jazz club (Shelly's Manne-Hole), he would go on to organize the second and third festivals (in 1969 and 1970), and artists affiliated with the Studio Watts Workshop were among the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herbst|first1=Robby|title=Ceremony of Us|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/ceremony-of-us|website=East of Borneo|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the period when Studio Watts transitioned into low cost housing with artists-in-residence as a component, Woods also was instrumental in organizing "The Meeting at Watts Towers," a venue attracting both the new and old of the Watts community to honor its past, raise awareness on current issues, and celebrate the future. A comprehensive review of community arts in Watts may be found in "Watts: Art and Social Change in Los Angeles, 1965-2002" the 2003 exhibition catalogue of Marquette University's Haggerty Museum of Art, curated by Director, Curtis Carter (complete 68-page catalogue available on line).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4332">'''Sun Farm''' is multidisciplinary project/place and experiential garden created by architects/artists [[Daniela Bertol]] and David Foell. The {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} site is located in [[Claverack, New York]], about {{convert|110|mi|km}} North of [[New York City]], and includes [[land art]] constructions, [[geoglyph]]s, architectural fabrications and sculptures:[[Image:Sun farm-aerial looknortheast.jpg|thumb|600px|Sun Farm aerial view]] The shaping of the landscape and structures is oriented to solar and celestial alignments, in a dual effort to capture the sun's energy and to celebrate the cosmos. The work unveils as a built philosophical statement of awareness of being in time and part of a system.

The [[Sun]]'s daily path—from sunrise to sunset and its disappearing at night—is represented, literally and metaphorically, by two spirals connected by a ¾ of mile long axis. East Spiral, located at the east end of the axis, represents the day, metaphor of the beginning of human life. Sun Axis stretches in the east–west direction and is defined by photovoltaic panels, linked to the energy grid; it ends in West Spiral, representation of the sunset and night. A naked eye observatory for night stars defines the center of the spiral. Initial constructions—already realized—include: 
* ''East Spiral'', an excavated pond, shaped as a logarithmic spiral and surrounded by a mound; the center of East Spiral represents the Axis Mundi of Sun Farm;
* ''East West'' a geoglyph aligned to an east–west axis;
* ''North Arrow'', a {{convert|24|ft|m|sing=on}} metal sculpture parallel to the Earth axis;
* ''Meditation Path''—a north–south gravel path framed by a tree-trunk arch, with a timber sculpture Time Helix, as focal point;
* ''Time Helix'', a [[helix]] sculpture based on 108 rotations of a timber module;
* ''North-South, East-West, Up-down'', a [[tensegrity]] sculpture aligned to the four cardinal axes; 
* a passive solar house;
* ''Sunrise Trellis'', a structure framing the sunrise at the equinoxes;
* ''Square Field'', a rock and gravel garden based on geometric progression;
* ''Noon Columns'', a {{convert|80|ft|m|sing=on}} long sundial / sculpture;
* ''Solstice Monument: the Helix'', a helix shaped arch, aligned to the sunrise at the winter solstice and the sunset at the summer solstice.
[[Image:Sun farm-sunrise trellis.jpg|thumb|600px|''Sunrise Trellis''framing the Sun path during the Fall equinox]]

''Sun Farm'' is envisioned as an outdoor art center and energy farm, a series of events in a place available to communities as a showcase of alternative energy sources as well as an educational art and nature destination. The viewing of the main artwork—the intersecting spirals path—develops at different layers of perception. Art becomes a participatory event leading to a spiritual experience, where the observer is led by views of the sky in the Sun's daily path/cycle. Walking along the path will provide a different layer of interpretation, as a walking meditation, with a direct experience of the metaphors of spirals / time / sun path / life. 
Sun Farm was inspired by the holistic model of eastern philosophies / practices and the connection with cosmological events which was present in early cultures, where traditional people used interventions in the landscape as a means of interpreting celestial events. 
  
The site of Sun Farm is in the Hudson Valley, a geographic region celebrated in the paintings of the nineteenth century Hudson River School, for its landscapes, dramatic skies, sunrises and sunsets. The framing of the sky created by the structures in Sunset Farm echoes the intention of those paintings and brings a contemporary interpretation to the perception of the landscape.

'''Sydney rock engravings''', or '''Sydney rock art''', are a form of [[Australian Aboriginal]] [[rock art]] in the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] around [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], that consist of carefully drawn images of people, animals, or symbols.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1999. Bedrock notions and isochrestic choice: evidence for localised stylistic patterning in the engravings of the Sydney region. Archaeology in Oceania 34(3): 145-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Many thousands of such engravings are known to exist in the Sydney region, although the locations of most are not publicised to prevent damage by vandalism, and to retain their sanctity, as they are still regarded as sacred sites by [[Indigenous Australians]]. There are two art environments in Sydney Basin, rock shelters and engraving sites.&lt;ref&gt;Basedow, H. 1914. Aboriginal rock carvings of great antiquity in S.A. J. R. Anthropol. Inst., 44, 195–211. &lt;/ref&gt; 

There are 1,500 pieces of Aboriginal art in Sydney, more than half of which contain rock art, and around 1,500 caves or shelters which contain cultural deposit. They are comparable with the [[petroglyphs]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the [[rock art]] found elsewhere in Australia, but have their own distinctive style which is quite unlike rock art found anywhere else in Australia. Dating to around [[4th millennium BC|5,000]] years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/history-culture/2016/03/top-7-aboriginal-rock-art-sites/ Australia's top 7 Aboriginal rock art sites by Australian Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt; with some possibly as old as [[6th millennium BC|7,000 years]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/23/hidden-in-plain-sight-indigenous-australian-rock-art-on-sydneys-doorstep Hidden in plain sight: Indigenous Australian rock art on Sydney's doorstep] by [[The Guardian]] (Author: Brigid Delaney)&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney rock art is predominantly found in [[Ku-ring-gai Council]], [[Sydney Harbour]] and the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]].&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowdler|first=Sandra|title=Balls Head: the excavation of a Port Jackson rock shelter.

==Origins==
[[File:(1)rock carvings Bondi-4.JPG|thumb|220px|Whale carvings in [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]].]]
The engravings were made by the [[Aboriginal Australians]] who have lived in the [[Sydney]] region from about 30,000 years ago until the present day. [[Radiocarbon dating]] suggests human activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years ago. However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought.&lt;ref name=Attenbrow-2010&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Attenbrow | first1= Val | year= 2010 | title= Sydney's Aboriginal Past: Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records | location= Sydney | publisher= UNSW Press | isbn= 978-1-74223-116-7 | pages= 152–153 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TDxldj_SLcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Val%20Attenbrow%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | accessdate= 11 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engravings cannot be dated straightforwardly with contemporary archaeological methods, necessitating the use of indirect dating. The Sydney engravings are of a style known as "simple [[Figurative art|figurative]]", which formulaic archaeology dates to around [[3,000 BC]] and [[4th millennium BC|4,000 BC]], which is contemporaneous to the [[neolithic]] period in [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Flood, 'Rock Art of the Dreamtime',  {{ISBN|0-207-18908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other engravings show [[Europe]]an [[sailing ships]], and so those cannot be more than about 200 years old. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the engravings were sometimes "re-grooved" during ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;David, B., J-M. Geneste, F. Petchey, J-J. Delannoy, B. Barker and M. Eccleston. 2013b. ‘How old are Australia’s pictographs? A Review of Rock Art Dating’. Journal of Archaeological Science 40 (1): 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some engravings appear to show [[thylacine]]s and other mammals which have been extinct in the Sydney region for many thousands of years, and thus can be presumably that old. In support of this, it is true that rock art elsewhere (e.g. [[Kakadu National Park]]) does show extinct animals, and so must be tens of thousands of years old. However, at the moment there is no hard evidence to support these claims for Sydney rock art.&lt;ref&gt;Bednarik, R. G. 1992. ‘A New Method to Date Petroglyphs’. Archaeometry 34 (2): 279–91. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Method of creation==
Examination of the grooves shows that they were made in several stages as follows:

* Presumably, a sketched outline was scratched on to the surface of the rock.
* Then a series of holes was drilled along the line, using a pointed stone or shell, which is possible because the [[Sydney Basin]] [[sandstone]] is relatively soft.
* Finally, the holes were joined by rubbing a sharp stone along the line.

This results in a U-shaped groove which is typically about 2 centimetres deep and 2 centimetres wide. It is easily distinguished from natural grooves in the sandstone, which are usually V-shaped, modern grooves made with steel tools, which are usually narrower and deeper, or those made by bulldozers, which usually have a square section.&lt;ref&gt; McDonald, J. 2008a. Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange. Terra Australis 27. ANU EPress, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;

The grooves were often maintained by "re-grooving" during ceremonies, which complicates attempts at dating them.&lt;ref&gt;Lilley, I. 2006. ‘Archaeology in Oceania: Themes and Issues.’ Archaeology of Oceania: Australia and the Pacific Islands, 1– 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
While their purpose is not known definitively, some educated guesses may be made by analogy with the culture of other indigenous groups who survived into modern times, as follows. Some sites may have been "increase sites", where a ceremony would be held to increase the availability of a food source such as kangaroos or fish. It is thought that most of the sites depicting animals are of this type.

Another group of sites may have been where initiation ceremonies were held, to celebrate and facilitate the transition of a young boy into manhood. In other parts of [[Australia]], we know that an initiation ceremony often involves a ceremonial path from childhood into manhood, and so the lines of steps, or mundoes, may indicate initiation sites. Other sites show "Culture Heroes" or "Ancestral Beings" such as [[Baiame]], who has a striped head-dress and often a striped body, and [[Daramulan]] who has a large club foot and may have been part-emu.

Some sites also show evidence of [[Australian Aboriginal Astronomy|Aboriginal Astronomy]], as the rock's patterns resemble the [[Milky Way]] and this may have been purposed as an astrological guide. It should also be recognised that increase sites, initiation sites, culture-hero sites, and astronomical sites are not necessarily distinct, and one site may fall into any or all of these categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.EmuDreaming.com|title=Aboriginal Astronomy|website=www.emudreaming.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Terrey Hills public.jpg|thumb|220px|Engravings at Terrey Hills in northern Sydney. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an increase ceremony, whilst the well-endowed man may be [[Baiame]].]]
The aboriginal rock engraving sites usually contain images of sacred [[spiritual being]]s, mythical ancestral hero figures, various endemic animals, fish and many footprints. Surrounding the rock engravings, there are art sites, [[burial]] sites, [[cave]]s, marriage areas, men’s areas, women’s areas, birthing areas, [[midden]] sites, stone arrangement sites and tool manufacturing locations.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J.1994. ‘Dreamtime Superhighway: Sydney Basin Rock Art and Prehistoric Information Exchange.’ PhD, Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Les McLeod, a local indigenous guide in [[Hawkesbury, New South Wales|Hawkesbury]] stated, “A lot of Aboriginal people believe they were created from animals – there are engravings here of wallabies, fish and emus”. “Sydney sandstone is easy to engrave but easy to fade. The [[Guringai]] people would have visited a couple of times a year to re-engrave it.” In some small cave on the water’s edge, there are ochre [[hand stencil]]s from a group of Guringai men (and from a smaller handprint, a minor). The stencils would have been a way of letting other members of the clan know that this cave or ledge is a safe place to dwell in. Rock paintings of a fish just above the water line signaled to others that fish could be found at this area. The majority (97%) of the etched motifs are
outline only. The only systematically infilled engravings are [[culture hero]]es which are usually decorated with a number of pecked lines of dots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboriginalheritage.org/sites/identification/ Identifying Aboriginal Sites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Shelters with art are characterised by stencil art or [[charcoal]]. Stencil is created by mixing [[ochre]] in the mouth and then into a wet paste, where it is sprayed over the object to be stencilled onto the wall of the shelter. Other forms of artwork include ochre paintings, charcoal drawings and etchings. Rock painting illustration usually feature humans, kangaroos, emus, echidnas, grid patterns, animal tracks, boomerangs, axes, hand stencils, among others. Black is the frequent colour used in Sydney, accounting for 46.2% of the pigment art. Followed by white (34.6%), red (16.6%) and yellow (2.8%). There are also a number of grinding grooves located throughout the general Sydney area.  Burial sites are present throughout the Sydney region, and many have been found over the past years in middens and within shelters. &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. 1998. Shelter art in the Sydney Basin - a space-time continuum: exploring different influences on stylistic change. In C. Chippindale &amp; P. Taçon (eds) Rock Art: New Directions in Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock engravings in Sydney would usually feature fish, animals, humans, wooden artefacts, and mythological beings. Stone quarries are sites where Aboriginals accumulate types of [[stone]] for the manufacturing of tools, ceremonial and sacred items. The majority of the fine stone flakes and tools recovered in the local area would have been traded from other areas such as the north coast, [[Hunter Valley]], and the [[Nepean River]]. [[Water well|Dug wells]] in the Sydney region were used by the local tribe to sharpen tools and also as a source of fresh [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F. D., 1956. Rock engravings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury District. Part 1: Flat Rocks Ridge: a Daruk ceremonial ground. Records of the Australian Museum 24(5): 37–58, plates 3–6. [23 November 1956].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 2,000 rock engraving sites, which are usually located on highly elevated, smooth and flat surfaces. More than half of the engraving sites (55.9%) are located on ridgelines. Hillside locations are the next most frequent (41.2%), while [[valley]] bottoms are comparatively rare (2.8%). The average distance to drinking water from any engraving site in the region is 650m and the maximum distance is approximately 3km. The minimum distance is 2m (rock wells or creeks).&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, F. D. 1959. ‘Rock Engravings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury District (Part 2): Some Important Ritual Groups in the County of Cumberland’. Records of the Australian Museum 24 (14): 203–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock art within Sydney is found in these locations:

== History ==
[[File:Eslogantecnópolis.jpg|thumb|''Say present (the word "presente" means "here" and "present" at the same time in this sentence), looking at the future'' Technopolis slogan]]
Initially, Technopolis was scheduled to be held in [[Buenos Aires]] after the [[Argentina Bicentennial]] celebrations.

The mega exhibition was planned to be the end of the Bicentennial celebrations organized by the national government in 2010, and inaugurated on November 19, 2010 in Buenos Aires for the "Day of Sovereignty", the anniversary of the [[Battle of Vuelta de Obligado]], in the area of parks of the [[Avenida Figueroa Alcorta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2010, [[List of mayors and chiefs of government of Buenos Aires|the Chief of Government of Buenos Aires]], [[Mauricio Macri]], denied authorization in such plots as the transport system would collapse in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2010/10/20/noticia_0012.html 
|title= Macri did not authorize the national government to make a presentation on Figueroa Alcorta 
|language= Spanish 
|work= Diario Perfil
|accessdate=July 20, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the national government decided to relocate the mega exhibition in an area of fifty hectares in the [[Province of Buenos Aires]], located in [[Villa Martelli]], [[Vicente López, Buenos Aires|Vicente López]], at the former barracks of Army Battalion 601.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These take the visitors to different aspects and practices of the past, present and future Argentinean scientist. To make this historical review educational, there is a timeline with milestones expressed in posters of local achievements in the world of science.

The exhibit also features discussions and scientific presentations to the public in general, some of the scientists involved are Vicente Barros, Nora Sabelli, Gonzalo Zabala, Alberto Saal, Sebastian Kadena, Roberto Etchenique, Lino Barañao, Ariel Arbiser, among others.

One mile of track was installed on the property, providing access to a train that runs the exhibition from one extreme to another. The rolling stock in use on the line is a [[railbus]] manufactured by the Argentine company [[TecnoTren]]. It has the same body of a bus, is lightweight, requires special way, and uses an automatic gearbox and diesel engine. Currently, this model is used in various parts of the country as a regular service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The House of the Dead''''' ({{lang-ru|Записки из Мёртвого дома}}, ''Zapiski iz Myortvogo doma'') is a semi-autobiographical [[novel]] published in 1860–2&lt;ref&gt;The first part was published in 1860 and the second one in 1862. The novel's first complete appearance was in book form in 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; in the journal ''[[Vremya (magazine)|Vremya]]''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Frank, Introduction to The House of the Dead and Poor Folk, Barnes and Noble, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; by Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], which portrays the life of convicts in a [[Siberia]]n prison camp. The novel has also been published under the titles '''''Memoirs from the House of The Dead''''', '''''Notes from the Dead House''''' (or '''''Notes from a Dead House'''''), and '''''Notes from the House of the Dead'''''. The book is a loosely-knit collection of facts, events and [[philosophy|philosophical]] discussion organised by "theme" rather than as a continuous story. Dostoevsky himself spent four years in exile in such a camp following his conviction for involvement in the [[Petrashevsky Circle]]. This experience allowed him to describe with great authenticity the conditions of prison life and the characters of the convicts.

==Background==
After his [[mock execution]] on 22 December 1849, Dostoevsky's life was spared in exchange for four years of imprisonment in one of Siberia’s ''[[katorga]]'' labor camps. Though he often was met with hostility from the other prisoners due to his noble status of ''[[dvoryanin]]'', his views on life changed. After his time in the camps Dostoevsky returned to write ''The House of the Dead''. The novel incorporates several of the horrifying experiences he witnessed while in prison. He recalls the guards’ brutality and relish performing unspeakably cruel acts, the crimes that the convicted criminals committed, and the fact that blended amid these great brutes were good and decent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"Fyodor Dostoevsky." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 23 Oct.2011&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he is also astonished at the convicts’ abilities to commit murders without the slightest change in conscience. It was a stark contrast with his own heightened sensitivity. During this time in prison he began experiencing the epileptic seizures that would plague him for the rest of his life. ''House of the Dead'' led Dostoevsky to include the theme of murder in his later works, a theme not found in any of his works preceding ''House of the Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;Dostoyevsky, Fedor. ''Memoirs From the House of the Dead''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, has been sentenced to penalty deportation to Siberia and ten years of hard labour for murdering  his wife. Life in prison is particularly hard for Aleksandr Petrovich, since he is a "gentleman" and suffers the malice of the other prisoners, nearly all of whom belong to the peasantry. Gradually Goryanchikov overcomes his revulsion at his situation and his fellow convicts, undergoing a [[spiritual awakening|spiritual re-awakening]] that culminates with his release from the camp.  It is a work of great humanity; Dostoevsky portrays the inmates of the prison with sympathy for their plight, and also expresses admiration for their energy, ingenuity and talent. He concludes that the existence of the prison, with its absurd practices and savage corporal punishments is a tragic fact, both for the prisoners and for Russia.

==Characters==
Many of the characters in the novel were very similar to the real-life people that Dostoevsky met while in prison. While many of the characters do mirror real-life people, he has also made some of the characters appear more interesting than their real-life counterparts.

==Reception==
''The House of the Dead'' was Dostoevsky’s only work that [[Leo Tolstoy]] revered.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rayfield |first1=Donald |title=The House of the Dead by Daniel Beer review – was Siberia hell on earth? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/house-of-dead-siberian-exile-under-tsars-daniel-beer-review |accessdate=24 August 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=29 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Sorcerer''' is one name for an enigmatic [[cave painting]] found in the cavern known as 'The Sanctuary' at the [[Cave of the Trois-Frères]], [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]], [[France]], made around 13,000 BC. The figure's significance is unknown, but it is usually interpreted as some kind of great spirit or [[master of animals]]. The unusual nature of The Sanctuary's decoration may also reflect the practice of magical ceremonies in the chamber.&lt;ref name = Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/606267/Trois-Freres#ref=ref893311|title=Trois Frères - cave, Ariège, France|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his sketches of the cave art, [[Henri Breuil]] drew a horned humanoid torso and the publication of this drawing in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;Henri Breuil, ''Quatre cent siècles d'art paiétal'' (Montignac, 1954, p. 166 (Mary E. Boyle, tr., as ''Four Hundred centuries of Cave Art'', London: Zwemmer, 1952); Breuil, ''Les Cavernes du Volp'', 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; influenced many subsequent theories about the figure.&lt;ref&gt;As S. G. F. Brandon expressed it in 1959, "it seems to be generally agreed that this picture of the 'Dancing Sorcerer' was a [[cult object]] of great significance to the community which used the cave." (S. G. F. Brandon, "The Ritual Perpetuation of the Past" ''Numen'' '''6'''.2 (April 1959:112-129) p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Breuil's sketch has also come under criticism in recent years.&lt;ref name="hutton"&gt;Hutton, Ronald ''Witches, Druids, Arthur''. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A single prominent human figure is unusual in the cave paintings of the [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic]], where the great majority of representations are of animals.

== Breuil's drawing ==
[[Henri Breuil]] asserted that the cave painting represented a shaman or magician — an interpretation which gives the image its name — and described the image he drew in these terms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Margaret Murray]] having seen the published drawing called Breuil's image 'the first depiction of a deity on earth', an idea which Breuil and others later adopted.

His views held sway in the field for much of the 20th century, but they have since been largely superseded.&lt;ref name = Britannica/&gt;

Breuil's image has been commonly interpreted as a [[shaman]] performing a ritual to ensure good hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams ''The Shamans of Prehistory: Trance and Magic in the Painted Caves''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Certain modern scholars question the validity of Breuil's sketch, claiming that modern photographs do not show the famous antlers. [[Ronald Hutton]] theorized that Breuil was fitting the evidence to support his hunting-magic theory of cave-art, citing that "the figure drawn by Breuil is not the same as the one actually painted on the cave wall." Hutton's theory led him to conclude that reliance on Breuil's initial sketch resulted in many later scholars erroneously claiming that "The Sorcerer" was evidence that the concept of a [[Horned God]] dated back to Paleolithic times.&lt;ref name="hutton"/&gt; Likewise, [[Peter Ucko]] concluded that inaccuracies in the drawing were caused by Breuil's working in dim gas-light, in awkward circumstances, and that he had mistaken cracks in the rock surface for man-made marks.&lt;ref&gt;Ucko, P, (1992). Subjectivity and the recording of Palaeolithic Cave Art, in T Shay &amp; J Clottes (eds), The Limitations of Archaeological Knowledge, 141-180. Liege: University of Liege Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views have also been questioned, noting that "The Sorcerer" is composed of both charcoal drawings and etching within the stone itself. Details, such as etching, are often difficult to view from photographs due to their size and the quality of the light source. Particularly celebrated prehistorian [[Jean Clottes]] asserts that Breuil's sketch is accurate ('I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years').&lt;ref name="Cave Art Cobblers?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/07/06/cave-art-cobblers/|title=Cave Art Cobblers? - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=6 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing influence==
The general assessment has placed the figure as central to an understanding of cave art: as S.G.F. Brandon expressed it in 1959, "it seems to be generally agreed that this picture of the 'Dancing Sorcerer' was a [[cult object]] of great significance to the community which used the cave."&lt;ref&gt;S.G.F. Brandon, "The Ritual Perpetuation of the Past" ''Numen'' '''6'''.2 (April 1959:112-129) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
Breuil's interpretation of the drawing as a shaman strongly influenced writer [[Pat Mills]] in the creation of the Lord Weird Slough Feg, a sorcerer, god, and early antagonist of the ongoing comic book title [[Sláine (comics)|Slaine]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins" (two-page text article), ''2000 AD'' #352, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[The Story of B]]'' by [[Daniel Quinn]] includes an interpretation of the painting as an expression of late Paleolithic animism, a symbol for the human sense of identity with other animal life.

'''''The Turkish Bath''''' ('''''{{Lang|fr|Le Bain turc}}''''') is an [[oil painting]] by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], initially completed between 1852 and 1859, but modified in 1862.&lt;ref name=Louvre&gt;{{cite web|title=The Turkish Bath|website=Louvre|url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/turkish-bath|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts a group of nude women at a pool in a [[harem]].&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt; It has an [[erotic art|erotic style]] that evokes both the [[Near East]] and earlier western styles associated with [[Greek mythology in western art and literature|mythological subject matter]]. The painting expands on a number of motifs that Ingres had explored in earlier paintings,&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt; in particular ''[[The Valpinçon Bather]]'' (1808) and ''La [[Grande odalisque]]'' (1814).

The work is signed and dated 1862, when Ingres was around 82 years old.&lt;ref name=Rosenblum126&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Rosenblum|author-first=Robert|chapter=Ingres's Portraits and their Muses|editor1-last=Tinterow|editor1-first=Gary|editor2-last=Conisbee|editor2-first=Philip|title=Portraits by Ingres: Image of an Epoch|location=New York|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=1999|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; He altered the original rectangular format and changed the painting to a [[Tondo (Art)|tondo]]. A photograph of its original state, taken by [[Charles Marville]], survives.&lt;ref name=Rosenblum128&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Rosenblum|author-first=Robert|chapter=Ingres's Portraits and their Muses|editor1-last=Tinterow|editor1-first=Gary|editor2-last=Conisbee|editor2-first=Philip|title=Portraits by Ingres: Image of an Epoch|location=New York|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=1999|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - La Baigneuse Valpinçon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[The Valpinçon Bather]]'', 1808. [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]], Paris.]]
[[Image:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''La [[Grande odalisque]]'', 1814. Musée du Louvre, Paris.]]
[[File:Ingres Femme aux trois bras.jpg|thumb|180px|''Woman with Three Arms'' (Study for ''The Turkish Bath''. [[Musée Ingres]], Montauban.]]
The painting is known for its subtle colourisation, especially the very pale skin of the women resting in the privacy of a bathing area. The figures are given an almost abstract and "slender and sinuous" form,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and seem at times to lack skeleton. They are arranged in a very harmonious, circular manner, a curved  arrangement that heightens the eroticism of the painting. Its charge is in part achieved through the use of motifs that include the implied haze of Oriental perfume, and the inclusion of vases, running water, fruit and jewels, as well as a palette that ranges from pale white to pink, ivory, light greys and a variety of browns.&lt;ref name=Magi50&gt;{{cite book|last=Magi|first=Giovanna|title=The Grand Louvre and the Musée D'Orsay|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|date=1998|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingres relished the irony of producing an erotic work in his old age, painting an inscription of his age (&lt;small&gt;''AETATIS LXXXII''&lt;/small&gt;, "at age 82") on the work—in 1867 he told others that he still retained "all the fire of a man of thirty years".&lt;ref name=HagenHagen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hagen|first1=Rose-Marie|last2=Hagen|first2=Rainer|title=Les dessous des chefs-d'oeuvre|location=Köln|publisher=Verlag Taschen|date=2000|pages=410–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pach&gt;{{cite book|last=Pach|first=Walter|title=Ingres|location=New York|publisher=Hacker Art Books|date=1973|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not paint this work from live models, but from [[croquis]] and several of his earlier paintings, reusing "bather" and "[[odalisque]]" figures he had drawn or painted as single figures on beds or beside a bath.

The figure from ''[[The Valpinçon Bather]]'' appears almost identically as the central element of the later composition, but now plays a [[mandolin]]. The woman in the background with her arm extended and holding a cup resembles the sitter in his portrait of [[Madame Moitessier]] (1856). The face of the woman with her arms raised above her head in the near right is similar to a ''croquis'' (1818) of the artist's wife, Delphine Ramel,&lt;ref name=Rosenblum128/&gt; though her right shoulder is lowered while her right arm is raised. The other bodies are juxtaposed in various unlit areas behind them.

Ingres drew from a wide variety of painterly sources, including 19th-century academic art, [[Neoclassicism]] and late [[Mannerism]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The colourisation is one of "chastising coolness", while figures merge into each other in a manner that evokes sexuality, but ultimately is intended to show Ingres's skill at defying rational perspective.&lt;ref name=Rosenblum128/&gt;

==Orientalist influences==
Ingres was influenced by the contemporary fashion for [[Orientalism]], relaunched by Napoleon's [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|invasion of Egypt]]. On leaving for Italy in 1806, he copied in his notebooks a text extolling "the baths of the seraglio of Mohammed", in which can be read a description of a harem where one "goes into a room surrounded by sofas [...] and it is there that many women destined for this use attend the sultana in the bath, wiping her handsome body and rubbing the softest perfumes into her skin; it is there that she must then take a voluptuous rest".&lt;ref name=HagenHagen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue de l'exposition du Louvre: Le Bain turc d'Ingres|location=Paris|date=1971|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La grande piscine de brousse.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], ''Women at a Bath'', Salon of 1885. Hermitage, St. Petersburg]]
In 1825, he copied a passage from ''Letters from the Orient'' by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], who had accompanied her British diplomat husband to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1716. Her letters had been re-published eight times in France alone between 1763 and 1857,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} adding to the Orientalist craze. The passage Ingres copied was entitled "Description of the women's bath at [[Adrianople]]" and reads: "I believe there were two hundred women there in all. Beautiful naked women in various poses... some conversing, others at their work, others drinking coffee or tasting a [[sorbet]], and many stretched out nonchalantly, whilst their slaves (generally ravishing girls of 17 or 18 years) plaited their hair in fantastical shapes."&lt;ref name=HagenHagen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Montagu&gt;{{cite book|last=Montagu|first=Lady Mary|title=L'islam au péril des femmes, une Anglaise en Turquie au XVIIe siècle|location=Paris|date=1981|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment of ''The Turkish Bath'', however, bears little resemblance to the public bathing described by Lady Montagu.&lt;ref name=Yeazell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeazell|first=Ruth Bernard|title=Public Baths and Private Harems: Lady Mary Worley Montagu and the Origins of Ingres's ''Bain Turc''|journal=Yale Journal of Criticism|volume=7|number=1|date=Spring 1994|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[Eugène Delacroix]], who visited an Algerian harem, Ingres never travelled to Africa or the Middle East, and the courtesans shown are more Caucasian and European than Middle Eastern or African in appearance. For Ingres the oriental theme was above all a pretext for portraying the female nude in a passive and sexual context. Exotic elements are few and far between in the image: musical instruments, a [[censer]] and a few ornaments.

==Provenance==
The painter's first buyer was a relation of [[Napoleon III]], but he handed it back some days later, his wife having found it "unsuitable" ("peu convenable").&lt;ref name=HagenHagen/&gt; It was purchased in 1865 by [[Khalil Bey]], a former Turkish diplomat who added it to his collection of erotic paintings.&lt;ref name=Haskill&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haskill|first=Francis|title=A Turk and His Pictures in Nineteenth-Century Paris|journal=Oxford Art Review|volume=5|number=1|date=1982|pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Degas]] demanded that ''The Turkish Bath'' be shown at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)]], in the wake of which came contrasting reactions: [[Paul Claudel]], for example, compared it to a "cake full of maggots".&lt;ref name=HagenHagen/&gt; At the start of the 20th century, patrons wished to offer ''The Turkish Bath'' to the Louvre, but the museum's council refused it twice.&lt;ref name=Hagen2&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Hagen|author1-first=Rose-Marie|author2-last=Hagen|author2-first=Rainer|title=What Great Paintings Say|location=Köln|publisher=Taschen GmbH|date=2003|volume=1|page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the national collections of [[Munich]] offered to buy it, the Louvre finally accepted it in 1911,&lt;ref name=Hagen2/&gt; thanks to a gift by the Société des Amis du Louvre, to whom the patron [[Maurice Fenaille]] made a three-year interest-free loan of 150,000 Francs for the purpose.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The '''Three Friends of Winter''', also known as '''''Suihan Sanyou''''', is an art motif that comprises the [[pine]], [[bamboo]], and [[Plum blossom|plum]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese symbols|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Chinese_symbols_1109.pdf|publisher=British Museum|page=1|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese observed that the pine, bamboo and plum do not wither as the cold days deepen into the winter season unlike many other plants.&lt;ref name=npm-intro/&gt; Known by them as the ''Three Friends of Winter'', they entered the conventions of East Asian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Friends of Winter|url=http://www.colby.edu/art/InkTales/Bowdoin%20Exhibition%20Pages/BEThreeFriendsWinter.html|publisher=Colby College|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultivating Virtue: Botanical Motifs and Symbols in East Asian Art|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/exhibitions/past/detail.dot?id=19111|publisher=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they symbolize steadfastness, perseverance, and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dusenbury|first=Mary|title=Flowers, dragons and pine trees: Asian textiles in the Spencer Museum of Art|year=2004|publisher=Hudson Hills Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55595-238-9|page=248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=566AlluiHT0C|edition=Bier, Carol; Foresman, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are highly regarded in [[Confucianism]] and as such represent the scholar-gentleman's ideal.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=welch-three/&gt;

==History==
The Three Friends of Winter are common in works of Chinese art&lt;ref name="welch20"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese art: a guide to motifs and visual imagery|year=2008|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|location=North Clarendon|isbn=978-0-8048-3864-1|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sgO9BuZQSEC|last=Welch|first=Patricia Bjaaland}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those cultures influenced by it. The three are first recorded as appearing together in a ninth-century poem by the poet Zhu Qingyu (朱慶餘) of the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name=welch-three/&gt; The [[Culture of the Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]] artist Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c. 1199–1264), among others of the time, made this grouping popular in painting.&lt;ref name=welch-three&gt;{{cite book|last=Welch|first=Patricia Bjaaland|title=Chinese art: A guide to motifs and visual imagery|year=2008|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|location=North Clarendon|isbn=978-0-8048-3864-1|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sgO9BuZQSEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The actual term "Three Friends of Winter" can be traced back to the earliest known mention in literature, the ''Record of the Five-cloud Plum Cottage'' (五雲梅舍記) from ''The Clear Mountain Collection'' (霽山集) by the Song dynasty writer Lin Jingxi (林景熙, 1242–1310):&lt;ref name=npm-intro&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Friends of Winter: Paintings of Pine, Plum, and Bamboo from the Museum Collection (Introduction)|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh91/3friends/english/infor.htm|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zh-npm-intro&gt;{{cite web|title=歲寒三友|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh91/3friends/chinese/infor.htm|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''"For his residence, earth was piled to form a hill and a hundred plum trees, which along with lofty pines and tall bamboo comprise the friends of winter, were planted."''&lt;ref name=npm-intro/&gt;
:即其居累土為山，種梅百本，與喬松，脩篁為歲寒友。&lt;ref name=zh-npm-intro/&gt;

==Cultural symbolism==
[[File:Bian Wenjin, Three Friends and a Hundred Birds.jpg|thumb|''Three Friends and a Hundred Birds'' by [[Bian Jingzhao|Bian Wenjin]], Ming dynasty]]
Culturally, the ''Three Friends of Winter''—[[pine]], [[Bamboo#In Asian culture|bamboo]], and [[Prunus mume#Cultural significance|plum]]—are grouped together in the context of winter because they all flourish at that season.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; For this reason they are commonly known as the ''Three Friends of Winter''.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;  They are also referred to simply by their linked names: ''Song Zhu Mei''  (松竹梅) in Chinese, transliterated as ''Sho Chiku Bai'' in Japanese (literally "pine, bamboo, plum").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Qiu|first=Peipei|title=Basho and the Dao: The Zhuangzi and the transformation of Haikai|year=2005|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-2845-5|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OolnFbgs_IC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Korean poem by Kim Yuki (1580–1658), the three friends are brought together in order to underline the paradoxical contrast:
:Peach and plum of springtime, don't flaunt your pretty blossoms;
:Consider rather the old pine and green bamboo at year's end.
:What can change these noble stems and their flourishing evergreen?&lt;ref&gt;''The Bamboo Grove'', ed. and trans. Richard Rutt, University of California Press 1971, poem 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, they are particularly associated with the start of the Lunar New Year, appearing on greeting cards and as a design stamped into seasonal sweets.&lt;ref&gt;''Bamboo in Japan'' Nancy Moore Bess and Bibi Wein, Kodansha International 2001, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8842">'''Tour promoters'''   (also known as '''concert promoters''' or talent buyers) are the individuals or companies responsible for organizing a live [[concert tour]] or special event performance. The tour promoter makes an offer of employment to a particular artist, usually through the artist’s [[talent agent|agent]] or [[music manager]]. The promoter and agent then negotiate the live performance [[contract]]. The majority of live performance contracts are drawn up using the [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) standard contract format known as the ''AFM Performance Agreement''.

==Services==
Included among the tour promoter’s various job responsibilities are: (1) obtaining [[Music venue|venue]], [[concert hall]], [[theater]], [[nightclub]] or [[arena]] bookings; (2) pricing the event or tour; and (3) providing air, sea or land [[transportation]] (optional). However the promoter must have upfront cash and or [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] financing to pay for advertising the tours of the artists. Such advertising costs, usually referred to as a Media or Promotional Kit, commonly include [[television]] and radio [[advertisement]]s, [[poster]]s, [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] adverts, [[online marketing]] and so on.

==Promoter compensation==
There are no figures available concerning how much an average concert promoter makes annually. Like most [[music industry]] professions, compensation depends on the level of success possessed by the artist the promoter works with, location, and what a given market will bear. The promoter assumes all the financial risk in putting on a show, so compensation also depends on how successful the promoter is at negotiating with [[Distributor (business)|vendors]] and creating sold-out shows. Additionally, in-depth knowledge of their operating market and audience characteristics are critical success factors for any tour promoter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry overview==
The rise of large corporation mega-promoters over the past ten years has made it much more difficult for aspiring tour promoters to break into the industry. [[Live Nation]] (previously known as [[Clear Channel Entertainment]]) is the number one concert promoter in the world according to figures released by ''Pollstar Magazine'' in 2006. The [[Beverly Hills, California]]-based corporation accounted for about $1.3 billion in concert [[box-office]] sales during 2005, according to [[Billboard magazine]]'s tracking. [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] ([[AEG Live]]) was ranked second with $417 million, followed by [[House of Blues]] (HOB Entertainment) at number three with $245 million. On July 5, 2006, Live Nation purchased HOB Entertainment for $350 million, further expanding their market share in the live-music business.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/media/06music.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Big Promoter of Concerts to Acquire House of Blues], ''[[New York Times]]''. July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

While average ticket prices jumped to roughly $57 in 2005, the number of tickets sold for the 100 biggest tours dipped 3.5%, to 36.3 million.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; Some fans have complained to government officials, particularly after they found tickets to the same concerts or sporting events available - sometimes at many times the face value - on secondary sellers like Stubhub.com and TicketsNow minutes after the public sale began. After hearing from some would-be ticket buyers, the [[Missouri]] [[attorney general]] announced the state was suing three ticket resellers on charges they violated state consumer protection laws. That same day, the [[Arkansas]] attorney general said he was seeking documents from five resellers. And the attorney general’s office in [[Pennsylvania]] is also looking into the ticket sale business after receiving several hundred complaints over the recent sale of tickets for a [[Hannah Montana]] concert in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/business/06money.html?scp=9&amp;sq=concert&amp;st=nyt In the Race to Buy Concert Tickets, Fans Keep Losing], ''[[New York Times]]''. October 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Nation and Ticketmaster===
On December 21, 2007, Live Nation announced it would acquire the software and services to ramp up its ticket-selling operation, potentially positioning the company to compete directly with its longtime contractor, [[Ticketmaster]].&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/business/21music.html?scp=1&amp;sq=concert&amp;st=nyt Top Concert Promoter Sets Up a Challenge to Ticketmaster] ''[[New York Times]]''. December 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Live Nation, the largest concert promoter, and Ticketmaster Entertainment, the No. 1 ticket seller, announced merger on February 10, 2009.  Then on January 25, 2010 the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] approved the merger with terms that include that Ticketmaster sell Paciolan, its ticketing and software services unit, to Comcast's sports and entertainment firm or "another buyer suitable to the department."

Ticketmaster must also license its software to [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG), the company’s largest customer. With a copy of the Ticketmaster software, AEG will be able to market an attractive ticketing system to venues, according to the DOJ; under the settlement terms, both companies will be able to compete head-to-head with Ticketmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reagan|first=Gillian|title=Ticketmaster And Live Nation Get Approval As One Giant Music Monster |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ticketmaster-and-livenation-get-approval-as-one-giant-music-ticket-monster-2010-1#ixzz1PenCQbOG|work=Business Insider|accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College concert market===
Colleges can provide "dedicated fans, an excellent testing ground, eager workers, [and] loyal fans."  The college market provides a network of new potential fans that artists, labels, agents, and managers could focus on for promotion.  The major record labels have departments dedicated to college promotion and hire students as representatives for all the artists on these labels.  [[Sony Music Entertainment]] has a college marketing department, which promotes records released by Sony and by their independent label affiliates.  Other music marketing companies such as Cornerstone Promotion focus on college marketing.  Cornerstone Promotion hires representatives from colleges all around the country to implement small scale marketing campaigns on their campuses.  
Artists began breaking into the college market in the 1990s.  [[Billboard Magazine]] published articles dating back to the early-mid nineties urging artists and agents to take advantage of the college market.  Artists such as [[Dave Matthews Band]] and R.E.M. played college shows to increase their presence in the college market in the nineties.  Billboard Magazine has emphasized the extent to which college concerts can help an artist in multiple articles.

==Education==
There are numerous degree programs and academic courses focusing on concert promotion and venue management. Some of these are full degree programs, while others are certificates offered for post-graduate studies. For example, [[New York University]] offers a Certificate in Meeting, Conference, and Event Management, and a Certificate in Sports Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scps.nyu.edu/departments/department.jsp?deptId=21 New York University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010063335/http://www.scps.nyu.edu/departments/department.jsp?deptId=21 |date=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whitehall farces''' were a series of five long-running comic stage plays at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in London, presented by the [[actor-manager]] [[Brian Rix]], in the 1950s and 1960s. They were in the [[low comedy]] tradition of British [[farce]], following the [[Aldwych farce]]s, which played at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] between 1924 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Benedict. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/theater/theater-england-s-endless-love-affair-with-farce.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "Theater; England's Endless Love Affair with Farce"], ''The New York Times'', 30 August 1987, 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The farces; critical reception===
The five farces were as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-

|}

Rix built a company of regular players who appeared in some or all of these shows. They included [[Leo Franklyn]], Larry Noble, Dennis Ramsden and [[Derek Royle]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; and members of Rix's family: his wife, [[Elspet Gray]], his sister, [[Sheila Mercier]] and his brother-in-law, Peter Mercier. Others who appeared in one or more of the Whitehall farces include [[Terry Scott]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaye, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Rix starred in all five plays, in a range of roles: a "gormless recruit" to the army in ''Reluctant Heroes'';&lt;ref&gt;"Whitehall Theatre", ''The Times'', 13 September 1950, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; a timidly crooked [[bookie]]'s runner in ''Dry Rot'';&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; a street musician recruited as a secret agent in ''Simple Spymen'';&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; four identical brothers in ''One For the Pot'';&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and a harassed civil servant in ''Chase Me, Comrade''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Dry Rot'' onwards, Rix and his authors developed a double act for the Rix characters and those played by Leo Franklyn, in which the two performers played off one another rather as [[Ralph Lynn]] and [[Tom Walls]] had done in the Aldwych farces of the previous generation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 58, 77 and 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the five plays had long runs and packed houses, most London critics were snobbishly dismissive of them. Looking back in 1980, [[Michael Coveney]] wrote of the Whitehall farces, "A tradition of critical snobbery has grown up around these plays, partly because they were so blatantly popular but chiefly because of our conviction that farce, unless written by a Frenchman, is an inferior theatrical species. Once the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] has done its duty by [[J.B. Priestley|Priestley]] and [[Terence Rattigan|Rattigan]] and others teetering on the brink of theatrical respectability I suggest they employ Mr. Rix … to investigate the ignored riches of English farce between [[Ben Travers|Travers]] and [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]]."&lt;ref&gt;Coveney, Michael. "Simple Spymen", ''[[The Financial Times]]'', 11 August 1980, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The few London critics of the 1950s and 1960s who did not take a lofty view included [[Harold Hobson]], Ronald Bryden, J. W. Lambert and [[Alan Dent]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television broadcasts; later productions===
In addition to the five long-running farces, Rix presented a series of more than eighty one-off televised comedies, some of them farces, for the [[BBC]]. The first was transmitted live from the Whitehall Theatre in January 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Rix, Brian. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/07/whitehall-farces-tv-theatre-relationship "The Whitehall farces had a major role in the TV-theatre relationship"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There were also film versions of ''[[Reluctant Heroes]]'' (1951), ''[[Dry Rot (film)|Dry Rot]]'' (1956), and ''Chase Me, Comrade'', which was renamed ''[[Not Now, Comrade]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/reluctant-heroes-107563/cast |title=Reluctant Heroes (1951) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{IMDb title|0155104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/cdc65/dry-rot |title=Dry Rot &amp;#124; Film review and movie reviews |work=Radio Times |date=2013-04-08 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkonair.com/features/2013/05/09/not-now-comrade/|title=Networkonair &gt; Features  &gt; Not Now Comrade|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, having been unable to secure the lease of the Whitehall Theatre, Rix took his company on tour in ''Chase Me, Comrade'' and ''Bang, Bang Beirut'' (later retitled ''Stand By Your Bedouin''), by Cooney and Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Later productions by the Rix company at the [[Garrick Theatre]] and elsewhere included ''Uproar in the House'', by [[Anthony Marriott]] and Alistair Foot (1967); ''Let Sleeping Wives Lie'' by Harold Brooke and Kay Bannerman (1967); ''She's Done It Again'', by [[Michael Pertwee]] (1969); ''Don't Just Lie There, Say Something'' (Pertwee, 1971); and ''A Bit Between the Teeth'' (Pertwee, 1974). According to Leslie Smith in a study of modern British farce, although some of the Rix productions after ''Chase Me, Comrade'' achieved substantial success, none of them had the conspicuously long runs of the five Whitehall farces.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Rix returned to the Whitehall with Fringe Benefits (Churchill and Cooney)  which ran until 1977 when he retired from the stage.

'''"Yusuf and Zulaikha"''' (the English transliteration of both names varies greatly) refers to a medieval Islamic version of the story of the prophet [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar's wife]] which has been told and retold countless times in many languages spoken in [[Muslim world]], such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. Its most famous version was written in Persian language by [[Jami]] (1414-1492), in his [[Haft Awrang]] ("Seven Thrones").  The story has by then many elaborations, and is capable of a [[Sufi]] interpretation, where Zulaikha's longing for Yusuf represents the soul's quest for God.

== Other versions of the story ==
Other writers to have retold the story include: [[Mahmud Gami]] ([[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]). It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]].

There exists as well a long poem on the subject, titled as Yusuf and Zalikha, which used to be attributed to [[Ferdowsi]], the great Persian poet of the tenth and eleventh century, however, the scholars have rejected this book based on its low quality and the time line of Ferdowsi's life.&lt;ref&gt;'Yusuf and Zalikha: The Biblical Legend of Joseph and Potiphar's Wife in the Persian Version Ascribed to Abul-Mansur Qasim, Called Firdausi, ca. 932-1021 A.D.,' Edited by Hermann Ethé, Philo Press, Amsterdam, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yousuf and Zulaikha in Asia ==
As in many other [[Muslim]] countries, the narrative of the epic love of Yousuf and Zulaikha was covered in classic literary works of [[East Bengal]] (modern day [[Bangladesh]]): in the 14th century A.D. (during the reign of [[Sultan]] [[Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah]]), [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] wrote in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] a version of ''[[Yusuf-Zulekha]]'' which is considered one of the greatest literary works of medieval "golden era" of [[Bengali literature]].
