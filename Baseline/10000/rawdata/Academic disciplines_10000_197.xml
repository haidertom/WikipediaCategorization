The '''American Association of Physics Teachers''' ('''AAPT''') was founded in 1930 for the purpose of "dissemination of knowledge of physics, particularly by way of teaching."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ About AAPT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 10,000 members that reside in over 30 countries. AAPT publications include two [[peer-reviewed journal]]s, the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Physics Teacher]]''. The association has two annual National Meetings (winter and summer) and has regional sections with their own meetings and organization. The association also offers grants and awards for physics educators, including the Richtmyer Memorial Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/richtmyer.cfm Richtmeyer Memorial Award, AAPT website]&lt;/ref&gt; and programs and contests for physics educators and students. It is headquartered at the American Center for Physics in [[College Park, Maryland]].

==History==
The American Association of Physics Teachers was founded on December 31, 1930, when forty-five physicists held a meeting during the joint [[American Physical Society|APS]]-AAAS meeting in Cleveland specifically for that purpose.

The AAPT became a founding member of the [[American Institute of Physics]] after the other founding members were convinced of the stability of the AAPT itself after a new constitution for the AAPT was agreed upon.

==Contests==
The AAPT sponsors a number of competitions. The [[Physics Bowl]], [[Six Flags]]' [[roller coaster]] contest, and the US Physics Team are just a few. The US physics team is determined by two preliminary exams and a week and a half long "boot camp." Each year, five members are selected to compete against dozens of countries in the [[International Physics Olympiad]] (IPHO).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art critics]] usually criticise art in the context of [[aesthetics]] or the theory of beauty.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; A goal of art criticism is the pursuit of a rational basis for art appreciation&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; but it is questionable whether such criticism can transcend prevailing socio-political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marty.  [http://www.jewishjournal.com/marty_kaplan/article/the_curious_case_of_criticism "The curious case of criticism."] ''Jewish Journal''.  23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of [[Art movement|artistic movements]] has resulted in a division of art criticism into different disciplines which may each use different criteria for their judgements.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; The most common division in the field of criticism is between historical criticism and evaluation, a form of art history, and contemporary criticism of work by living artists.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;

Despite perceptions that art criticism is a much lower risk activity than making art, opinions of current art are always liable to drastic corrections with the passage of time.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Critics of the past are often ridiculed for either favouring artists now derided (like the [[Academic art|academic painters]] of the late 19th century){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} or dismissing artists now venerated (like the early work of the [[Impressionists]]).&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rewald1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=James S.|title=Art History and the Problems of Criticism|journal=Daedalus|date=Winter 1960|volume=89|issue=1 – The Visual Arts Today|pages=253–263|jstor=20026565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art movements themselves were named disparagingly by critics, with the name later adopted as a sort of badge of honour by the artists of the style (e.g., [[Impressionism]], [[Cubism]]), with the original negative meaning forgotten.&lt;ref name="rewald1973"&gt;Rewald, John (1973).

New York: The Museum of Modern Art. p. 323 {{ISBN|0-87070-360-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists have often had an uneasy relationship with their critics. Artists usually need positive opinions from critics for their work to be viewed and purchased; unfortunately for the artists, only later generations may understand it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Painting by ridiculed but popular artist sells for £744,800|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/20/arts.artsnews1|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art is an important part of being human and can be found through all aspects of our lives, regardless of the culture or times. There are many different variables that determine one's judgment of art such as aesthetics, cognition or perception. Art can be objective or subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form. It can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance. Art is a basic human instinct with a diverse range of form and expression. Art can stand-alone with an instantaneous judgment or can be viewed with a deeper more educated knowledge. Aesthetic, pragmatic, expressive, formalist, relativist, processional, imitation, ritual, cognition, mimetic and postmodern theories are some of many theories to criticize and appreciate art. Art criticism and appreciation can be subjective based on personal preference toward aesthetics and form, or it can be based on the elements and principle of design and by social and cultural acceptance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Definition==
Art criticism has many and often numerous subjective viewpoints which are nearly as varied as there are people practising it.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; It is difficult to come by a more stable definition than the activity being related to the discussion and interpretation of art and its value.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Depending on who is writing on the subject, "art criticism" itself may be obviated as a direct goal or it may include [[art history]] within its framework.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Regardless of definitional problems, art criticism can refer to the [[history of art|history of the craft]] in its essays and art history itself may use critical methods implicitly.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; According to art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]], "The borders between art history and art criticism... are no more as firmly drawn as they once used to be. It perhaps began with art historians taking interest in modern art."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Art criticism includes a descriptive aspect,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; where the work of art is sufficiently translated into words so as to allow a case to be made.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation of a work of art that follows the description (or is interspersed with it) depends as much on the artist's output as on the experience of the critic.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p6" /&gt; There is in an activity with such a marked subjective component a variety of ways in which it can be pursued.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt; As extremes in a possible spectrum,&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5" /&gt; while some favour simply remarking on the immediate impressions caused by an artistic object,&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; others prefer a more systematic approach calling on technical knowledge, favoured [[aesthetic theory]] and the known sociocultural context the artist is immersed in to discern their intent.&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ackerman1960" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of art criticism}}
Critiques of art likely originated with the origins of art itself, as evidenced by texts found in the works of [[Plato]], [[Vitruvius]] or [[Augustine of Hippo]] among others, that contain early forms of art criticism.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; Also, wealthy [[patron]]s have employed, at least since the start of [[Renaissance]], intermediary art-evaluators to assist them in the procurement of commissions and/or finished pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Creighton E.|title=What Did the Renaissance Patron Buy?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1998|volume=51|issue=2|pages=392–450|url=http://classroom.kleinisd.net/users/1243/docs/what_did_the_renaissance_patron_buy.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Renaissance Society of America|doi=10.2307/2901572|jstor=2901572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Alexander|title=Negotiating the Gift: Pre-Modern Figurations of Exchange|year=2003|pages=319–360|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/nagel_PDFs/Art_as_Gift_lq.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2013|chapter=Art as Gift: Liberal Art and Religious Reform in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Jonathan Richardson by Jonathan Richardson.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] coined the term 'art criticism' in 1719.]]
Art criticism as a genre of writing, obtained its modern form in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; The earliest use of the term art criticism was by the English painter [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson]] in his 1719 publication ''An Essay on the Whole Art of Criticism''. In this work, he attempted to create an objective system for the ranking of works of art. Seven categories, including drawing, composition, invention and colouring, were given a score from 0 to 18, which were combined to give a final score. The term he introduced quickly caught on, especially as the English middle class began to be more discerning in their art acquisitions, as symbols of their flaunted social status.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and England in the mid 1700s, public interest in art began to become widespread, and art was regularly exhibited at the Salons in Paris and the [[Summer Exhibition]]s of London. The first writers to acquire an individual reputation as art critics in 18th-century France were [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] with his ''Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture'' (1718)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubos|first=Jean-Baptiste|title=Réflexions critiques sur la poésie et sur la peinture|year=1732|publisher=E. Neaulme|location=Utrecht|url=https://archive.org/details/reflexionscriti03jeagoog|edition=3rd|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered the acclaim of [[Voltaire]] for the sagacity of his approach to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire |title=Le Siècle de Louis XIV|year=1874|publisher=Charpentier et C&lt;sup&gt;ie&lt;/sup&gt;, Libraires-Éditeurs|location=Paris|page=581|url=https://archive.org/details/sicledelouisxiv00voltgoog|editor=Charles Louandre|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne]] with ''Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France'' who wrote about the Salon of 1746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=La Font de Saint-Yenne|first=Étienne|title=Reflexions sur quelques causes de l'état présent de la peinture en France : avec un examen des principaux ouvrages exposés au Louvre le mois d'août 1746|year=1747|publisher=Jean Neaulme|location=The Hague|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting on the socioeconomic framework of the production of the then popular [[Baroque]] art style,&lt;ref name="saisselin1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saisselin|first=Rémy G.|title=The Enlightenment Against the Baroque: Economics and Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=49–50|url=http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0779n6fb/|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a perception of anti-monarchist sentiments in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Walter |first=Nancy Paige Ryan |title=From Armida to Cornelia: Women and Representation in Prerevolutionary France |type=MA |page=11 |url=http://repositories.tdl.org/ttu-ir/handle/2346/15694 |year=1995 |publisher=Texas Tech University |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th-century French writer [[Denis Diderot]] greatly advanced the medium of art criticism. Diderot's "The Salon of 1765"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diderot|first=Denis|title=Essais sur la peinture|year=1795|publisher=François Buisson|location=Paris|pages=118–407|url=https://archive.org/details/gri_000033125010886956|editor=François Buisson|accessdate=10 December 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first real attempts to capture art in words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Morley|first=John|authorlink=John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn|editor=Hugh Chisholm, Franklin Henry Hooper|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=DIDEROT, DENIS|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_08.djvu/222|accessdate=10 December 2012|edition=11th|year=1911|volume=8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Thomas E. Crow]], "When Diderot took up art criticism it was on the heels of the first generation of professional writers who made it their business to offer descriptions and judgments of contemporary painting and sculpture. The demand for such commentary was a product of the similarly novel institution of regular, free, public exhibitions of the latest art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas E.|title=Diderot on Art, Volume I: The Salon of 1765 and Notes on Painting|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|page=x|editor=Denis Diderot|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in England an exhibition of the [[Society of Arts]] in 1762 and later, in 1766, prompted a flurry of critical, though anonymous, pamphlets. Newspapers and periodicals of the period, such as the ''[[London Chronicle]]'', began to carry columns for art criticism; a form that took off with the foundation of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1768.
In the 1770s, the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' became the first newspaper to systematically review the art featured at exhibitions.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:John Ruskin - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]], the preeminent art critic of 19th century England.]]
From the 19th century onwards, art criticism became a more common vocation and even a profession,&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; developing at times formalised methods based on particular [[aesthetic theory|aesthetic theories]].&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fishman1963p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fishman|first=Solomon|title=The Interpretation of Art: Essays on the Art Criticism of John Ruskin, Walter Pater, Clive Bell, Robert Fry, and Herbert Read|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, a rift emerged in the 1820s between the proponents of traditional [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] forms of art and the new [[romanticism|romantic]] fashion. The Neoclassicists, under [[Étienne-Jean Delécluze]] defended the classical ideal and preferred carefully finished form in paintings. Romantics, such as [[Stendhal]], criticized the old styles as overly formulaic and devoid of any feeling. Instead, they championed the new expressive, Idealistic, and emotional nuances of Romantic art. A similar, though more muted, debate also occurred in England.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the prominent critics in England at the time was [[William Hazlitt]], a painter and essayist. He wrote about his deep pleasure in art and his belief that the arts could be used to improve mankind's generosity of spirit and knowledge of the world around it. He was one of a rising tide of English critics that began to grow uneasy with the increasingly abstract direction [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s landscape art was moving in.&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

One of the great critics of the 19th century was [[John Ruskin]]. In 1843 he published ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in which he robustly defended the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] from his critics, who charged Turner with being unfaithful to nature. Through painstaking analysis and attention to detail, Ruskin was able to demonstrate the very opposite, in what the art historian [[E. H. Gombrich]] called "the most ambitious work of scientific art criticism ever attempted." Ruskin became renowned for his rich and flowing prose, and later in life he branched out to become an active and wide-ranging critic, publishing works on architecture and [[Renaissance art]], including the ''[[Stones of Venice]]''.

[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''Salon of 1845'' art review shocked its audience with its ideas.]]
Another dominating figure in 19th-century art criticism, was the French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]], whose first published work was his art review ''Salon of 1845'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baudelaire|first=Charles|title=Curiosités esthétiques: Salon 1845–1859|year=1868|publisher=M.

He tried to move the debate from the old binary positions of previous decades, declaring that "the true painter, will be he who can wring from contemporary life its epic aspect and make us see and understand, with colour or in drawing, how great and poetic we are in our cravats and our polished boots".&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

===Turn of the twentieth century===
[[File:Roger Fry self-portrait.jpg|thumb|Self portrait of [[Roger Fry]], described by the [[art historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]] as "incomparably the greatest influence on taste since [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]... In so far as taste can be changed by one man, it was changed by Roger Fry".&lt;ref&gt;IAN CHILVERS. "Fry, Roger." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists. 2003.

Towards the end of the 19th century a movement towards abstraction, as opposed to specific content, began to gain ground in England, notably championed by the playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. By the early twentieth century these attitudes formally coalesced into a coherent philosophy, through the work of [[Bloomsbury Group]] members [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, as art critic &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_artcritic.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Group Profiles &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/group.htm#bellc|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an art historian in the 1890s, Fry became intrigued with the new modernist art and its shift away from traditional depiction. His 1910 exhibition of what he called [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art attracted much criticism for its iconoclasm. He vigorously defended himself in a lecture, in which he argued that art had moved to attempt to discover the language of pure imagination, rather than the staid and, to his mind, dishonest scientific capturing of landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, ideas &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_ideas.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive Journeys: Bloomsbury Biographies: Roger Fry, modern art &amp;#124; Tate|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/bloomsburyhtml/bio_fry_modernart.htm|work=Archive Journeys|publisher=Tate|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry's argument proved to be very influential at the time, especially among the progressive elite. [[Virginia Woolf]] remarked that: "in or about December 1910 [the date Fry gave his lecture] human character changed."&lt;ref name="pearson" /&gt;

Independently, and at the same time, [[Clive Bell]] argued in his 1914 book ''Art'' that all art work has its particular 'significant form', while the conventional subject matter was essentially irrelevant. This work laid the foundations for the [[formalism (art)|formalist]] approach to art.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tekiner|first=Deniz|title=Formalist Art Criticism and the Politics of Meaning|journal=Social Justice|year=2006|volume=33|issue=2 (104) – Art, Power, and Social Change|pages=31–44|jstor=29768369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Fry argued that "it’s all the same to me if I represent a Christ or a [[saucepan]] since it's the form, and not the object itself, that interests me." As well as being a proponent of [[formalism (art)|formalism]], he argued that the value of art lies in its ability to produce a distinctive aesthetic experience in the viewer. an experience he called "aesthetic emotion". He defined it as that experience which is aroused by significant form. He also suggested that the reason we experience aesthetic emotion in response to the significant form of a work of art was that we perceive that form as an expression of an experience the artist has. The artist's experience in turn, he suggested, was the experience of seeing ordinary objects in the world as pure form: the experience one has when one sees something not as a means to something else, but as an end in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4XeRgAACAAJ|title=Art|author=Clive Bell|year=2010|publisher=General Books LLC|isbn=9781770451858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Read]] was a champion of modern British artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Henry Moore]] and [[Barbara Hepworth]] and became associated with Nash's contemporary arts group Unit One. He focused on the [[modernism]] of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]], and published an influential 1929 essay on the meaning of art in ''The Listener''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Paul Nash (1889–1946)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/paul-nash|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Ben Nicholson (1894–1982)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/ben-nicholson|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Henry Moore (1898–1986)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/henry-moore|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Overton|first=Tom|title=Barbara Hepworth (1903–1975)|url=http://venicebiennale.britishcouncil.org/people/reference/barbara-hepworth|work=Venice Biennale|publisher=British Council|accessdate=11 December 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also edited the trend-setting ''Burlington Magazine'' (1933–38) and helped organise the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205900771.pdf|title=A History of Art Criticism|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
As in the case of Baudelaire in the 19th century, the poet-as-critic phenomenon appeared once again in the 20th, when French poet [[Apollinaire]] became the champion of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Katharine |title=The Cubist Painters by Guillaume Apollinaire; Peter Read|journal=French Forum|date=Spring 2005|volume=30|issue=2|pages=139–141|jstor=40552391|doi=10.1353/frf.2005.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Timothy|title=Apollinaire and Cubism?|journal=Style|date=Summer 1988|volume=22|issue=2|pages=275–298|url=http://mlpa.nottingham.ac.uk/archive/00000033/01/Rec_Mathews.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, French writer and hero of the Resistance [[André Malraux]] wrote extensively on art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Derek|title=Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi}}&lt;/ref&gt; going well beyond the limits of his native Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudek|first=Antony|title=The Vocal Turn|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|year=2012|volume=10|issue=1|pages=64–65|doi=10.5334/jcms.1011210}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction that the vanguard in Latin America lay in [[Mexican Muralism]] ([[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]], [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]]){{citation needed|date=December 2012}} changed after his trip to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1958. After visiting the studios of several Argentine artists in the company of the young Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Buenos Aires [[Rafael Squirru]], Malraux declared the new vanguard to lie in [[Argentina]]'s new artistic movements.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Squirru, a poet-critic who became Cultural Director of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] in [[Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], during the 1960s, was the last to interview [[Edward Hopper]] before his death, contributing to a revival of interest in the American artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Gail|title=Edward Hopper : an intimate biography|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]]) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the [[New York Vanguard]].&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=The Art Story: Gallery – The Art of This Century Gallery|url=http://www.theartstory.org/gallery-art-of-this-century.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]] who functioned as critics as well.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Archives of American Art |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-robert-motherwell-13286 |title=Oral history interview with Robert Motherwell, 1971 Nov. 24-1974 May 1 – Oral Histories &amp;#124; Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Aaa.si.edu |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Motherwell|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-motherwell-1673|publisher=Tate|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php The Barnett Newman Foundation website: Chronology of the Artist's Life page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although New York and the world were unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="artofthiscentury" /&gt; by the late 1940s most of the artists who have become household names today had their well established patron critics.&lt;ref name="oxfordart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Painters in Postwar New York City|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/public/page/benz/themes/PostwarNYC|work=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Barnett Newman, [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Abstract Expressionism|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-abstract-expressionism.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uima.uiowa.edu/mural/ Jackson Pollock, ''Mural'' (1943)] [[University of Iowa Museum of Art]], Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|title=American-Type Painting|journal=[[Partisan Review]]|year=1955|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webexhibits"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Abstract Expressionism: Painting Action and Colorfields|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/abstract-expressionism.html|work=Color Vision &amp; Art|publisher=webexhibits.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php|publisher=The Barnett Newman Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Exhibitions – Adolph Gottlieb|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/home/content/exhibitions/special/gottlieb/gottlieb.html|publisher=The Jewish Museum|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans Hofmann: Biography|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|publisher=The Estate of Hans Hofmann|accessdate=12 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129075738/http://www.hanshofmann.org/biography|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de&amp;nbsp;Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Mark|author2=Annalyn Swan|title=When de Kooning Was King|journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=8 November 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/10248/index1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Harold Rosenberg|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-rosenberg-harold.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas B. Hess]], the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Thomas B. Hess|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hess-thomas.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers" or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.:13&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, in 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] "became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Biennale of Venice. New York's two leading art magazines were not interested. ''Arts'' mentioned the historic event only in a news column and ''Art News'' (Managing editor: Thomas B. Hess) ignored it completely. ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' printed feature articles".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/5750568&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]] wrote catalogue forewords and reviews and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Session at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image".&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pgs.: 240–241, University of California Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter to [[Sidney Janis]] on 9 April 1955: {{quotation|It is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews, (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, p.: 201, University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York [[Trotskyist]], [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordart"/&gt; As long time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref name="tekiner2006" /&gt; Artist [[Robert Motherwell]], well-heeled, joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Robert Motherwell, Master of Abstract, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/18/obituaries/robert-motherwell-master-of-abstract-dies.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement Greenberg proclaimed [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever "purer" and more concentrated in what was "essential" to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:154–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New,'' Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", Da Capo Press, 1959 pp.:23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of Abstract Expressionism at the time was ''New York Times'' art critic [[John Canaday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=John Canaday|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-canaday-john.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] were also important postwar art historians who voiced support for Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|title=A Critic Turns 90; Meyer Schapiro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/a-critic-turns-90-meyer-schapiro.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Kristi|title=Remembering Leo Steinberg (1920–2011)|url=http://pressblog.uchicago.edu/2011/03/15/remembering-leo-steinberg-1920-2011.html|work=The Chicago Blog|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early to mid sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]] and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Michael Fried|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-fried-michael.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Rosalind Krauss|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-krauss-rosalind.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Justin|title=Robert Hughes|url=http://www.theartstory.org/critic-hughes-robert.htm|work=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist art criticism===
[[Feminist art criticism]] emerged in the 1970s from the wider [[feminist movement]] as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art [[women artists|produced by women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deepwell|first=Katie|title=12 Step Guide to Feminist Art, Art History and Criticism|journal=N.paradoxa|date=September 2012|volume=online|issue=21|page=8|url=http://www.ktpress.co.uk/pdf/nparadoxaissue21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a major field of art criticism.

==Today==

Art critics today work not only in print media and in specialist art magazines as well as newspapers. Art critics appear also on the internet, TV, and radio, as well as in museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="ntifotva"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Criticism|url=http://art.unt.edu/ntieva/pages/teaching/tea_comp_artcriticism.html|work=Comprehensive Art Education|publisher=North Texas Institute For Educators on the Visual Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gratza|first=Agnieszka|title=Frieze or faculty?

Art critics curate exhibitions and are frequently employed to write exhibition catalogues.&lt;ref name="ntifotva" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt; Art critics have their own organisation, a [[UNESCO]] non-governmental organisation, called the [[International Association of Art Critics]] which has around 76 national sections and a political non-aligned section for refugees and exiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association of Art Critics|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100031328|work=UNESCO NGO – db|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art blogs===
{{Main|Art blog}}

Since the early 21st century, online art critical websites and art blogs have cropped up around the world to add their voices to the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Tyler|title=Tyler Green|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level3.asp?id=283&amp;fid=6&amp;sid=17|work=In Their Own Words|publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaiser|first=Michael|title=The Death of Criticism or Everyone Is a Critic|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-kaiser/the-death-of-criticism-or_b_1092125.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these writers use [[social media]] resources like Facebook, Twitter, [[Tumblr]] and [[Google+]] to introduce readers to their opinions about art criticism.

'''Arthropodology''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]]}} - ''arthron'', "joint", and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:πούς|πούς]]}}, ''gen''.: {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ποδός|ποδός]]}} - ''pous'', ''podos'', "foot", which together mean "jointed feet") is a biological discipline concerned with the study of [[arthropod]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Arthropodology Etymology-Museum of Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; a phylum of [[animal]]s that include the [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[crustacean]]s and others that are characterized by the possession of jointed limbs.

This field is very important in medicine, studied together with [[parasitology]]. Medical arthropodology is the study of the parasitic effect of arthropods, not only as parasites but also as vectors. The first annual '' Conference on Medical Arthropodology'' was held in [[Madurai]] ([[Tamil Nadu]]) in 2007.

An '''automated driving system''' is a complex combinations of various components that can be defined as systems where perception, decision making, and operation of the automobile are performed by electronics and machinery instead of a human driver, and as introduction of automation into road traffic. This includes handling of the vehicle, destination, as well as awareness of surroundings. While the automated system has control over the vehicle, it allows the human operator to leave all responsibilities to the system.
[[File:Automated Vehicle System Technology Hierarchy.png|thumbnail|right|Automated vehicle system technology hierarchy]]
 
== Overview ==
The '''automated driving system''' is generally an integrated package of individual [[Control system|automated systems]] operating in concert. Automated driving implies that you as the driver have given up the ability to drive (i.e., all appropriate monitoring, agency, and action functions) to the vehicle automation system. Even though you as the driver may be alert and ready to take action at any moment, you are still giving up the ability to the automation system.

Automated driving systems are often conditional, which implies that the automation system is capable of automated driving, but not for all conditions encountered in the course of normal operation.  Therefore, a human driver is functionally required to initiate the automated driving system, and may or may not do so when driving conditions are within the capability of the system. When the vehicle automation system has assumed all driving functions, the human is no longer driving the vehicle but continues to assume responsibility for the vehicle's performance as the vehicle operator. The automated vehicle operator is not functionally required to actively monitor the vehicle's performance while the automation system is engaged, but the operator must be available to resume driving within several seconds of being prompted to do so, as the system has limited conditions of automation. While the automated driving system is engaged, certain conditions may prevent real-time human input, but for no more than a few seconds. The operator is able to resume driving at any time subject to this short delay. When the operator has resumed all driving functions, he or she reassumes the status of the vehicle's driver.

== Success in the technology ==
The success in the automated driving system has been known to be successful in situations like rural road settings. Rural road settings would be a setting in which there is lower amounts of traffic and lower differentiation between driving abilities and types of drivers. "The greatest challenge in the development of automated functions is still inner-city traffic, where an extremely wide range of road users must be considered from all directions." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://products.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/de/specials/specials_safety/automated_driving/technology_and_development_1/challenge_1/challenge.html|title=The next steps|website=products.bosch-mobility-solutions.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is progressing to a more reliable way of the automated driving cars to switch from auto-mode to driver mode. [[Autonomous car|Auto-mode]] is the mode that is set in order for the automated actions to take over, while the driver mode is the mode set in order to have the operator controlling all functions of the car and taking the responsibilities of operating the vehicle (Automated driving system not engaged).

This definition would include vehicle automation systems that may be available in the near term—such as traffic-jam assist, or full-range automated cruise control—if such systems would be designed such that the human operator can reasonably divert attention (monitoring) away from the performance of the vehicle while the automation system is engaged. This definition would also include automated platooning (such as conceptualized by the [[Safe Road Trains for the Environment|SARTRE]] project).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sartre-project.eu/EN/ABOUT/Sidor/default.aspx|title=About the SARTRE project|website=www.sartre-project.eu|access-date=2016-12-09|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vpeyHyE3?url=http://www.sartre-project.eu/en/about/Sidor/default.aspx|archive-date=18 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The SARTRE Project==
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20101127172612/http://www.sartre-project.eu/en/Sidor/default.aspx SARTRE] project's main goal is to create platooning, a train of automated cars, that will provide comfort and have the ability for the driver of the vehicle to arrive safely to a destination. Along with the ability to be along the train, drivers that are driving past these platoons, can join in with a simple activation of the automated driving system that correlates with a truck that leads the platoon. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20101127172612/http://www.sartre-project.eu/en/Sidor/default.aspx SARTRE] project is taking what we know as a train system and mixing it with automated driving technology. This is going to allow for an easier transportation though cities and ultimately help with traffic flow through heavy automobile traffic.

=== SARTRE &amp; modern day ===

In some parts of the world the self-driving car has been tested in real life situations such as in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.uber.com/pittsburgh-self-driving-uber/|title=Pittsburgh, your Self-Driving Uber is arriving now|date=2016-09-14|newspaper=Uber Global|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://newsroom.uber.com/pittsburgh-self-driving-uber/ The Self-driving Uber] has been put to the test around the city, driving with different types of drivers as well as different traffic situations. Not only have there been testing and successful parts to the automated car, but there has also been extensive testing in California on automated busses. The lateral control of the automated buses uses magnetic markers such as the platoon at San Diego, while the longitudinal control of the automated truck platoon uses millimeter wave radio and radar. Current examples around today's society include the [[Google self-driving car|Google car]] and [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]]'s models. [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] has redesigned automated driving, they have created car models that allow drivers to put in the destination and let the car take over.  These are two modern day examples of the automated driving system cars.

== Levels of automation ==
The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|U.S Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) provided a standard classification system in 2013 which defined five different levels of automation, ranging from level 0 (no automation) to level 4 (full automation).&lt;ref name="NHTSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Transportation Releases Policy on Automated Vehicle Development|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/About-NHTSA/Press-Releases/U.S.-Department-of-Transportation-Releases-Policy-on-Automated-Vehicle-Development|website=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the NHTSA updated their standards to be in line with the classification system defined by [http://www.sae.org/ SAE International].&lt;ref name="TechRepublic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Updated: Autonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/autonomous-driving-levels-0-to-5-understanding-the-differences/|website=TechRepublic|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAE International defines six different levels of automation in their new standard of classification in document [[SAE J3016]] that ranges from 0 (no automation) to 5 (full automation).&lt;ref name="SAE"&gt;{{cite web|title=AUTOMATED DRIVING LEVELS OF DRIVING AUTOMATION ARE DEFINED IN NEW SAE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD J3016|url=http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|website=SAE International|accessdate=9 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120142825/http://www.sae.org/misc/pdfs/automated_driving.pdf|archive-date=20 November 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level 0 – No automation ===

The driver is in complete control of the vehicle and the system does not interfere with driving.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt; Systems that may fall into this category are [[Collision avoidance system|forward collision warning systems]] and [[lane departure warning system]]s.&lt;ref name="Adaptive"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Etemad|first1=Aria|last2=Bartels|first2=Arne|title=A Stepwise Market Introduction of Automated Driving|url=https://www.adaptive-ip.eu/files/adaptive/content/downloads/Deliverables%20&amp;%20papers/AdaptIVe-ITS-WC%202014_A%20Stepwise%20Market%20Introduction%20of%20Automated%20Driving_V02.pdf|website=Adaptive|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level 1 – Driver assistance ===

The driver is in control of the vehicle, but the system can modify the speed and steering direction of the vehicle.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt; Systems that may fall into this category are [[Autonomous cruise control system|adaptive cruise control]] and lane keep assist.&lt;ref name="Adaptive" /&gt;

=== Level 2 – Partial automation ===

The driver must be able to control the vehicle if corrections are needed, but the driver is no longer in control of the speed and steering of the vehicle.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt; Parking assistance is an example of a system that falls into this category&lt;ref name="Adaptive" /&gt; along with [[Tesla Autopilot|Tesla's autopilot]] feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Assis|first1=Claudia|title=Tesla's latest autopilot update is still not hands free|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-latest-autopilot-update-is-still-not-hands-free-2015-10-14|website=MarketWatch|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A system that falls into this category is the DISTRONIC PLUS system created by Mercedes-Benz.&lt;ref name="Mercedez-Benz"&gt;{{cite web|title=DISTRONIC PLUS|url=https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/owners/videos/detail/videoId-6f31735fd7cee310VgnVCM1000007c184335RCRD|website=Mercedez-Benz|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the driver must not be distracted in Level 0 to Level 2 modes. 

=== Level 3 – Conditional automation ===

The system is in complete control of vehicle functions such as speed, steering, and monitoring the environment under specific conditions. A driver must be ready to intervene, when requested by the system to do so.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt; If the driver does not respond, an accident may happen. Hence, the driver is only allowed to be partially distracted, such as checking text messages, but taking a nap is not allowed.

=== Level 4 – High automation ===

The system is in complete control of the vehicle and human presence is no longer needed, but its applications are limited to specific conditions.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt; An example of a system that falls into this category is the [[Google self-driving car|Google car]].&lt;ref name="google car"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Self-Driving Car Project|url=https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/faq/|website=Google|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the actual motoring condition exceeds the performance boundaries, the system does not necessarily have to ask the human to intervene. It could choose to stop the car in a safe manner.

=== Level 5 – Full automation ===

The system is in complete control of the vehicle and human presence is no longer needed. The system is capable of providing the same aspects of a level 4, but the system can operate in all driving conditions.&lt;ref name="SAE" /&gt; The human is equivalent to "cargo" in Level 5. Currently, there are no driving systems at this level.&lt;ref name="Ringer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luckerson|first1=Victor|title=Yep, Driverless Cars Have Power Rankings|url=https://theringer.com/here-are-your-autonomous-car-power-rankings-dd7a4070e1c0#.u2dvsikj5|website=The Ringer|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks and liabilities ==
{{See also|Computer security#Automobiles|Autonomous car liability}}
Many automakers such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Volvo]] have announced plans to offer fully automated cars in the future.&lt;ref name="computer world"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mearian|first1=Lucas|title=Ford remains wary of Tesla-like autonomous driving features|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3109217/car-tech/ford-wary-of-tesla-like-autonomous-driving-features.html|website=Computer World|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research and development is being put into automated driving systems, but the biggest problem automakers cannot control is how drivers will use system.&lt;ref name="computer world" /&gt; Drivers are stressed to stay attentive and safety warnings are implemented to alert the driver when corrective action is needed.&lt;ref name="Automated Vehicle Technology 2014"&gt;"Automated Vehicle Technology." King Coal Highway 292 (2014): 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tesla Motors|Tesla Motor]]'s has one recorded incident that resulted in a fatality involving the automated driving system in the Tesla Model S.&lt;ref name="Tesla Loss"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tragic Loss|url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/tragic-loss|website=Tesla|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accident report reveals the accident was a result of the driver being inattentive and the autopilot system not recognizing the obstruction ahead.&lt;ref name="Tesla Loss" /&gt;

Another flaw with automated driving systems is that in situations where unpredictable events such as weather or the driving behavior of others may cause fatal accidents due to sensors that monitor the surroundings of the vehicle not being able to provide corrective action.&lt;ref name="Automated Vehicle Technology 2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The '''BMW Guggenheim Lab''' is a collaboration between the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and the [[BMW]] Group.  It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] mobile laboratory that visited three cities around the world between 2011 and 2013.  The lab is part urban [[think tank]], part [[community center]], and part gathering space, and explores issues of urban life through public programming and discourse.&lt;ref name="bmw"&gt;McHugh, Sharon. [http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16691 "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in NYC"], ''World Architecture News'', May 17, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Three different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which would travel to three cities.  The lab has an advisory committee of experts and is operated by a lab team.

The Lab was expected to travel to nine cities over the course of six years.  In 2013, however, BMW ended its support of the project, and the project ended in 2014, with an exhibition in New York.&lt;ref name=BMWend&gt;Vogel, Carol. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/bmw-ends-support-for-guggenheim-lab-project/ "BMW Ends Support for Guggenheim Lab Project"], ''The New York Times'', July 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept, organization and structures==
The concept behind the lab was developed by David van der Leer, assistant curator, architecture and urban studies, and Maria Nicanor, assistant curator, architecture, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. The lab's advisory committee is composed of internationally renowned experts in a range of fields and nominates members for each city's lab team, an interdisciplinary group that will help create the programming for that location.&lt;ref name=vogel1&gt;Carol Vogel, "A Lab on a Mission", ''The New York Times'', May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Committee&gt;"Six-Year Collaboration to Examine Contemporary Urban Issues in Nine Cities Around the World – International Advisory Committee Selects New York BMW Guggenheim Lab Team – Design of First Mobile Laboratory", Associated Press, May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Three different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which could be moved and would travel to three cities. Only one structure was built.  It was designed by the Tokyo-based architecture firm [[Atelier Bow-Wow]]. [[Seoul]]-based graphic designers Sulki &amp; Min created the graphic identity for the project, including an interactive logo that changed over the course of the project.&lt;ref name=mobile&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/press-room/releases/4121-bglmay6 "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in New York City on August 3 Before Traveling to Berlin and Asia"], Guggenheim Foundation, May 6, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vogel2&gt;Vogel, Carol.

The lab's three-city cycle was designed around the theme ''Confronting Comfort'', which explores ways of making urban environments more responsive to people's needs, striking a balance between individual and collective comfort, and promoting environmental and social responsibility.  The program was designed to proactively engage residents from each city, and participants on the Internet and from around the world, in free programs and experiments, and it addressed ideas and issues of particular relevance to each city.&lt;ref name=GuggLabSite&gt;[http://www.bmwguggenheimlab.org "What Is the Lab?"], The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Retrieved April 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee members are: [[Daniel Barenboim]], [[Elizabeth Diller]], [[Nicholas Humphrey]], [[Muchadeyi Masunda]], [[Enrique Peñalosa]], [[Juliet Schor]], [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]], and [[Wang Shi (entrepreneur)|Wang Shi]].&lt;ref name=vogel1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Committee/&gt;

==New York City==
The lab was open from August 3 to October 16, 2011, in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] and was attended by over 54,000 visitors from 60 countries.&lt;ref name=vogel2/&gt;  Members of the New York Lab Team were Omar Freilla, founder and coordinator of [[Green Worker Cooperatives]], [[Bronx]], New York; [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], Canadian journalist and urban experimentalist; Olatunbosun Obayomi, Nigerian [[microbiologist]] and inventor; and architects and [[urbanists]] Elma van Boxel and Kristian Koreman, founders of [[Zones Urbaines Sensible (consulting)|Zones Urbaines Sensible]], [[Rotterdam]]. The first Public Programs Manager in New York City was Rosanna Flouty.&lt;ref&gt;Boscawen, Rosanna.

==Berlin==
From June 15 to July 29, 2012, the lab was open in Pfefferberg, a complex of galleries and artist studios in [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/politics/2012/04/following-threats-bmw-guggenheim-lab-finds-new-berlin-location/1665/ "Following Threats, BMW Guggenheim Lab Finds a New Berlin Location"], ''The Atlantic Cities'', April 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Berlin Lab were José Gómez-Márquez, program director for the [[Innovations in International Health]] Initiative (IIH) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT); Italian architect and engineer [[Carlo Ratti]], who directs the [[MIT Senseable City Lab]]; Berlin-based artist Corinne Rose, who works with photography and video and teaches at the Bern University of the Arts, Switzerland; and Rachel Smith, principal transport planner with [[AECOM]], based in [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=vogel2/&gt;&lt;ref name=berlin&gt;[https://www.dexigner.com/news/24158 "BMW Guggenheim Lab Berlin to Open in May 2012"], Dexigner, November 9, 2011, accessed January 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The programming of the Berlin Lab focused on four main topics: Empowerment Technologies (Gómez-Márquez), Dynamic Connections (Smith), Urban Micro-Lens (Rose) and the Senseable (SENSEable) City (Ratti).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Mumbai==
The lab opened in [[Mumbai]], India on December 9, 2012 and ran until January 20, 2013. The central location was on the grounds of the [[Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum]] in Mumbai’s [[Byculla]] neighborhood, with additional satellite locations around the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/objectlessons/2012/10/22/the-bmw-guggenheim-lab-gets-a-mumbai-makeover/ The BMW Guggenheim Lab Gets a Mumbai Makeover], Artinfo.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The lab's team consisted of Aisha Dasgupta, a British demographer based in Malawi; Neville Mars, a Dutch architect based in China; Trupti Amritwar Vaitla, an architect and urban transport designer from Mumbai; and Héctor Zamora, a Mexican artist based in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/58322/bmw-guggenheim-lab-to-launch-in-mumbai/  "BMW Guggenheim Lab to Launch in Mumbai"], Architizer.com, accessed October 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Along with neighborhood-specific public programming, the Mumbai Lab program included participatory research studies and design projects, including a competition to redesign Mumbai's Kala Nagar Junction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitednetworker.com/us/2012/10/22/bmw-guggenheim-lab-mumbai-to-open-december-9-2012-at-dr-bhau-daji-lad-museum-with-pop-up-sites-throughout-the-city/ BMW Guggenheim Lab Mumbai to Open December 9, 2012], UnitedNetworker.com, October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/six-designs-selected-as-solutions-for-congested-kala-nagar-junction/articleshow/18079917.cms Six designs selected as solutions for congested Kala Nagar junction], ''Times of India'', January 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final exhibition==
The program concluded with an exhibition, ''Participatory City: 100 Urban Trends from the BMW Guggenheim Lab'', which was on view at the New York museum from October 2013 through January 5, 2014.&lt;ref name=BMWend/&gt; The exhibition featured photos and videos from the Lab's public programs and displayed 100 terms representing the "most-talked about words" during the Lab's activities in New York, Berlin, and Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2013/10/131017-BMW-Guggenheim-Lab-Comes-to-a-Close-with-Exhibition.asp BMW Guggenheim Lab Comes to an Early End], Architectural Record, October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BioWall''' is a bio-inspired computing surface made of several thousand electronic modules which can be seen as artificial molecules. Each of these modules contains a programmable electronic circuit, a [[touch sensor]] and a display composed of 64 [[LED]]s (Light-emitting diodes). As a result, each module enables the visitor to communicate with the surface by touching it with his finger, calculates its new status and indicates it immediately on a coloured display.

==Overview==
The BioWall was developed in the Logic Systems Laboratory ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/ LSL]) of the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de [[Lausanne]] ([[EPFL]]), [[Switzerland]]. Its construction has been sponsored by Jacqueline Reuge, owner of the Villa Reuge Museum in [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland|Sainte-Croix]] ([[Vaud|VD]]). Two versions of the BioWall have been realized, in which several thousand [[FPGA]]s (''Spartan XCS10XL'' of [[Xilinx]]) constitute the core of as many modules, locally exchanging information with their nearest neighbours. The interaction with the FPGA is performed through a touch sensitive membrane and each FPGA communicates its state to a 64 coloured [[LED]] array.

The main goal of this academic project is the study of the hardware implementation of bio-inspired concepts such as self-repair, evolution, self-replication, learning... following the three main axes defined in the POEtic model:
* Phylogenetic axis (P axis), inspired by the evolution of biological species
* Ontogenetic axis (O axis), inspired by the development and growth of multicellular organisms
* Epigenetic axis (E axis), inspired by the adaptation of individuals to the environment
Among these three research axes, the main effort of the LSL has been focused to the ontogenetic axis through the Embryonics Project, which aims at drawing inspiration from the development of multicellular living organisms in order to obtain in [[digital hardware]] some of their original features, and notably growth and fault tolerance.

==BioWatch==

[[Image:BioWatch.jpg|thumb|right|The BioWatch]]

An artificial organism endowed with all of the features of an [[Embryonics Project#Embryonics machines|embryonic machine]] was implemented in the BioWall. The BioWatch, which counts hours, minutes, and seconds, is used to demonstrate the growth and self-repair capabilities of the BioWall.

Following the three levels of complexity defined in the [[Embryonics Project]], the BioWatch has been hierarchically designed: The entire watch can be seen as an organism composed of six cells, each of which is dedicated to the calculation of one digit: units and tens of seconds, minutes and hours. Each of these cells is itself decomposed in smaller identical units, i.e. the modules of the BioWall, that could be seen as the basic molecules in a real organism.

Self-repair is possible by including in the BioWatch spare molecules; when a FPGA, i.e. a molecule, becomes faulty, one of the spare molecules can take over its functionality and enables the BioWatch to still display the right time. When a whole cell, counting a specific digit, is overwhelmed by faulty molecules, it dies, but the spare space is automatically configured in order to take over the functionality of the dead cell and to replicate it. As a result, the full watch is then able to tolerate a large amount of faults inside its hardware, and nevertheless can still display the right time.

==Other applications==

The BioWall is composed of an array of small, locally connected elements and as a result is also an ideal platform to prototype [http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/ApplicationsE.html  many different kinds] of two-dimensional cellular systems and bio-inspired systems, such as:

* [[John Horton Conway|Conway]]'s [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/LifeE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* Self-replicating Loops ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/LoopsE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Alan Turing|Turing]] [[Artificial Neural Networks]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/TuringE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Von Neumann]]'s [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Universal Constructor]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/UConstE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Stephen Wolfram|Wolfram]]'s [[Cellular Automata]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/WolframE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* Firing Squad Cellular Automaton ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/SquadE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])
* [[Sequence alignment|DNA Sequence Comparison]] ([http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/VersionE/ApplicationsE/SequenceE.html &gt;&gt;&gt;])

Although the BioWall's size and structure impose a certain number of limitations (e.g. clock speed of the system), its complete programmability provides an outstanding versatility and the visual and interactive component of the system are invaluable tools both for the dissemination of ideas and for the verification of research concepts that are often limited to software simulations.

A BioWall with 2000 molecules is now in the Intelligent Systems Group, Department of Electronics, [[University of York]] (UK). Another BioWall with 2000 molecules resides in a permanent exhibition in the Ecole polytechnique fédérale Lausanne (EPFL) and can be seen operating live with the following [http://lslwww.epfl.ch/biowall/Camera/CameraE/CameraE.html Webcam], from Monday to Friday between 8:00 and 19:00 GMT+1.

'''Brookhaven National Laboratory''' ('''BNL''') is a [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|United States Department of Energy national laboratory]] located in [[Upton, New York]], on [[Long Island]], and was formally established in 1947 at the site of [[Camp Upton]], a former [[List of United States Army installations|U.S. Army base]]. Its name stems from its location within the [[Brookhaven, New York|Town of Brookhaven]], approximately 60 miles east of [[New York City]].

Research at BNL specializes in nuclear and high energy physics, energy science and technology, environmental and bioscience, nanoscience and national security. The 5,300 acre campus contains several large research facilities, including the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] and [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. Seven [[Nobel prize]]s have been awarded for work conducted at Brookhaven lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/nobel/ |title=Nobel Prizes at BNL |publisher=Bnl.gov |access-date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
BNL is staffed by approximately 2,750 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support personnel, and hosts 4,000 guest investigators every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/about/|title=About BNL|publisher=BNL.gov|accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory has its own police station, fire department, and [[ZIP code]] (11973).  In total, the lab spans a {{convert|5265|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} area that is mostly coterminous with the hamlet of [[Upton, New York]]. BNL is served by a rail spur operated as-needed by the [[New York and Atlantic Railway]]. Co-located with the laboratory is the Upton, New York, forecast office of the [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/okx/ |title=NWS Forecast Office New York, NY |date=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation===
Brookhaven National Lab was originally owned by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and is now owned by that agency's successor, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). DOE subcontracts the research and operation to universities and research organizations.  It is currently operated by Brookhaven Science Associates LLC, which is an equal partnership of [[Stony Brook University]] and [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]. From 1947 to 1998, it was operated by [[Associated Universities, Inc.]] (AUI), but AUI lost its contract in the wake of two incidents: a 1994 fire at the facility's high-beam flux reactor that exposed several workers to radiation and reports in 1997 of a tritium leak into the groundwater of the [[Long Island Central Pine Barrens]] on which the facility sits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10614FD3B5A1B7B93C3A91788D85F438485F9 Atomic Laboratory on Long Island to Be Mighty Research Center – New York Times – March 1, 1947]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/5/21/laboratory-loses-federal-contract-pin-fallout/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundations===
Following [[World War II]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] was created to support government-sponsored peacetime research on atomic energy. The effort to build a [[nuclear reactor]] in the American northeast was fostered largely by physicists [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[Norman Foster Ramsey Jr.]], who during the war witnessed many of their colleagues at [[Columbia University]] leave for new remote research sites following the departure of the [[Manhattan Project]] from its campus. Their effort to house this reactor near [[New York City]] was rivalled by a similar effort at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to have a facility near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Involvement was quickly solicited from representatives of northeastern universities to the south and west of [[New York City]] such that this city would be at their geographic center. In March 1946 a nonprofit corporation was established that consisted of representatives from nine major research universities — [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Rochester]], and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crease |first=Robert P. |date= 1999|title= Making Physics: A Biography of Brookhaven National Laboratory|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soldier_records,_Camp_Upton_(LOC)_(23546348723).jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers during [[World War I]] at the [[Camp Upton]] site,  which would in 1947 be repurposed as BNL]]
Out of 17 considered sites in the Boston-Washington corridor, [[Camp Upton]] on [[Long Island]] was eventually chosen as the most suitable in consideration of space, transportation, and availability. The camp had been a training center from the [[United States Army|US Army]] during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  After the latter war, Camp Upton was deemed no longer necessary and became available for reuse. A plan was conceived to convert the military camp into a research facility.

On March 21, 1947, the Camp Upton site was officially transferred from the [[U.S. War Department]] to the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]], predecessor to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]].

===Research and facilities===
====Reactor history====
In 1947 construction began on the first [[nuclear reactor]] at Brookhaven, the [[Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor]]. This reactor, which opened in 1950, was the first reactor to be constructed in the United States after World War II.  The [[High Flux Beam Reactor]] operated from 1965 to 1999. In 1959 Brookhaven built the first US reactor specifically tailored to medical research, the [[Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor]], which operated until 2000.

====Accelerator history====
[[File:Satoshi Ozaki 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Satoshi Ozaki]] posed with a magnet for the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] in 1991]]
In 1952 Brookhaven began using its first [[particle accelerator]], the [[Cosmotron]]. At the time the Cosmotron was the world's highest energy accelerator, being the first to impart more than 1 [[GeV]] of energy to a particle. The Cosmotron was retired in 1966, after it was superseded in 1960 by the new [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] (AGS). The AGS was used in research that resulted in 3 [[Nobel prize]]s, including the discovery of the [[muon neutrino]], the [[charm quark]], and [[CP violation]]. The [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] operated from 1982 to 2014 and was involved with two Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. It has since been replaced by the [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. The [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) has been operational since 2000. One of the world's only two operating heavy-ion colliders, RHIC is as of 2010 the second-highest-energy collider after the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. RHIC is housed in a tunnel 2.4 miles (3.9&amp;nbsp;km) long and is visible from space.

====Other discoveries====

In 1958, Brookhaven scientists created one of the world's first [[video game]]s, [[Tennis for Two]]. In 1968 Brookhaven scientists patented [[Maglev]], a transportation technology that utilizes [[magnetic levitation]].

It is a contributing partner to [[ATLAS experiment]], one of the four detectors located at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC).  It is currently operating at [[CERN]] near [[Geneva]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/ATLAS/|title=BNL {{!}} Brookhaven and the Large Hadron Collider|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brookhaven was also responsible for the design of the SNS accumulator ring in partnership with [[Spallation Neutron Source]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].

Brookhaven plays a role in a range of neutrino research projects around the world, including the [[Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment]] in China and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/science/neutrinos.php|title=BNL {{!}} Neutrino Research History|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access==
[[File:National Synchrotron Light Source II.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]] facility in 2012, during a Brookhaven National Laboratory "Summer Sundays" public tour.]]
For other than approved Public Events, the Laboratory is closed to the general public. The lab is open to the public on several Sundays during the summer for tours and special programs. The public access program is referred to as 'Summer Sundays' and takes place on four Sundays from mid-July to mid-August, and features a science show and a tour of the lab's major facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/summersundays.php|title=BNL {{!}} Summer Sundays|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory also hosts science fairs, science bowls, and robotics competitions for local schools, and lectures, concerts, and scientific talks for the local community. The Lab estimates that each year it enhances the science education of roughly 35,000 kindergarten to 12th grade LI students, more than 200 undergraduates, and 550 teachers from across the United States.

== Controversy and environmental cleanup ==
In January 1997, ground water samples taken by BNL staff revealed concentrations of tritium that were twice the allowable federal drinking water standards—some samples taken later were 32 times the standard. The tritium was found to be leaking from the laboratory's High Flux Beam Reactor's spent-fuel pool into the aquifer that provides drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents.

DOE's and BNL's investigation of this incident concluded that the tritium had been leaking for as long as 12 years without DOE's or BNL's knowledge. Installing wells that could have detected the leak was first discussed by BNL engineers in 1993, but the wells were not completed until 1996. The resulting controversy about both BNL's handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in DOE's oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997.

The responsibility for failing to discover Brookhaven's tritium leak has been acknowledged by laboratory managers, and DOE admits it failed to properly oversee the laboratory's operations. Brookhaven officials repeatedly treated the need for installing monitoring wells that would have detected the tritium leak as a low priority despite public concern and the laboratory's agreement to follow local environmental regulations. DOE's on-site oversight office, the Brookhaven Group, was directly responsible for Brookhaven's performance, but it failed to hold the laboratory accountable for meeting all of its regulatory commitments, especially its agreement to install monitoring wells. Senior DOE leadership also shared responsibility because they failed to put in place an effective system that encourages all parts of DOE to work together to ensure that contractors meet their responsibilities on environmental, safety and health issues. Unclear responsibilities for environment, safety and health matters has been a recurring problem for DOE management.

Since 1993, DOE has spent more than US$580 million on remediating soil and groundwater contamination at the lab site and completed several high-profile projects. These include the decommissioning and decontamination of the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/brookhaven-lab-reactor-fully-decommissioned-1.4027164|title=Lab reactor fully decommissioned|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; removal of mercury-contaminated sediment from the Peconic River, and installation and operation of 16 on- and off-site groundwater treatment systems that have cleaned more than 25 billion gallons of groundwater since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/community/cleanup/|title=Environmental Cleanup, Brookhaven National Laboratory|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after winning the contract to operate the lab in 1997, BSA formed a Community Advisory Council (CAC) to advise the laboratory director on cleanup projects and other items of interest to the community. The CAC represents a diverse range of interests and values of individuals and groups who are interested in or affected by the actions of the Laboratory. It consists of representatives from 26 local business, civic, education, environment, employee, government, and health organizations. The CAC sets its own agenda, brings forth issues important to the community, and works to provide consensus recommendations to Laboratory management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/cac.php|title=BNL {{!}} Community Advisory Council|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Draw, formerly the '''Campaign for Drawing,''' is a UK registered charity that promotes [[drawing]] and visual literacy. It was founded in 2000 by the [[Guild of St George]], and is now an independent charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100917/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Draw believes that drawing is a universal language that can unite people across generations, backgrounds and borders. It is inspired by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] artist and writer, [[John Ruskin]], whose mission was not to teach people how to draw, but how to see. An arts [[educational]] [[Charitable organization|charity]], the Campaign demonstrates that drawing is a [[life skill]]: an essential tool for learning, expression and invention. Its [[publications]] for [[teacher]]s and other educators provide comprehensive evidence that drawing supports formal and informal [[learning]].&lt;ref name="campaign"&gt;[http://www.campaignfordrawing.org]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511163743/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/|date=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/ |title=The Campaign for Drawing - Press releases |publisher=NESTA |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213131726/http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/# |archive-date=2012-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/secretofdrawing/ |title=Arts - The Secret of Drawing |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013133744/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503153730/http://staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity leads a programme of advocacy, empowerment and engagement, and is the driving force behind The Big Draw Festival – the world’s biggest celebration of drawing.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The charity supports established and emerging artists through The John Ruskin Prize and exhibition, and regular events, awards and competitions.

The Big Draw manages collaborative research projects, campaigns and educational conferences on visual literacy, digital technology and STEAM (Science, Technology, Art, Maths, Science).

==The Big Draw Festival==
The Big Draw charity is the founder and driving force behind The Big Draw Festival, which takes place each year in over 20 countries around the world. 

Events often take place at notable venues throughout the UK including [[The British Museum]], [[The National Gallery]] and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] as well as schools, community centres, parks and village halls. The 2013 Big Draw highlight event offered visitors 20 different activities in the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Previous launches were held at the Natural History Museum, V&amp;A (twice), Trafalgar Square, St Pancras International Station, Welcome Collection and the British Library.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Partnerships==
The Big Draw receives no core funding. Previously, it has been sponsored by bodies as diverse as NESTA, [[Arts Council England]] (ACE), [[Crayola]], [[Daler-Rowney]], Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, Paul Hamlyn Foundation, Barbara Whatmore Charitable Trust, [[Financial Times]], Heritage Lottery Fund, [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], [[Persil]], [[Puffin]], [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] and [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), Derwent and Cass Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145232/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cell cortex''', also known as the '''actin cortex''' or '''actomyosin cortex''', is a specialized layer of [[cytoplasm]]ic [[protein]]s on the inner face of the [[cell membrane]].

In most cases, the cortex is in the range of 100 to 1000 nanometers thick.

In some animal cells, the protein [[spectrin]] may be present in the cortex. Spectrin helps to create a network by cross-linked actin filaments.&lt;ref name='Alberts' /&gt; The proportions of spectrin and actin vary with cell type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Machnicka B, Grochowalska R, Bogusławska DM, Sikorski AF, Lecomte MC | title = Spectrin-based skeleton as an actor in cell signaling | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–201 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21877118 | pmc = 3249148 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-011-0804-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectrin proteins and actin microfilaments are attached to transmembrane proteins by attachment proteins between them and the transmembrane proteins. The cell cortex is attached to the inner [[cytosol]]ic face of the [[plasma membrane]] in cells where the spectrin proteins and actin microfilaments form a mesh-like structure that is continuously remodeled by [[polymerization]], [[depolymerization]] and branching.

Many proteins are involved in the cortex regulation and dynamics including [[formins]] with roles in actin polymerization, [[Arp2/3 complex|Arp2/3]] complexes that give rise to actin branching and [[F-actin capping protein|capping proteins]]. Due to the branching process and the density of the actin cortex, the cortical [[cytoskeleton]] can form a highly complex meshwork such as a [[fractal]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadegh S, Higgins JL, Mannion PC, Tamkun MM, Krapf D | title = Plasma Membrane is Compartmentalized by a Self-Similar Cortical Actin Meshwork | journal = Physical Review X | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28690919 | pmc = 5500227 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialized cells are usually characterized by a very specific cortical actin cytoskeleton.

In [[plant cell]]s, the cell cortex is reinforced by cortical [[microtubule]]s underlying the plasma membrane. The direction of these cortical microtubules determines which way the cell elongates when it grows.

'''The Centre for Advanced Structural Ceramics''' is a multidisciplinary research centre focusing on materials science and engineering involving ceramic materials for applications such as aerospace, energy and tissue engineering. It is located within [[Imperial College London]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

It was intended from conception to facilitate research between CASC-associated academics and the UK’s industrial structural ceramics community. Its stated goal is to provide a "critical mass of UK expertise in the fundamental understanding of structural ceramics that is highly relevant to key areas of the economy including, energy generation, aerospace and defence, transport and healthcare". Funding initially came through the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] but it is now funded through an industrial consortium including members such as [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]], [[Morgan Advanced Materials]] and [[Reaction Engines]].&lt;ref name = CASCsite&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/structuralceramics|title= Imperial College CASC Page|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Imperial College London|access-date= 27 August 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CASC's work draws from skills of multiple fields, including chemistry, physics, materials and earth sciences and business. It supports the dissemination of knowledge of ceramic materials through annual summer schools, industry days, workshops and lectures.&lt;ref name = ACS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/uks-imperial-college-builds-global-advanced-ceramics-industry-university-consortium|title= UK’s Imperial College builds global advanced ceramics industry–university consortium|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= ceramics.org|publisher= The American Ceramic Society|access-date= 27 August 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clarkesdale Bird Sanctuary''' is a [[nature reserve]] focused on protecting and restoring habitat for woodland birds.  It lies in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in south-eastern [[Australia]], near the small town of [[Linton, Victoria|Linton]], 30&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the city of [[Ballarat]].

==History==
The origins of the reserve lie in the 1960s with the efforts of Gordon Clarke, a [[Sheep husbandry|sheep farmer]] in the Linton district who was a keen [[birdwatching|birdwatcher]] and conservationist.  He began removing areas of [[gorse]], an [[invasive species|invasive weed]] in the area, to replant one of his paddocks with a wide range of Australian native (though not necessarily locally indigenous) plants in order to attract and protect birds by providing them with food and shelter.  This initial {{convert|31|ha|adj=on}} block of land, named the "Bird Paddock’’, had been purchased in 1957 and had never been heavily grazed; it was donated by Clarke to [[Bird Observation &amp; Conservation Australia]] (BOCA), then known as the Bird Observers Club, in 1975 when formal reservation of the land took place.&lt;ref name=CBShistory&gt;CBS history.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 a second block of {{convert|13|ha}} of land, named "Grantiella’’ after the generic name of the [[painted honeyeater]], was also donated to the club.  During the 1980s Clarke purchased several additional small blocks of adjacent land which he donated to the Trust for Nature to supplement the existing reserve.  Clarke died in 1996 at the age of 89, having established and endowed the Gordon Clarke Trust Fund to secure the future of the sanctuary.&lt;ref name=CBShistory/&gt;

==Description==
With adjacent [[crown land]] dedicated as a flora and fauna reserve, the sanctuary comprises {{convert|535|ha}}, of which the private land titles are covered by [[conservation easement|conservation covenants]].  Much of the land used to be farmland, including a commercial orchard and a [[Pinus radiata|pine]] plantation as well as pasture for sheep. but is now subject to a program of environmental rehabilitation involving the restoration of indigenous [[woodland]] vegetation. There are some small artificial [[wetland]]s on the reserve, which is managed by a BOCA-appointed Committee of Management and a resident [[park ranger|ranger]].  Much maintenance and planting work is carried out by a volunteer group, the Friends of Clarkesdale.&lt;ref&gt;CBS overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===
The remnant native forest in the area is classified as [[heath]]y dry forest and has been subject to selective logging and other forms of disturbance for many years.  The dominant trees include [[Eucalyptus obliqua|messmate]], [[Eucalyptus rubida|candlebark]], [[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha|red stringybark]], [[Eucalyptus radiata|narrow-leaved peppermint]], [[Eucalyptus dives|broad-leaved peppermint]], [[Eucalyptus aromaphloia|scent–bark]] and [[Eucalyptus ovata|swamp gum]] forming an open overstorey about 20&amp;nbsp;m in height.  The [[understory|understorey]] is a low and sparse [[shrub]] layer containing [[Acacia myrtifolia|myrtle wattle]], [[Acacia mearnsii|black wattle]], [[Pultenaea gunnii|golden bush-pea]], [[Cassinia arcuata|drooping cassinia]], [[Leptospermum myrsinoides|heath tea-tree]], [[Epacris impressa|common heath]], [[Xanthorrhoea minor|small grass-tree]], [[Pteridium esculentum|austral bracken]] and [[Poa sieberiana|grey tussock-grass]].&lt;ref name=afo&gt;Loyn et al. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims and achievements==
The original aim of Gordon Clarke was to provide a habitat for birds that was richer in food resources than native forest, and towards that end most of his early plantings were of [[nectar]]-producing shrubs and trees, especially from [[Western Australia]].  He refused to plant the local stringybarks and scent-barks as they did not fit within that vision.  This has resulted in areas of Clarke’s plantings benefiting some species of honeyeaters, such as [[New Holland honeyeater]]s and [[red wattlebird]]s, to the point where they are much more common there than in native forest.  On the other hand, birds such as [[Australasian treecreeper|treecreepers]] have benefited far less and are more common in adjacent native forest.&lt;ref name=afo/&gt;

The current vision for the sanctuary however, as stated in the 1999 management plan, is ‘to optimise, manage and create habitat at Linton as a Sanctuary to increase the diversity and populations of native birds in perpetuity’.&lt;ref name=afo/&gt;  The main aim of the management program is to help reverse the decline of the woodland bird community, which is listed as a [[threatened]] [[community (ecology)|community]] under Victoria’s [[Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988]].  Clarkesdale was a finalist in Category 6 (Protecting Bush, Land and Waterways) of the 2003 [[Banksia Environmental Foundation|Banksia Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;CBS achievements.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|clausula in medieval music|Clausula (music)}}

In Roman rhetoric, a '''clausula''' /'klɔːzi̯ʊlə/ (Latin "little close or conclusion"; plural ''clausulae'' /'klɔːzi̯ʊli/) was a [[Foot (prosody)|rhythmic figure]] used to add finesse and finality to the end of a sentence or phrase. There was a large range of popular clausulae. Most well known is the classically Ciceronian ''esse videatur'' type.

Every long sentence can be divided into rhythmical ''cola'' (singular ''colon''), in Latin ''membra'' (singular ''membrum''), and the last few syllables of every colon tend to conform to certain favourite rhythmic patterns, which are known as ''clausulae''.&lt;ref&gt;Habinek (1985), pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter ''cola'' were known as ''commata'' /ˈkɒmətə/ (singular ''comma''), in Latin ''incisa'' (singular ''incisum''), which also often display rhythmic endings.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham (1957), p. 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clausulae in Cicero's speeches==

The constant use of clausulae in Cicero's speeches was first thoroughly investigated by the Polish philologist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|Tadeusz Zieliński]] in a monumental work published in German in 1904, following an earlier dissertation by G. Wüst in 1881 and work by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905).&lt;/ref&gt; Zieliński established that a Ciceronian clausula had two parts: a "base", generally a cretic | – u – | or a variation on it, and a "cadence", generally of a [[trochee|trochaic]] rhythm such as | – x |, | – u x |, or | – u – x |.&lt;ref name=Sre150&gt;Srebrny (1947 (2013)), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; (Here "–" indicates a long syllable, "u" a short syllable, and "x" a syllable which can be either long or short.)

The most common clausulae in Cicero are the following:&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*| – u – | – x | and variations (32.4% of Cicero's clausulae)
*| – x – | – u x | (24.4%)
*| – x – | – u – x | (30.1%)

Variations may include resolving one of the long syllables in the rhythm into two short ones, for example | – u uu | – x | (''esse videatur'') instead of | – u – | – x |. Another type of allowable variation is to substitute | – uu – | or | – u – – | for the base.&lt;ref name=Cla167&gt;Clark (1905), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above clausulae account for about 87% of Cicero's clausulae. Other clausulae are rarer. For example, the cadence may have five elements | – u – u – | or consist of two [[spondee]]s | – – – – |. This last type (commoner in Livy than in Cicero) is compared by Zieliński to the blows of a hammer.&lt;ref name=Cla167 /&gt; Certain clausulae, such as the [[hexameter]] ending | – u u | – x |, were avoided (it occurs in Cicero, but only in about 0.6% of cases, and often for a reason such a mock-heroic description).&lt;ref&gt;Berry (1996), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Zieliński noted that Cicero's preferences changed gradually over the years. For example, the rhythm | – – – | – u x | was more common in his earlier speeches, while from his consulate onwards he preferred the lighter | – u – | – u x |.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zieliński, it is a principle of clausulae that the word-accent tends to follow the ictus of the feet, that is, there is usually an accent on the first syllable of the base and on the penultimate long syllable of the cadence, e.g. ''ílla tempéstas'', ''egéstas audácia'', ''incéndium civitátis'', ''Cáesari d(e) eius áctis'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are often exceptions to this rule, and Cicero was not so strict as later writers such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Arnobius]].&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Dennison (1970), §16, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt that the skilful use of clausulae was one of the techniques which an orator used to excite an audience. Cicero writes of one occasion when the use of a certain clausula (a dichoreus or double [[trochee]] – u – x) by the orator [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo|Carbo the Younger]] was so effective that the audience all gave a shout.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 214; cf. Adams (2013), p. 8; Cunningham (1957), p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples from Cicero==
An example of Cicero's use of clausulae in a speech is given below, with the two sentences divided into cola:&lt;ref&gt;Grillo (2015), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Ecce '''ílla tempéstas''', | – u – | – – | 
::cālīgo bonorum et subita atque impro'''vísa formído''', | – u – | – – | 
::téne'''brae rei públicae''', | – u – | – u – |

::inimicus esse '''débui, nón nego'''. | – u – | – u – |&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Provinciis consularibus'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Behold that storm, the gloom of good men and a sudden and unforeseen fear, the darkness of the republic, the ruin and conflagration of the state, terror given to Caesar concerning his acts, fear of slaughter for all good men, the wickedness, greed, indigence, and audacity of the consuls! If I was not helped, I did not deserve it; if I was deserted, perhaps he was providing for his own safety; if I was even attacked, as certain people either think or wish, our friendship was violated, I received an injury; I should have been his enemy, I do not deny it."

The "heroic clausula" (– uu – x), which resembles a hexameter ending, is rare but can be used for comic effect, as in the following quotation from ''pro Caelio'':&lt;ref&gt;''pro Caelio'' §63; cf. Adams (2013), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
::In '''bálneis delituérunt''': | – u – | – uu – – |
::'''téstis egrégios'''! | – – – | uu – |
::'''Déin temerē prósiluérunt''': | – uu – | – uu – – |
::'''homines témperántis'''! | uu – | – u – – |

:"They hid in the baths. Outstanding witnesses! Then they rashly leapt out. Cool-headed men!"

As Adams points out, the passage is made even more funny by the pun on ''testes'', which can mean "testicles" as well as "witnesses".

The following passage from the 2nd Catilinarian oration shows some of the less commonly used cadences, including the five-syllable | – u – u – | and the "hammer-blow" spondaic | – – – – |:&lt;ref&gt;''in Catilinam'' 6; cf. Riggsby (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; 
::Non est iam '''lénitatí locus'''; | – u – | – u – |
::severi'''tátem res ípsa flágitat'''. | – – – | – u – u – |

::si accelerare volent, ad '''vésperam cónsequéntur'''. | – u – | – u – – |

:"There is no place for leniency any longer; the situation itself calls for severity. But one thing I will concede even now: let them go out, let them depart; let them not allow Catiline to pine away miserably with desire for them. I will show them the route: he departed by the Aurelian Way. If they are willing to hurry, by evening they will catch up with him."

It is characteristic of the emphatic spondaic ending (– – – –) that in Cicero there is always a word-break between the base and the cadence. With the clausula – u – – x on the other hand, as in ''illa tempestas'', the most usual place for a word-break is after the second syllable.&lt;ref name="Cla167"/&gt;

The following passage from the ''pro Scauro'' is analysed explicitly by Cicero himself into four ''incisa'' (commata), followed by two ''membra'' (cola), and then a long spondaic period ending in a ''dichoreus'' or double trochee:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 222–26; analysed in Cunningham (1957), pp. 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt;
::do'''mús tibi déerat'''? at habébas. | u | – u – | – – || uu – – |
::pe'''cúnia superábat'''? at egébas. | u | – u uu | – – || uu – – |
::incur'''ríst(i) amens ín colúmnas''', | – – | – – – | – u – – |

::pluris quam t(e) et quam fortu'''nás tuas áestimásti'''. | – – – – – – – | – u – | – u – – |

:"Did you lack a house? No, you already had one. Did you have enough money? No, you didn't have any. You ran madly into the columns, you raged crazily against other people's slaves; you reckoned a decrepit, dark, fallen down house as worth more than yourself and your fortunes."

Cicero comments that the ''incisa'' (commata), because of their shortness, are rather freer in their rhythm, and should be used "like little daggers". The rhythmical period (''numerosa comprehensio''), he says, is a longer sentence composed of at least two cola, and is more sparingly used. The style which consists of a mixture of commata, cola, and the occasional longer period is particularly effective, he says, in passages arguing a case or refuting one.

==Clausulae in other writers==
Clausulae are found not only in Cicero but in many Roman (as well as Greek and medieval) writers, especially in oratory but also in other types of writing. Each writer has their own preferences and "rhythmic signature".&lt;ref name=Sre150 /&gt; For example, Livy avoids clausulae which are common in Cicero, such as | – u – | – x |, but frequently ends a sentence with a series of long syllables, for example ''legati Roman(i) occurrērunt''.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 167, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest orator to make extensive use of rhythmic prose in Greek is said to have been the sophist [[Thrasymachus]] of Chalcedon (the same person who appears as a speaker in book 1 of Plato's ''Republic'').&lt;ref name=Cla164&gt;Clark (1905), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] himself favoured the clausulae | – u – | – u x |, | – – – | – u x |, and | – u u | – u x |, among others. His preferences changed in the course of his life, and he used | u u u x | and | – u u u – x | more often in the later works.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysias]], [[Aeschines]], [[Isaeus]], [[Plutarch]] and others also had their own preferences. Clausulae are prominent in the orations of [[Demosthenes]], especially the ditrochaeus (– u – x), dispondaeus (– – – x), cretic + trochee (– u – – x), and choriamb + trochee (– uu – – x).&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt; But his most characteristic practice (known as "Blass's Law") is to avoid series of more than three short syllables anywhere in his sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers such as [[Thucydides]], wrote prose almost free of rhythmical influence, however.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin, rhythmical prose was characteristic of the so-called "Asiatic" style of oratory, whereas followers of the plainer "Attic" style avoided it.&lt;ref name="Cla164"/&gt; The younger [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Suetonius]], [[Apuleius]] and [[Tertullian]] more or less followed the Ciceronian pattern, though several writers avoided | – – – | – u x | and the famous ''esse videatur'' clausula, as being overly Ciceronian.&lt;ref name=Cla164 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §17f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval clausulae (''cursus'')==

In the medieval period, Latin ceased to be pronounced in a quantitative way, and clausulae tended to be accentual rather than based on quantity. Three end-of-sentence rhythms were especially favoured, the so called ''planus'' (– x x – x) (where – indicates an accented syllable and x an unaccented one), the ''tardus'' (– x x – x x), and the ''velox'' (– x x x x – x). These rhythms are found for example in the writings of [[Gregory of Tours]] (6th century), [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and [[Héloïse]] (12th century), and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] (13th-14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §21.&lt;/ref&gt; They are known to modern scholars (although apparently not to the medieval writers themselves) as ''cursus''. However, not all writers made use of them.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 114-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The professors of the period specified that the last word of the sentence had to be of either three or four syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Tunberg (1996), pp. 115-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient writers on clausulae==
The first writer to mention rhythm in prose is [[Aristotle]] in his ''Ars Rhetorica''; he says that prose should not be entirely metrical, like poetry, but also not unrhythmical either.&lt;ref&gt;1408b; cf. Adams (2013), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero himself discusses the use of clausulae in his books on oratory, especially in ''[[de Oratore]]'' 173-198, and ''[[Orator]]'' 204-226.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), pp. 164-5; Adams (2013), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terentianus|Terentianus Maurus]] (c. 290 AD) also discusses clausulae in a work itself written in verse. He says of the cretic (– u –) that it is the best kind of foot, especially when used in penultimate position before a dactyl (– u x).&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1905), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher of rhetoric [[Quintilian]] treats clausulae at length, especially in books 5 and 9; like Terentianus, he approves of the double cretic | – u – | – u x |,&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.107; Clark (1905), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; but recommends avoiding the heroic clausula | – x – | – uu – x |, since it too much resembles the end of a line of verse.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.102; Clark (1905), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of clausula-study==
The analysis of a piece of Latin into cola and clausulae can not only of help the modern student to read the passage with authentic phrasing, but also is a useful tool in investigating an author's style. So, for example, Riggsby notes that the cola in the earlier part of the 2nd Catilinarian oration are shorter, and the clausulae more varied, than in the last paragraph. He takes this as an indication of Cicero's shift in emphasis from chaos and danger to peace and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Riggsby (2010), pp. 101-102; cf. Adams (2013), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the clausulae will throw light on the writer's choice of word, tense or word order.&lt;ref name=Cla171&gt;Clark (1905), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''patent portae, proficiscere!''&lt;ref&gt;''In Catilinam'' 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt; "the gates are open; depart!" makes an effective clausula, whereas *''portae patent, proficiscere'' does not. Clausulae can also help editors decide which of two manuscript readings is the correct one, or whether an editor's conjecture is acceptable.&lt;ref name=Cla170&gt;Clark (1905), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausulae have sometimes helped editors to decide on the authenticity or otherwise of a work. For example, the speech ''de domo sua'', whose authorship was once in doubt, has been shown to exhibit exactly the same proportions of clausulae as Cicero's other speeches.&lt;ref name=Cla171 /&gt; In the case of authors whose practice varied over the years, such as Plato, clausulae analysis can throw light on the date of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Shewring &amp; Denniston (1970), §22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From examining the clausulae it is sometimes possible to uncover the exact pronunciation of individual words by a particular author. For example, it appears that Cicero pronounced ''redduco'' "I bring back" and ''relliquus'' "remaining" with a long first syllable, as did [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; ''Nōn modō'' "not only" was pronounced with the last vowel long. For ordinary nouns ending in ''-ium'' or ''-ius'', the genitive ''-i'' was preferred by Cicero (e.g. ''iudici'' "of the trial"), although in proper names such as ''Clodii'' "of Clodius" the ending "-ii" was often used. In ''nil'' and ''nihil'' "nothing" and ''periculum'' and ''periclum'' "danger" both forms occur.&lt;ref name=Cla170 /&gt; In the future perfect tense, as in ''fecerīmus'' "we'll have made", it appears that Cicero, contrary to the rule given in some grammars such as Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, B. ''Revised Latin Primer'', 1962 ed. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced the "i" long, as did his contemporary [[Catullus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fordyce, C.J. (1961) ''Catullus: A commentary'', note on 5.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nephology''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɪ|ˈ|f|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; from the Greek word ''nephos'' for 'cloud') is the study of [[cloud]]s and cloud formation. British meteorologist [[Luke Howard]] was a major researcher within this field, establishing a [[Cloud#Classification|cloud classification system]].

While this branch of [[meteorology]] still exists today, the term nephology, or nephologist is rarely used.  The term came into use at the end of the nineteenth century, and fell out of common use by the middle of the twentieth.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Party politics}}

The '''conservation movement''', also known as '''nature conservation''', is a political, environmental, and social movement that seeks to protect [[natural resource]]s including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future.

The early conservation movement included [[fisheries]] and wildlife management, water, [[soil]] conservation, and [[sustainable forestry]]. The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of [[wilderness]] areas to include preservation of [[biodiversity]]. Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far-reaching [[environmental movement]], while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice. Chiefly in the United States, conservation is seen as differing from [[environmentalism]] in that it aims to preserve natural resources expressly for their continued [[sustainable]] use by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of environmental events}}

===Early history===
[[File:Sylva paper 1662.jpg|right|thumb| ''Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty's Dominions,'' title page of the first edition (1664).]]
The conservation movement can be traced back to [[John Evelyn]]'s work ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]'', presented as a paper to the [[Royal Society]] in 1662. Published as a book two years later, it was one of the most highly influential texts on [[forestry]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Evelyn]], ''Sylva, Or A Discourse of Forest Trees ... with an Essay on the Life and Works of the Author by John Nisbet'', Fourth Edition (1706), reprinted London: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1908, V1, p. lxv; online edn, March 2007 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20778/20778-h/20778-h.htm], accessed 29 Dec 2012. This source (John Nisbet) states: "There can be no doubt that John Evelyn, both during his own lifetime and throughout the two centuries which have elapsed since his death in 1706, has exerted more individual influence, through his charming ''Sylva'', ... than can be ascribed to any other individual." Nisbet adds that "Evelyn was by no means the first [author] who wrote on [forestry]. That honour belongs to Master [[Anthony Fitzherbert|Fitzherbert]], whose ''Boke of Husbandrie'' was published in 1534" (V1, p. lxvi).&lt;/ref&gt; Timber resources in England were becoming dangerously depleted at the time, and Evelyn advocated the importance of conserving the forests by managing the rate of depletion and ensuring that the cut down trees get replenished.

The field developed during the 18th century, especially in [[Prussia]] and France where scientific forestry methods were developed. These methods were first applied rigorously in [[British India]] from the early-19th century. The government was interested in the use of [[forest produce]] and began managing the forests with measures to reduce the risk of wildfire in order to protect the "household" of nature, as it was then termed. This early ecological idea was in order to preserve the growth of delicate [[teak]] trees, which was an important resource for the [[Royal Navy]]. Concerns over teak depletion were raised as early as 1799 and 1805 when the Navy was undergoing a massive expansion during the [[Napoleonic War]]s; this pressure led to the first formal conservation Act, which prohibited the felling of small teak trees. The first forestry officer was appointed in 1806 to regulate and preserve the trees necessary for shipbuilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edugreen.teri.res.in/explore/forestry/history.htm|title=History of forests in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; This promising start received a setback in the 1820s and 30s, when [[laissez-faire]] economics and complaints from private landowners brought these early conservation attempts to an end.

===Origins of the modern conservation movement===
Conservation was revived in the mid-19th century, with the first practical application of scientific conservation principles to the forests of India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Percy Stebbing]] warned of desertification of India. The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barton |first=Greg |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=9781139434607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These local attempts gradually received more attention by the British government as the unregulated felling of trees continued unabated. In 1850, the [[British Association]] in Edinburgh formed a committee to study forest destruction at the behest of [[Hugh Francis Cleghorn|Dr. Hugh Cleghorn]] a pioneer in the nascent conservation movement.

He had become interested in [[Sustainable forest management|forest conservation]] in [[Mysore]] in 1847 and gave several lectures at the Association on the failure of agriculture in India. These lectures influenced the government under [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] to introduce the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]].

Sir [[Dietrich Brandis]], a [[Germany|German]] forester, joined the British service in 1856 as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern [[Myanmar|Burma]]. During that time Burma's [[teak]] forests were controlled by militant [[Karen people|Karen]] tribals. He introduced the "taungya" system,&lt;ref&gt;King KFS (1968). "Agro-silviculture (the taungya system)". University of Ibadan / Dept. of Forestry, Bulletin no. 1, 109&lt;/ref&gt; in which Karen villagers provided labour for clearing, planting and weeding teak plantations. After seven years in Burma, Brandis was appointed Inspector General of Forests in India, a position he served in for 20 years. He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions. The [[Imperial Forest School]] at [[Dehradun]] was founded by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weil|first1=Benjamin|title=Conservation, Exploitation, and Cultural Change in the Indian Forest Service, 1875-1927|journal=Environmental History|date=1 April 2006|volume=11|issue=2|pages=319–343|doi=10.1093/envhis/11.2.319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233861694_Conservation_Exploitation_and_Cultural_Change_in_the_Indian_Forest_Service_1875-1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madhav Gadgil and Ramachandra Guha, ''This Fissured Land: An Ecological History of India'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Germans were prominent in the forestry administration of British India. As well as Brandis, [[Berthold Ribbentrop]] and [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] brought new methods to Indian conservation, the latter becoming the Inspector-General in 1883 after Brandis stepped down. Schlich helped to establish the journal ''[[Indian Forester]]'' in 1874, and became the founding director of the first [[forestry]] school in England at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Burley, Jeffery, et al. 2009.

The American movement received its inspiration from 19th century works that exalted the inherent value of nature, quite apart from human usage. Author [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817-1862) made key philosophical contributions that exalted nature. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]],'' which argued that people should become intimately close with nature. The ideas of [[Dietrich Brandis|Sir Brandis]], [[Sir William P.D. Schlich]] and [[Carl A. Schenck]] were also very influential - [[Gifford Pinchot]], the first chief of the [[USDA Forest Service]], relied heavily upon Brandis' advice for introducing professional forest management in the U.S. and on how to structure the Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20(Brett%20M%20Benet).htm America has been the context for both the origins of conservation history and its modern form, environmental history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313144333/http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Golden_jubilee_vol/articles/H_468%20%28Brett%20M%20Benet%29.htm |date=2012-03-13 }}.

Both conservationists and preservationists appeared in political debates during the [[Progressive Era]] (the 1890s&amp;mdash;early 1920s). There were three main positions. The laissez-faire position held that owners of private property—including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Hays, ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservationists, led by future President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[George Bird Grinnell]], were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market forces, including logging and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Redekop, "Embodying the Story: The Conservation Leadership of Theodore Roosevelt" in ''Leadership'' (2015).  DOI: 10.1177/1742715014546875.  [http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114045519/http://cnu.edu/leadershipstudies/faculty/pdf/redekop-embodying_the_story_theodore_roosevelts_conservation_leadership.pdf |date=2016-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction. Roosevelt recognized that the laissez-faire approach of the U.S. Government was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. To accomplish the mission, Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] in 1887. The Club was made up of the best minds and influential men of the day. The [[Boone and Crockett Club]]'s contingency of conservationists, scientists, politicians, and intellectuals became Roosevelt's closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives of the Boone and Crockett Club|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p16013coll13/id/1220/rec/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preservationists, led by [[John Muir]] (1838–1914), argued that the conservation policies were not strong enough to protect the interest of the natural world because they continued to focus on the natural world as a source of economic production.

The debate between conservation and preservation reached its peak in the public debates over the construction of California's [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] which supplies the water supply of San Francisco. Muir, leading the [[Sierra Club]], declared that the valley must be preserved for the sake of its beauty: "No holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man."

President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] put conservationist issue high on the national agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas G. Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter, [[Gifford Pinchot]] and was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He encouraged the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 930,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more federal land for [[national park]]s and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.&lt;ref&gt;W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservations Legacy'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TR-Enviro.JPG|Thumb|250px|right|Roosevelt was a leader in conservation, fighting to end the waste of natural resources]]

Roosevelt established the [[United States Forest Service]], signed into law the creation of five [[National parks (United States)|national parks]], and signed the year 1906 [[Antiquities Act]], under which he proclaimed 18 new [[National Monument (United States)|national monuments]]. He also established the first 51 [[bird reserve]]s, four [[game preserve]]s, and 150 [[United States National Forest|national forests]], including [[Shoshone National Forest]], the nation's first. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately {{convert|230000000|acre|km2}}.

[[Gifford Pinchot]] had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture. In 1905, his department gained control of the national forest reserves.  Pinchot promoted private use (for a fee) under federal supervision. In 1907, Roosevelt designated 16 million acres (65,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of new national forests just minutes before a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Char Miller, ''Seeking the Greatest Good: The Conservation Legacy of Gifford Pinchot'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1908, Roosevelt sponsored the [[Conference of Governors]] held in the White House, with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use. Roosevelt delivered the opening address: "Conservation as a National Duty.".

In 1903 Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with [[John Muir]], who had a very different view of conservation, and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests.  Working through the Sierra Club he founded, Muir succeeded in 1905 in having Congress transfer the [[Mariposa Grove]] and Yosemite Valley to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 26, Chap. 1263, pp. 650-52.

Theodore Roosevelt's view on conservationism remained dominant for decades; - [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] authorised the building of many large-scale dams and water projects, as well as the expansion of the National Forest System to buy out sub-marginal farms.  In 1937, the [[Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act]] was signed into law, providing funding for state agencies to carry out their conservation efforts.

====Since 1970====
Environmental reemerged on the national agenda in 1970, with Republican [[Richard Nixon]] playing a major role, especially with his creation of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. The debates over the public lands and environmental politics played a supporting role in the decline of liberalism and the rise of modern environmentalism. Although Americans consistently rank environmental issues as "important", polling data indicates that in the voting booth voters rank the environmental issues low relative to other political concerns.

The growth of the Republican party's political power in the inland West (apart from the Pacific coast) was facilitated by the rise of popular opposition to public lands reform.  Successful Democrats in the inland West and Alaska typically take more conservative positions on environmental issues than Democrats from the Coastal states.  Conservatives drew on new organizational networks of think tanks, industry groups, and citizen-oriented organizations, and they began to deploy new strategies that affirmed the rights of individuals to their property, protection of extraction rights, to hunt and recreate, and to pursue happiness unencumbered by the federal government at the expense of resource conservation.&lt;ref&gt;* Turner, James Morton, "The Specter of Environmentalism": Wilderness, Environmental Politics, and the Evolution of the New Right.

=== Conservation in Costa Rica ===
[[File:Areas Conservacion CR.svg|thumb|Figure 1. Costa Rica divided into different areas of conservation]]

Although the conservation movement developed in Europe in the 18th century, [[Costa Rica]] as a country has been heralded its champion in the current times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/costa-rica-biodiversity|title=Costa Rica recognised for biodiversity protection|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2010-10-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica hosts an astonishing number of species, given its size, having more animal and plant species than the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]] combined&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while being only 250 miles long and 150 miles wide. A widely accepted theory for the origin of this unusual density of species is the free mixing of species from both North and South America occurring on this "inter-oceanic" and "inter-continental" landscape.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Preserving the natural environment of this fragile landscape, therefore, has drawn the attention of many international scholars.

Costa Rica has made conservation a national priority, and has been at the forefront of preserving its natural environment with over a quarter of its land designated as protected in some form, which is under the administrative control of [[National System of Conservation Areas|SINAC]] (National System of Conservation Areas) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|title=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html|website=inbio.ac.cr|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of [[Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications|MINAE]] (Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications). SINAC has subdivided the country into various zones depending on the ecological diversity of that region - these zones are depicted in figure 1.

The country has used this ecological diversity to its economic advantage in the form of a thriving [[Ecotourism in Costa Rica|ecotourism industry]], putting its commitment to nature, on display to visitors from across the globe. It is estimated that a record 2.6 million foreigners visited the country in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/01/16/costa-rica-welcomes-2-6-million-tourists-2015-hits-new-record|title=Costa Rica tourism sets new record with 2.6 million visitors in 2015|work=The Tico Times Costa Rica|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost half the population of Costa Rica itself. This tourism is facilitated by the fact that Costa Rica has a stable democracy and has a [[human development index]] of 0.776, the highest for any country in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/CRI|title={{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the only country in the world that generates more than 99% of its electricity from renewable sources, relying on hydropower (78%), wind (10%), geothermal energy (10%), biomass and solar (1%). Critics have pointed out however, that in achieving this milestone, the country has built several dams (providing the bulk of its electricity) some of which have negatively impacted indigenous communities as well as the local flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/costa-rica-electricity-renewable-energy-300-days-2017-record-wind-hydro-solar-water-a8069111.html|title=Costa Rica runs entirely on renewable energy for 300 days this year|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historical development ====
[[File:16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean.png|thumb|Figure 2. 16th century Spanish expansion in the Caribbean]]
"The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica" by Sterling Evans is a renowned book that traces the development of the conservation movement in Costa Rica from the mid 1700s to present day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=NckTGXhHZgQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=The+Green+Republic:+A+Conservation+History+of+Costa+Rica,&amp;ots=83nGtAQb-k&amp;sig=sg06Dd_009atdW-IjCOB_in1xM4#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Green%20Republic:%20A%20Conservation%20History%20of%20Costa%20Rica,&amp;f=false|title=The Green Republic: A Conservation History of Costa Rica|last=Evans|first=Sterling|date=2010-06-28|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292789289|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans mentions that when the Spaniards first arrived in the Americas, the landscape of Costa Rica did not appear particularly hospitable to them, compared to Guatemala or Mexico which seemed more reminiscent of the Spanish climate. Therefore, up until the 18th century, there was very little agricultural development in the region. It also lacked gold and other minerals that [[Christopher Columbus]] had hoped to find in these areas (hence the name, Rich Coast). As a result, the forest cover of Costa Rica was left more or less intact by the European settlement in the Americas.

By the mid-19th century, it was observed that the Costa Rican soil was particularly conducive to the growth of coffee. The global demand for coffee was growing rapidly, fueled by the demand from the working class in the industrializing west. The agricultural model adopted by coffee growers in Costa Rica was of small family owned farms known as ''cafeteras,'' and they strove to be responsible stewards of the land. This approach was in stark contrast to the coffee [[monoculture]] that would've developed by adopting a purely capitalistic ideology. As a result, even though the coffee production increased substantially from 1850 to 1950, there wasn't large scale deforestation in Costa Rica until the 1950s, contrary to popular belief.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some of the key points often overlooked in Costa Rica's conservation history between 1850 and 2000 according to Evans, are as follows:

1. President Bernardo Soto's government in 1888 began the process of attracting scholars from all over the world, particularly Switzerland and Germany in an effort to educate the locals about agricultural practices harmonious with the environment such that by 1914, Costa Rica became a leading scientific research center in tropical America

2. The establishment of the [[University of Costa Rica]] (UCR) in the 1940s was a landmark event, since the university acted as a springboard for research into tropical studies in Central America. At the helm of UCR were many influential academics such as [[Rafael Lucas Rodríguez]] and [[Alexander Skutch]] whose forward thinking publications served as a foundation for the future policy decisions. Skutch noted,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"&lt;small&gt;in the mid-1930s, Costa Rica was still largely unspoiled. Its population of less than a half a million people . . .was concentrated in the narrow Meseta Central. . . . Other advantages . . . to the naturalist were its political stability and the friendliness of its people. . . . Costa Rica has a record of continuous, orderly constitutional government that scarcely any other country in Latin America can match. Thus the naturalist working in some remote spot was not likely to have his studies suddenly interrupted or his thin lines of communication cut by a violent upheaval, as has happened to many in Latin America. .&lt;/small&gt;"

3. By 1950, Costa Rica became heavily reliant on coffee exports to Europe and the US. Around the same time, it was battling the dilemma between increasing agricultural output on one hand and protecting natural resources for future use on the other. In 1958, however, the world coffee prices plummeted, and Costa Rica's main source of income was shown to be very vulnerable to unpredictable forces. The government responded by promoting internal manufacturing and encouraging other industries. One such industry that emerged as a result, was the meat industry.

The Central American valley has been described as "perfect for cattle" by [[Carl Hoffman]]. Until 1970, the cattle raised in Costa Rica were primarily used for domestic consumption. Around 1970, the demand for beef from the US started showing an exponential growth due to the rise of the fast-food industry. This robust demand, coupled with the falling coffee prices gave the cattle industry a boost and forests started getting replaced with pastures. At its worst, Costa Rica was losing 4% of its forested area per year.

An alternative analysis by Julia Flagg within the framework of "[[Process tracing|process-tracing]]" reveals that after gaining independence in 1821 the isolation of Costa Rica from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua was critical in shaping its future and served as a divergence point in the evolution of the Central American nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flagg|first=Julia A.|date=2018-01-24|title=Carbon Neutral by 2021: The Past and Present of Costa Rica’s Unusual Political Tradition|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/2/296|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=296|doi=10.3390/su10020296}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahoney &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511750328|title=Colonialism and Postcolonial Development|last=Mahoney|first=James|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511750328|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; “ . . . while all of the other provinces quickly became engulfed in warfare and political chaos, Costa Rica escaped such devastation and made tentative economic strides forward”. She also argues that the lack of a land-owning elite class in Costa Rica was instrumental in the development of good governance and  maintaining a stable democracy in the country. The abolishing of the military in 1948 helped free up valuable resources that the government chose to invest into education and resource protection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The country entered into a positive reinforcement cycle thereafter, where new laws enacted drew international praise which helped solidify Costa Rica's position as global leader in resource protection .

==== Examples of active efforts ====

===== Environmental Services Program =====
To counter reducing forest area coverage in the 1980's, the Costa Rican government pioneered a [[Payment for ecosystem services#Costa Rica|scheme]] in 1997 known as ''PES'', which rewarded private land owners for keeping forests intact on their lands in lieu of the services provided by these forests to the environment and the economy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iied.org/payments-for-ecosystem-services-costa-rica-s-recipe|title=Payments for ecosystem services: Costa Rica’s recipe|date=2013-11-29|work=International Institute for Environment and Development|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank, which provided the loan initially from 2000 to 2006 to support the payments incentivizing afforestation, viewed the program as a success overall despite some of its shortcomings.

It is estimated that the percentage of Costa Rican land covered by forests has gone up from around 20% in the 1980's to over 50% of the total area in 2013 - a growth of 250%. The program has also reduced the national carbon emissions by 11 million tons over a period of 6 years from 1999 to 2005. Indigenous communities and women in particular, have benefited due to this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2015/12/16/costa-rica-improves-the-efficiency-of-its-payment-for-environmental-services-program|title=Costa Rica Improves the Efficiency of its Payment for Environmental Services Program|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buoyed by this success, the World Bank extended its support to the Costa Rican government's initiative by funding a new program titled "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P093384/mainstreaming-market-based-instruments-environmental-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects  : Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, many international agencies have pushed the national government to make the process of obtaining the payments easier so as to include more underdeveloped communities and cast a wider net for the program.

===== Green sea turtle conservation =====
[[File:Green sea turtle (1).jpg|thumb|A Green sea turtle]]
The [[green sea turtle]] is a globally endangered species and one of the most important nesting grounds for it is in [[Tortuguero National Park|Tortuguero]], Costa Rica&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-01-01|title=Long-term conservation efforts contribute to positive green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting trend at Tortuguero, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320704001715|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=121|issue=1|pages=111–116|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.04.014|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the word Totuguero is derived from old Spanish maps meaning "place of turtles". After a steady global decline in its population due to overhunting for its meat and eggs, the Tortuguero National Park was established in 1975 in an effort to protect and save the turtle's breeding zone. A highly cited study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by Tröeng and Rankin, investigated in 2004, the effects that this protective measure has had on the nesting trend. Although the population of turtles shows a large inter-annual variation thus making the task of determining the exact number very difficult, on an average, the trend has been positive over a long time scale of almost 35 years. The study illustrated that the enactment of three laws by the Costa Rican government was vital in stabilizing and increasing the population of these green sea turtles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1. A ban on turtle and egg collection in 1963

2. A ban on the export of [[calipee]] (a part of the turtle's head that is considered a delicacy) in 1970 and finally,

3. The creation of the Tortuguero National Park in 1975 by the legislative assembly.

The lasting impact created by such forward thinking political decisions exhibits the necessity of meaningful governmental intervention.

===== Carbon neutral goal =====
[[File:EARTH-La Flor Campus Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom of [[EARTH University|Earth University]] in Costa Rica - a carbon neutral university]]
Although they contribute only 0.15% to the world's [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], the governments of New Zealand and Costa Rica&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5439|title=Costa Rica and New Zealand on Path to Carbon Neutrality {{!}} Worldwatch Institute|website=worldwatch.org|language=cust-en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently expressed their intents to become carbon neutral in the next decade, with Costa Rica aiming to achieve an ambitious target of becoming carbon neutral by 2021.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-promotes-carbon-neutral-program-2021/|title=Costa Rica Promotes the Carbon Neutral Program in 2021 {{!}} The Costa Rica News|last=Villegas|first=Charito|date=2017-11-14|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, it would become the world's first carbon neutral country, with the expectation of influencing policy decisions in other major countries. The proposal hopes to ignite the interest of private companies to engage in practices that reduce their emissions, for example, using more fuel efficient routes in transportation, relying more on digital documents than printed ones, adopting LED lighting in offices and using more efficient air conditioning systems.

==== Criticisms of active efforts ====
The government's approach to attain zero net emissions has yielded positive results overall, but has been described as insufficient and lacking by experts &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; because it neglects vehicular emissions which account for nearly 20% of the country's total emissions. The 2021 target has also been called "arbitrary" and "overambitious", since the efforts to reduce the country's reliance on imported oil &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-carbon-neutral-2021-reality-or-unrealistic/|title=Costa Rica Carbon Neutral 2021: Reality or Unrealistic?|last=STAFF|first=TCRN|date=2014-07-21|work=The Costa Rica News|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; will take much longer to take effect.

In 2006, a study by Sierra and Russman&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-08-05|title=On the efficiency of environmental service payments: A forest conservation assessment in the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905004982|journal=Ecological Economics|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=131–141|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.010|issn=0921-8009}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the additional conservation obtained through PES, over and above the baseline conservation rate. The study concluded that the PES program definitely affected land use decisions because land owners used the payments for other productive activities thus keeping the forest cover intact. However, they also concluded that this was not the most effective use of funds because the majority of these forests would have remained intact even without the payments. The study suggested that it would a better strategy to engage in the protection of more critical habitats instead.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;    
[[File:Represa Hidroeléctrica Reventazón, Costa Rica (1).jpg|thumb|The Reventazón Dam has come under criticism recently for the loss of habitat it has caused for many species]]

Protestors of this project claim that the construction has failed to meet the expectations on the following issues:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

1) The constructors did not completely clear vegetation from the areas that would be flooded due to this project. As a result, the uncleared vegetation in the flooded areas began to stagnate, creating the perfect conditions for the growth of the [[Eichhornia crassipes|Water Hyacinth]] (an invasive species). The Water Hyacinth acted as a source for a large amount of carbon dioxide and methane emitted into the atmosphere.

2) Reforestation around the reservoir lake to assist in the migration of the jaguars has not been completed making their movement more difficult.

3) Due to the removal of a lot of material to facilitate construction, the neighboring Lancaster wetlands (home to more than 250 species of birds and 80 species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians) have been left in a state more susceptible to landslides.

What appears to be common in these criticisms is that the initiatives have moved things in the right direction overall, but the implementation hasn't been as good as promised.

== Areas of concern ==
[[Deforestation]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] are issues affecting all regions of the world.  The consequent destruction of wildlife habitat has prompted the creation of conservation groups in other countries, some founded by local hunters who have witnessed declining wildlife populations first hand.  Also, it was highly important for the conservation movement to solve problems of living conditions in the cities and the overpopulation of such places.

=== Boreal forest and the Arctic ===
The idea of incentive conservation is a modern one but its practice has clearly defended some of the sub Arctic wildernesses and the wildlife in those regions for thousands of years, especially by indigenous peoples such as the Evenk, Yakut, Sami, Inuit and Cree. The fur trade and hunting by these peoples have preserved these regions for thousands of years. Ironically, the pressure now upon them comes from non-renewable resources such as oil, sometimes to make synthetic clothing which is advocated as a humane substitute for fur. (See [[Raccoon dog]] for case study of the conservation of an animal through fur trade.) Similarly, in the case of the beaver, hunting and fur trade were thought to bring about the animal's demise, when in fact they were an integral part of its conservation. For many years children's books stated and still do, that the decline in the beaver population was due to the fur trade. In reality however, the decline in beaver numbers was because of habitat destruction and deforestation, as well as its continued persecution as a pest (it causes flooding). In Cree lands however, where the population valued the animal for meat and fur, it continued to thrive. The Inuit defend their relationship with the seal in response to outside critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf|title=Inuit Ask Europeans to Support Its Seal Hunt and Way of Life|date=6 March 2006|accessdate=12 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628204105/http://www.icc.gl/UserFiles/File/sealskin/2006-03-07_icc_saelskind_pressemeddelse_eng.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America (Bolivia) ===
The [[Izoceño people|Izoceño]]-[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], [[Bolivia]] is a tribe of hunters who were influential in establishing the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso (CABI). CABI promotes economic growth and survival of the Izoceno people while discouraging the rapid destruction of habitat within Bolivia's [[Gran Chaco]]. They are responsible for the creation of the 34,000 square kilometre Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area (KINP).  The KINP protects the most biodiverse portion of the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion shared with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. In 1996, the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] joined forces with CABI to institute wildlife and hunting monitoring programs in 23 Izoceño communities. The partnership combines traditional beliefs and local knowledge with the political and administrative tools needed to effectively manage habitats. The programs rely solely on voluntary participation by local hunters who perform self-monitoring techniques and keep records of their hunts.  The information obtained by the hunters participating in the program has provided CABI with important data required to make educated decisions about the use of the land. Hunters have been willing participants in this program because of pride in their traditional activities, encouragement by their communities and expectations of benefits to the area.

=== Africa (Botswana) ===
In order to discourage illegal South African hunting parties and ensure future local use and sustainability, indigenous hunters in [[Botswana]] began lobbying for and implementing conservation practices in the 1960s. The Fauna Preservation Society of Ngamiland (FPS) was formed in 1962 by the husband and wife team: Robert Kay and June Kay, environmentalists working in conjunction with the Batawana tribes to preserve wildlife habitat.

The FPS promotes habitat conservation and provides local education for preservation of wildlife. Conservation initiatives were met with strong opposition from the Botswana government because of the monies tied to big-game hunting. In 1963, BaTawanga Chiefs and tribal hunter/adventurers in conjunction with the FPS founded [[Moremi Wildlife Reserve|Moremi National Park and Wildlife Refuge]], the first area to be set aside by tribal people rather than governmental forces. Moremi National Park is home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, giraffes, elephants, buffalo, zebra, cheetahs and antelope, and covers an area of 3,000 square kilometers.  Most of the groups involved with establishing this protected land were involved with hunting and were motivated by their personal observations of declining wildlife and habitat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10862">'''Consulting psychology''' is a specialty area of [[psychology]] that addresses such areas as [[psychological evaluation|assessment]] and interventions at the individual, group, and organizational levels. The ''Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;Lowman, R.L. (Ed.). (2002). ''Handbook of Organizational Consulting Psychology''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; provides an overview of specific areas of study and application within the field. The major journal in the field is ''[[Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and Research]]''. Consulting psychologists typically work in business or non-profit organizations, in consulting firms or in private practice. Consulting psychologists are typically professionally licensed as psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apadiv31.org/Coop/EducationInOrganizationalPsychology.pdf |title=Education and Training in Organizational and Consulting Psychology |last=Lowman |first=Rodney L. |work=PDF |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining consulting psychology==
The [[American Psychological Association]] defines the fields as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Consulting psychology shall be defined as the function of applying and extending the specialized knowledge of a psychologist through the process of consultation to problems involving human behavior in various areas. A consulting psychologist shall be defined as a psychologist who provides specialized technical assistance to individuals or organizations in regard to the psychological aspects of their work. Such assistance is advisory in nature and the consultant has no direct responsibility for its acceptance. Consulting psychologists may have as clients individuals, institutions, agencies, corporations or other kinds of organization."&lt;ref&gt;APA Division 13, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consultation should help individuals and organizations "become more efficient and effective."&lt;ref&gt;Former Div. 13 Chair DeWayne Kurpius, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of consultation==

===Generic===

The generic model encompasses all kinds of consulting, starting with Entry, moving through Diagnosis and Implementation and ending with an explicit Disengagement.&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Caplan, G. (1970). ''Theory and practice of mental health consultation''. New York: Basic Books.; Caplan, G. &amp; Caplan, R.B. (1993). Mental health consultation and collaboration. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Client-centered===

This approach focuses on an individual client (recipient of service) and helps service providers better help that client.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The consultant functions assesses the client, makes a diagnosis and recommends changes to the consultee, typically a teacher, physician or other care providers.

===Consultee-centered===

This relationship focuses on the consultee rather than a particular client, helping build new skills via training and/or supervision.&lt;ref name="cg"/&gt; The consultant typically does not meet clients directly. Consultees seek consultation to increase knowledge, skills, confidence, and/or objectivity.

===Consultee-centered administrative consultation===

In some cases, the focus is on administrative rather than professional staff. Such relationships are typically longer term.

=== Behavioral consultation model/behavioral-operant ===
In this model, the consultant is an authority figure who assumes primary responsibility for the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bergan, J.R. &amp; Kratochwill, T.R. (1990) ''Behavioral Consultation and Therapy''. New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus is on problem-solving more than skills development or a particular client.

===Organization consultation===
This model employs systems theory to improve productivity or to streamline the relationship between an organization and its environment.

===Statistical consultation===
A model that focuses on having statistical consultants to research empirical evidence and sophisticated analysis through consulting test and certified projects.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, J. &amp; Dang, J.(2010) ''Measurement, Monte Carlo, and music: Why doctorates in psychology and other applied fields make desirable consultants in statistics''. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62,4–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation and risk management===
A model used by behavioral scientists who works in jury thought and decision making processes. They are usually reserved to help attorneys and insurance companies to evaluate the risks of lawsuits and/or the application of settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, J. M. (2010) ''Litigation consulting: Expanding beyond jury selection to trial strategy and tactics''. Consulting Psychology Journal, 62,
12–20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==
Consulting psychology encompasses diverse roles including individual assessment, individual and group process consultation, organizational development, education/training, employee selection/appraisal, research and evaluation test construction, executive/manager coaching, change management, expert technical support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div13.org/about_consulting.aspx |title=Society of Consulting Psychology (Division 13) |publisher=Div13.org |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional education==
The [[American Psychological Association]] publishes professional training guidelines for consulting psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Guidelines for education and training at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels in consulting psychology/Organizational consulting psychology (2007). ''American Psychologist'', 62, 980–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Master's programs are available under varying program names (e.g., business psychology). Some psychologists come to the field from areas such as [[clinical psychology]], [[counseling psychology]], or [[industrial and organizational psychology]].

==Consultation in community psychology==
It is often critical to build community relationships to understand the context and enable the collection of appropriate data to supporting the consulting relationship. Strong relationships can increase trust between consultants and clients, leading to more effective interventions. [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]]'s model of [[Ecological Systems Theory]] is a framework for navigating the challenges of consulting in community psychology.

===Cultural sensitivity===

{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
Consulting psychology can involve providers in communities unlike their own. Success requires sensitivity to cultural variation, including recognition of the consultant's own cultural bias and/or ethnocentrism. This is further complicated by potential differences between the background of the consultee and client. In this context, "culture" involves client’s/consultee’s religious, cultural and family background and value system.

Cultural differences can involve communication styles, attitudes towards conflict, approaches to completing tasks, decision-making and attitudes towards disclosure.

==Notable consulting psychologists==
Consulting psychologists who have helped to develop the field include [[Clayton Alderfer]], Chris Argyris, [[Eliott Jaques]], Harry Levinson, and [[Edgar Schein]]. More recent authors include Arthur Freedman, Dale Fuqua, Richard Kilburg, [[Rodney L. Lowman]], Jody Newman, Ann O'Roark, David Peterson, Sharon Robinson-Kurpius, Peter Sorensen, and Len Sperry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Society of Consulting Psychology==
The field's professional association is the [[Society of Consulting Psychology]], Division 13 of the [[American Psychological Association]]. The [[Society of Industrial–Organizational Psychology]] is another professional association of which many consulting psychologists are members.

The [[American Board of Professional Psychology]] certifies participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abpp.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3314 |title=ABAP – Organizational and Business Consulting Psychology |publisher=abpp.org |accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues==
Consultants face different ethical questions than clinicians:&lt;ref&gt;Fanibanda, D.K. (1976). Ethical issues of mental health consultation. ''Professional Psychology'', 7, 547–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What degree of responsibility does the consultant take for a consultee's behavior and client outcomes?
* To what extent and over what period is the consultee dependent on the consultant?
* How is the consultant's responsibility for resolving conflicts with and among other participants?
* What are acceptable motivations for the consultant to offer consulting services?
* How are financial arrangements handled?
* What is the proper oversight for consulting relationships?
* What are the consultant's responsibilities for maintaining confidentiality?

Consulting relationships differ from traditional counseling and psychotherapeutic relationships in fundamental ways{{vague|date=July 2012}} that require consideration in evaluating ethical questions. As of 2012, formal ethical guidelines specific to the discipline are not available. Existing codes of ethics for the helping professions provide limited guidance for consultation practice.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;Newman, J.L. (1993). Ethical Issues in Consultation. ''Journal of Couunseling and Development'', 72, 148–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical issues are inevitably complicated by the fact that consulting relationships involve three parties: the consultant, the consultee, and the consultee's client system.

Confidentiality depends on the consultant and on the cooperative efforts of perhaps many organizational members. Variable levels of participation means attention to providing only appropriate access to information. Managing information access and confidentiality require negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J.L. &amp; Robinson, S.E. (1991). In the best interests of the consultee: Ethical issues in consultation.

Clients' right to informed consent must be maintained in the presence of a consulting relationship. This right is complicated by the corresponding rights of consultees, including the right not to accept consultation.

Power is typically distributed unequally among participants in the consultation process. Power differentials may be real or perceived. Those with greater power must take responsibility for its use and impact.&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt;

Consultants with preexisting personal or professional relationships with participants in the consultation must take care that such relationships do not comprise the process.

{{short description|a person's choice to deny reality, as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth}}
In the psychology of [[human behavior]], '''denialism''' is a person's choice to [[denial|deny]] [[reality]], as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable [[truth]].{{sfn|Maslin|2009}} Denialism is an essentially [[irrational]] action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event, when a person refuses to accept an [[empirical]]ly verifiable reality.{{sfn|O'Shea|2008|p=20}} In the sciences, denialism is the rejection of basic facts and concepts that are undisputed, well-supported parts of the [[scientific consensus]] on a subject, in favor of radical and controversial ideas.{{sfn|Scudellari|2010}} The terms ''[[Holocaust denialism]]'' and ''[[AIDS denialism]]'' describe the denial of the facts and the reality of the subject matters,&lt;ref&gt;Usages of Holocaust and AIDS denialism:
{{harvnb|Kim|2007}}; {{harvnb|Cohen|2007}}; {{harvnb|Smith|Novella|2007|p=e256}}; {{harvnb|Watson|2006|p=6}}; {{harvnb|Nature Medicine's editor|2006|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''[[climate change denial]]'' describes denial of the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that the [[climate change]] of planet Earth is a real and occurring event primarily caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;Usages of global-warming denialism: {{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|page=425}} {{harvnb|Colquhoun|2009|p=b3658}}; {{harvnb|Connelly|2007}}; {{harvnb|Goodman|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and the generation of political controversy with attempts to deny the existence of consensus.{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}
The motivations and causes of denialism include religion and self-interest (economic, political, financial) and [[defence mechanisms]] meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas.{{sfn|Hambling|2009}}{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}}

==Orthodoxy and heterodoxy==
Anthropologist [[Didier Fassin]] distinguishes between ''[[denial]]'', defined as "the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied", and ''denialism'', which he defines as "an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth".&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"&gt;Didier Fassin, ''When bodies remember: experiences and politics of AIDS in South Africa'', Volume 15 of California Series in Public Anthropology, [[University of California Press]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25027-7}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jn9yoyuEV1YC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;f=false p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons and social groups who reject propositions on which there exists a mainstream and [[scientific consensus]] engage in ''denialism'' when they use [[rhetoric]]al tactics to give the appearance of argument and legitimate debate, when there is none.{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}} Rick Stoff quoted [[Chris Hoofnagle]]—a senior staff attorney at the [[Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic]] and a senior fellow at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the [[UC Berkeley School of Law]]—as follows:
{{quote|Then there are those who engage in denialist tactics because they are protecting some "overvalued idea" which is critical to their identity. Since legitimate dialogue is not a valid option for those who are interested in protecting bigoted or unreasonable ideas from scientific facts, their only recourse is to use these types of rhetorical tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoff |first=Rick |date=June 2007 |title='Denialism' and muddying the waters |journal=St. Louis Journalism Review |volume=37 |issue=296 |pages=21–33, 2p.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2003 newspaper article, [[Edwin Cameron]]—a senior South African judge who has [[AIDS]]—described the tactics used by those who deny the Holocaust and by those who deny that the [[AIDS pandemic]] is due to infection with HIV. He states that "For denialists, the facts are unacceptable. They engage in radical controversion, for ideological purposes, of facts that, by and large, are accepted by almost all experts and lay persons as having been established on the basis of overwhelming evidence".&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/apic-90503.html The dead hand of denialism] [[Edwin Cameron]]. [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] (Johannesburg), April 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this they employ "distortions, half-truths, misrepresentation of their opponents' positions and expedient shifts of premises and logic."&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt;  Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to "make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics",&lt;ref name="Cameron-2004"/&gt; as scientific studies of many areas rely on probability analysis of sets of data, and in historical studies the precise numbers of victims and other facts may not be available in the primary sources.

A 2009 article published in the journal ''[[Globalization and Health]]'' also notes "recourse to data debates and [[pseudo-scientific]] 'evidence{{'"}} as a common feature of several types of denialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chazan M, Brklacich M, Whiteside A |title=Rethinking the conceptual terrain of AIDS scholarship: lessons from comparing 27 years of AIDS and climate change research |journal=[[Global Health]] |volume=5 |issue= |page=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19807923 |pmc=2764568 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-5-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area which British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] mentioned as part of his analysis of the [[David Irving]]'s work which he presented for the defence when Irving sued  [[Deborah Lipstadt]] for libel:
{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, in order to make their arguments more plausible.&lt;ref name="Evans-Pgrph-6-20"&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 6. General Conclusion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140414/http://www.hdot.org/trial/defense/evans/6 |date=October 12, 2007 }} Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Mark Hoofnagle]] (brother of [[Chris Hoofnagle]]) has described denialism as "the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none".{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}{{sfn|McKee|Diethelm|2010}}{{efn|"AIDS denialism is one of several incarnations of denialism. All denialism is defined by rhetorical tactics designed to give the impression of a legitimate debate among experts when in fact there is none. [[Holocaust deniers]] claim that historians disagree about the evidence for Nazi mass gassings and systematic murder of Jews. Global warming denialists say that climatologists are torn by the evidence about climate change. [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 'Truth Seekers']], as clever a piece of branding as '[[pro-life]]', say the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] resulted from controlled demolition. Vaccine hysterics tell us that the science is split on whether vaccinations cause autism. And AIDS denialists say that scientists are in disagreement about whether HIV causes AIDS" {{harv|Kalichman|2009}}.}} It is a process that operates by employing one or more of the following five tactics in order to maintain the appearance of legitimate controversy:{{sfn|Diethelm|McKee|2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/mar/10/climate-change-denier |title= Climate change deniers: failsafe tips on how to spot them |publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]'' |author= Mark Hoofnagle |date= 11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Conspiracy theories]] – Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in "a conspiracy to suppress the truth".
# [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|Cherry picking]] – Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea, or using outdated, flawed, and discredited papers in order to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research.
# [[False attribution|False experts]] – Paying an expert in the field, or another field, to lend supporting evidence or credibility.
# [[Moving the goalpost]] – Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other (often unfulfillable) piece of evidence.
# Other [[logical fallacies]] – Usually one or more of [[false analogy]], [[appeal to consequences]], [[straw man]], or [[red herring]].

Tara Smith of the [[University of Iowa]] also stated that moving goalposts, conspiracy theories, and cherry-picking evidence are general characteristics of denialist arguments, but went on to note that these groups spend the "majority of their efforts critiquing the mainstream theory" in an apparent belief that if they manage to discredit the mainstream view, their own "unproven ideas will fill the void".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=310459&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The fanaticism of denial that must be exposed |publisher=''Times Higher Education'' |author=Tara Smith |date=14 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 author [[Michael Specter]] defined group denialism as "when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie".&lt;ref name="Specter 2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prescriptive and polemic==
If one party to a debate accuses the other of ''denialism'' they are framing the debate. This is because an accusation of denialism is both prescriptive and [[polemic]]. Prescriptive because it carries implications that there is truth to the denied claim; [[polemic]] since the accuser implies that continued denial in the light of presented evidence raises questions about the other's motives.&lt;ref name="Fassin-115"/&gt;

Some people have suggested that because denial of the Holocaust is well known, advocates who use the term "denialist" in other areas of debate may intentionally or unintentionally imply that their opponents are little better than holocaust deniers. For example, in an essay discussing the general importance of skepticism, [[Clive James]] objected to the use of the word denialist to describe climate change skeptics, stating that it "calls up the spectacle of a fanatic denying the Holocaust";{{sfn|James|2009}} and [[Celia Farber]] has objected to the term ''AIDS denialists'', arguing that it is unjustifiable to place this belief on the same moral level with the Nazi crimes against humanity.{{sfn|Farber|2006}} However, [[Robert Gallo]] ''et al.'' defended this latter comparison, stating that AIDS denialism is similar to Holocaust denial since it is a form of [[pseudoscience]] that "contradicts an immense body of research".{{sfn|Gallo|Geffen|Gonsalves|Jefferys|2006}}

Edward Skidelsky, a lecturer in philosophy at [[Exeter University]], has suggested that this is a new use for the word denial and it may have its origins in an old sense of "deny", akin to "disown" (as in the [[Apostle Peter]] [[Denial of Peter|denying Jesus]]), but that its more immediate antecedence is from the Freudian sense of deny as a refusal to accept a painful or humiliating truth. He writes that "An accusation of 'denial' is serious, suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self-deception. The thing being denied is, by implication, so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity, malice or wilful blindness." He suggests that, by the introduction of the word ''denier'' into further areas of historical and scientific debate, "One of the great achievements of [[The Enlightenment]]—the liberation of historical and [[scientific enquiry]] from [[dogma]]—is quietly being reversed", and that this should worry liberal-minded people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Edward |last=Skidelsky |date=27 January 2010 |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/01/words-that-think-for-us-3/ |title=Words that think for us: The tyranny of denial |work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]| accessdate=10 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of use: scientific denialism==

===Flat Earth===
{{main|Flat Earth|Modern flat Earth societies}}

The [[superseded scientific theories|superseded belief]] that the [[Earth]] is [[flat Earth|flat]], and [[denial]] of all of the overwhelming evidence that supports an approximately [[spheroid]] [[globe]] that rotates around its axis and revolves around the [[Sun]], persists into the [[21st century]]. Modern proponents of flat-Earth [[cosmology]] (or [[flat-earther]]s) refuse to accept any kind of contrary evidence, dismissing all [[spaceflight]]s and images from space as [[hoax]]es and accusing all organizations and even private citizens of [[conspiracy theory|conspiring]] to "hide the truth". They also claim that no actual [[satellite]]s are [[orbit]]ing the Earth, that the [[International Space Station]] is fake, and that these are lies from all governments involved in this grand [[cover-up]].

[[belief perseverance|Adherents]] of the modern flat-Earth model propose that a dome-shaped [[firmament]] encloses a disk-shaped Earth. They commonly claim that the Sun is only [[Samuel Rowbotham|3,000 miles]] above the Earth and that the [[Moon]] and the Sun orbit above, but not around, a flat Earth. Modern flat-earthers believe that [[Antarctica]] is not a continent but a massive [[ice flow]], with a wall 150 feet or higher, which circles the perimeter of the Earth and keeps everything (including all the oceans' water) from falling off the edge.

Flat-earthers also assert that no one is allowed to fly over or explore [[Antarctica]], despite contrary evidence. According to them, all photos and videos of ships sinking under the horizon and of the bottoms of city [[skyline]]s and clouds below the horizon, revealing the [[curvature of the Earth]], have been [[photo manipulation|manipulated]], [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or somehow faked. Therefore, regardless of any scientific or [[empirical evidence]] provided, flat-earthers will [[delusion|stubbornly conclude]] it is fabricated or altered in some way.&lt;ref name="Nixon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listverse.com/2016/02/01/10-absurd-claims-of-modern-flat-earth-conspiracy-theorists/ |title=10 Absurd Claims of Modern Flat Earth Conspiracy Theorists |last=Nixon |first=Eli |publisher=Listverse |date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When linked to other observed phenomena such as gravity, sunsets, tides, eclipses, distances and other measurements that challenge the flat earth model, claimants replace commonly-accepted explanations with piecemeal models that distort how perspective, mass, boyancy, light or other physical systems work.  These piecemeal replacements rarely conform with each other, finally leaving many flat-Earth claimants to agree that such phenomena remain "mysteries" and more investigation is to be done.  In this conclusion, adherents remain open to all explanations except the commonly accepted globular Earth model, shifting the debate from ignorance to denialism.

===AIDS===
{{main|HIV/AIDS denialism}}
[[AIDS denialism]] is the denial that the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chigwedere P, Essex M |title=AIDS denialism and public health practice |journal=AIDS Behav |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=237–47 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20058063 |doi=10.1007/s10461-009-9654-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS denialism has been described as being "among the most vocal anti-science denial movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalichman SC, Eaton L, Cherry C |title="There is no Proof that HIV Causes AIDS": AIDS Denialism Beliefs among People Living with HIV/AIDS |journal=J Behav Med |volume= 33|issue= 6|pages= 432–40|date=June 2010 |pmid=20571892 |doi=10.1007/s10865-010-9275-7 |pmc=3015095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some denialists reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that the virus exists but say that it is a harmless [[passenger virus]] and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of [[recreational drug use]], malnutrition, poor sanitation, and side effects of [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral medication]], rather than infection with HIV. However, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive&lt;ref name=iomreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=771&amp;page=2 |title=Confronting AIDS: Update 1988 |publisher=[[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] |year=1988 |quote=…the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=niaid&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/hivaids/understanding/howhivcausesaids/pages/hivcausesaids.aspx |title=The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS |accessdate=2010-10-08 |publisher=[[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease]] |date=2010-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[scientific community]] rejects and ignores AIDS-denialist claims as based on faulty reasoning, [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]], and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data.{{efn|To support their ideas, some AIDS denialists have also misappropriated a scientific review in ''Nature Medicine'' which opens with this reasonable statement: "Despite considerable advances in HIV science in the past 20 years, the reason why HIV-1 infection is pathogenic is still debated" {{harv|Borowski|2006|p=369}}.}} With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, AIDS-denialist material is now spread mainly through the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="NewScientist"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227131.500-aids-denial-a-lethal-delusion.html |title=AIDS denial: A lethal delusion |first=J |last=Steinberg |journal=New Scientist |accessdate=2009-10-14 |date=2009-06-17 |volume=2713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thabo Mbeki]], former [[president of South Africa]], embraced AIDS denialism, proclaiming that AIDS was primarily caused by poverty. About 365,000 people died from AIDS during his presidency; it is estimated that around 343,000 premature deaths could have been prevented if proper treatment had been available.&lt;ref name=chigwedere&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chigwedere P, Seage GR, Gruskin S, Lee TH, Essex M |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes |volume= 49|issue= 4|pages= 410–415|date=October 2008 |pmid=19186354 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818a6cd5 |laysummary=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NattrassAA&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nattrass N |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=African Affairs |volume=107 |issue=427 |pages=157–76 |date=February 2008 |doi=10.1093/afraf/adm087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
{{main|Climate change denial}}
{{see also|Politicization of science}}
Some international corporations, such as [[ExxonMobil]], have contributed to "fake citizens' groups and bogus scientific bodies" that claim that the [[scientific opinion on climate change|science]] of [[global warming]] is inconclusive, according to a criticism by [[George Monbiot]].{{sfn|Monbiot|2006}} ExxonMobil did not deny making the financial contributions, but its spokesman stated that the company's financial support for scientific reports did not mean it [[funding bias|influenced the outcome]] of those studies. "The recycling of this type of discredited [[conspiracy theory]] diverts attention from the real challenge at hand: how to provide the energy needed to improve global living standards while also [[mitigation of global warming|reducing]] [[greenhouse gas]] emissions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]: ''[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/08/07/gore-exxon.html Gore takes aim at corporately funded climate research].''

May/June 2005 ([[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt; have published articles stating corporations are funding the "denial industry".

In the context of [[consumer protection]], denialism has been defined as "the use of rhetorical techniques and predictable tactics to erect barriers to debate and consideration of any type of reform, regardless of the facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=962462 |title=Denialists' Deck of Cards: An Illustrated Taxonomy of Rhetoric Used to Frustrate Consumer Protection Efforts |first=Chris Jay |last=Hoofnagle|date=February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]]'s replacement of previous science advisers with industry experts or scientists tied to industry, and its refusal to submit the [[Kyoto Protocol]] for ratification due to uncertainties they asserted were present in the climate change issue, have been cited by the press as examples of politically motivated denialism.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070912031936/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20113753/site/newsweek/ Timeline, Climate Change and its Naysayers] [[Newsweek]] August 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tim |last=Dickinson |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/15148655/the_secret_campaign_of_president_george_bushs_administration_to_deny_global |title=The Secret Campaign of President Bush's Administration To Deny Global Warming |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
{{main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Religious beliefs may prompt an individual to deny the validity of the scientific theory of evolution. [[Evolution]] is still considered an undisputed fact within the [[scientific community]] and in [[academia]], where the [[level of support for evolution]] is essentially universal, yet this view is often met with opposition by biblical literalists.{{sfn|Myers|2006}}{{sfn|NSTA|2007}}{{sfn|IAP|2006}}{{sfn|AAAS|2006}}{{sfn|Pinholster|2006}} The alternative view is often presented as a literal interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]]'s [[creation myth]]. Many [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christians teach [[creationism]] as if it were fact under the banners of [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]]. Beliefs that typically coincide with creationism include the belief in the global [[flood myth]], [[geocentrism]], and the belief that the [[Young Earth creationism|Earth is only 6,000-10,000]]  [[Age of the Earth|years old]].&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Edwards v.

It is an essentially [[Emotional|irrational]] action that withholds validation of a historical experience or event."&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea, ''A Cross Too Heavy: Eugenio Pacelli, Politics and the Jews of Europe 1917-1943'', Rosenberg Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|1-877058-71-8}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZMaFfg0u-EC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=denialism&amp;lr= p.20].&lt;/ref&gt; The general class of [[genocide denial]], of which [[holocaust denial]] is a subset, is a form of denialism for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|year=2005|title=The Political Methodology of Genocide Denial|url=http://www.polsis.uq.edu.au/dialogue/vol3-3-1.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Dialogue|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1–23|author=Strakosch, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the proposal of [[Jules Vuillemin]], a chair in the department of Philosophy and History was created at [[Collège de France]] to replace the late [[Jean Hyppolite]]. The title of the new chair was ''The history of systems of thought'' and it was created on 30 November 1969. Vuillemin put forward the then-little known outside the shores of France-philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] - to the general assembly of professors and Foucault was duly elected on 12 April 1970. He was 44 years old. As required by this appointment he held a series of public lectures from 1970 until his death in 1984. These lectures in which he further advanced his work, were summarised from audio recordings and edited by Michel Senellart. They were subsequently translated into English and further edited by Graham Burchell and published posthumously by St Martin's Press.

==''Lectures On The Will To Know'' (1970–1971)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This was an important time for Foucault and marks an important switch of methodology from ‘archaeology’ to ‘genealogy’ (according to Foucault he never abandoned the archaeology method). This was also a period of transition of thought for Foucault; the Dutch TV-televised Foucault [[Noam Chomsky]] ''Human nature Justice versus Power debate'' of November 1971 at the Eindhoven University of Technology appears at this exact time period as his first inaugural lecture were delivered at the [[Collège de France]] entitled "the Order Of Discourse" delivered on 2 December 1970 (translated and published into English as "The Discourse On Language") then a week later (9 December 1970) his first ever full inaugural lecture course was delivered at the Collège de France "The Will to Knowledge" course Foucault promised to explore; "fragment by fragment," the "morphology of the will to knowledge," through alternating historical periods, inquiries and theoretical questioning. The lectures produced were called "Lectures On The Will To Know"; all of this within a space of a year.

The first phase of Foucault’s thought is characterized by knowledge construction of various types and how each thread of knowledge systems combine together to produce a series of networks (Foucault uses the term ‘Grille’) to produce a successful fully functional ‘subject’ and a workable fully functional human society. Foucault uses the terms ''[[epistemological]] indicators'' and ''epistemological breaks'' to show, contrary to popular opinion, that these "indicators" and "breaks" require skilled trained technical group of ‘specialists’ in the various knowledge fields and a trained rigorous professionalized regulatory body of which know-how on behalf of those who use the terms (discourse formations or "speech/discourse") with a professional body that can make the terms used stand up to further rational scrutiny. Scientific knowledge for Foucault isn’t an advancement for human progress as is so often portrayed by the human sciences (such as the humanities and the social sciences) but is much more of a subtle method of organizing and producing firstly an individual subject, and secondly, a fully functional society functioning as a self-replicated control apparatus not as a group of ‘free’ atomized individuals but as a collective societal, organised (or drilled) unit both in terms of industrial [[Economics|Production]], [[labour power]] and a militarily organized unit (in the guise of armies) which is beneficial for the production of "epistemological indicators" or "breaks" enabling society to "control itself" rather than have external factors (such as the state for example) to do the job.

In the inaugural lecture course "The Will To Know" Foucault goes into detail on how the ‘natural order of things’ from the 16th century transpired into a fully organised human society which includes a "[[Governmentality]]" apparatus and a complex machine (by "governmentaility", Foucault means a state apparatus which is conceived as a scientific machine) as a rational organizing principle. This was the first time (contrary to popular opinion that this was a rather late invention in Foucault’s thought) that Foucault started to go into the Greek dimensions of his thought of which he would return to in later lectures towards the end of his life. First of all a few pointers should be made explicit on certain points. Foucault mentions the western notion of by [[money]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[trade]] (Greek society) starting about 800 BCE to 700 BCE. However, other ‘non-western’ societies also had these very same problems and is automatically assumed by some historians{{Who|date=July 2015}} that these were entirely western inventions. This isn’t entirely true; [[China]] and [[India]] for example had the most sophisticated trading and monetary institutions by the 6th century B.C.E., indeed the concept of a ''[[corporation]]'' existed in India&lt;ref&gt;[[Chanakya]] [[Arthashastra]] Translated by R Shamasastry pp. 541–547&lt;/ref&gt; from at least 800 BCE and lasted until at least 1000 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;"The examination reveals that business people on the Indian subcontinent utilized the corporate form from a very early period. The corporate form (e.g., the [[Shreni]]) was being used in India from at least 800 B.C., and perhaps even earlier, and was in more or less continuous
use since then until the advent of the Islamic invasions around 1000 A.D.
This provides evidence for the use of the corporate form centuries before the earliest Roman proto-corporations.
In fact, the use of the sreni in Ancient India was widespread including virtually
every kind of business, political and municipal activity. Moreover, when we examine how
these entities were structured, governed and regulated we find that they bear many
similarities to corporations and, indeed, to modern US corporations. The familiar concerns
of agency costs and incentive effects are both present and addressed in quite similar ways as
are many other aspects of the law regulating business entities. Further, examining the
historical development of the sreni indicates that the factors leading to the growth of this
corporate form are consistent with those put forward for the growth of organizational
entities in Europe. These factors include increasing trade, methods to contain agency costs,
and methods to patrol the boundaries between the assets of the sreni and those of its
members (i.e., to facilitate asset partitioning and reduce creditor information costs)." Vikramaditya S. Khanna ''The Economic History Of The Corporate Form In Ancient India 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;
Most importantly there was a [[social security]] system in India at this time. Foucault begins his notions from these lectures on the very notion of truth and the ‘Will to knowledge’ and the challenge is on when Foucault asks the very question of the entire western philosophical and political tradition: Namely knowledge (at least scientific knowledge) and its close association with truth is entirely desirable and is politically and philosophically natural and neutral. First of all Foucault puts these notions (at least its political notions) to a thorough test, firstly, Foucault asks the politically ‘neutral’ question on the very first appearance of money which became not only an important economic symbol but above all else became a measure of value and a unit of account.

Money once established as a social process and social reality had (if one could say the word) an extremely rocky and precarious history. First of all while it had a social reality but the actual social authority to use money didn’t develop a standard practice or knowledge on how to use it; it was rather undisciplined. Kings and emperors could squander large taxation revenues with impunity regardless of the consequences.They could default on repayments on loans as witnessed during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–29)|Anglo-French War]] (1627-1629).&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Kaeuper ''Bankers to the Crown: The Riccardi of Lucca and Edward I''  1973&lt;/ref&gt; Above all else kings and monarchs could take out forced loans and get others(their subjects) to pay for these forced loans and to add insult to injury get them to pay interest on the loans at extortionate rates of interest charged on the loans because they and their advisers regarded it as their own ‘income’. However, whole societies were dependent on money particularly when the whole of society had to use and be ready for its function.&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls February 1255 pp. 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calendar Of Patent Rolls July 1255 pp. 439–440&lt;/ref&gt; Money took at least 3,000 years of history to get a more disciplined approach and became the sole prerogative of the fiscal responsibility of the state after the medieval ‘order of things’ was entirely dismantled ‘to get it right’ namely; the ruthlessness and rigorous efficiency needed for its proper function and it wasn’t until the 16th century with the advent of modern [[political economy]] with its analysis of production, [[Labour economics|labour]] and trade you then get a sense of why money, particularly its relationship with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and its complex relationship with the rest of society conversion, from labour power into money via the essential route of [[surplus value]] became a much maligned and misunderstood category and hot potato. This is where Foucault is at his most profound. Foucault now is asking how is it that modern western political economy, together with [[political philosophy]] and [[political science]] came to ask the question concerning money but was utterly perplexed by it (this is a question that particularly irritated and irked [[Karl Marx]] throughout his life)? That money and its various association with production, labour, government and trade was beyond doubt but its exact relationship with the rest of society was entirely missed by economists but yet still its version of events was entirely accepted as true? Foucault begins to try to go into the whole production of truth (both philosophical and political) its whole “breaks” “discontinuity” 'epistemological unconscious' and theoretical splitting “[[Episteme]]”. From this Greek period starting from 800 BCE Foucault pursues the path of scientific and political knowledge the emergence and conditions of possibility for philosophical knowledge and ends up with “the problem of political knowledge (i.e. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] notions of the political animal) of what is necessary in order to govern the city and put it right.” He then divided his work on the history of systems of thought into three interrelated parts, the “re-examination of knowledge, the conditions of knowledge, and the knowing subject.”

==''The Punitive Society'' (1972–1973)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In these lectures, published in English in 2015, Foucault uses the first precursor of [[Discipline and Punish]] to study the foundations of what he calls “disciplinary institutions”(punitive power) and the productive dimensions of penalty. Foucault spent a lot of time during this period trying to make intelligible the internal and external dynamics of what we call the prison. He questioned, "What are the relations of power which made possible the historical emergence of something like the prison?". This was correlated to three terms; firstly ‘measure’ "a means of establishing or restoring order, the right order, in the combat of men or the elements; but also a matrix of mathematical and physical knowledge."(treated in more detail in ''The Will To Knowledge'' lectures of 1971); Secondly the ‘inquiry’ "a means of establishing or restoring facts, events, actions, properties, rights; but also a matrix of empirical knowledge and natural sciences"(from the 1972 lectures ''Theories On Punishment and Penal Theories and Institutions'') and thirdly ‘the examination’ treated as "the permanent control of the individual, like a permanent test with no endpoint". Foucault links the examination with 18th century [[Political economy]] and the productive labourers with the wealth they produce and the forces of production.

==''"Society Must Be Defended"'' (1975–1976)==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
This series of lectures forms a trilogy with [[Security, Territory, Population]] and [[The Birth of Biopolitics]], and it contains Foucault's first discussion of [[biopower]]. It also contains an explanation of the term "Civil war" in the form of rigorous treatment of a working definition. Foucault goes into great detail how power (as Foucault saw it) becomes a battleground drifting from civil war to generalized pacification of the individual and particularly the systems he (the individual) relies upon and to which he gives loyalty: "According to this hypothesis, the role of political power is perpetually to use a sort of silent war to re-inscribe that relationship of force, and to re-inscribe it in institutions, economic inequalities, language, and even the bodies of individuals." Foucault begins to explain that this generalized form of power is not only rooted in [[Disciplinary institutions]] but is also concentrated in "political sovereignty, the military, and war," so it is in turn spread evenly throughout modern society as a network of domination.

Foucault then discusses what lies behind the “academic chestnut” which couldn't be deciphered by his historical predecessors: namely the disjointed and discontinuous movement of history and power (bio-power). What is meant by this? For Foucault's predecessors, history was concerned by deeds of monarchs and a full list of their accomplishments in which the sovereign is presented in the text as doing all things ‘great,’ added to this 'greatness' of deeds this 'greatness' of the sovereign was accomplished all by the sovereign himself without any help; monument building, allegedly built by the monarch, without any help from skilled and trained professionals serves as a perfectly good example of the sovereign "greatness". However, for Foucault, this is not the case. Foucault’s genealogy comes into play here where Foucault tries to build a bridge between two theoretical notions: disciplinary power ([[Disciplinary institutions]]) and biopower. He investigates the constant shift throughout history between these two ‘[[paradigms]],’ and what developments-from these two ‘paradigms’ became new subjects. The previous historical dimensions so often portrayed by historians Foucault argues, was sovereign history, which acts as a ceremonial tool for sovereign power "It glorifies and adds lustre to power. History performs this function in two modes: (1) in a "genealogical" mode (understood in the simple sense of that term) that traces the lineage of the sovereign. By the time of the 17th century with the development of [[Mercantilism]], [[Statistics]] ([[mathematical statistics]]) and [[political economy]] this reaches a most vitriolic and vicious form later to be called [[Nation states]] where whole populations were involved(in the guise of armies both industrial and military), in which a continuous war is enacted out not amongst ourselves(the population) but in a struggle for the state's very existence which ultimately leads to a "[[thanatopolitics]]"(a philosophical term that discusses the politics of organizing who should live and who should die (and how) in a given form of society) of the population on a large industrial scale.

This is where Foucault discusses a "counterhistory" of "race struggle or race war."According to Foucault Marx and Engels used or borrowed the term "Race" and transversed the term race into a new term called "[[Class struggle]]" which later [[Marxist]] accepted and began to use. This is more partly to do with Marx's antagonistic relationship with [[Karl Vogt]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Marxists Internet Archive]]''  Karl Marx ''Herr Vogt'' 1860&lt;/ref&gt; who for his time was a convinced [[Polygenist]] which Marx and Engels had inherited Vogt's belief. Foucault quotes letters written by Marx to Engels in 1854 and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]] in 1852 {{cquote|Finally, in your place I should in general remark to the democratic gentlemen that they would do better first to acquaint themselves with bourgeois literature before they presume to yap at the opponents of it. For instance, these gentlemen should study the historical works of [[Augustin Thierry]], [[François Guizot]], [[John Wade (author)|John Wade]], and others in order to enlighten themselves as to the past 'history of classes.'Where the history of the revolutionary project and of revolutionary practice is indissoluble from this counterhistory of races&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be defended'' pp.79-80, p.85 1975-1976&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

Foucault challenges the traditional notions of racism in explaining the operation of the modern state. When Foucault talks of racism he is not talking about what we might traditionally understand it to be–an ideology, a mutual hatred. In Foucault’s reckoning modern racism is tied to power, making it something far more profound than traditionally assumed.&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;Foucault, M. (2003). Society must be defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975–76, trans. David Macey. New York: Picador&lt;/ref&gt;
Tracing the genealogy of racism, Foucault proposes that ‘race’, previously used to describe the division between two opposing societal groups distinguished from one another for example by religion or language, came to be conceived in the late 18th century in biological terms. The concept of "race war" that referred to conflict over the legitimacy of the power of the established sovereign, was "reformulated" into a struggle for existence driven by concern about the biopolitical purity of the population as a single race that could be threatened from within its own body. For Foucault "racism is born at the point when the theme of racial purity replaces that of race struggle" (p.&amp;nbsp;81).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

For Foucault, racism "is an expression of a schism within society…provoked by the idea of an ongoing and always incomplete cleaning of the social body…it structures social fields of action, guides political practice, and is realized through state apparatuses…it is concerned with biological purity and conformity with the norm" (pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).&lt;ref name="Lemke"&gt;Lemke, T. (2011). Biopolitics. An Advanced Introduction. (Trans. E.F. Trump). New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In modern states, racism is not defined by the action of individuals, rather it is vested in the State and finds form in its structures and operation–it is State racism.

State racism serves two functions. Firstly, it makes it possible to divide the population into biological groups, "good and bad" or "superior or inferior" ‘races’. Fragmented into subspecies, the population can be brought under State control. Secondly, it facilitates a dynamic relationship between the life of one person and the death of another. Foucault is clear that this relationship is not one of warlike confrontation but rather a biological one, that is not based on the individual but rather on life in general "the more inferior species die out, the more abnormal individuals are eliminated the fewer degenerates there will be in the species as a whole, and the more I – as species rather than individual – can live, the stronger I will be, the more vigorous I will be, I will be able to proliferate" (p.&amp;nbsp;255)&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;

In effect race, defined in biological terms, "furnished the ideological foundation for identifying, excluding, combating, and even murdering others, all in the name of improving life not of an individual but of life in general" (p.&amp;nbsp;42).&lt;ref name="Lemke" /&gt; What is important here is that racism, inscribed as one of the modern state’s basic techniques of power, allows enemies to be treated as threats, not political adversaries. But through what mechanism are these threats treated? Here the technologies of power described by Foucault become important.

Foucault argues that new technologies of power emerged in the second half of the 18th century, which Foucault termed biopolitics and biopower(Foucault uses both terms synonymously), these technologies focused on man-as-species and were concerned with optimising the state of life, with taking control of life and intervening to "make live and let die".&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Importantly, Foucault argues, the technologies did not replace the technologies of sovereign power with their exclusive focus on disciplining the individual body to be more productive by punishing or killing individuals, but embedded themselves into them. It was in exploring how this new power, with life as its object, could come to include the power to kill that Foucault theorizes the emergence of state racism.

Foucault argues that the modern state must at some point become involved with racism in order to function since once a State functions in a biopolitical mode it is racism alone that can justify killing.&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt;  Determined as a threat to the population, the State can take action to kill in the name of keeping the population safe and thriving, healthy and pure. It is racism that allows the right to kill to be squared off with a power that seeks to improve life. State racism delivers actions that while appearing to derive from altruistic intentions, veil the murder of the "Other"&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, M. (2004). Racism, Nationalism and Biopolitics: Foucault’s Society Must Be Defended, 2003. Contretemps 4, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Following this argument to its logical end, it is only when there is never a need for the State to claim the right to kill or to let die that State racism will disappear.

Since killing is predicated on racism it follows that the "most murderous states are also the most racist" (p.&amp;nbsp;258).&lt;ref name="Foucault" /&gt; Foucault refers to the way in which Nazism and the state socialism of the Soviet Union dealt with ethnic or social groups and their political adversaries as examples of this.

Threats, however, can change over time and here the utility of ‘race’ a concept comes into its own. While never defining ‘race’, Foucault suggests that the word ‘race’ is "not pinned to a stable biological meaning" (p.&amp;nbsp;77).&lt;ref name="Foucault"/&gt; with the implication that it is a concept that is socially and historically constructed where a discourse of truth is enabled. This makes ‘race’ something that is easy for the State to adopt and exploit for its own purpose. ‘Race’ becomes a technology that is used by the state to structure threats and to make decisions over the life and death of sub-populations. In this way it helps to explain how the idea of ‘race’ or cultural difference are used to wage wars such as the "war on terror" or the "humanitarian war" in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Fiaccadori, E.

== ''Security, Territory, Population'' (1977–1978)&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault  ''Lectures At The College de France Security, Territory, Population'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ==
{{Main article|Security, Territory, Population}}

The course deals with the genesis of a political knowledge that was to place at the centre of its concerns the notion of population and the mechanisms capable of ensuring its regulation but even of its procedures and means employed to ensure, in a given society, "the government of men". A transition from a "territorial state" to a "population state"([[Nation state]])?
Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] and [[biopower]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work at which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

Foucault's challenge to himself in these series of lectures is to try and decipher the genealogical split between power in ancient and [[Medieval]] society and late modern society, such as our own. By split Foucault means power as a force for manipulation of the human body. Previous notions of power failed to account for the historical subject and general shifts in techniques of power-according to Foucault's genealogy or genesis of power – it was totally denied that manipulation of the human body by unforeseen, outside forces ever existed. According to this theory, it was human ingenuity and man's ability to increase his own rationalisation was the primary motion behind social phenomena and the human subject and change was a result of increasing human reason and human conscience ingenuity. Foucault denies that any such notion had ever existed in the historical record and insists that this kind of thought is a misleading abstraction. Foucault cites the main driving force behind this set of accelerated change was the modern human sciences and the technologies both available to skilled professionals from the 16th century and a whole set of clever techniques used to shift the whole old social order into the new order of things. However, what was significant was the notion of [[Population]] practised upon the entire human species on a global mass scale, not in separately locally defined areas. By population, Foucault means its fluidness and malleability, Foucault refers to ‘a multiplicity of men, not to the extent that they are nothing more than individual bodies, but to the extent that they form, on the contrary, a global mass that is affected by overall processes of birth, death, production, taxation, illness and so forth, one should also take note that Foucault does not just mean population as singular event but a means of circulation tied to factors of security. What again was also significant was the idea of "freedom" the population's "freedom" which was the new modern [[Nation state]] and the 'neo-discourse' erected around such notions as freedom, work and [[Liberalism]], the ideological stance of the state (mass popular democracy and the voting franchise) and the state was only too willing to recognize and give freedom for example as the object of security. Population, in Foucault's understanding, is understood as a self-regulating mass;an agglomeration or circulation of people and things which co-operate and co-produce order free from heavy state regulation the state governs less allowing the population to "govern itself". For Foucault, the freedom of population is grasped at the level of how elements of population circulate. Techniques of security enact themselves through, and upon, the circulation which occurs at the level of population.In Foucault's opinion the modern concept of population, as opposed to the ancient [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and medieval version of "populousness" which has in its roots going as far back as the time period of the [[Book of Numbers]] in the [[Old testament]] [[Bible]] and the work that it sustained both in political theory and practice certainly does so; or, at least, the construction of the concept population is central to the creation of new orders of knowledge, new objects of intervention, new forms of subjectivity.

However, in order to fully understand what Foucault is trying to convey a few things should be said about the alteration techniques used that Foucault talks about in this series of lectures. The ancient and medieval version of [[Political power]] was centered around a central figure who was called a King, [[Emperor]], [[Prince]] or ruler (and in some cases the pope)of his principle territory whose rule was considered absolute ([[Absolute monarchy]]) by both [[Political philosophy]] and political theory of the day even in our time such notions still exist. Foucault uses the term population state to designate a new founded technology founded on the principal of security and territory which would mean a "population" to govern on a global mass with each population having its own territorial integrity(a separate nation) mapped out by experts in treaty negotiations&lt;ref&gt;''Colossal, unjustified' payments to Treaty negotiators'' Stuff 11 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiating International Trade Treaties Before Exit'' Francis Hoar '' UK's Right to Negotiate Free Trade Agreements before leaving the European Union'' 1 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the new emerging field of 15th century [[Cartography|Advances in map-making technologies]] and the profession of [[Cartography]] eventually producing in the 18th century what we now know as [[nation states]]. These technologies take place at the level of "population" Foucault argues, and with the shifting aside of the body of the King or territorial ruler. By the time of the ending of the medieval period the body(or the persona of the king)of the territorial ruler became under increasingly under financial pressure and a cursory look at the medieval financial records tends to show that the monarch could not pay back all debts due to his creditors; the monarch would easily and readily default on loans due to any creditors causing financial ruin to creditors.Foucault notices that by the time of the 18th century several changes began to take place like the re-organization of armies, an emerging industrial working population begins to appear, (both military and industrial), the emergence of the [[Mathematical sciences]], [[Biological sciences]] and [[Physical sciences]] which, coincidently gave birth to a-what Foucault calls-Biopower and a political apparatus(machine) to take care of biological (in the form of medicine and health) and political life(mass democracy and the voting franchise for the population). An apparatus (both economic and political) was required much more sophisticated than previous social organisations of previous societies had at their disposal. For example, [[Bank]]s, which function as financial intermediaries and tied to the apparatus of the new 'state' machine which can easily pay back any large scale debts(large debts) which the King cannot, due to the king's own financial resources are limited;the king cannot pay back for example, the national debt, nor pay for a modern army out of his own personal resources, which can amount to trillions of US Dollars out of his own personal finances, that would be both impracticable and impossible.

== ''The Birth of Biopolitics'' (1978–1979) ==
{{Main article|The Birth of Biopolitics}}

''The Birth of Biopolitics'' develops further the notion of [[biopolitics]] that Foucault introduced in his lectures on "Society must be defended". It traces how eighteenth-century political economy marked the birth of a new governmental rationality and raises questions of political philosophy and social policy about the role and status of neo-liberalism in twentieth century politics.

Over the course of many centuries the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour has received a great deal of attention. Recently(the last 60 years or so) in the academic field and journals there has been some development within the field of political and biological behaviour.In his College de France lecture course of January 1978 Foucault use the term Biopolitics(not for the first time) to denote politic power over every aspect of human life.Why did Foucault use the term Biopolitics in the first place?First of all the term Biopolitics has many different meanings to many different people and to fully understand the term as Foucault saw and used and understood it, we have to look at the very different meanings of the concept.For Foucault the term means to him the association between biological phenomena and human political behaviour maximizing and increasing the human abilities machine(as we know the term).Over the course of evolutionary time this abilities machine of man becomes species specific, such as language capabilities, neuronal and cognitive capabilities so on and so forth.This then becomes over the course of the history of discursive technologies of scientific knowledge Foucault argues;became a field of knowledge established by groups of experts in the field of [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary Biology]], Physical sciences and Genetics for example.

The study of a new and rigorous discipline allied together with a new language(discourse technologies) in which a grasp of the new language is needed developing into a powerful force in the political realm as well as biological evolution the two become powerful allies (both biology and politics).Genetics and the change that develops(over time) over the course of the human organism existence.However, the two become co-joined unwittingly but one of them both political philosophy and political science have specific problems, both cannot have or lay claim to independent knowledge which is problematic for both lines of thought.Not in the case of ideology(as in Marxism) but in the case of discursive technologies.Foucault insists that the scientific knowledge being presented by historians is not an endeavour by the whole of humankind, particularly when written about by historians who claim that 'man' invented the sciences anymore than the Nazi represented the whole of humankind and the whole of humankind were to blame for the Nazi atrocities the ultimate embodiment of evil.But is, for all attempts and purposes a collaborative enterprise by groups of specially trained specialists producing a scientific community who have unfettered access to the whole of society through their scientific knowledge and expertise.

Change does indeed happen both within the organism and the organisms properties, the specific species is unable to correct them directly and biological change moves beyond any individual or single member of the species.However, these changes are aimed at the species as a whole and characteristics and traits are retained both at the biological, ecological and environmental level.In the human sciences (biology and genetics)these changes happen at a genetic and biological level which are unalterable and transpire from one generation to the next not at the individual level of the species.This is at the heart of the core theory of [[Charles Darwin]] and his proponents and the theory of [[Evolution]] and [[natural selection]].Foucault's analysis try's to show that contrary to previous thought that the modern human sciences were somehow an obscure universal objective source which somehow had an absence of any linage, took over the role of the Christian church in disciplining the body by replacing the soul and confession of the Catholic church plus also the specific director of the process which in this case would be the deity(God), with indefinite supervision and discipline. However, these new techniques required a new 'director(s)' or 'editor(s)' who replaced the priestly and [[Pharaonic]] versions of much similar past vintages.These new governmental mechanism based upon the right of sovereignty and law both supported the fixed hierarchical organisation of the previous mode of feudal governmental mechanism, but stripping the modern human subject of any kind of self autonomy; not only fully fit for indoctrination, work, and education a fully fit conversant subject but left them vulnerable as well to face a permanent exam which he(the ordinary individual) had no chance in passing and was supposed to fail with no end point.Foucault maintains that these techniques were deliberate, cold, calculating and ruthless;the human sciences, far from being "a way at looking at the world" the knowledge/power dynamic/relationship [[Paradigm]] was a 'cheap' efficient and 'cost' effective method into a way of producing a subjugated and docile human subject(not only a citizen, but a political and productive citizen) as an instrument for administrative control and concern(through the state) for the well being of the population(and a constant help to the spread of Biopower)with the help of scientific classifications and new disciplinary technologies including the polity readily available to the human body and mind. Here are a few examples on what Foucault means by this type of "biopower" and bio-history of man

The series starts at the first encounter with the offender and continues through to the process of change.It includes the issue of drug use in this population.The authors have detailed their research with what they termed "the criminal mind."Their definition of the criminal strongly resembles the description of antisocial-personality disorder and psychopathy.During the early stages of their research, Yochelson and Samenow limited their work to observation without the attempt of treatment.They detailed 52 features of criminal thinking that needed to be changed for rehabilitation to be a possibility.Patterns of deception are established early in this population and others rights are characteristically disregarded, and when arrested, this population tends to see themselves as victims and believe that they were good people despite their lengthy criminal records.Over time a treatment plan, or "process of change" was defined that change was most likely to occur in this population when the individual was vulnerable and desirous of change.The desire for change must be accompanied by an in depth knowledge of what needs to be changed.Finally, change is only possible when the long term benefits of change outweigh the benefits of maintaining a criminal lifestyle.Overall, change is considered a possibility, although not a common one.These three volumes comprise the most detailed, long-term examination of the criminal mind documented."

As with the most recent discovery of [[Mirror neurons]] has demonstrated Foucault has(while these techniques used in [[Psychiatry]] and [[Psychology]] are not mentioned alongside Foucault's name) hit on something that rigorous research methods may prove beyond a reasonable doubt that manipulation of social phenomena(which includes the human body and the mind) is most certainly possible.Techniques developed from the First and Second World war which started out as field experiments, among military personal, were then extended into ordinary civilian life; techniques borrowed from the Human cognitive sciences and found its way into [[Psychoanalysis|Psycho-analysis]], [[Psychiatry]], [[Psychology]], [[Clinical psychology]], [[Lightner Witmer]] and [[Clinical psychiatry]] (see this encyclopedia's article on [[Political abuse of psychiatry]]):"Mobilisation and manipulation of human needs as they exist in the consumer".He([[Ernest Dichter]]) "was the first to coin the term focus group and to stress the importance of image and persuasion in advertising".In [[Vance Packard]]'s book, [[The Hidden Persuaders]] Dichter's name is mentioned extensively.Subjectivation, a term Foucault coined for this purpose in which Biological life itself is given over to constant testing and research(an examination) without ever ending.One could argue;who are these new experts answerable too?Foucault argues that these new experts are answerable to absolutely no one.Just like previous notions of the past, absolute monarchy and divine rights of kings were answerable to nobody, their predecessors are just replacements of the past these new experts have now been democratised.Where mans body (and his soul)his mind can be manipulated and altered and is liable to be vulnerable. Every single aspect of the human subject is ripe for '[[Subjectification (linguistics)|subjectification]]' and the technology-as it stands today-is unknown to us.This Biological ''allegory of man carries with it endless possibilities from the perspective of the [[Biological Sciences|Biological sciences]] and [[Physical Sciences|Physical sciences]].The above extractions clearly show this “Biopower” of man requires man himself to administer these sophisticated technologies, where one group of experts or professionals(the enquiry) can completely subjugate another producing new human subjects(and new experts) through their expertise at manipulating social phenomena.In these few examples and according to this view:”the criminal is treated like a cancer” whereas human nature does not change which is the only society that ever gets produced, past,present or future.''

== ''On The Government Of The Living '' (1979–1980) ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2015}}
In the ''On The Government Of The Living'' lectures delivered in the early months of 1980, Foucault begins to ask questions of Western man obedience to power structures unreservedly and the pressing question of Government: "Government of children, government of souls and consciences, government of a household, of a state, or of oneself." Or [[governmentality]], as Foucault prefers to call it, although he fleshes out the development of that concept in his earlier lectures titled "Security, Territory, Population." Foucault tries to trace the kernel of "the genealogy of obedience" in western society. The 1980 lectures attempt to relate the historical foundations of "our obedience"—which must be understood as the obedience of the Western subject. Foucault argues confessional techniques are an innovation of the Christian West intended to guarantee men’s obedience to structures of power in return, so the belief goes, for Christian salvation.In his summary of the course Foucault asks the question: "How is it that within Western Christian culture, the government of men requires, on the part of those who are led, in addition to acts of obedience and submission, ‘acts of truth,’ which have this particular character that not only is the subject required to speak truthfully but to speak truthfully about himself?" The reader should take note here that much of this kind of work has been done before, albeit in what is best described as brilliant, lost and forgotten scholarship by such scholars as [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] (his work on the [[body politic]] and the king's two bodies), [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], [[Carl Erdmann]], [[Hermann Kantorowicz]], [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederick Maitland]]. However, Foucault was after the genealogical dynamics and his main thrust was "regimes of truth" and the emergence and gradual development of "reflexive acts of truth". Foucault locates the very beginning of this act of obedience to power structures and the truth that they bring to the first Christian institutions between the 2nd century and the 5th century C.E. This is where Foucault starts to use his main tool—that is [[Genealogy (philosophy)|Genealogy]] as his main focus and it is with this genealogical tool that you finally get to understand fully what genealogy actually means. Foucault goes into great painstaking detail into the Christian [[baptism]] and its contingency and discontinuity in order to find "the genealogy of confession". This is an attempt-argues Foucault-to write a "political history of the truth".

== ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject'' (1980–1981) ==
In these lectures, Foucault develops notions on the ability of the concept of truth to shift through time as described by the modern human sciences (for example [[Ethology]]) in contrast to ancient society (Aristotelian notions). It discusses how these notions are accepted as truth and produce the self as true. This is followed by a discussion on the existence of this truth and the discourse of truth for the experience of the self.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17010">The topic of gender and emotion is often reduced to attempts to identify the differences between women, men, and the various ways in which they express their emotions. Stereotypes are powerful, and men and women from various cultures have been shown to accept the Western stereotype that women are more emotional than men.&lt;ref name= kring&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kring | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = A. H. | year = 1998 | title = Sex differences in emotion: expression, experience, and physiology | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.686 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 686–703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, women are believed to experience and express discrete emotions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and sadness more than men. 

Many researchers have concluded that the observed emotional differences between men and women primarily stem from socialized [[gender role]]s, rather than biology.  Thus, the range of [[emotional expression]] that certain populations experience is based, in large part, on their culture's expectations for [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==
Many psychologists reject the notion that men actually experience emotions less frequently than do women.  Instead, researchers have suggested that men exhibit restrictive [[emotionality]]. Restrictive emotionality refers to a tendency to inhibit the expression of certain emotions and an unwillingness to self-disclose intimate feelings.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt; Men's restrictive emotionality has been shown to influence health, emotional appraisal and overall identity.  Furthermore, tendencies toward restrictive emotionality are correlated with an increased risk of certain anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt;
A substantial amount of research has suggested that women do, on average, express emotions more frequently than men.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; In the Handbook of Emotions, Leslie R. Brody and Judith A. Hall report that This difference in emotional expression starts at a young age, as early as 4 and 6 years old, as girls begin to express more sadness and anxiety than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Hall | first2 = J. A. | year = 2008 | title = Gender and emotion in context | url = | journal = Handbook of emotions | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brody and Hall (2008) report that women generally smile, laugh, nod and use hand gestures more than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  The only known exception to this rule is that men more frequently express anger.  However, all of these effects are not commonly observed until after preschool, suggesting that these differences might be the result of certain [[socialization]] processes.&lt;ref name = jansz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jansz | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = [[Masculine]] identity and restrictive emotionality | url = | journal = Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives | volume = | issue = | pages = 166–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women are also more accurate expressers of emotion, when "posing deliberately and when observed unobstrusively."&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  This increased expressiveness in emotional expression is consistent across cultures – women report more intense emotional experiences and more overt emotional expressions across 37 cultures.&lt;ref name =  fischer&gt;Fischer, A. H., &amp; Manstead, A. S. R. (2000). The relation between gender and emotion in different cultures. In A. H. Fischer (Ed.), Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives (pp. 71–98). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been found that men and women more accurately display gender-stereotypic expressions – men more accurately express anger, contempt and happiness, while women were more accurately express fear and happiness.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  Other studies have shown that women show higher levels of expression accuracy and judgement of nonverbal emotional cues than men overall.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt; However, these patterns are not consistent across cultures, again suggesting that socialization influences the observed gender differences in emotional expression.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  For example, in [[Japan]], research has suggested that women convey anger and contempt better than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

==Major empirical findings==
Research has shown that culture and context-specific gender roles have a stronger influence on emotional expression than do biological factors.  "Empirical evidence suggests that girls are socialized to be emotional, nonaggressive, nurturing, and obedient, whereas boys are socialized to be unemotional, aggressive, achievement oriented, and self-reliant. Peers continue this process as children develop and mature in effect constraining how, where, why, and with whom certain emotions are expressed".&lt;ref name = wester/&gt;  One study suggests that people tend to exhibit more intense negative facial expressions in solitary conditions, and smile more when others are present.  In this experiment, men and women did not differ in their anger expression in non-social conditions. However, women were more likely to express their anger in the solitary condition as opposed to the social condition. Men, on the other hand, seemed to be less concerned with appearing positive to others; they showed no difference in their expression of anger based on whether or not others were present.&lt;ref name = derks/&gt;  In another recent study, Coats and Feldman found that women who were more accurate expressors of happiness were judged as more popular, while men who were more accurate expressors of anger were judged as more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coats | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = R. S. | year = 1996 | title = Gender differences in nonverbal correlates of social status | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 10| pages = 1014–1022 | doi=10.1177/01461672962210004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there are negative consequences for people who are less accurate expressors of gender-stereotypical emotions.

These consequences also extend to judging others' emotions. Studies have shown that there are negative social consequences for children who are deficient at judging gender-stereotypic nonverbal cues – angry nonverbal cues for boys and happy, sad, and fearful nonverbal cues for girls.  Communication of emotion involves both detection and expression of emotions or moods. The ability to detect non-verbal cues leads to successful communication of emotions. In [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), the absence of body language and visibility restricts one's ability to correctly recognize other's [[emotion]]s.  For this reason, emoticons are widely used  in online communication to replace non-verbal behaviors that emphasize or clarify one's feelings.  Surprisingly, there is no static gender difference in the use of emoticons.  In some studies, both men and women display an increase in emoticon use in the context of a mixed-gender group chat.  Others show that men use more emoticons when interacting with women, while women show no change when interacting with men.&lt;ref name = derks&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derks | first1 = Daantje | last2 = Fischer | first2 = Agneta H. | last3 = Bos | first3 = Arjan E.R. | year = 2008 | title = The role of emotion in computer-mediated communication: A review | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 766–785 | doi =  10.1016/j.chb.2007.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature versus nurture==
{{Main article|Nature versus nurture}}
The social-developmental hypothesis is one of the major arguments for the impact of nurture on emotional expression.  The social-developmental theory explains gender differences in emotion expression through emphasizing "children's active role in their development of gendered behavior" through learning by watching adults or through interactions with their parents and peers (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name= chaplin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = T. | last2 = Aldao | first2 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Gender differences in emotion expression in children: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/bul-a0030737.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 139 | issue = 4| pages = 735–765 | doi=10.1037/a0030737 | pmid=23231534 | pmc=3597769}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis points to the fact that infants are not born with the same differences in emotional expression and gender differences generally grow more pronounced as children age.  In a 2012 meta-analysis conducted by Tara Chaplin and Amelia Aldao, researchers reviewed gender differences in emotion expression from the infancy period through adolescence in order to determine the impact of development and age on gender differences. Their findings support the notion that social factors in a child's development play a large role in the gender differences that later emerge, as "gender differences were not found in infancy…but they emerged by the toddler/preschool period and in childhood".&lt;ref name= chaplin /&gt; One possible explanation for this developmental difference comes from the child's parents.  In many Western cultures, for example, parents discuss and express a broader range of emotions with their daughters than their sons.&lt;ref name = wester&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = http://www.sagepub.com/counselingstudy/Journal%20Articles/Wester.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow older, these patterns continue with their peers.

The second major argument in support of social influences on emotion expression involves the idea that a society's gender roles reinforce gender differences.  The social constructionist theory states that children grow up in the context of gender roles that naturally place them in role-specific situations, influencing their emotion expression in that context.  Gender stereotypes in [[heteronormative]] societies enforce expectations for women to suppress anger and contempt, but express other emotions using words and facial expressions.  Simultaneously, these same cultural norms discourage men from verbally expressing emotions, with the exception of anger or contempt (Wester, Pressly, &amp; Heesacker, 2002).&lt;ref name = wester/&gt; As an adaptive feature, regulation of expression of emotion involves the consideration the social demands of any given situation.  Studies have shown that "fewer gender differences in emotion expression may be found when children are with someone they trust and know well than when children are with an unfamiliar person" (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name=chaplin /&gt; Generally, people are trained to behave in a "socially acceptable" way around strangers or acquaintances, suggesting that the social context of an environment can shape the levels of emotion expression.

Biological factors also play a role in influencing emotion expression.  One central biological argument is related to cognitive differences between genders. In a 2008 study using functional magnetic reasoning imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity in participants, researchers found that men and women differ in neural responses when experiencing negative emotions. "Compared with women, men showed lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, greater decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional responding, and lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions, which are associated with reward processing" (McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, &amp; Gross, 2008).&lt;ref name="mcrae"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McRae|first1=K.|last2=Ochsner|first2=K. N.|last3=Mauss|first3=I. B.|last4=Gabrieli|first4=J. J.|last5=Gross|first5=J. J.|year=2008|title=Gender differences in emotion regulation: An fMRI study of cognitive reappraisal|url=|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=11|issue=2|pages=143–162|doi=10.1177/1368430207088035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that male and female brains respond to emotions likely impacts the expression of those emotions.

The biological roots of gender differences interact with the social environment in various ways.  Biological theorists propose that females and males have innate differences that exist at birth, but unfold with age and maturation in response to interactions with their specific environments (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; An important argument for this viewpoint is that "gender differences in emotion expression are the result of a combination of biologically based temperamental predispositions and the socialization of boys and girls to adopt gender-related display rules for emotion expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L | year = 1997 | title = Gender and Emotion: Beyond Stereotypes | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 369–394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1997.tb02448.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that even infant males display higher levels of activity and arousal than do infant girls as well as a lower ability for language and behavior inhibitory controls, which are biologically-based characteristics.  This "nature" argument interacts with "nurture" in that "parents and other socialization agents may respond to boys in ways that dampen emotional expressiveness…as a way to down-regulate their high emotional arousal and activity levels".&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; On the other hand, girls are encouraged to utilize their higher vocabulary and communication skills to verbally express their emotions to parents and other adults, which would also highlight expression differences between genders.

== "Man-box" ==
References to a figurative "man-box", an idea often attributed to [[TED (conference)|TED]] speaker Tony Porter, attempts to describe the societal restrictions on a man's freedom of emotional expression. As Porter describes, this restriction is a primary reason for high rates of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porter|first=Tony|title=A call to men|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_porter_a_call_to_men|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his organization, ''A Call to Men'', Porter and his team organize initiatives and create awareness about what it means to possess "healthy manhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acalltomen.org/about-us/our-vision/|title=Mission/Vision|website=A Call To Men|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'man-box' is an analogous attempt to shed light on some of the cultural and social barriers we impose on men such as emotional reservedness, lack of physical intimacy with other men, and expectations of aggressive and/or dominant behavior in social environments.

==Controversies==
Emotions are complex and involve different components, such as physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience. While the expressive component of emotion has been widely studied, it remains unclear whether or not men and women differ in other aspects of emotion.  Most researchers agree that women are more emotionally expressive, but not that they experience more emotions than men do.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; Some studies have shown that women are more likely to produce inauthentic smiles than men do, while others have shown the opposite.  This debate is significant because emotion can be generated by adopting an action that is associated with a particular emotion, such as smiling and speaking softly.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

A possible explanation is that both men and women's emotional expressiveness is susceptible to social factors. Men and women may be reinforced by social and cultural standards to express emotions differently, but it is not necessarily true in terms of experiencing emotions. For instance, studies suggest that women often occupy roles that conform to feminine display rules, which require them to amplify their emotional response to impress others.&lt;ref name = derks /&gt;

{{Beyond the Standard Model|expanded=Theories}}

A '''Grand Unified Theory''' ('''GUT''') is a model in [[particle physics]] in which, at high [[energy]], the three [[gauge theory|gauge interactions]] of the [[Standard Model]] which define the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], [[Weak interaction|weak]], and [[strong interaction|strong]] [[fundamental interaction|interactions]], or [[forces]], are merged into one single force. This unified interaction is characterized by one larger [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] and thus several force carriers, but one unified [[coupling constant]]. If Grand Unification is realized in nature, there is the possibility of a [[grand unification epoch]] in the early universe in which the fundamental forces are not yet distinct.

Models that do not unify all interactions using one [[simple group]] as the gauge symmetry, but do so using [[semisimple group]]s, can exhibit similar properties and are sometimes referred to as Grand Unified Theories as well.

Unifying [[gravity]] with the other three interactions would provide a [[theory of everything]] (TOE), rather than a GUT. Nevertheless, GUTs are often seen as an intermediate step towards a TOE.

The novel particles predicted by GUT models are expected to have masses around the [[GUT scale]]{{clarify|date=March 2016}}—just a few orders of magnitude below the [[Planck scale]]—and so will be well beyond the reach of any foreseen particle collider experiments. Therefore, the particles predicted by GUT models will be unable to be observed directly and instead the effects of grand unification might be detected through indirect observations such as [[proton decay]], electric dipole moments of elementary particles, or the properties of [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=G. |date=1984 |title=Grand Unified Theories |pages= |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |isbn=978-0-8053-6968-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some GUTs, such as the [[Pati-Salam model]], predict the existence of [[magnetic monopoles]].

GUT models which aim to be completely realistic are quite complicated, even compared to the Standard Model, because they need to introduce additional fields and interactions, or even additional dimensions of space. The main reason for this complexity lies in the difficulty of reproducing the observed fermion masses and mixing angles which may be related to an existence of some additional [[family symmetries]] beyond the conventional GUT models. Due to this difficulty, and due to the lack of any observed effect of grand unification so far, there is no generally accepted GUT model.

{{unsolved|physics|Are the three forces of the Standard Model unified at high energies? By which symmetry is this unification governed? Can Grand Unification explain the number of fermion generations and their masses?}}

==History==
Historically, the first true GUT which was based on the [[simple group|simple Lie group]] {{math|[[SU(5)]]}}, was proposed by [[Howard Georgi]] and [[Sheldon Glashow]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Georgi |first=H. |last2=Glashow |first2=S.L.
 |date=1974 |title=Unity of All Elementary Particle Forces |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=32 |issue=8 |pages=438–41 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.32.438|bibcode=1974PhRvL..32..438G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Georgi–Glashow model]] was preceded by the [[semisimple Lie algebra]] [[Pati–Salam model]] by [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Jogesh Pati]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pati |first=J. |last2=Salam |first2=A. |date=1974 |title=Lepton Number as the Fourth Color |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=10 |pages=275–89 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.10.275 |bibcode = 1974PhRvD..10..275P }}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered the idea to unify gauge interactions.

The acronym GUT was first coined in 1978 by CERN researchers [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]], [[Andrzej Buras]], [[Mary K. Gaillard]], and [[Dimitri Nanopoulos]], however in the final version of their paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buras |first1=A.J.
 |last2=Ellis |first2=J. |last3=Gaillard |first3=M.K. |last4=Nanopoulos |first4=D.V. |date=1978 |title=Aspects of the grand unification of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions |journal=[[Nuclear Physics B]] |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=66–92
 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(78)90214-6 |url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/132734/files/197712054.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-21|bibcode = 1978NuPhB.135...66B }}&lt;/ref&gt; they opted for the less anatomical GUM (Grand Unification Mass). Nanopoulos later that year was the first to use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nanopoulos |first=D.V. |date=1979 |title=Protons Are Not Forever |url=http://www-spires.fnal.gov/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=r+HUTP-78-A062 |journal=[[Orbis Scientiae]] |volume=1 |page=91 |id=Harvard Preprint HUTP-78/A062}}&lt;/ref&gt; the acronym in a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellis |first=J. |title=Physics gets physical |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=415 |page=957 |date=2002 |doi=10.1038/415957b |issue=6875 |bibcode=2002Natur.415..957E |pmid=11875539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
The fact that the [[electric charge]]s of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s seem to cancel each other exactly to extreme precision is essential for the existence of the macroscopic world as we know it, but this important property of elementary particles is not explained in the Standard Model of particle physics. While the description of [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] interactions within the Standard Model is based on [[gauge theory|gauge symmetries]] governed by the [[simple Lie group|simple symmetry groups]] {{math|[[SU(3)]]}} and {{math|[[SU(2)]]}} which allow only discrete charges, the remaining component, the [[weak hypercharge]] interaction is described by an [[Abelian Group|abelian symmetry]] {{math|[[U(1)]]}} which in principle allows for arbitrary charge assignments.&lt;ref group=note&gt;There are however certain constraints on the choice of particle charges from theoretical consistency, in particular [[gauge anomaly|anomaly cancellation]].&lt;/ref&gt; The observed [[charge quantization]], namely the fact that all known [[elementary particle]]s carry electric charges which appear to be exact multiples of ⅓ of the [[elementary charge|"elementary" charge]], has led to the idea that [[hypercharge]] interactions and possibly the strong and weak interactions might be embedded in one Grand Unified interaction described by a single, larger simple symmetry group containing the Standard Model. This would automatically predict the quantized nature and values of all elementary particle charges. Since this also results in a prediction for the relative strengths of the [[fundamental interaction]]s which we observe, in particular the [[weak mixing angle]], Grand Unification ideally reduces the number of independent input parameters, but is also constrained by observations.

Grand Unification is reminiscent of the unification of electric and magnetic forces by [[Maxwell equations|Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]] in the 19th century, but its physical implications and mathematical structure are qualitatively different.

===SU(5)===

In addition to [[Standard Model]] particles, the theory includes twelve colored X bosons, responsible for [[proton decay]].]]

{{math|SU(5)}} is the simplest GUT. The smallest [[simple Lie group]] which contains the [[standard model]], and upon which the first Grand Unified Theory was based, is

:&lt;math&gt; SU(5) \supset SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Such group symmetries allow the reinterpretation of several known particles{{which|date=March 2016}} as different states of a single particle field. However, it is not obvious that the simplest possible choices for the extended "Grand Unified" symmetry should yield the correct inventory of elementary particles. The fact that all currently known matter particles fit nicely into three copies of the smallest [[group representation]]s of {{math|SU(5)}} and immediately carry the correct observed charges, is one of the first and most important reasons why people believe that a Grand Unified Theory might actually be realized in nature.

The two smallest [[group representation#Reducibility|irreducible representations]] of {{math|SU(5)}} are {{math|'''5'''}}{{clarify|date=March 2016}} and {{math|'''10'''}}. In the standard assignment, the {{math|'''5'''}} contains the [[Charge Conjugation|charge conjugates]] of the right-handed [[Quark|down-type quark]] [[Quantum chromodynamics|color]] [[Triplet state|triplet]] and a left-handed [[lepton]] [[isospin]] [[Doublet state|doublet]], while the {{math|'''10'''}} contains the six [[Quark|up-type quark]] components, the left-handed [[Quark|down-type quark]] [[Quantum chromodynamics|color]] triplet, and the right-handed [[electron]]. This scheme has to be replicated for each of the three known [[Generation (particle physics)|generations of matter]]. It is notable that the theory is [[Gauge anomaly|anomaly free]] with this matter content.

The hypothetical [[neutrino#Chirality|right-handed neutrinos]] are a singlet of {{math|SU(5)}}, which means its mass is not forbidden by any symmetry; it doesn't need a spontaneous symmetry breaking which explains why its mass would be heavy.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} (see [[seesaw mechanism]]).

===SO(10)===
{{main article|SO(10) (physics)}}

[[File:E6GUT.svg|200px|right|thumb|The pattern of [[weak isospin]], W, weaker isospin, W', strong g3 and g8, and baryon minus lepton, B, charges for particles in the [[SO(10)]] Grand Unified Theory, rotated to show the embedding in [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]].]]

The next simple Lie group which contains the standard model is

:&lt;math&gt;SO(10)\supset SU(5)\supset SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, the unification of matter is even more complete, since the [[group representation|irreducible]] [[spinor]] [[group representation|representation]] {{math|'''16'''}} contains both the {{math|{{overline|'''5'''}}}} and {{math|'''10'''}} of {{math|SU(5)}} and a right-handed neutrino, and thus the complete particle content of one generation of the extended [[standard model]] with [[Neutrino|neutrino masses]]. This is already the largest [[Simple Lie group|simple group]] which achieves the unification of matter in a scheme involving only the already known matter particles (apart from the [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs sector]]).

Since different standard model fermions are grouped together in larger representations, GUTs specifically predict relations among the fermion masses, such as between the [[electron]] and the [[down quark]], the [[muon]] and the [[strange quark]], and the [[tau lepton]] and the [[bottom quark]] for {{math|SU(5)}} and {{math|SO(10)}}. Some of these mass relations hold approximately, but most don't (see [[Georgi-Jarlskog mass relation]]).

The boson matrix for {{math|SO(10)}} is found by taking the {{math|15 × 15}} matrix from the {{math|'''10''' + '''5'''}} representation of {{math|SU(5)}} and adding an extra row and column for the right-handed neutrino. The bosons are found by adding a partner to each of the 20 charged bosons (2 right-handed W bosons, 6 massive charged gluons and 12 X/Y type bosons) and adding an extra heavy neutral Z-boson to make 5 neutral bosons in total. The boson matrix will have a boson or its new partner in each row and column. These pairs combine to create the familiar 16D Dirac [[spinor]] matrices of {{math|SO(10)}}.

===Extended Grand Unified Theories===
Non-chiral extensions of the Standard Model with vectorlike split-multiplet particle spectra which naturally appear in the higher SU(N) GUTs considerably modify the desert physics and lead to the realistic (string-scale) grand unification for conventional three quark-lepton families even without using [[supersymmetry]] (see below). On the other hand, due to a new missing VEV mechanism emerging in the supersymmetric SU(8) GUT the simultaneous solution to the gauge hierarchy (doublet-triplet splitting) problem and problem of unification of flavor can be found.&lt;ref&gt;J.L.Chkareuli, SU(N) SUSY GUTS WITH STRING REMNANTS: MINIMAL SU(5) AND BEYOND, Invited Talk given at 29th International Conference on High-Energy Physics (ICHEP 98), Vancouver, 23–29 July 1998. In *Vancouver 1998, High energy physics, vol. 2 1669–73&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GUTs with four families / generations, SU(8)''': Assuming 4 generations of fermions instead of 3 makes a total of {{math|'''64'''}} types of particles. These can be put into {{math|'''64''' {{=}} '''8''' + '''56'''}} representations of {{math|SU(8)}}. This can be divided into {{math|SU(5) × SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; × U(1)}} which is the {{math|SU(5)}} theory together with some heavy bosons which act on the generation number.

'''GUTs with four families / generations, O(16)''': Again assuming 4 generations of fermions, the '''128''' particles and anti-particles can be put into a single spinor representation of {{math|O(16)}}.

===Symplectic groups and quaternion representations===
Symplectic gauge groups could also be considered. For example, {{math|Sp(8)}} (which is called {{math|Sp(4)}} in the article [[symplectic group]]) has a representation in terms of {{math|4 × 4}} quaternion unitary matrices which has a {{math|'''16'''}} dimensional real representation and so might be considered as a candidate for a gauge group. {{math|Sp(8)}} has 32 charged bosons and 4 neutral bosons. Its subgroups include {{math|SU(4)}} so can at least contain the gluons and photon of {{math|SU(3) × U(1)}}. Although it's probably not possible to have weak bosons acting on chiral fermions in this representation. A quaternion representation of the fermions might be:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
e+i\overline{e}+jv+k\overline{v} \\
u_r+i\overline{u_r}+jd_r+k\overline{d_r} \\
u_g+i\overline{u_g}+jd_g+k\overline{d_g} \\
u_b+i\overline{u_b}+jd_b+k\overline{d_b} \\
\end{bmatrix}_L &lt;/math&gt;

A further complication with [[quaternion]] representations of fermions is that there are two types of multiplication: left multiplication and right multiplication which must be taken into account. It turns out that including left and right-handed {{math|4 × 4}} quaternion matrices is equivalent to including a single right-multiplication by a unit quaternion which adds an extra SU(2) and so has an extra neutral boson and two more charged bosons. Thus the group of left- and right-handed {{math|4 × 4}} quaternion matrcies is {{math|Sp(8) × SU(2)}} which does include the standard model bosons:

:&lt;math&gt; SU(4,H)_L\times H_R = Sp(8)\times SU(2) \supset SU(4)\times SU(2) \supset SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1) &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a quaternion valued spinor, &lt;math&gt;A^{ab}_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is quaternion hermitian {{math|4 × 4}} matrix coming from {{math|Sp(8)}} and &lt;math&gt;B_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a pure imaginary quaternion (both of which are 4-vector bosons) then the interaction term is:

::&lt;math&gt;\overline{\psi^{a}} \gamma_\mu\left( A^{ab}_\mu\psi^b + \psi^a B_\mu \right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Octonion representations===
It can be noted that a generation of 16 fermions can be put into the form of an [[octonion]] with each element of the octonion being an 8-vector. If the 3 generations are then put in a 3x3 hermitian matrix with certain additions for the diagonal elements then these matrices form an exceptional (Grassmann-) [[Jordan algebra]], which has the symmetry group of one of the exceptional Lie groups (F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; or E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) depending on the details.

:&lt;math&gt;\psi=\begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; e &amp; \mu \\
\overline{e} &amp; b &amp; \tau \\
\overline{\mu} &amp; \overline{\tau} &amp; c
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[\psi_A,\psi_B] \subset J_3(O)&lt;/math&gt;

Because they are fermions the anti-commutators of the Jordan algebra become commutators. It is known that E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has subgroup {{math|O(10)}} and so is big enough to include the Standard Model. An E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; gauge group, for example, would have 8 neutral bosons, 120 charged bosons and 120 charged anti-bosons. To account for the 248 fermions in the lowest multiplet of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, these would either have to include anti-particles (and so have [[baryogenesis]]), have new undiscovered particles, or have gravity-like ([[spin connection]]) bosons affecting elements of the particles spin direction. Each of these possess theoretical problems.

===Beyond Lie groups===
Other structures have been suggested including [[Lie 3-algebra]]s and [[Lie superalgebra]]s. Neither of these fit with [[Yang–Mills theory]]. In particular Lie superalgebras would introduce bosons with the wrong{{clarify|date=January 2016}} statistics. [[Supersymmetry]] however does fit with Yang–Mills. For example, N=4 Super Yang Mills Theory requires an {{math|SU(''N'')}} gauge group{{clarify|date=January 2016}}.

==Unification of forces and the role of supersymmetry==
The unification of forces is possible due to the energy scale dependence of force [[coupling constant|coupling parameters]] in [[quantum field theory]] called [[renormalization group|renormalization group running]], which allows parameters with vastly different values at usual energies to converge to a single value at a much higher energy scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross |first=G. |date=1984 |title=Grand Unified Theories |pages= |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |isbn=978-0-8053-6968-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[renormalization group]] running of the three gauge couplings in the [[Standard Model]] has been found to nearly, but not quite, meet at the same point if the [[hypercharge]] is normalized so that it is consistent with {{math|SU(5)}} or {{math|SO(10)}} GUTs, which are precisely the GUT groups which lead to a simple fermion unification. This is a significant result, as other Lie groups lead to different normalizations. However, if the [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] extension [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|MSSM]] is used instead of the Standard Model, the match becomes much more accurate. In this case, the coupling constants of the strong and electroweak interactions meet at the [[grand unification energy]], also known as the GUT scale:

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{\text{GUT}} \approx 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is commonly believed that this matching is unlikely to be a coincidence, and is often quoted as one of the main motivations to further investigate [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric theories]] despite the fact that no supersymmetric partner particles have been experimentally observed. Also, most model builders simply assume [[supersymmetry]] because it solves the [[hierarchy problem]]—i.e., it stabilizes the electroweak [[MSSM Higgs Mass|Higgs mass]] against [[Renormalization|radiative correction]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Neutrino masses==
Since [[Majorana fermion|Majorana]] masses of the right-handed neutrino are forbidden by {{math|SO(10)}} symmetry, {{math|SO(10)}} GUTs predict the Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos to be close to the [[GUT scale]] where the symmetry is [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] in those models. In [[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] GUTs, this scale tends to be larger than would be desirable to obtain realistic masses of the light, mostly left-handed neutrinos (see [[neutrino oscillation]]) via the [[seesaw mechanism]].

==Proposed theories==
Several theories have been proposed, but none is currently universally accepted. An even more ambitious theory that includes ''all'' [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]], including [[gravitation]], is termed a [[theory of everything]]. Some common [[mainstream]] GUT models are:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
* minimal [[left-right model]] — {{math|SU(3)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; × SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; × SU(2)&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; × U(1)&lt;sub&gt;B-L&lt;/sub&gt;}}
* [[Georgi–Glashow model]] — {{math|SU(5)}}
* [[SO(10) (physics)|SO(10)]]
* [[Flipped SU(5)|Flipped {{math|SU(5)}}]] — {{math|SU(5) × U(1)}}
* [[Pati–Salam model]] — {{math|SU(4) × SU(2) × SU(2)}}
* [[flipped SO(10)|Flipped {{math|SO(10)}}]] — {{math|SO(10) × U(1)}}
{{col-break}}
* [[Trinification]] — {{math|SU(3) × SU(3) × SU(3)}}
* [[SU(6) (physics)|{{math|SU(6)}}]]
* [[E6 (mathematics)|{{math|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]
* [[331 model]]

Not quite GUTs:

{{col-break}}

''Note'': These models refer to [[Lie algebra]]s not to [[Lie group]]s. The Lie group could be {{math|[SU(4) × SU(2) × SU(2)]/'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, just to take a random example.

The most promising candidate is {{math|[[SO(10)]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=kmxkDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA351&amp;lpg=PA351&amp;dq=The+most+promising+candidate+is+SO(10)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-ETmyYYuBf&amp;sig=skJuPs80bKrJeCAKZN0VOVZweUQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimuOvTgMrYAhUBNI8KHQwnD9gQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20most%20promising%20candidate%20is%20SO(10)&amp;f=false|title=Fundamental Interactions: A Memorial Volume for Wolfgang Kummer|last=Grumiller|first=Daniel|date=2010|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814277839|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=M6_KCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA265&amp;lpg=RA1-PA265&amp;dq=SO(10)+grand+unified+theory+promising&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9wqBWc-18Q&amp;sig=enB9cwjNRU8ptCp1J6fI14DxRas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZusuXjc_YAhUEk5QKHdO4AlEQ6AEIRTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=SO(10)%20grand%20unified%20theory%20promising&amp;f=false|title=Pascos 2004: Part I: Particles, Strings And Cosmology; Part Ii: Themes In Unification -- The Pran Nath Festschrift - Proceedings Of The Tenth International Symposium|last=Pran|first=Nath|last2=T|first2=Vaughn Michael|last3=George|first3=Alverson|date=2005-08-19|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814479967|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Minimal) {{math|SO(10)}} does not contain any [[exotic fermion]]s (i.e. additional fermions besides the [[Standard Model]] fermions and the right-handed neutrino), and it unifies each generation into a single [[irreducible representation]]. A number of other GUT models are based upon subgroups of {{math|SO(10)}}. They are the minimal [[left-right model]], {{math|[[SU(5)]]}}, [[flipped SU(5)|flipped {{math|SU(5)}}]] and the [[Pati–Salam model]]. The GUT group E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; contains {{math|SO(10)}}, but models based upon it are significantly more complicated. The primary reason for studying E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; models comes from {{math|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; × E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}} [[heterotic string theory]].

GUT models generically predict the existence of [[topological defect]]s such as [[magnetic monopoles|monopoles]], [[cosmic strings]], [[Domain wall (string theory)|domain wall]]s, and others. But none have been observed. Their absence is known as the [[monopole problem]] in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Many GUT models also predict [[proton decay]], although not the Pati–Salam model; proton decay has never been observed by experiments. The minimal experimental limit on the proton's lifetime pretty much rules out minimal {{math|SU(5)}} and heavily constrains the other models. The lack of detected supersymmetry to date also constrains many models.

Some GUT theories like {{math|SU(5)}} and {{math|SO(10)}} suffer from what is called the [[doublet-triplet problem]]. These theories predict that for each electroweak Higgs doublet, there is a corresponding [[color charge|colored]] Higgs triplet field with a very small mass (many orders of magnitude smaller than the GUT scale here). In theory, unifying [[quark]]s with [[lepton]]s, the Higgs doublet would also be unified with a Higgs triplet. Such triplets have not been observed. They would also cause extremely rapid proton decay (far below current experimental limits) and prevent the gauge coupling strengths from running together in the renormalization group.

Most GUT models require a threefold replication of the matter fields. As such, they do not explain why there are three generations of fermions. Most GUT models also fail to explain the [[little hierarchy]] between the fermion masses for different generations.

==Ingredients==
A GUT model consists of a [[gauge group]] which is a [[compact Lie group]], a [[connection form]] for that Lie group, a [[Yang–Mills action]] for that connection given by an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] [[symmetric bilinear form]] over its Lie algebra (which is specified by a [[coupling constant]] for each factor), a [[Higgs sector]] consisting of a number of scalar fields taking on values within real/complex [[representations of Lie groups|representations]] of the Lie group and chiral [[Weyl fermion]]s taking on values within a complex rep of the Lie group. The Lie group contains the [[Standard Model group]] and the Higgs fields acquire [[VEV]]s leading to a [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] to the [[Standard Model]]. The Weyl fermions represent matter.

==Current status==
There is currently no hard evidence that nature is described by a Grand Unified Theory. The discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]]s indicates that the Standard Model is incomplete and has led to renewed interest toward certain GUT such as {{math|SO(10)}}. One of the few possible experimental tests of certain GUT is [[proton decay]] and also fermion masses. There are a few more special tests for supersymmetric GUT. However, minimum proton lifetimes from research (at or exceeding the 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; year range) have ruled out simpler GUTs and most non-SUSY models. The maximum upper limit on proton lifetime (if unstable), is calculated at 6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; years for SUSY models and 1.4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; years for minimal non-SUSY GUTs.&lt;ref&gt;Pran Nath and Pavel Fileviez Perez, "Proton Stability
in Grand Unified Theories, in Strings and in Branes", Appendix H; 23 April 2007.  arXiv:hep-ph/0601023  https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0601023&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gauge coupling]] strengths of [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]], the [[weak interaction]] and [[hypercharge]] seem to meet at a common length scale called the [[Grand unification energy|GUT scale]] and equal approximately to 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; GeV (slightly less than the [[Planck energy]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; GeV), which is somewhat suggestive. This interesting numerical observation is called the '''gauge coupling unification''', and it works particularly well if one assumes the existence of [[superpartner]]s of the Standard Model particles. Still it is possible to achieve the same by postulating, for instance, that ordinary (non supersymmetric) {{math|SO(10)}} models break with an intermediate gauge scale, such as the one of Pati–Salam group.

The '''ISO/IEC 15288''' is a [[systems engineering]] standard covering processes and lifecycle stages. Initial planning for the ISO/IEC 15288:2002(E) standard started in 1994 when the need for a common systems engineering process framework was recognized. The previously accepted standard MIL STD 499A (1974) was cancelled after a memo from SECDEF prohibited the use of most [[United States Military Standard]]s without a waiver. The first edition was issued on 1 November 2002. [[Stuart Arnold]] was the editor and [[Harold Lawson]] was the architect of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.org/?attach_external_tab&amp;217&amp;3&amp;50&amp;50&amp;784&amp;530&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;IE Systems Engineering – Guide for ISO/IEC 15288 (System Life Cycle Processes)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 this standard was adopted as IEEE 15288. ISO/IEC 15288 has been updated 1 February 2008 as well as on 15 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=63711 ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO/IEC 15288 is managed by [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7|ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7]], which is the ISO committee responsible for developing ISO standards in the area of Software and Systems Engineering. ISO/IEC 15288 is part of the SC 7 Integrated set of Standards, and other standards in this domain include:
* ISO/IEC TR 15504 which addresses capability
* ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288 which address lifecycle and
* ISO 9001 &amp; ISO 9000-3 which address quality

==History==
* ISO/IEC 15288:2015
* Revises: ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (harmonized with ISO/IEC 12207:2008)
* Revises: ISO/IEC 15288:2002 (first edition)

==Processes==
The standard defines processes divided into four categories:
* Technical
* Project
* Agreement, and
* Enterprise

Each process is defined by a purpose, outcomes, and activities. ISO 15288 comprises 25 processes which have 123 outcomes derived from 403 activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.se/old/images/Roedler%20Abstract%20ISO%20IEC%2015288.pdf What is ISO/IEC 15288 and Why Should I Care?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs) are non-profit organizations that employ [[grassroots]] organizing, direct advocacy, [[investigative journalism]], and [[Law suit|litigation]] to affect public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. PIRG: About Us |url=http://www.uspirg.org/page/usp/about-us |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Illinois PIRG was founded in 1987, and has offices in [[Chicago]], [[Springfield, IL]], and a national lobbying office in Washington, D.C. called [[US PIRG]].&lt;ref name="Benton Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Benton Foundation]] |url=http://www.benton.org/sites/benton.org/files/bentonetal_Final.doc |title=In the Matter of Third Periodic Review of the Commission’s Rules and Policies Affecting the Conversion To Digital Television, Comments of Illinois PIRG" |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. [[college]] campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book ''[[Action for a Change]]'' by [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Donald K. Ross (author)|Donald Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|title=Action for a Change: A Student's Manual for Public Interest Organizing|year=1972|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York|author2=Donald Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other early accomplishments, the PIRGs were responsible for much of the [[Container deposit legislation#United States|Container Container Deposit Legislation in the United States]], also known as "bottle bills."&lt;ref name="Boston College, The Heights, Volume LVI, Number 4, 22 September 1975"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Boston College]] |url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=bcheights19750922.2.30|title=PIRG Backs "Bottle Bill"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Sun Sentinel]] |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-08/news/9102150529_1_bottle-bill-beverage-containers-industry-recycling-program|title=Bottle Bill Beverage Containers Recycling Program"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1937">The '''Institute of Wood Science''' was a British organisation that researched wood.

==History==
It was established in 1955. It is a research institute for the [[British timber trade|wood industry in the UK]].

The Institute of Wood Science is now known as the Wood Technology Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom3.org/wood-technology-society/about-wood-technology-society Wood Technology Society]&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining]].

==Structure==
It was situated in [[Hughenden Valley]] in Hughenden, north of [[High Wycombe]] west of the A4128, home of the British furniture industry. The site is also the headquarters of the [[Timber Research and Development Association]], or TRADA. The site is also known as Trada Technology. It is not a government organisation.

TRADA is owned by [[Exova]] BM TRADA.

==Function==
It researches wood products. Its journal is the [[International Wood Products Journal]].

===UK timber industry===
It is the UK's examining body for the UK timber trade. It organises training at its site and at [[The Horse Trust]] nearby.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3019">'''Intercultural therapy''' is a form of [[psychotherapy]] aimed at benefiting [[culturally diverse]] groups. It recognises the importance of race, culture, beliefs, values, attitudes, religion and language in the life of the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been developed by Jafar Kareem in his book ''Intercultural Therapy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kareem (1992) believed that there are some intrinsic differences between individual human beings, either in their biology, their personality or both, and that both inter- and intrapsychic events profoundly affect an individual's psyche and develop as part of their unconscious life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kareem|first1=Jafar|title=Intercultural Therapy: Themes, Interpretations and Practice|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0632052240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the external world, then, are real but they are also internalised. 

Intercultural therapy responds to the cultural variances identified by the field of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zanatta|first=Francesca|date=2008|title=Intercultural therapy and ethnopsychoanalysis: Are they both 'possession'?|journal=Opticon 1826|issue=4|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/opticon1826/archive/issue4/Art_BMS_Zanatta_Ethnopsychoanalysis_Pub.pdf|doi=10.5334/opt.040810}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intercultural therapist must take the external realities of a client's life into account, such as poverty, refugee status, racism, sexism, physical health and physical abilities.

Intercultural therapy recognises the differences and similarities of various aspects of culture for both the client and therapist, and that the very fact of being from another culture involves both conscious and unconscious assumptions, both in the patient and in the therapist. These unconscious assumptions sometimes mean traditional modes of therapy do not address the needs of someone from outside a dominant culture, or that therapy is not offered to them in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Troche|first1=Ursula|title=Intercultural therapy|journal=The Independent Practitioner|date=2008|volume=Summer|page=2|url=http://bacppp.org.uk/_sitedata/1391515928%20Z3A0IvmuG/JournalsFromOldSite/2970_summer08.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/Upload/Documents/FINAL_WEB_POLICY_FRAMEWORK_30_NOV_2015.pdf Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (IPFSD)]''' is a dynamic document created to help governments formulate sound investment policy, especially [[international investment agreement]]s (IIAs), that capitalize on [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) for [[sustainable development]]. It was prepared by the Division on Investment and Enterprise (DIAE) of the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD). IPFSD is not a negotiated text or undertaking between States; but rather an initiative by the UNCTAD Secretariat that represents expert guidance while leaving domestic policy makers free to ''adapt and adopt.'' IPFSD is the result of numerous consultations with experts and is intended as a platform to provide for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders. The main objective of the IPFSD is to create a balance between the rights and obligations of States and investors while maintaining attractive investment environments.

In the face of persistent global economic and social challenges, UNCTAD's IPFSD intends to:

*Promote a new generation of investment agreements by pursuing a broader development agenda; and
*Offer guidance to policymakers when formulating their national and international investment policies.

To that end, IPFSD defines eleven critical Core Principles. Flowing from these Core Principles IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policy including clause-by-clause options for negotiators to enhance the [[sustainable development]] value of domestic investment policies.

== Background to the IPFSD ==

IPFSD has grown out of a long precedent of [[UN]] Member States calling for sustainable economic development, an understanding that investment is a critical aspect of [[sustainable development]], and UNCTAD's three-and-a-half decades of experience in research and policy analysis.

The [[UN Charter]] promotes, ''inter alia'', the goal of economic and social progress. The [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) call for a Global Partnership for Development. In particular, Goal 8 encourages the further development of an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system, which includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction, both nationally and internationally- concepts that apply equally to the investment system. The “Monterrey Consensus” of the UN Conference on Financing for Development 2002, acknowledges that countries need to continue their efforts to achieve a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate. The UN Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of September 2002, following up on the Rio Declaration, calls for the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for [[sustainable development]], which integrate economic, social and environmental aspects. The 4th UN Conference on [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDCs) in May 2011 adopted the Istanbul Programme of Action with a strong focus on productive capacity building and structural transformation as core elements to achieve more robust, balanced, equitable, and inclusive sustainable development. Finally, the 2012 UNCTAD XIII Conference recognized the role of FDI in sustainable development and inclusive growth.

Several other international instruments inspired the Core Principles that make up the IPFSD. They comprise, in particular, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], the Convention on the Establishment of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the [[World Bank]] Guidelines, the [[UN Global Compact]] and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and social policy and several [[WTO]]-related agreements, including the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]], the [[TRIMs]] Agreement and the Agreement on Government Procurement.

== Structure and components of the IPFSD ==
[[File:IPFSD Structure.jpg|450px|thumbnail|right]]
The IPFSD consists of eleven core principles which aim to guide the investment policy underlying IIAs. Flowing from these core principles, the IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policies. The IPFSD proposes clause-by-clause options for negotiators to strengthen the [[sustainable development]] aspects of IIAs.

IPFSD also offers an interactive online platform giving stakeholders the opportunity to critically assess policy guidelines and recommend any appropriate changes.

=== The Core Principles ===

The eleven core principles of the IPFSD are:
 
# Investment for sustainable development
# 
# Policy coherence
# 
# Public governance and institutions
# 
# Dynamic Policymaking
# 
# Balanced rights and obligations
# 
# Right to regulate
# 
# Openness to investment
# 
# Investment protection and treatment 
# 
# Investment promotion and facilitation
# 
# Corporate governance and responsibility 
# 
# International cooperation

=== National Investment Policy: Guidelines ===
The national investment policy guidelines translate the core principles for investment policy making into concrete guidelines at the national level, with a view to addressing specific policy changes. 
These guidelines are designed to ensure that investment policy is coherent with the overarching development strategy of countries, enhance the sustainable development impact of investment and promote responsible investment. The guidelines further aim to balance maximizing sustainable development outcomes while maintaining an attractive investment climate. 
The national investment policy guidelines targets policy action at three levels:

*''Strategic'' – policymakers should ground investment policy in a broad roadmap for economic growth and sustainable development, such as those set out in formal economic or industrial development strategies in many countries.
*''Normative'' – by setting rules and regulations on investment and in a range of other policy areas, policymakers can promote and regulate investment that is geared towards sustainable development goals.
*''Administrative'' – through appropriate implementation and institutional mechanisms, policymakers can ensure continued relevance and effectiveness of investment policies.

=== International Investment Agreements (IIAs):  Policy Options ===

The IPFSD aims to translate the Core Principles into concrete options for policymakers with a view to addressing today’s investment challenges by providing examples of how to draft IIAs that address sustainable development by strengthening development dimensions of IIAs, balancing the rights and obligations of States and investors, and managing the systematic complexity of the IIA regime. International investment policy must be addressed at three levels.

*''Strategic'' – this involves managing the interaction between IIAs and national policies, and those between IIAs and other international agreements e.g. human rights obligations.  The overall objective is to ensure coherence between IIAs and sustainable development goals.
*''Designing provisions for sustainable development''– this concerns addressing the policy space and balancing rights and obligations between States and investors, and effective investment promotion.
*''Building multilateral consensus on investment policy'' – this goes toward helping address the systemic challenges that emerge from overlaps and inconsistencies in the IIA regime.

The IPFSD suggests, clause-by-clause, how the IPFSD's Core Principles can be converted into concrete provisions in an IIA. Governments can choose from these explicit policy options those that best suit their countries’ levels of development and respective policy objectives.  Among others these include: adjustments of existing IIA provisions(e.g. making them more [[sustainable development]]-friendly through formulations that safeguard policy space and limit State liability); new provisions in IIAs (e.g. to balance investor rights and responsibilities and to promote responsible investment); and the introduction of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) (e.g. clauses for less-developed Parties to calibrate the level of obligations to the country’s level of development).

Some specific clause-level recommendations include:

*Narrowing the scope-and-definition clause to exclude portfolio, short-term or speculative investments from treaty coverage;
*Formulating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) clause as an exhaustive list of State obligations (e.g. not to (i) deny justice; (ii) treat investors in a manifestly arbitrary manner; (iii) flagrantly violate due process);
*Clarifying the distinction between legitimate regulatory activity and regulatory takings giving rise to compensation (i.e. indirect expropriations);
*Limiting the Full Protection and Security (FPS) clause to establish that "physical" security and protection will only commensurate with the country's level of development;
*Limiting the scope of the transfer-of-funds clause by providing an exhaustive list of covered payments/transfers, including exceptions triggered by serious balance-of-payment difficulties, and stipulating that the investor's transfer rights are contingent on its compliance with the host State's fiscal and other transfer-related obligations;
*Including exceptions to protect human rights, health, core labour standards and the environment, along with a check-and-balance system that ensures there is enough policy space while avoiding abuse; and
*Including clauses designed to eliminate or make investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) the last resort (e.g. after the investor's exhaustion of local remedies and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms).

== The New Generation of Investment Policies ==

The IPFSD embodies the new generation of investment policies that seeks to create a more intricate development strategy that maintains a favorable investment climate.  New generation investment policies seek to give investment policy a more prominent place in development strategies.  The continuous need to respond to newly emerging challenges and trends make it necessary to review and modify these guidelines.

== Dynamic Nature of IPFSD and The Investment Policy Hub ==

IPFSD has been designed with the intention of providing immediate technical assistance for the negotiation of investment agreements, while maintaining a dialog between investment policy stakeholders including the international development community, investors, business associations, labor unions, relevant NGOs and interest groups. The result of these ongoing multi-stakeholder consultations will be a dynamic document.

To that end, in concert with IPFSD, UNCTAD has provided a platform for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders—the [http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/ Investment Policy Hub] which allows investment stakeholders to post comments regarding the content of the IPFSD. The combination then, of IPFSD and the Investment Policy Hub will enable IPFSD to remain a valuable resource for investment policy makers into the future.

The '''Israel Meteorological Service''' ({{lang-he|השירות המטאורולוגי הישראלי}}, ''HaSherut HaMete'orologi HaYisra'eli'') is a unit of the Israeli Ministry of Transportation that is responsible for forecasting weather, meteorological data supply and climate research in Israel. Its origins begin in 1930's in a meteorological unit established by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government mainly as a support to the evolving aviation needs at the time. After establishment of the state of Israel, it was incorporated into the newly established ministry of transport. It is a member of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] since 1949. the Israeli Meteorological Service runs more than 150 measuring stations across Israel. Located between [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Mishmar HaShiva]], and [[Holon]], it is traditionally identified with also nearby [[Beit Dagan]].

Jersey's legislature, the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]] makes [[legislation]] affecting most areas of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide for Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law, chapter 8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Laws ====
[[File:1771 onwards Jersey Recueil des Lois.jpg|thumb|''Recueil de Lois de Jersey'' from 1771]]
The highest form of legislation made by the States is 'Laws'. If a proposed Law is likely to be controversial, the general desirability of having new legislation on the topic may be debated before the Law drafted. The procedure for making Laws is set out in the Standing Orders of the States of Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/lawsinforce/consolidated/16/16.800.15_StandingOrdersoftheStatesofJersey_RevisedEdition_1January2011.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the States of Jersey|date=1 January 2011}}; {{cite web|first=Lucy|last=Marsh-Smith|title=The Production of Legislation in the Crown Dependencies|year=2010|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221553/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Law is in draft from, it starts the legislative process as a ''projet de loi'', which may be introduced to the States by a [[Cabinet of Jersey|Minister]], any States Member, a [[scrutiny panel]] or the Comité des [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétables]]. At the stage known as 'first reading', the title of the projet is read out and the projet is 'lodged [[Greffier|au Greffe]]' providing a two to six week breathing space for Members to read the draft Law. Under Article 16 of the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|title=Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110631/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Minister or other person lodging the projet au Greffe must make a written statement that the provisions of the projet are compatible with [[ECHR|Convention rights]] or 'make a statement that although [he or she] is unable to make a statement of compatibility, [he or she] nevertheless wants the States to proceed with the projet'. At the next 'second reading' stage, there is a formal debate in the States chamber during which members consider the principle of the projet and then scrutinise the draft in detail. At 'third reading' stage there is an opportunity for minor drafting errors to be corrected. Finally, members vote to adopt the law.

The Law is then submitted via the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey|Lieutenant Governor]]'s office for transmission to London, where [[Politics of Jersey#Relations with the United Kingdom|officials]] in the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] examine the Law. In 2010, the [[House of Commons Justice Committee]] was highly critical of the UK Government's approach, finding that 'The Islands are more than adequately advised by their own Law Officers and Parliamentary Counsel. It seems a strange use of Ministry of Justice resources ... to engage in a kind of legislative oversight which does not restrict itself to the constitutional grounds for scrutiny'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons Justice Committee|title=Crown Dependencies, 8th Report of 2009-10, HC 56-1, para 62|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5607.htm#a6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process may take several months. In an unusual move in 2011, campaigners against a Law that sought to reduce the number of Senators in the States petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Senators plea reaches Privy Council|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 June 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/06/07/save-senators-plea-reaches-privy-council/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once official scrutiny is complete in London, the Law is formally presented to Her Majesty for [[Royal Assent]] at a meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], usually held at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.

After a Law receives Royal Assent, the final step is for it be registered with the [[Royal Court of Jersey]]. At this point it is 'passed'. The Law is then brought into force at a date decided by the relevant Jersey minister. There may be a considerable delay between a Law being passed and it becoming legally effective if, for example, civil servants need to be trained, computer systems put in place or money found to pay for the new scheme.

Laws adopted and passed are published in print as ''Recueil de Lois'' de Jersey and online by the [[Jersey Legal Information Board]] on the Jersey Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|title=Laws in Force|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234724/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|archivedate=2012-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

==== Other types of legislation ====
In Jersey, there are other types of legislation in addition to Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = 8 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regulations''': these are used where a Law delegates to the States Assembly power to make legally binding rules to implement a named Law.
* '''Triennial Regulations''': since the 18th century, the States of Jersey has had power to make provisional regulations of up to three years' duration.
* '''Orders and Rules''': these are generally made by a Minister, within the scope of powers set out in a Law.

=== Customary law ===
Custom is a source of law in the Jersey legal system. It has been described as "the product of generally accepted usage and practice. It has no formal sanction or authority behind it other than the general consensus of opinion within the community".&lt;ref&gt;Snell v Beadle [2001] UKPC 5 at [16] http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2001/5.html&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[English common law]] where rules stated by a judge of a senior court are binding law ''because'' they are stated by a judge. In customary law, the role of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary]] is to look for evidence of what is "generally accepted usage and practice".

Many rules of customary law have crystallised to such an extent (through repeated acknowledgment by the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] and in the way people conduct their affairs) that everyone accepts them as binding without discussion. The boundaries of the [[Parishes of Jersey|Parishes]], the existence of the office of [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)#Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]] and various rules relating to possession of land and inheritance fall into this category. Many rules of customary law are to be found discussed in the texts of the "Commentators" and the case law of the Jersey courts.  Where the works of the commentators do not deal with situation, the Jersey courts look at factual evidence to work out is the "generally accepted usage and practice".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Moran v Deputy Registrar for the Parish of St Helier'' [2007] JRC 151 http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007/07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055727/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007%2F07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customary law of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] is particularly influential as a source of law in Jersey, even though Jersey ceased to part of Normandy in 1204. Norman law developed in two main epochs–the "Ancienne coutume" (1199–1538) and the "Coutume reformée" (1538–1804).

==== Ancienne coutume of Normandy ====
The northern and western regions of Medieval Europe "were a patchwork of territorial areas in which the main source of law was customs, usages and practices which had become relatively fixed and settled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = Chapter 2 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman law was based on oral tradition and repeated practices in [[Feudal]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

When in 1309 [[Edward II of England]] sent Justices to Jersey, the people of Jersey were "asked by what law they claimed to be governed, the law of England, of Normandy, or by some special customs of their own? They answered 'By the law of Normandy, and referred the Justices to the ''Summa of Malcael'' [the Jersey name for the Grand Coutumier], where the Norman laws are well embodied'... But they added, and this a clause that caused much trouble later, 'except that we have certain customs used in this island from time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the 16th century, two commentaries on the Grand Coutumier, written in Normandy, have been influential in Jersey law. [[:fr:Guillaume Le Rouillé|Guillaume Rouillé of Alençon]] (also known as Le Rouillé) was the author of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-xCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ALe%20intitle%3AGrant%20intitle%3ACoustumier&amp;pg=PT3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Le Grant Coustumier du pays &amp; duché de Normendie : tres utile &amp; profitable a tous practiciens]'' (1534; 1539). He also produced commentary on the neighbouring province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] (pictured).

Guillaume Terrien's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xYaA_5KCB04C&amp;dq=Commentaires%20du%20droit%20civil%20tant%20public%20que%20priv%C3%A9%20observ%C3%A9%20au%20pays%20et%20Duch%C3%A9%20de%20Normandie&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commentaires du droit civil, tant public que privé, observé au pays et Duché de Normandie]'' was first published in 1574. Dawes explains: "Terrien’s own work comprised the selecting of texts from the ''Grand Coutumier'', putting them into an order which suited his scheme (even to the point of cutting and pasting quite disparate texts) and then commenting on the resulting amalgam. To this commentary a further author added notes headed 'Additio', more often than not in Latin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Dawes| first =Gordon| authorlink =| title =A note on Guillaume Terrien and his work| journal =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review| volume =| issue =| pages =| publisher =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd| location =| year =2007| language =| url =http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| jstor =| issn =| doi =| id =| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| accessdate =27 August 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055355/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| archivedate =13 January 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two modern versions of the text of the Grand Coutumier have been produced. The first was by [[Jurat]] William Laurence de Gruchy entitled ''L’Ancienne Coutume de Normandie: Réimpression, éditée avec de légères annotations'' (1881), based on Le Rouillé’s 1539 edition, using a double-column format setting out the Latin and French texts side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==== Coutume Reformée of Normandy ====
[[File:Berault_Coutume_Reformée_3rd_edn_1620.jpg|thumb|Berault's 1620 commentary]]
The second period in the development of Norman custom was between 1583 and 1804 and is known as the ''Coutume reformée'' (the reformed custom). In 1453, [[Charles VII of France]] issued orders that all the customary laws of France should be "redacted", in other words set out systematically and approved under royal authority. The [[Duchy of Normandy]] was the last part of France to comply with this order but the new text was eventually prepared and received royal approval in 1585 by [[Henry III of France]].

There are two reasons why the Coutume reformée might be thought to have little relevance to [[Jersey]]: it was created 380 years after Jersey had ceased formally to be part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] and it was a text sanctioned by the king of France. Nonetheless, Jersey lawyers and courts made frequent references to the Coutume reformée and by virtue of its assimilation into Jersey law over the centuries it is regarded as a source of the island's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Within France, customary law was abolished in 1804 with the introduction of uniform [[Napoleonic code|codes]] of civil and criminal law across the whole of France.

==== Jersey commentators on custom ====
As well as relying on commentaries produced in France, Jersey has an indigenous legal literature on custom. In the 17th century, [[Jean Poingdestre]] (1609–1691) and [[Philippe Le Geyt]] (1635–1716) wrote several works. Some chapters of [[Charles Sydney Le Gros|C.S. Le Gros]]' 20th century work, ''Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey'' also remain relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=C.S.|last=Le Gros|title=Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey|location=St Helier|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd|year=1943|ISBN=978-0-9557611-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legislative reforms of custom ====
Many rules of customary law have been amended or abolished by legislation in the later 19th and 20th centuries. Examples of this include:
* “Any rule of customary law, that a contract passed before the Royal Court for the transfer of immovable property may be annulled, at the instance of the heirs or devisees, as the case may be, of the transferor, if he or she dies within 40 days of the passing of the contract, is abolished” (Customary Law Amendment (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 1984).
* In customary law, the age of majority was 20 years; the Age of Majority (Jersey) Law 1999 reduces this to 18 years.
* “The rule under customary law that all gifts to a concubine are null is hereby abolished” (Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993).
* Customary law did not permit a cause of action for/against a person to survive the person’s death against/for the benefit of the person’s estate; Customary Law Amendment (Jersey) Law 1948 reversed this situation.
* The ''année de jouissance'' (the right of an executor to have the income arising during the administration of a moveable estate for a year and a day) was abolished by the Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993.

=== Influence of English and French law ===
Some fields of Jersey, such as negligence and administrative law, are heavily influenced by [[English common law#Common law|English common law]]. In other branches of law, notably contract, Jersey courts may have regard to [[French civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Law Commission |title=Consultation Paper No. 5: The Jersey Law of Contract |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/Contract.htm }}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide on Jersey Contract Law |url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights ===
The Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; based closely on the United Kingdom's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], requires Jersey courts so far as possible to interpret legislation so that it is compatible with rights and freedoms guaranteed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Jersey public bodies are required to act in conformity with Convention rights.

In January 2012, Jersey introduced laws to recognise same-sex civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-16536572 | work=BBC News | title=Jersey recognises civil partnerships | date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language of Jersey law ==
During the 20th century, the main working language of the Jersey legal system changed from French to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Timothy|last=Hanson|title=The Language of Law: the importance of French|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221249/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1930s, almost all legislation passed by the States Assembly was in French. Since then, French is used only where new legislation makes amendments to legislation originally drafted in French.&lt;ref&gt;All legislation is available on the [http://www.jerseylaw.je/ Jersey Law] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conveyancing of immoveable property was carried out using contracts drafted in French until October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Falle|title=The structure of a pro forma Jersey conveyance|year=2004|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june04/JLR0406_Falle.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221329/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june04/JLR0406_Falle.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Trotter|title=Commentary on Jersey Conveyance|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Trotter.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221404/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Trotter.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which contracts were required to be in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Falle|title=At the stroke of a pen …|year=2007|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Falle.aspx#page83|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221411/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Falle.aspx#page83|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several French [[Jersey Legal French|words and expressions]] used in Jersey differ from [[Standard French]].

==Precedent and law reporting==
[[File:Tables des Décisions de La Cour Royale de Jersey.jpg|thumb|''Tables de Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey'' 1885-1978]] The Jersey legal system does not follow the strict rules of [[binding precedent]] that exist in common law jurisdictions such as [[English law|England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;''Qatar v Al Thani'' 1999 Jersey Law Reports 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]] is not bound by its own previous decisions on a point of law but it will generally follow them unless persuaded that the earlier decision was wrongly decided. A similar approach is taken by the [[Courts of Jersey#Appeal courts|Court of Appeal]]. All Jersey courts are, however, bound by points of law decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in previous Jersey appeals to that court.

During the 19th and 20th centuries a series of improvements to the system of writing and reporting judgments was put in place. In 1885, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] began to publish the ''Tables des Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey''–a subject index to decided cases, prepared by the [[Greffier]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Law, Jersey, ''Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law'' (2011), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Charles Thomas Le Quesne]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] returned to Jersey from practice at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] and was appointed [[Lieutenant Bailiff of Jersey|Lieutenant Bailiff]]. Up to this point, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]]'s judgments were in the French style of ''jugements motivés'',{{French spelling}} written in French by the [[Greffier]] rather than the judge, and expressing the reasons for the court's decision only very briefly. Le Quesne changed the language of judgments to English and adopted the [[common law]] style of judgments, where the judge gives detailed reasons for accepting or rejecting the rival submissions made at trial by [[counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General v Weston'' 1979 Jersey Judgments 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1984, the Royal Court published its and the Court of Appeal judgments in a series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Judgments'' (eleven volumes in total). From 1984, judgments have been published a new series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Law Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reports International Ltd {{cite web |url=http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123022208/http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Jersey Legal Information Board (JLIB) was set up to promote "accessibility of the written law and legal processes to the public and of an integrated and efficient legal system, through the use of information technology and by other means".&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Legal Information Board (Incorporation) Law 2004 {{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f16%2f16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181215/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F16%2F16.335_JerseyLegalInformationBoard%28Incorporation%29Law2004_RevisedEdition_1January2006.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgments of the Royal Court and Court of Appeal are published online on [https://web.archive.org/web/20120929022406/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Search/default.aspx?target=uj www.jerseylaw.je], with open access to "unreported" judgments as part of the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

== Judiciary ==
The head of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary in Jersey]] is the [[Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]], who as well as performing the judicial functions of a [[chief justice]] is also the President ([[Speaker (politics)|presiding officer]]) of the [[legislature|States of Jersey]] and has certain civic, ceremonial and executive functions. The Bailiff's functions may be exercised by the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]].

=== Judicial appointments processes ===
The posts of Bailiff and [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]] are Crown appointments, formally made by Her Majesty the Queen, on [[Politics of Jersey#The Crown|advice]] of the UK government's [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

[[File:Juges Jour d'la Libéthâtion 2009 a.jpg|thumb|The Bailiff and Jurats outside the Royal Court in 2009]]An appointment process has developed in recent years, without a legislative basis, for vacancies for the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]], Attorney General for Jersey and Solicitor General for Jersey. This involves advertising for candidates and the preparation of a shortlist by a selection panel consisting of the Bailiff (in the chair), the senior [[Jurat]] and the chairman of the [[Jersey Appointments Commission]]. A process of consultation is then carried out, including the Jurats, the [[States Consultative Panel]] (which includes the [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]]), a number of elected members of the States, senior lawyers (the [[Bâtonnier]], the President of the Law Society, the former President of the [[Law Society of Jersey]] and the President of the [[Chambre des Ecrivains]]), the other Crown Officers and the local [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Commissioners|Commissioner]] of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]]. All candidates on the shortlist are then interviewed by the selection panel. A single name is then sent by the Lieutenant Governor to the Secretary of State for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=5–15|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process has not been used for appointment to the office of Bailiff on the basis that "The Secretary of State has accepted that the position of Deputy Bailiff is a training ground for the position of Bailiff, and that, therefore, all things being equal, you would expect to move up, assuming of course that you have performed to everyone's satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|page=14|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jurat]]s are elected by an [[electoral college]] consisting of the Bailiff, the Jurats, the [[Constable#Channel Islands|Connétables]], the elected members of the states, advocates and solicitors of the Royal Court.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLaw"&gt;Article 4 of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting is by secret ballot.

Commissioners of the Royal Court are appointed by the Bailiff for the hearing of a specified cause or matter or a specified term.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"&gt;Part II of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff appoints the [[Courts of Jersey#Magistrate's Court|Magistrate]] and the Assistant Magistrate (who hold full-time salaried posts) and part-time Relief Magistrates (legal practitioners who carry out duties on a daily fee-paid basis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now normal for the Bailiff to convene a panel to advise on salaried appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=17–18|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from office===
The Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff and members of the [[Jersey Court of Appeal]] 'hold office during good behaviour'.&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the Court of Appeal: {{cite web|title=Court of Appeal (Jersey) Law 1961|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221706/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas senior judges in England and Wales who are appointed by Crown may only be removed from office with the consent of both Houses of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Courts Act (previously known as the Supreme Court Act) 1981, section 11(3)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/11|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/jud-acc-ind/judges-and-parliament|title=Judges and parliament|publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Justice]] may dismiss a Jersey judge appointed by the Crown without the agreement [[States of Jersey]]. This happened in 1992, when the then Deputy Bailiff [[Vernon Tomes]] was dismissed from office by the [[Home Secretary]] (the UK minister who at the time was responsible for the [[Crown Dependencies]]) on grounds of his delays in producing written judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons|title=Debates vol 208 cc93-4W|date=19 May 1992|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1992/may/19/jersey-bailiff-dismissal#S6CV0208P0_19920519_CWA_184}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyer|title='Dismissal of "slow" Judge angers Jersey|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey in revolt after Clarke sacks judge|newspaper=The Independent|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey to review constitutional links with UK|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurats hold office up to the age of 72 years. A Jurat who 'in the opinion of the Court, is permanently unable, through physical or mental incapacity, or for any other reason, efficiently to carry out the duties of the office, may be called upon by the Court to resign'. A Jurat who refuses to resign may be removed from office by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the petition of the Superior Number (the Bailiff and five or more Jurats) of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 9 of the Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff may if he 'thinks fit, terminate the appointment of a Commissioner on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour'.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"/&gt;

The Magistrates, who are also appointed by the Bailiff not the Crown, may not be removed from office 'except by virtue of an Order of Her Majesty in Council'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2(3) of the {{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the Chief Minister informed the [[States of Jersey]] that the Magistrate-Designate, Ian Christmas, has 'agreed not to sit as a judge following a discussion with the former Bailiff as a result of a criminal investigation into an alleged [[fraud]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyQuestions/2009/3%20Deputy%20of%20St%20Martin%20to%20CM%20re%20suspension%20of%20Magistrate%20designate.pdf|title=Extract from States of Jersey Hansard|year=2009|publisher=States of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=States of Jersey|title=Official Report ('Hansard')|date=8 June 2010|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111039/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=Further delay in fraud case|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 March 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/03/15/further-delay-in-fraud-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Christmas was subsequently convicted of one count of fraud and sentenced to fifteen months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2f12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|title=Attorney General v Lewis, Christmas, Foot and Cameron (2012) JRC 177|publisher=JerseyLaw|date=5 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110638/http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2F12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the Bailiff's Office has asked the United Kingdom [[Ministry of Justice]] to arrange for a UK judge to undertake a disciplinary investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/07/27/what-next-for-fraud-judge/|title=What next for fraud judge?|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/09/25/christmas/|title=New inquiry to decide whether Christmas retains his position|date=25 September 2012|publisher=Jersey Evening Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonymusings.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/ian-christmas-legal-background.html|title=Ian Christmas: the Legal Background|publisher=Tony's musings|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial independence in Jersey===

====Code of Conduct====
All judges in Jersey are bound by a [http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx code of conduct] promulgated by the [[Jersey Judicial Association]] in 2007. This requires judges to 'uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary and perform their duties with competence, diligence and dedication'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of conduct for members of the judiciary of Jersey, paragraph 1|year=2007|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ECHR Article 6====
All courts in Jersey are required under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] to be 'independent and impartial'.&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; In 2000, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held in ''McGonnell v United Kingdom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/62.html|title=McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000) ECHR 62|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a breach of Article 6 in ''Guernsey'' where the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff sat as President of the [[States of Guernsey]] when proposed legislation was being debated and then subsequently sat as a judge of the [[Royal Court of Guernsey]] in a case where that legislation was relevant. The Court, noting that there was no suggestion that the Bailiff 'was subjectively biased', stated that the 'mere fact' that this happened was capable of casting doubt on the Bailiff's impartiality. A Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff in Jersey is able to avoid a ''McGonnell'' situation simply by not sitting in the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] in cases concerned with legislation that was debated when he presided in the [[States of Jersey|States]]. The current Bailiff, Mr [[Michael Birt (Bailiff of Jersey)|Michael Birt]] has conceded that 'we probably need to improve our systems to be very compliant with ''McGonnell'' and that one probably ought to keep a running list of those statutes where I have presided so at least I could invite the parties to consider whether they wanted to object or not'.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 46-47, Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers, Public Hearing 4 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent review chaired by [[Lord Carswell]], set up by the [[States of Jersey]], a legal opinion was commissioned from [[Rabinder Singh (Barrister)|Rabinder Singh]] QC in which he expressed the view that 'there is no reason in law why the present constitutional arrangements in respect of the Bailiff should be altered. However, the trend suggests that the tide of history is in favour of reform and that the legal position will be different in 10 years time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/Pages/StatesReports.aspx?ReportID=491|title=Report into Review of Crown Officers|publisher=Jersey Government|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of Lord Carswell's inquiry concluded that Mr Singh's opinion 'provides an additional reason why the Bailiff should cease to be the President of the States'.&lt;ref&gt;Para 5.16 of Report into Review of Crown Officers&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey]] have not accepted this aspect of the Carswell report. Many prominent islanders do not believe that any change is necessary or desirable.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite web|first=Reg|last=Jeune|title=Let's not throw out 800 years of history and good governance|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=20 December 2010|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/12/20/lets-not-throw-out-800-years-of-history-and-good-governance/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/HowGovernmentWorks/ReviewCrownOfficers/Pages/WrittenSubmissions.aspx|title=Written submissions on role of Crown Officers|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stuart Syvret litigation====
In recent years, a former [[States of Jersey|State's]] member Mr [[Stuart Syvret]] has argued in legal proceedings in England and Jersey that all members of [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|the Jersey judiciary]] lack the appearance of independence and impartiality. In March 2009, the High Court in London refused him permission to commence a judicial review claim against [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/7946988.stm |title=Jersey abuse case review rejected |first= |last=Anon|work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 March 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}; {{cite web |url= http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/displayarticle.asp?id=400612 |title=Syvret loses High Court bid |first= |last=Anon |work=channelonline.tv |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jersey, subsequent proceedings related to a criminal prosecution for a data protection offence (he named a former nurse on his [[blog]], who he said was guilty of murdering patients), judicial reviews and appeals relating to that criminal case, and a separate civil action brought by Syvret against fellow politicians and Law Officers in connection with his removal from office as minister for health.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Nursing a grievance in Jersey|newspaper=Private Eye (no 1288)|date=13 May 2011|page=30}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Jersey senator jailed over data-breach blog|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2010|page=11}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Hemming shields man|newspaper=Birmingham Evening Mail|date=26 October 2009|page=8}} (referring to Liberal Democrat MP [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]]'s assistance to Syvret)&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Hough|title=Jersey senator to claim asylum at Commons|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 October 2009|page=16}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Charge against senator in abuse cover-up claim|newspaper=The Times|date=20 July 2009|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syvret argues that he cannot have a fair trial in the island and there is a lack of appearance of independence and impartiality because judges are appointed by the [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] and the other judges have attended social events with the Bailiff. Syvret's arguments relating to lack of independence and impartiality have been rejected by the Royal Court and Court of Appeal in Jersey on a number of occasions between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of Sir Richard Tucker (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JRC 165 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105155/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgement of Clare Montgomery QC (sitting as a judge of the Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JCA 181 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=4 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111432/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Mr Julian Clyde-Smith (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2010) JRC 179 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010/10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111747/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010%2F10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Jonathan Sumption QC (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Chief Minister and others (2011) JRC 116 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103945/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of MS Jones QC (sitting in the Jersey Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 130 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224095020/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of the Court of Appeal (Michael Beloff QC, Clare Montgomery QC and Christopher Nugee QC) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 146 |publisher=JerseyLaw |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |date=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112152/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jersey legal profession ==
[[File:Institute of Law, St Helier, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Institute of Law, Seale Street, St Helier|upright]]The Jersey legal profession has three types of Jersey-qualified lawyers - Advocates, Solicitors and [[Public notary#United Kingdom|Notaries Public]].&lt;ref name="1997Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|title=Advocates and Solicitors Law 1997|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221753/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/6-7/90|title=Public Notaries Act 1843}} (United Kingdom), section 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advocate#Advocates in the Channel Islands|Advocates]] have rights of audience to represent clients in all courts. Jersey solicitors have no general rights of audience. Notaries have no rights of audience. The Law Society of Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/ Law Society of Jersey ]&lt;/ref&gt; is the professional body responsible for professional conduct. Notaries are regulated by the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury through the [[Dean of the Arches]], referred to as the [[Master of the Faculties]], who is normally an English [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk|title=Faculty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some law firms focus on legal practice relating to Jersey's [[Economy of Jersey#Financial .26 legal services|finance industry]], the largest being: [[Appleby Spurling Hunter|Appleby]]; Bedell Cristin; [[Carey Olsen]]; [[Mourant Ozannes]]; and [[Ogier (law firm)|Ogier]], all of which are regarded as part of the "[[offshore magic circle]]". Smaller firms and sole practitioners also provide a wide range of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613012913/http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-13|title=Law Firms|publisher=Law Society of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several law firms now have offices in both Jersey and [[Guernsey]] but the legal professions of the two islands are separate, as they are separate from those in England, Wales and Scotland. Most notaries in Jersey are employed by, or are partners in, local firms of Jersey Advocates or Solicitors, although some are in English solicitors firms or practising purely as notaries, independent of the general legal profession. There is a local Jersey Notaries Society.

The Law Officers of the Crown are responsible for criminal prosecution work and for providing legal advice to the Crown, ministers and other members of the Assembly of the [[States of Jersey]]. The Attorney General and his deputy, the Solicitor General, are non-voting members of the States Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/LawOfficers/Pages/index.aspx|title=Law Officers|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of qualifying as a Jersey lawyer is regulated by the Advocates and Solicitors (Jersey) Law 1997&lt;ref name="1997Law"/&gt; and is similar for both advocates and solicitors. Since 2009, candidates for the [[Jersey law]] examinations are required to enrol on the Jersey Law Course run by the Institute of Law, Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ Institute of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to take five compulsory papers: (i) Jersey legal system and constitutional Law; (ii) Law of contract and the law relating to security on moveable property and bankruptcy; (iii) testate and intestate succession; law of immoveable property and conveyancing; and civil and criminal procedure. In addition, candidates must take one of three option papers: (i) company law; (ii) trusts law; or (iii) family law.

The admission of lawyers as Notaries in Jersey is governed by an order of the [[Master of the Faculties]]. It is necessary to show that a prospective Notary has been in actual practise in Jersey as a Jersey-qualified Advocate or Solicitor for a period of 5 years and is required to pass an examination in Notarial Practice. The Master does however retain a discretion to admit those who are not so qualified "...in appropriate circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk/TheNotaries%28JerseyandGuernsey%29AdmissionOrder2012.pdf|title=The Notaries (Jersey and Guernsey) Admission Order 2012|publisher=Faculty Office|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal aid ==
There is no publicly funded [[legal aid]] system in Jersey, though the [[States of Jersey]] may exercise discretion to pay defence legal fees in serious criminal trials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A system in need of overhaul|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 September 2010|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2010/09/15/a-system-in-need-of-overhaul/}}.&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=Elaine|last=Byrne|title=£3m cost may lead to legal aid review|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=21 October 2009|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2009/10/21/3m-cost-may-lead-to-legal-aid-review/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in cases involving children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dolores|last=Cowburn|title=Serious case review cost the Island over £600,000|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 September 2010|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/09/15/serious-case-review-cost-the-island-over-600000/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bailiff champions welfare of children|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=1 July 2008|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2008/07/01/the-bailiff-champions-welfare-of-children/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their first 15 years of practice, Jersey Advocates and Solicitors, but not Notaries, are required to participate in a scheme organised by the profession to ensure so far as possible that people without sufficient resources are not prevented from pursuing or defending civil and criminal cases in the island's courts. The scheme is administered on behalf by the [[Bâtonnier]] (a senior member of the profession). Cases accepted by the Bâtonnier as eligible are allocated to lawyers on the basis of the 'Tour de Rôle' (i.e. according to one's turn). Depending on the litigants' income and assets, lawyers may work [[pro bono]] or charge a reasonable fee in accordance with published guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Citizen's Advice Bureau|title=Legal Aid|url=http://www.cab.org.je/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=106&amp;Itemid=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer assigned a legal aid case may choose to pay another lawyer to handle the case and several firms have established specialist legal aid departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Harry|last=McRandle|title=Law firm stops taking legal aid divorce cases|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=5 November 2005|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2005/11/05/law-firm-stops-taking-legal-aid-divorce-cases/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous and long-standing calls for reform of the present system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Quérée|title=Public should pay for legal aid, says Bailiff|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=14 September 2007|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2007/09/14/public-should-pay-for-legal-aid-says-bailiff/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Sibcy|title=Taxpayers "may have to foot bill for legal aid"|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=12 September 2003|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2003/09/12/taxpayers-may-have-to-foot-bill-for-legal-aid/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law reform ==
The Jersey Law Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/ Jersey Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[States of Jersey]] in 1996 to keep Jersey [[Law commission|law under review]] and bring forward proposals for law reform.

'''Learning about Forests''' (LEAF) is one of the five programs run by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE), a [[non-governmental organization]] located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. LEAF aims to encourage school classes and teachers to use [[forests]] for educational activities. The ''vision'' is to see an increased level of awareness and knowledge the key role the forest plays on our planet. The program's ''mission'' is to spread [[environmental education]] concerning forests and all their values among school children all around the world.

==Member organizations==
In August 2013, LEAF was composed of twenty-one organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAF Member Organi[z]ations|url=http://www.leaf-international.org/Side.cfm?ID_kanal=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is based on a systematic user co-creation approach integrating research and innovation processes. These are integrated through the co-creation, exploration, experimentation and evaluation of innovative ideas, scenarios, concepts and related technological artefacts in real life use cases. Such use cases involve user communities, not only as observed subjects but also as a source of creation. This approach allows all involved stakeholders to concurrently consider both the global performance of a product or service and its potential adoption by users. This consideration may be made at the earlier stage of research and development and through all elements of the product life-cycle, from design up to recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Kusiak, A.; Tang, C.-Y.: Innovation in a requirement life-cycle framework, Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, IMS’2006, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey, 2006, 61-67.&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Concurrent engineering]]

More recently, the [[Web 2.0]] has demonstrated the positive impact of involving user communities in [[new product development]] (NPD) such as [[mass collaboration]] projects (e.g.  [[crowdsourcing]], [[Wisdom of Crowds]]) in [[collective intelligence|collectively]] creating new contents and applications.

A living lab is not similar to a [[testbed]] as its philosophy is to turn users, from being traditionally considered as observed subjects for testing modules against requirements, into value creation in contributing to the co-creation and exploration of emerging ideas, breakthrough scenarios, innovative concepts and related artefacts. Hence, a living lab rather constitutes an experiential environment, which could be compared to the concept of [[experiential learning]], where users are immersed in a creative social space for designing and experiencing their own future. Living labs could also be used by policy makers and users/citizens for designing, exploring, experiencing and refining new policies and regulations in real-life scenarios for evaluating their potential impacts before their implementations.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Description==
The term ''living lab'' has emerged in parallel from the ambient intelligence research communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ami-communities.eu/wiki/AMI%40Work_on-line_Communities|title=AMI@Work on-line Communities |work=AMI@Work Communities Wiki |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; context and from the discussion on experience and application research (EAR).&lt;ref&gt;ISTAG EAR working group report "Involving users in the development of Ambient Intelligence" on http://www.cordis.lu/ist/istag.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the term is based on the concept of [[user experience]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaver, W.W., Boucher, A., Pennington, S. and Walker, B.

William J. Mitchell, Kent Larson, and Alex (Sandy) Pentland at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are credited with first exploring the concept of a Living Laboratory.  They argued that a living lab represents a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. Nowadays, several living lab descriptions and definitions are available from different sources.&lt;ref&gt;Core Labs (2006), http://www.ami-communities.net/wiki/CORELABS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niitamo, V.-P.; Kulkki, S.; Eriksson, M.; Hribernik, K.

Living Labs for user-driven open innovation. An overview of the Living Labs methodology, activities and achievements. January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Mitchell, Larson and Pentland, formed the first US-based living labs research consortium. According to the consortium website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livinglabs.mit.edu |title=MIT Living Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The convergence of globalization, changing demographics, and urbanization is transforming almost every aspect of our lives.  We face new choices about where and how we work, live, travel, communicate, and maintain health.  Ultimately, our societies are being transformed.  MIT Living Labs brings together interdisciplinary experts to develop, deploy, and test - in actual living environments - new technologies and strategies for design that respond to this changing world.  Our work spans in scale from the personal to the urban, and addresses challenges related to health, energy, and creativity.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consortium has since been reorganized as the City Science Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.media.mit.edu/ |title=MIT City Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "living lab" or "living laboratory" is also used for representing a residential home research facility where the behaviour of people living in this house is observed and usage patterns are collected by researchers that are investigating methods for merging new technologies with user-centered design. In this type of living lab, users are more observed subjects than engaged in the co-creation of ideas and breakthrough scenarios. There are examples of such research facilities like PlaceLab at MIT developed by Kent Larson and Stephen Intille and ExperienceLab at Philips Research. In the Netherlands, Utrecht University has created the Governance Lab Utrecht

* Co-creation: bring together technology push and application pull (i.e. crowdsourcing, crowdcasting) into a diversity of views, constraints and knowledge sharing that sustains the ideation of new scenarios, concepts and related artefacts.
* Exploration: engage all stakeholders, especially user communities, at the earlier stage of the co-creation process for discovering emerging scenarios, usages and behaviours through live scenarios in real or virtual environments (e.g. [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], [[mixed reality]]).
* Experimentation: implement the proper level of technological artefacts to experience live scenarios with a large number of users while collecting data which will be analysed in their context during the evaluation activity.
* Evaluation: assess new ideas and innovative concepts as well as related technological artefacts in real life situations through various dimensions such as socio-ergonomic, socio-cognitive and socio-economic aspects; make observations on the potentiality of a viral adoption of new concepts and related technological artefacts through a confrontation with users' value models.

'''Nadcap''' (formerly '''NADCAP''', the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program) is a global cooperative accreditation program for [[aerospace engineering]], [[defense contractor|defense]] and related industries. 

==History of Nadcap==
The Nadcap program is administered by the Performance Review Institute (PRI). Nadcap was established in 1990 by [[SAE International]]. Nadcap's membership consists of "Prime Contractors" who coordinate with aerospace accredited Suppliers to develop industry-wide audit criteria for special processes and products. Through PRI, Nadcap provides independent certification of manufacturing processes for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pri-network.org/nadcap/ PRI Official Site], Nadcap Home Page, Correct as of 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; PRI has its headquarters in [[Warrendale, Pennsylvania]] with branch offices for Nadcap located in [[London]], [[Beijing]], and Nagoya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pri-network.org/about-pri/contact-us/ PRI Official Site], Contact Us Page, Correct as of 16 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of Nadcap activities==
The Nadcap program provides accreditation for special processes in the aerospace and defense industry. 

These include:
*Aerospace Quality Systems (AQS)
*Aero Structure Assembly (ASA)
*Chemical Processing (CP)
*[[Coating]]s (CT)
*[[Composite material|Composites]] (COMP)
*Conventional [[Machining]] as a Special Process (CMSP)
*Elastomer Seals (SEAL)
*[[Electronics]] (ETG)
*Fluids Distribution (FLU)
*[[Heat treating|Heat Treating]] (HT)

==The Nadcap program and industry==
PRI schedules an audit and assigns an industry approved auditor who will conduct the audit using an industry agreed checklist. At the end of the audit, any non-conformity issues will be raised through a non-conformance report. PRI will administer and close out the non-conformance reports with the Supplier. Upon completion PRI will present the audit pack to a 'special process Task Group’ made up of members from industry who will review it and vote on its acceptability for approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2347">The '''Netherlands Economic Institute''' ('''NEI''') is a research institute based in [[Rotterdam]].

== History ==

=== 1929–1940 ===
The NEI was established in 1929 by a group of businessmen from Rotterdam. Its initial purpose was to collect economic data and to analyze economic problems. It published its research in its own journal [[Economisch Statistische Berichten|Economische Statistische Berichten]] (ESB). Over the years it added economic consultancy. Before the second World War it remained relatively small with about 20 employees.

=== 1945–1990 ===
NEI was affiliated with the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. One of its directors was professor [[Jan Tinbergen]], who won the first Nobel prize in Economics in 1969. Through his influence NEI became a strong player in development economics. Another director, professor Klaassen, stimulated growth in the field of spatial economics. Later, professor Molle led the NEI to prominence in the field of European integration. Through such expansions and diversifications NEI grew and internationalized significantly. In 1970 it had about 80 employees.

=== 1990–1999 ===
Together with six other European research and consultancy companies NEI founded ERECO, the European Economic Research and Advisory Consortium.

In 1999 NEI was split into a company for research &amp; consultancy and a foundation with the aim to foster economic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.ecorys.nl/NEI |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917051931/http://english.ecorys.nl/NEI |archivedate=2014-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter NEI merges with Kolpron, a Dutch consulting company in real estate.

== Ecorys ==
In 2000  NEI Kolpron merged with the UK company ECOTEC Research &amp; Consulting, established in 1982. The new organisation was called [[Ecorys]].&lt;ref name="Ecorys"&gt;[http://www.ecorys.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; It has offices in many European companies and also in Turkey, Russia and India.

==History==
The "far-fetched" possibility of using light for selectively controlling precise neural activity (action potential) patterns within subtypes of cells in the brain was thought of by [[Francis Crick]] in his Kuffler Lectures at the University of California in San Diego in 1999.&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crick, F.|title=The impact of molecular biology on neuroscience |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |doi=10.1098/rstb.1999.0541 |volume=354 |issue=1392 |pages=2021–25 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10670022 |pmc=1692710}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier use of light to activate neurons was carried out by [[Richard Fork]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fork|first=R. L.|title=Laser stimulation of nerve cells in Aplysia|journal=Science|date=March 1971|volume=171|issue=3974|pages=907–8|doi=10.1126/science.171.3974.907|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/171/3974/907.abstract|bibcode = 1971Sci...171..907F|pmid=5541653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrated laser activation of neurons within intact tissue, although not in a genetically-targeted manner. The earliest genetically targeted method that used light to control rhodopsin-sensitized neurons was reported in January 2002, by [[Boris Valery Zemelman|Boris Zemelman]] and [[Gero Miesenböck]], who employed ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[rhodopsin]] cultured mammalian neurons.&lt;ref name="Zemelman 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zemelman|first1=B.

Zhuo-Hua Pan of Wayne State University, researching on restore sight to blindness, thought about using channelrhodopsin when it came out in late 2003. By February 2004, he was trying channelrhodopsin out in ganglion cells—the neurons in our eyes that connect directly to the brain—that he had cultured in a dish. Indeed, the transfected neurons became electrically active in response to light.

Optogenetics provides millisecond-scale temporal precision which allows the experimenter to keep pace with fast biological information processing (for example, in probing the causal role of specific [[action potential]] patterns in defined neurons). Indeed, to probe the neural code, optogenetics by definition must operate on the millisecond timescale to allow addition or deletion of precise activity patterns within specific cells in the brains of intact animals, including mammals (see '''Figure 1)'''. By comparison, the temporal precision of traditional genetic manipulations (employed to probe the causal role of specific genes within cells, via "loss-of-function" or "gain of function" changes in these genes) is rather slow, from hours or days to months. It is important to also have fast readouts in optogenetics that can keep pace with the optical control. This can be done with electrical recordings ("optrodes") or with reporter proteins that are [[biosensor]]s, where scientists have fused fluorescent proteins to detector proteins. An example of this is [[Genetically encoded voltage indicator|voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein]] (VSFP2).&lt;ref name="pmid22815406"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akemann | first1 = W | last2 = Mutoh | first2 = H | last3 = Perron | first3 = A | last4 = Park | first4 = YK | last5 = Iwamoto | first5 = Y | last6 = Knöpfel | first6 = T | year = 2012 | title = Imaging neural circuit dynamics with a voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22815406 | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 108 | issue = 8| pages = 2323–37 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00452.2012 | pmid = 22815406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, beyond its scientific impact optogenetics represents an important case study in the value of both ecological conservation (as many of the key tools of optogenetics arise from microbial organisms occupying specialized environmental niches), and in the importance of pure basic science as these opsins were studied over decades for their own sake by biophysicists and microbiologists, without involving consideration of their potential value in delivering insights into neuroscience and neuropsychiatric disease.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/optogenetics-controlling/|title=Optogenetics: Controlling the Brain with Light [Extended Version]|last=Deisseroth|first=Karl|newspaper=Scientific American|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

'''Light-activated proteins: channels, pumps and enzymes'''

The hallmark of optogenetics therefore is introduction of fast light-activated channels, pumps, and enzymes that allow temporally precise manipulation of electrical and biochemical events while maintaining cell-type resolution through the use of specific targeting mechanisms. Among the microbial opsins which can be used to investigate the function of neural systems are the [[channelrhodopsin]]s (ChR2, ChR1, VChR1, and SFOs) to excite neurons and [[anion-conducting channelrhodopsin]]s for light-induced inhibition.

'''Expression of optogenetic actuators'''

Optogenetics also necessarily includes the development of genetic targeting strategies such as cell-specific promoters or other customized conditionally-active viruses, to deliver the light-sensitive probes to specific populations of neurons in the brain of living animals (e.g. worms, fruit flies, mice, rats, and monkeys). In invertebrates such as worms and fruit flies some amount of [[all-trans-retinal]] (ATR) is supplemented with food. A key advantage of microbial opsins as noted above is that they are fully functional without the addition of exogenous co-factors in vertebrates.'''&lt;ref name="Gradinaru 2007" /&gt;'''

The technique of using optogenetics is flexible and adaptable to the experimenter's needs. For starters, experimenters genetically engineer a microbial opsin based on the [[Gating (electrophysiology)|gating]] properties (rate of excitability, refractory period, etc..) required for the experiment.

There is a challenge in introducing the microbial opsin, an optogenetic actuator, into a specific region of the organism in question. A rudimentary approach is to introduce an engineered viral vector that contains the optogenetic actuator gene attached to a recognizable [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] such as [[CAMK2A|CAMKIIα]]. This allows for some level of specificity as cells that already contain and can translate the given promoter will be infected with the viral vector and hopefully express the optogenetic actuator gene.

Another approach is the creation of transgenic mice where the optogenetic actuator gene is introduced into mice zygotes with a given promoter, most commonly [[CD90|Thy1]]. Introduction of the optogenetic actuator at an early stage allows for a larger genetic code to be incorporated and as a result, increases the specificity of cells to be infected.

A third and rather novel approach that has been developed is creating transgenic mice with [[Cre recombinase]], an enzyme that catalyzes recombination between two lox-P sites. Then by introducing an engineered viral vector containing the optogenetic actuator gene in between two lox-P sites, only the cells containing the Cre recombinase will express the microbial opsin. This last technique has allowed for multiple modified optogenetic actuators to be used without the need to create a whole line of transgenic animals every time a new microbial opsin is needed.

After the introduction and expression of the microbial opsin, depending on the type of analysis being performed, application of light can be placed at the terminal ends or the main region where the infected cells are situated. Light stimulation can be performed with a vast array of instruments from light emitting diodes ([[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s) or diode-pumped solid state ([[Diode-pumped solid-state laser|DPSS]]). These light sources are most commonly connected to a computer through a fiber optic cable. Recent advances include the advent of wireless head-mounted devices that also apply LED to targeted areas and as a result give the animal more freedom of mobility to reproduce ''in vivo'' results.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warden|first=Melissa R.|last2=Cardin|first2=Jessica A.|last3=Deisseroth|first3=Karl|date=2014-07-11|title=Optical Neural Interfaces|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|volume=16|pages=103–129|doi=10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071813-104733|issn=1523-9829|pmc=4163158|pmid=25014785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guru|first=Akash|last2=Post|first2=Ryan J|last3=Ho|first3=Yi-Yun|last4=Warden|first4=Melissa R|date=2015-07-25|title=Making Sense of Optogenetics|journal=International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=18|issue=11|doi=10.1093/ijnp/pyv079|issn=1461-1457|pmc=4756725|pmid=26209858|pages=pyv079}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

== Issues ==
Although already a powerful scientific tool, optogenetics, according to Doug Tischer &amp; Orion D. Weiner of the University of California San Francisco, should be regarded as a "first-generation [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]]" because of its immense potential for both utilization and optimization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tischer|first=Doug|last2=Weiner|first2=Orion D.|date=2014-08-01|title=Illuminating cell signalling with optogenetic tools|url=http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v15/n8/full/nrm3837.html#optogenetic-control-of-signals-in-time|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|language=en|volume=15|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/nrm3837|issn=1471-0072|pmc=4145075|pmid=25027655}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that being said, the current approach to optogenetics is limited primarily by its versatility. Even within the field of Neuroscience where it is most potent, the technique is less robust on a subcellular level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfn.org/~/media/SfN/Documents/Short%20Courses/2013%20Short%20Course%20I/SC1%20Deisseroth.ashx|title=Current Challenges in Optogenetics|last=Zalocusky|first=Kelly A|last2=Fenno|first2=Lief E|date=2013|website=Society for Neuroscience|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Deisseroth|first3=Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selective expression ===

One of the main problems of optogenetics is that not all the cells in question may express the microbial opsin gene at the same level. Thus, even illumination with a defined light intensity will have variable effects on individual cells. Optogenetic stimulation of neurons in the brain is even less controlled as the light intensity drops exponentially from the light source (e.g. implanted optical fiber).

Moreover, mathematical modelling shows that selective expression of opsin in specific cell types can dramatically alter the dynamical behavior of the neural circuitry. In particular, optogenetic stimulation that preferentially targets inhibitory cells can transform the excitability of the neural tissue from Type 1 — where neurons operate as integrators — to Type 2 where neurons operate as resonators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heitmann|first=Stewart|last2=Rule|first2=Michael|last3=Truccolo|first3=Wilson|last4=Ermentrout|first4=Bard|date=2017|title=Optogenetic stimulation shifts the excitability of cerebral cortex from Type I to Type II: Oscillation onset and wave propagation|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=13|issue=1|pages=e1005349|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005349|issn=1553-7358|bibcode=2017PLSCB..13E5349H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Type 1 excitable media sustain propagating waves of activity whereas Type 2 excitable media do not. The transformation from one to the other explains how constant optical stimulation of primate motor cortex elicits gamma-band (40–80&amp;nbsp;Hz) oscillations in the manner of a Type 2 excitable medium. Yet those same oscillations propagate far into the surrounding tissue in the manner of a Type 1 excitable medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Yao|last2=Truccolo|first2=Wilson|last3=Wagner|first3=Fabien B.|last4=Vargas-Irwin|first4=Carlos E.|last5=Ozden|first5=Ilker|last6=Zimmermann|first6=Jonas B.|last7=May|first7=Travis|last8=Agha|first8=Naubahar S.|last9=Wang|first9=Jing|last10=Nurmikko|first10=Arto V.|date=2016|title=Optogenetically induced spatiotemporal gamma oscillations and neuronal spiking activity in primate motor cortex|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=113|issue=10|pages=3574–3587|doi=10.1152/jn.00792.2014|issn=1522-1598|pmc=4461886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, it remains difficult to target opsin to defined subcellular compartments, e.g. the plasma membrane, synaptic vesicles, or mitochondria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gradinaru|first=Viviana|last2=Thompson|first2=Kimberly R.|last3=Deisseroth|first3=Karl|date=2008-08-01|title=eNpHR: a Natronomonas halorhodopsin enhanced for optogenetic applications|journal=Brain Cell Biology|volume=36|issue=1–4|pages=129–139|doi=10.1007/s11068-008-9027-6|issn=1559-7113|pmc=2588488|pmid=18677566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restricting the opsin to specific regions of the plasma membrane such as [[dendrite]]s, [[Soma (biology)|somata]] or [[axon terminal]]s would provide a more robust understanding of neuronal circuitry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Kinetics and synchronization ===

An issue with channelrhodopsin-2 is that its gating properties don't mimic ''in vivo'' cation channels of cortical neurons. A solution to this issue with a protein's kinetic property is introduction of variants of channelrhodopsin-2 with more favorable kinetics.&lt;sup&gt;[[Optogenetics#cite note-:0-55|[55]]][56]&lt;/sup&gt;

Another one of the technique's limitations is that light stimulation produces a synchronous activation of infected cells and this removes any individual cell properties of activation among the population affected. Therefore, it is difficult to understand how the cells in the population affected communicate with one another or how their phasic properties of activation may relate to the circuitry being observed.

Optogenetic activation has been combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) to elucidate the [[connectome]], a thorough map of the brain’s neural connections. The results, however, are limited by the general properties of [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leergaard|first=Trygve B.|last2=Hilgetag|first2=Claus C.|last3=Sporns|first3=Olaf|date=2012-05-01|title=Mapping the Connectome: Multi-Level Analysis of Brain Connectivity|journal=Frontiers in Neuroinformatics|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fninf.2012.00014|issn=1662-5196|pmc=3340894|pmid=22557964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The readouts from this neuroimaging procedure lack the spatial and temporal resolution appropriate for studying the densely packed and rapid-firing neuronal circuits.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Excitation spectrum ===

The opsin proteins currently in use have absorption peaks across the visual spectrum, but remain considerable sensitivity to blue light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This spectral overlap makes it very difficult to combine opsin activation with genenetically encoded indictors ([[Genetically encoded voltage indicator|GEVIs]], [[Genetically encoded calcium sensor|GECIs]], [[Glutamate-sensitive fluorescent reporter|GluSnFR]], [[synapto-pHluorin]]), most of which need blue light excitation. Opsins with infrared activation would, at a standard irradiance value, increase light penetration and augment resolution through reduction of light scattering.

Chronos and CatCh variants are particularly useful in that they have less time spent in their deactivated states, which allow for more activity with less bursts of blue light emitted.

===Precise temporal control of interventions===
The currently available optogenetic actuators allow for the accurate temporal control of the required intervention (i.e. inhibition or excitation of the target neurons) with precision routinely going down to the millisecond level. Therefore, experiments can now be devised where the light used for the intervention is triggered by a particular '''element of behavior''' (to inhibit the behavior), a particular '''unconditioned stimulus''' (to associate something to that stimulus) or a particular '''oscillatory event''' in the brain (to inhibit the event). This kind of approach has already been used in several brain regions:

====Hippocampus====
[[Sharp waves and ripples|Sharp waves and ripple complexes]] (SWRs) are distinct high frequency oscillatory events in the [[hippocampus]] thought to play a role in memory formation and consolidation. These events can be readily detected by following the oscillatory cycles of the on-line recorded [[local field potential]]. In this way the onset of the event can be used as a trigger signal for a light flash that is guided back into the hippocampus to inhibit neurons specifically during the SWRs and also to optogenetically inhibit the oscillation itself&lt;ref name="pmid27760158"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovacs KA, O'Neill J, Schoenenberger P, Penttonen M, Ranguel Guerrero DK, Csicsvari J | title = Optogenetically Blocking Sharp Wave Ripple Events in Sleep Does Not Interfere with the Formation of Stable Spatial Representation in the CA1 Area of the Hippocampus | journal = PLOS ONE | date = 19 Nov 2016 | pmid = 27760158 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0164675 | volume=11 | pmc=5070819 | pages=e0164675| bibcode=2016PLoSO..1164675K }}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of "closed-loop" experiments are useful to study SWR complexes and their role in memory.

Moreover, this technique has been shown to extend outside neurons to an increasing number of proteins and cellular functions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cellular scale modifications including manipulation of contractile forces relevant to cell migration, cell division and wound healing have been optogenetically manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valon|first=Léo|last2=Marín-Llauradó|first2=Ariadna|last3=Wyatt|first3=Thomas|last4=Charras|first4=Guillaume|last5=Trepat|first5=Xavier|date=2017-02-10|title=Optogenetic control of cellular forces and mechanotransduction|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|doi=10.1038/ncomms14396|issn=2041-1723|pmc=5309899|pmid=28186127|page=14396|bibcode=2017NatCo...814396V}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field has not developed to the point where processes crucial to cellular and developmental biology and cell signaling including protein localization, post-translational modification and GTP loading can be consistently controlled via optogenetics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21523">In the [[power systems|power systems analysis]] field of [[electrical engineering]], a '''per-unit system'''  is the expression of system quantities as fractions of a defined base unit quantity. Calculations are simplified because quantities expressed as per-unit do not change when they are referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This can be a pronounced advantage in power system analysis where large numbers of transformers may be encountered. Moreover, similar types of apparatus will have the impedances lying within a narrow numerical range when expressed as a per-unit fraction of the equipment rating, even if the unit size varies widely. Conversion of per-unit quantities to volts, ohms, or amperes requires a knowledge of the base that the per-unit quantities were referenced to. The per-unit system is used in [[Power flow study|power flow]], [[short circuit]] evaluation, [[motor starting methods|motor starting]] studies etc.

The main idea of a per unit system is to absorb large differences in absolute values into base relationships. Thus, representations of elements in the system with per unit values become more uniform.

A per-unit system provides units for [[electric power|power]], [[voltage]], [[Current (electricity)|current]], [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and [[admittance]]. With the exception of impedance and admittance, any two units are independent and can be selected as base values; power and voltage are typically chosen. All quantities are specified as multiples of selected base values.  For example, the base power might be the rated power of a [[transformer]], or perhaps an arbitrarily selected power which makes power quantities in the system more convenient.  The base voltage might be the nominal voltage of a [[Busbar|bus]].  Different types of quantities are labeled with the same symbol ('''pu'''); it should be clear whether the quantity is a voltage, current, or other unit of measurement.

==Purpose==

There are several reasons for using a per-unit system:
* Similar apparatus (generators, transformers, lines) will have similar per-unit impedances and losses expressed on their own rating, regardless of their absolute size. Because of this, per-unit data can be checked rapidly for gross errors. A per unit value out of normal range is worth looking into for potential errors.
* Manufacturers usually specify the impedance of apparatus in per unit values. 
* Use of the constant &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \sqrt{3} &lt;/math&gt; is reduced in three-phase calculations. 
* Per-unit quantities are the same on either side of a transformer, independent of voltage level
* By normalizing quantities to a common base, both hand and automatic calculations are simplified. 
* It improves numerical stability of automatic calculation methods.
* Per unit data representation yields important information about relative magnitudes.
The per-unit system was developed to make manual analysis of power systems easier.  Although power-system analysis is now done by computer, results are often expressed as per-unit values on a convenient system-wide base.

== Base quantities ==
Generally base values of power and voltage are chosen. The base power may be the rating of a single piece of apparatus such as a motor or generator. If a system is being studied, the base power is usually chosen as a convenient round number such as 10 MVA or 100 MVA. The base voltage is chosen as the nominal rated voltage of the system. All other base quantities are derived from these two base quantities. Once the base power and the base voltage are chosen, the base current and the base impedance are determined by the natural laws of electrical circuits. The base value should only be a magnitude, while the per-unit value is a phasor. The phase angles of complex power, voltage, current, impedance, etc., are not affected by the conversion to per unit values.

The purpose of using a per-unit system is to simplify conversion between different transformers. Hence, it is appropriate to illustrate the steps for finding per-unit values for voltage and impedance. First, let the base power (S_base) of each end of a transformer become the same. Once every S is set on the same base, the base voltage and base impedance for every transformer can easily be obtained. Then, the real numbers of impedances and voltages can be substituted into the per-unit calculation definition to get the answers for the per-unit system. If the per-unit values are known, the real values can be obtained by multiplying by the base values.

By convention, the following two rules are adopted for base quantities:

* The base power value is the same for the entire power system of concern.
* The ratio of the voltage bases on either side of a transformer is selected to be the same as the ratio of the transformer voltage ratings.

With these two rules, a per-unit impedance remains unchanged when referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This allows the ideal transformer to be eliminated from a transformer model.

==Relationship between units==

The relationship between units in a per-unit system depends on whether the system is [[single-phase]] or [[three-phase]].

===Single-phase===

Assuming that the independent base values are power and voltage, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the base value for power may be given in terms of [[Reactive power|reactive]] or [[apparent power]], in which case we have, respectively,

: &lt;math&gt;Q_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;S_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

The rest of the units can be derived from power and voltage using the equations &lt;math&gt;S = IV&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \underline{V} = \underline{I} \underline{Z}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Ohm's law]]), &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; being represented by &lt;math&gt; \underline{Z} = R + j X = Z\cos(\phi) + j Z\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  We have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{I_{\text{base}}V_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

===Three-phase===

Power and voltage are specified in the same way as single-phase systems.  However, due to differences in what these terms usually represent in three-phase systems, the relationships for the derived units are different. Specifically, power is given as total (not per-phase) power, and voltage is line-to-line voltage.
In three-phase systems the equations &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; also hold. The apparent power &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; now equals &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}}= \sqrt{3}V_{\mathrm{base}} I_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{base}}}{V_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{base}}}{I_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{{V_{\mathrm{base}}^2}}{S_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example of per-unit==

As an example of how per-unit is used, consider a three-phase power transmission system that deals with powers of the order of 500 MW and uses a nominal voltage of 138 kV for transmission.  We arbitrarily select &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}} = 500\, \mathrm{MVA}&lt;/math&gt;, and use the nominal voltage 138 kV as the base voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;.  We then have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 2.09 \, \mathrm{kA}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 38.1 \, \Omega&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 26.3 \, \mathrm{mS}&lt;/math&gt;

If, for example, the actual voltage at one of the buses is measured to be 136 kV, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{pu}} = \frac{V}{V_{\mathrm{base}}} = \frac{136 \, \mathrm{kV}}{138 \, \mathrm{kV}} = 0.9855 \, \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

== In transformers ==
It can be shown that voltages, currents, and impedances in a per-unit system will have the same values whether they are referred to primary or secondary of a [[transformer]].&lt;ref name="Sen 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sen | first=P. C. | title=Principles of electric machines and power electronics | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=New York | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-471-02295-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}

For instance, for voltage, we can prove that the per unit voltages of two sides of the transformer, side 1 and side 2, are the same. Here, the per-unit voltages of the two sides are E&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{E_{1}}{V_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2}V_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2} \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {E_{2}} {V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= E_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

‘E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the voltages of sides 1 and 2 in volts. N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 1 has. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 2 has. V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are the base voltages on sides 1 and 2. &lt;math&gt; V_{base1}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}V_{base2}&lt;/math&gt;

For current, we can prove that the per-unit currents of the two sides are the same below.
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{I_{1}}{I_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1}I_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1} \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{2}} {I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= I_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

where I&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; are the per-unit currents of sides 1 and 2 respectively. In this, the base currents I&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related in the opposite way that V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related, in that

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base1}} {V_{base1}}\\
S_{base1} &amp;= S_{base2}\\
V_{base2} &amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} V_{base1}\\
I_{base2} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} {V_{base2}}\\
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} { \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reason for this relation is for power conservation
S&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; = S&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt;

The full load [[copper loss]] of a transformer in per-unit form is equal to the per-unit value of its resistance:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL}&amp;=\text{full-load copper loss}\\
&amp;= I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL,pu}&amp;=\frac{P_{cu,FL}}{P_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}/I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {Z_{B1}}\\
&amp;= R_{eq1,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it may be more useful to express the resistance in per-unit form as it also represents the full-load copper loss.&lt;ref name="Sen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

As stated above, there are two degrees of freedom within the per unit system that allow the engineer to specify any per unit system. The degrees of freedom are the choice of the base voltage (V{{sub|base}}) and the base power (S{{sub|base}}). By convention, a single base power (S{{sub|base}}) is chosen for both sides of the transformer and its value is equal to the rated power of the transformer. By convention, there are actually two different base voltages that are chosen, V{{sub|base1}} and V{{sub|base2}} which are equal to the rated voltages for either side of the transformer. By choosing the base quantities in this manner, the transformer can be effectively removed from the circuit as described above. For example:

Take a transformer that is rated at 10 kVA and 240/100 V. The secondary side has an impedance equal to 1∠0° ohms. The base impedance on the secondary side is equal to:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,2}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,2}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {10000} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {1 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance on the secondary side is 1∠0° ohm / 1 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. When this impedance is referred to the other side, the impedance becomes:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{2}&amp;=\left(\frac{240}{100}\right)^2\times\text{1∠0° ohm}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76∠0° ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The base impedance for the primary side is calculated the same way as the secondary:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,1}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,1}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {57600} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance is 5.76∠0° ohm / 5.76 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. which is the same as when calculated from the other side of the transformer, as would be expected.

Another useful tool for analyzing transformers is to have the base change formula that allows the engineer to go from a base impedance with one set of a base voltage and base power to another base impedance for a different set of a base voltage and base power. This becomes especially useful in real life applications where a transformer with a secondary side voltage of 1.2 kV might be connected to the primary side of another transformer whose rated voltage is 1 kV. The formula is as shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,new}&amp;=Z_{base,old}\times\left(\frac{V_{base,old}}{V_{base,new}}\right)^2\times\left(\frac{S_{base,new}}{S_{base,old}}\right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Laherrère and D. Sornette&lt;/ref&gt; except in the cases of the two "[[King effect|Kings]]": [[China]] and [[India]].]]
'''Rank-size distribution''' is the distribution of size by rank, in decreasing order of size. For example, if a data set consists of items of sizes 5, 100, 5, and 8, the rank-size distribution is 100, 8, 5, 5 (ranks 1 through 4). This is also known as the '''rank-frequency distribution''', when the source data are from a [[frequency distribution]]. These are particularly of interest when the data vary significantly in scale, such as city size or word frequency. These distributions frequently follow a [[power law]] distribution, or less well-known ones such as a [[stretched exponential function]] or [[parabolic fractal distribution]], at least approximately for certain ranges of ranks; see below.

A rank-size distribution is not a [[probability distribution]] or [[cumulative distribution function]]. Rather, it is a discrete form of a [[quantile function]] (inverse cumulative distribution) in reverse order, giving the size of the element at a given rank.

==Simple rank-size distributions==
In the case of city populations, the resulting distribution in a country, a region, or the world will be characterized by its largest city, with other cities decreasing in size respective to it, initially at a rapid rate and then more slowly. This results in a few large cities and a much larger number of cities orders of magnitude smaller. For example, a rank 3 city would have one-third the population of a country's largest city, a rank 4 city would have one-fourth the population of the largest city, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;[[List of United States cities by population]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2016}}

When any [[log-linear]] factor is ranked, the ranks follow the [[Lucas numbers]], which consist of the sequentially additive numbers 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, etc. Like the more famous [[Fibonacci sequence]], each number is approximately 1.618 (the [[Golden ratio]]) times the preceding number. For example, the third term in the sequence above, 4, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 4.236; the fourth term, 7, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, or 6.854; the eighth term, 47, is approximately 1.618&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, or 46.979. With higher values, the figures converge. An [[equiangular spiral]] is sometimes used to visualize such sequences.

== Segmentation ==
[[File:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|Wikipedia word frequency plot, showing three segments with distinct behavior.]]

A rank-size (or rank-frequency) distribution is often segmented into ranges. This is frequently done somewhat arbitrarily or due to external factors, particularly for [[market segmentation]], but can also be due to distinct behavior as rank varies.

Most simply and commonly, a distribution may be split in two, termed the '''head''' and '''tail'''. If a distribution is broken into three pieces, the third (middle) piece has several terms, generically '''middle''',&lt;ref name="fishkin"&gt;[https://moz.com/blog/illustrating-the-long-tail Illustrating the Long Tail], Rand Fishkin, November 24th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; also '''belly''',&lt;ref name="young"&gt;[https://gigaom.com/2006/09/04/digg-that-fat-belly/ Digg that Fat Belly!], Robert Young, Sep. 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; '''torso''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/08/03/09/long-tail-guide The Long Tail Keyword Optimization Guide - How to Profit from Long Tail Keywords], August 3, 2009, Tom Demers&lt;/ref&gt; and '''body'''.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx The Small Head, the Medium Body, and the Long Tail .. so, where's Microsoft?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025939/http://blogs.technet.com/b/lliu/archive/2005/03/12/394732.aspx |date=2015-11-17 }}, 12 Mar 2005, Lawrence Liu's Report from the Inside&lt;/ref&gt; These frequently have some adjectives added, most significantly ''[[long tail]]'', also ''fat belly'',&lt;ref name="young" /&gt; ''chunky middle'', etc. In more traditional terms, these may be called ''top-tier'', ''mid-tier'', and ''bottom-tier''.

The relative sizes and weights of these segments (how many ranks in each segment, and what proportion of the total population is in a given segment) qualitatively characterizes a distribution, analogously to the [[skewness]] or [[kurtosis]] of a probability distribution. Namely: is it dominated by a few top members (head-heavy, like profits in the recorded music industry), or is it dominated by many small members (tail-heavy, like internet search queries), or distributed in some other way? Practically, this determines strategy: where should attention be focused?

These distinctions may be made for various reasons. For example, they may arise from differing properties of the population, as in the [[90–9–1 principle]], which posits that in an internet community, 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content. As another example, in marketing one may pragmatically consider the head as all members that receive personalized attention, such as personal phone calls; while the tail is everything else, which does not receive personalized attention, for example receiving [[form letter]]s; and the line is simply as far as resources allow, or where it makes business sense to stop.

Purely quantitatively, a conventional way of splitting a distribution into head and tail is to consider the head to be the first ''p'' portion of ranks, which account for &lt;math&gt;1 - p&lt;/math&gt; of the overall population, as in the 80:20 [[Pareto principle]], where the top 20% (head) comprises 80% of the overall population. The exact cutoff depends on the distribution – each distribution has a single such cutoff point—and for power laws can be computed from the [[Pareto index]].

Segments may arise naturally due to actual changes in behavior of the distribution as rank varies. Most common is the [[king effect]], where behavior of the top handful of items does not fit the pattern of the rest, as illustrated at top for country populations, and above for most common words in English Wikipedia. For higher ranks, behavior may change at some point, and be well-modeled by different relations in different regions; on the whole by a [[piecewise function]]. For example, if two different power laws fit better in different regions, one can use a [[broken power law]] for the overall relation; the word frequency in English Wikipedia (above) also demonstrates this.

The [[Yule–Simon distribution]] that results from [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" and "success breeds success") simulates a broken power law and has been shown to "very well capture" word frequency versus rank distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf | title=Scaling laws in human speech, decreasing emergence of new words and a generalized model | author=Lin, Ruokuang|author2=Ma, Qianli D. Y.|author3=Bian, Chunhua | year=2014 | arxiv=1412.4846|bibcode=2014arXiv1412.4846L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It originated from trying to explain the population verses rank in different species. It has also been show to fit city population versus rank better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/a110361|title=A Growth Process for Zipf's and Yule's City-Size Laws|first=M F|last=Dacey|date=1 April 1979|publisher=|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=11|issue=4|pages=361–372|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/a110361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rank-size rule ==
The '''rank-size rule''' (or '''law'''), describes the remarkable regularity in many phenomena, including the distribution of city sizes, the sizes of businesses, the sizes of particles (such as sand), the lengths of rivers, the frequencies of word usage, and wealth among individuals.

All are real-world observations that follow [[power law]]s, such as [[Zipf's law]], the [[Yule distribution]], or the [[Pareto distribution]]. If one ranks the population size of cities in a given country or in the entire world and calculates the [[natural logarithm]] of the rank and of the city population, the resulting graph will show a [[log-linear]] pattern.{{dubious|date=March 2013}} This is the rank-size distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213211558/http://people.few.eur.nl/vanmarrewijk/geography/zipf/ |date=2007-02-13 }} Steven Brakman, Harry Garretsen, and Charles van Marrewijk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical rationale===

One study claims that the rank size rule "works" because it is a "shadow" or coincidental measure of the true phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~copyrght/image/monog08/fulltext.pdf The Urban Rank-Size Hierarchy] James W. Fonseca&lt;/ref&gt; The true value of rank size is thus not as an accurate mathematical measure (since other power-law formulas are more accurate, especially at ranks lower than 10) but rather as a handy measure or "rule of thumb" to spot power laws. When presented with a ranking of data, is the third-ranked variable approximately one-third the value of the highest-ranked one? Or, conversely, is the highest-ranked variable approximately ten times the value of the tenth-ranked one? If so, the rank size rule has possibly helped spot another power law relationship.

==Known exceptions to simple rank-size distributions==

While Zipf's law works well in many cases, it tends to not fit the largest cities in many countries; one type of deviation is known as the [[King effect]]. A 2002 study found that Zipf's law was rejected for 53 of 73 countries, far more than would be expected based on random chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0641.pdf|title=Kwok Tong Soo (2002)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that variations of the Pareto exponent are better explained by political variables than by economic geography variables like proxies for economies of scale or transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ Zipf's Law, or the Rank-Size Distribution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302005906/http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199280988/01student/zipf/ |date=2007-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study showed that Zipf's law did not work well for the five largest cities in six countries.&lt;ref&gt;Cuberes, David, The Rise and Decline of Cities, University of Chicago, September 29, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the richer countries, the distribution was flatter than predicted. For instance, in the [[United States]], although its largest city, [[New York City]], has more than twice the population of second-place [[Los Angeles]], the two cities' metropolitan areas (also the two largest in the country) are much closer in population. In metropolitan-area population, New York City is only 1.3 times larger than Los Angeles. In other countries, the largest city would dominate much more than expected. For instance, in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the capital, [[Kinshasa]], is more than eight times larger than the second-largest city, [[Lubumbashi]]. When considering the entire distribution of cities, including the smallest ones, the rank-size rule does not hold. Instead, the distribution is [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]]. This follows from [[Gibrat's law]] of proportionate growth.

Because exceptions are so easy to find, the function of the rule for analyzing cities today is to compare the city-systems in different countries.  The rank-size rule is a common standard by which urban primacy is established.  A distribution such as that in the United States or China does not exhibit a pattern of primacy, but countries with a dominant "[[primate city]]" clearly vary from the rank-size rule in the opposite manner.  Therefore, the rule helps to classify national (or regional) city-systems according to the degree of dominance exhibited by the largest city.  Countries with a primate city, for example, have typically had a colonial history that accounts for that city pattern.  If a normal city distribution pattern is expected to follow the rank-size rule (i.e. if the rank-size principle correlates with central place theory), then it suggests that those countries or regions with distributions that do not follow the rule have experienced some conditions that have altered the normal distribution pattern.  For example—the presence of multiple regions within large nations such as China and the United States tends to favor a pattern in which more large cities appear than would be predicted by the rule.  By contrast, small countries that had been connected (e.g. colonially/economically) to much larger areas will exhibit a distribution in which the largest city is much larger than would fit the rule, compared with the other cities—the excessive size of the city theoretically stems from its connection with a larger system rather than the natural hierarchy that central place theory would predict within that one country or region alone.

{{Culture of Turkey}}
'''Seljuk architecture''' comprises the building traditions used by the [[Seljuq dynasty]], when it ruled most of the [[Middle East]] and [[Anatolia]] during the 11th to 13th centuries. After the 11th century, the [[Seljuks of Rum]] emerged from the [[Great Seljuk Empire]] developing their own architecture, though they were influenced and inspired by the [[Armenian architecture|Armenian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Persian architecture|Persian]] architectural traditions.

==Great Seljuq Empire architecture==
Seljuq architectural elements can be found in a vast area stretching from the [[Hindu Kush]] to eastern Anatolia and from [[Central Asia]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The homeland of this building tradition was [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Iran]], where the first permanent Seljuk edifices were constructed. However, the [[Mongol invasions]] and [[earthquakes]] destroyed most of these buildings and only a few remain. In 1063 [[Isfahan]] was established as capital of the Great Seljuk Empire under [[Alp Arslan]].
[[File:Shrine_of_Warrior_Khalid_Waleed_(Back_side_Image).jpg|thumb|The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in central [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region.&lt;ref name=mughal/&gt;]] 
The most significant alteration carried out in the early twelfth century was the conversion of the mosque plan into a four-iwan plan mosque. Another mosque-type introduced at this time was the kiosk mosque, consisting of a domed space with three open sides and wall containing a mihrab on the qibla side.The architecture of this period was also characterized by memorial tombs which were usually octagonal structures with domed roofs, called [[Gonbad|Kümbet]] or [[Türbe]]. An impressive example of tomb architecture is the [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar|mausoleum]] of [[Sultan Sanjar]] at [[Merv]], a massive building measuring {{convert|27|m|abbr=off}} square with a huge double dome resting on squinches and muqarnas pendentives.

In [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] the surviving monuments are represented by [[madrassas]] and tombs. The madrassas such as the Mustansiriya in [[Baghdad]] or the Muristan in [[Damascus]] were built to a four-iwan plan, while the tombs were characterized by conical muqarnas domes. The [[Shrine of Khalid Walid]] in southern [[Pakistan]] features Seljuk architectural elements that had been introduced to the region via [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=mughal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mughal|first1=Mohammad|authorlink1=Expansion of Architectural Traditions of Kunya-Urgench to Pakistan and Beyond|title=TURKEMINSTAN-UNESCO: APPRAISAL OF THE HISTORICAL CULTURAL VALUES AND DETERMINATION OF THE WAYS ON THE PROTECTION OF THE WORLD HERITAGE PROPERTIES: Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|date=2006|publisher=Abstracts of reports of the International Scientific Conference|url=http://www.rafiquemughal.com/MUGHAL_2006_Ashgabat-KU-&amp;-Pakistan.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of Seljuk Empire architecture include:
* [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar]]
* [[Kharraqan towers]]

==Anatolian Seljuk architecture==
[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|Çifte Minareli Medrese in Erzurum]]
The greatest number of surviving Seljuk monuments are in [[Anatolia]].
The [[Seljuks of Rum]] built monumental stone buildings of elegantly simple design and harmonious proportion, for the most part severely plain, but with bursts of elaborate decoration around doorways.

In their construction of [[caravanserai]]s, [[medrese]]s and mosques, the Rum Seljuks translated the Iranian Seljuk architecture of bricks and plaster into the use of stone.&lt;ref&gt;''West Asia:1000-1500'', Sheila Blair and Jonathan Bloom, '''Atlas of World Art''', ed. John Onians, (Laurence King Publishing, 2004), 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, the caravanserais (or hans), used as stops, trading posts and defense for caravans, and of which about a hundred structures were built during the Anatolian Seljuqs period, are particularly remarkable. Along with Persian influences, which had an indisputable effect,&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture(Muhammadan)'', H. Saladin, '''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics''', Vol.1, ed. James Hastings and John Alexander, (Charles Scribner's son, 1908), 753.&lt;/ref&gt; Seljuk architecture was also influenced by [[Armenian architecture]], such as by having Muslim architects who originated from historical Armenia, and by having Armenian architects and masons.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Stierlin, "Turkey From the Selcuks to the Ottomans", Taschen's World Architecture, 1998, p73-75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Armenia during the Seljuk and Mongol Periods'', Robert Bedrosian, '''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times: The Dynastic Periods from Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century''', Vol. I, ed. Richard Hovannisian, (St. Martin's Press, 1999), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Anatolian architecture represents some of the most distinctive and impressive constructions in the entire history of Islamic architecture. Later this Anatolian architecture would be transmitted to [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultanate India]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in Translation: Architecture, Taxonomy, and the "Eastern Turks"'', Finbarr Barry Flood, '''Muqarnas: History and Ideology: Architectural Heritage of the "Lands of Rum''', ed. Gulru Necipoglu, (Brill, 2007), 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Anatolian Seljuk works are of dressed stone, with brick reserved for minarets. The use of stone in Anatolia is the biggest difference with the Seljuk buildings in Iran, which are made of bricks. The buildings make frequent use of [[muqarnas]] (stalactite vaulting). In the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] the courts are often covered to protect against the colder and snowier winters of the Anatolian plateau. Thus some [[madrasas]] (theological seminaries) such as the [[Çifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum have an open court, and others, such as the [[Karatay Medrese]] in Konya, have covered courts.

[[File:Ince Minareli Medrese 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ince Minaret Medrese in Konya]].

[[Konya]], the capital of the Seljuks and the other great Seljuk cities--[[Alanya]], [[Erzurum]], [[Kayseri]], [[Sivas]]—have important Seljuk buildings, but Seljuk works are abundant in almost any Anatolian city or town, especially in Central and Eastern Anatolia. Seljuk power extended (briefly) as far as the Aegean coast, so there are Seljuk türbes (tombs) even in—appropriately—the town of [[Selçuk]], next to Ephesus, south of [[İzmir]].
The great [[caravanserais]], or hans, are among the finest and most characteristic of Seljuk buildings. Built during the 13th century to encourage trade throughout the empire, several dozen survive in good condition.

After the [[Mongol invasions]] of the mid-13th century, the wealth and power of the Seljuk empire declined. The few late 13th century-early 14th century buildings that survive include the bimarhane (madhouse) in [[Amasya]], and the "Süngür Bey Mosque" in [[Nigde]]. One of the last Seljuk architectural endeavors was the tomb of 'Ismat al-Dunya wa 'l-Din ibint al-malik al-Adil built by her daughters after 1243.&lt;ref&gt;'' Notes on Saldjūq Architectural Patronage in Thirteenth Century Anatolia'', H. Crane, ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient'', Vol. 36, No. 1 (1993), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solonoid valves.jpg|thumb|Solenoid valves.]]
A '''solenoid valve''' is an [[electromechanical]] device in which the [[solenoid]] uses an [[electric current]] to generate a [[magnetic field]] and thereby operate a [[Mechanism_(engineering)|mechanism]] which regulates the opening of fluid flow in a [[valve]].

Solenoid valves differ in the characteristics of the electric current they use, the strength of the magnetic field they generate, the mechanism they use to regulate the fluid, and the type and characteristics of fluid they control. The mechanism varies from linear action, plunger-type [[actuator|actuators]] to pivoted-armature actuators and rocker actuators. The valve can use a two-port design to regulate a flow or use a three or more port design to switch flows between ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a [[Hydraulic manifold|manifold]].

Solenoid valves are the most frequently used control elements in [[fluidics]]. Their tasks are to shut off, release, dose, distribute or mix fluids. They are found in many application areas. Solenoids offer fast and safe switching, high reliability, long service life, good medium compatibility of the materials used, low control power and compact design.

== Operation ==
There are many valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A 2-way valve, for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is '''open''', then the two ports are connected and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is '''closed''', then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally open''' (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally closed'''.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201311/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also 3-way and more complicated designs.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225122854/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to either of the two other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).

Solenoid valves are also characterized by how they operate. A small solenoid can generate a limited force. If that force is sufficient to open and close the valve, then a '''direct acting''' solenoid valve is possible. An approximate relationship between the required solenoid force ''F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the fluid pressure ''P'', and the orifice area ''A'' for a direct acting solenoid valve is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asconumatics.eu/images/site/upload/_en/pdf1/00022gb.pdf |format=PDF|page=V030-1|title=The relation ignores the dynamic head|website=Asconumatics.eu|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_s = P A = P \pi d^2 / 4&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''d'' is the orifice diameter. A typical solenoid force might be {{convert|15|N|abbr=on}}. An application might be a low pressure (e.g., {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}}) gas with a small orifice diameter (e.g., {{convert|3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} for an orifice area of {{convert|0.11|in2|m2|abbr=on}} and approximate force of {{convert|1.1|lbf|N|abbr=on}}).

[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|The solenoid valve (small black box at the top of the photo) with input air line (small green tube) used to actuate a larger [[rack and pinion]] [[actuator]] (gray box) which controls the water pipe valve.]]
When high pressures and large orifices are encountered, then high forces are required. To generate those forces, an '''internally piloted''' solenoid valve design may be possible.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt; In such a design, the line pressure is used to generate the high valve forces; a small solenoid controls how the line pressure is used. Internally piloted valves are used in dishwashers and irrigation systems where the fluid is water, the pressure might be {{convert|80|psi|abbr=on}} and the orifice diameter might be {{convert|3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

In some solenoid valves the solenoid acts directly on the main valve. Others use a small, complete solenoid valve, known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve. While the second type is actually a solenoid valve combined with a pneumatically actuated valve, they are sold and packaged as a single unit referred to as a solenoid valve. Piloted valves require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power for a short period of time to open it, and only low power to hold it.

A direct acting solenoid valve typically operates in 5 to 10 milliseconds. The operation time of a piloted valve depends on its size; typical values are 15 to 150 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"/&gt;

Power consumption and supply requirements of the solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4" 150 psi sprinkler valve, intended for 24 VAC (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/d6/d6964dee-5165-4616-b043-0eb0e7a765c6.pdf|title = Orbit 3/4 150 PSI Sprinkler|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = homedepot|publisher = Home Depot|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, an industrial 1/2" 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in high pressure fluid and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.omega.com/green/pdf/SVH-110.pdf|title = Omega High Pressure Solenoid Valve SVH-111/SVH-112 Series|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = omega|publisher = Omega|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither valve lists a minimum pressure required to remain closed in the un-powered state.

===Internally piloted===
While there are multiple design variants, the following is a detailed breakdown of a typical solenoid valve design.

A solenoid valve has two main parts: the solenoid and the valve.  The solenoid converts electrical energy into mechanical energy which, in turn, opens or closes the valve mechanically. A direct acting valve has only a small flow circuit, shown within section '''E''' of this diagram (this section is mentioned below as a pilot valve).  In this example, a diaphragm piloted valve multiplies this small pilot flow, by using it to control the flow through a much larger orifice.  

Solenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and may also have electrical interfaces to allow for easy control.  A [[Spring (device)|spring]] may be used to hold the valve opened (normally open) or closed (normally closed) while the valve is not activated.
[[Image:Solenoid Valve.svg|thumbnail|right|360px| A- Input side&lt;BR&gt;
B- Diaphragm&lt;BR&gt;
C- Pressure chamber&lt;BR&gt;
D- Pressure relief passage&lt;BR&gt;
E- Electro Mechanical Solenoid&lt;BR&gt;
F- Output side]]

The diagram to the right shows the design of a basic valve, controlling the flow of water in this example. At the top figure is the valve in its closed state.  The water under pressure enters at '''A'''. '''B''' is an elastic diaphragm and above it is a weak spring pushing it down.  The diaphragm has a pinhole through its center which allows a very small amount of water to flow through it. This water fills the cavity '''C''' on the other side of the diaphragm so that pressure is equal on both sides of the diaphragm, however the compressed spring supplies a net downward force. The spring is weak and is only able to close the inlet because water pressure is equalized on both sides of the diaphragm.

Once the diaphragm closes the valve, the pressure on the outlet side of its bottom is reduced, and the greater pressure above holds it even more firmly closed.  Thus, the spring is irrelevant to holding the valve closed.

The above all works because the small drain passage '''D''' was blocked by a pin which is the armature of the [[solenoid]] '''E''' and which is pushed down by a spring.  If current is passed through the solenoid, the pin is withdrawn via magnetic force, and the water in chamber ''C'' drains out the passage ''D'' faster than the pinhole can refill it.  The pressure in chamber '''C''' drops and the incoming pressure lifts the diaphragm, thus opening the main valve. Water now flows directly from '''A''' to '''F'''.  

When the solenoid is again deactivated and the passage '''D''' is closed again, the spring needs very little force to push the diaphragm down again and the main valve closes. In practice there is often no separate spring; the elastomer diaphragm is molded so that it functions as its own spring, preferring to be in the closed shape.

From this explanation it can be seen that this type of valve relies on a differential of pressure between input and output as the pressure at the input must always be greater than the pressure at the output for it to work.  Should the pressure at the output, for any reason, rise above that of the input then the valve would open regardless of the state of the solenoid and pilot valve.

Solenoid valve designs have many variations and challenges.

The core or plunger is the magnetic component that moves when the solenoid is energized. The core is coaxial with the solenoid. The core's movement will make or break the seals that control the movement of the fluid. When the coil is not energized, springs will hold the core in its normal position.

The plugnut is also coaxial.&lt;!-- explain reason for plugnut; why not just one longer core. --&gt;

The core tube contains and guides the core. It also retains the plugnut and may seal the fluid. To optimize the movement of the core, the core tube needs to be nonmagnetic.  If the core tube were magnetic, then it would offer a shunt path for the field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skinner Valve|1997|p=128}}, stating "The tube is made of non-magnetic material to make certain that the flux is directed through the plunger rather than around it."&lt;/ref&gt; In some designs, the core tube is an enclosed metal shell produced by [[deep drawing]]. Such a design simplifies the sealing problems because the fluid cannot escape from the enclosure, but the design also increases the magnetic path resistance because the magnetic path must traverse the thickness of the core tube twice: once near the plugnut and once near the core. In some other designs, the core tube is not closed but rather an open tube that slips over one end of the plugnut. To retain the plugnut, the tube might be crimped to the plugnut. An O-ring seal between the tube and the plugnut will prevent the fluid from escaping.

The solenoid coil consists of many turns of copper wire that surround the core tube and induce the movement of the core. The coil is often encapsulated in epoxy.  The coil also has an iron frame that provides a low magnetic path resistance.&lt;!-- explain this more. Force related to size of the gap. --&gt;
&lt;!-- AC/DC issues --&gt;

===Materials===
The valve body must be compatible with the fluid; common materials are brass, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Skinner Valve |title=Two-Way, Three-Way and Four-Way Solenoid Valves |id=Catalog CFL00897 |publisher=[[Parker Hannifin]] |year=1997 |url=http://www.surmaq.com/html/cata/parker/contr/skinner.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p.&amp;nbsp;128&lt;/ref&gt;

The seals must be compatible with the fluid.

To simplify the sealing issues, the plugnut, core, springs, shading ring, and other components are often exposed to the fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The core tube needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. [[Stainless steel]]s can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf|format=PDF|page=450f|title=States, "Internal parts in contact with fluids are of non-magnetic 300 and magnetic 400 series stainless steel."|website=Controlandpower.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the core tube, 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheettext.aspx?matguid=d1fcb0f0cca340a4aa9068d6af5e6606|title=Crucible Steel 430F Stainless Steel|website=Matweb.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for the core and plugnut.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt;

== Types ==
Many variations are possible on the basic, one-way, one-solenoid valve described above:
* one- or two-solenoid valves;
* [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]] powered;
* different number of ways and positions;

==Common uses==
Solenoid valves are used in [[fluid power]] pneumatic and hydraulic systems, to control cylinders, fluid power motors or larger industrial valves. Automatic [[irrigation sprinkler]] systems also use solenoid valves with an automatic [[Controller (irrigation)|controller]]. Domestic [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwasher]]s use solenoid valves to control water entry into the machine. They are also often used in paintball gun triggers to actuate the CO2 hammer valve. Solenoid valves are usually referred to simply as "solenoids." 

Solenoid valves can be used for a wide array of industrial applications, including general on-off control, calibration and test stands, pilot plant control loops, process control systems, and various original equipment manufacturer applications. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcor.com/scientific-and-industrial/general-purpose-solenoid-valves/|title=General Purpose Solenoid Valves - Valcor Engineering|website=Valcor.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1539">A '''standard ruler''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] object for which the actual physical size is known. By measuring its angular size in the sky, one can use simple [[trigonometry]] to determine its distance from [[Earth]]. In simple terms, this is because objects of a fixed size appear smaller the further away they are.

Measuring distances is of great importance in [[cosmology]], as the relationship between the distance and [[redshift]] of an object can be used to [[Hubble's law|measure the expansion rate]] and geometry of the Universe. Distances can also be measured using [[Standard candle|standard candles]]; many different types of standard candles and rulers are needed to construct the [[cosmic distance ladder]].

== Relationship between angular size and distance ==

The relation between the angular diameter, θ, actual (physical) diameter, r, and distance, D, of an object from the observer is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta \approx \frac{r}{D} &lt;/math&gt;
 
where θ is measured in [[radians]].

Because space is [[Expansion of space|expanding]], there is no one, unique way of measuring the distance between source and observer. The distance measured by a standard ruler is what is known as the [[angular diameter distance]]. Standard candles measure another type of distance called the [[luminosity distance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5191">In [[engineering]], '''technical peer review''' is a type of engineering review. Technical peer reviews are a well defined review process for finding and fixing defects, conducted by a team of peers with assigned roles. Technical peer reviews are carried out by peers representing areas of life cycle affected by material being reviewed (usually limited to 6 or fewer people). Technical peer reviews are held within development phases, between milestone reviews, on completed products or completed portions of products.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"&gt;{{cite book| title=NASA Systems Engineering Handbook| id=SP-610S | year=2007|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

A technical peer review may also be called a ''engineering peer review'', a ''product peer review'', a ''peer review/inspection'' or an ''inspection.''

== Overview ==
The purpose of technical peer reviews is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. By removing defects at their origin (e.g., requirements and design documents, test plans and procedures, software code, etc.), technical peer reviews prevent defects from propagating through multiple phases and work products, and reduce the overall amount of rework necessary on projects.

In addition, improved team efficiency is a side effect of technical peer reviews (e.g., by improving team communication, integrating the viewpoints of various engineering specialty disciplines, more quickly bringing new members up to speed, and educating project members about effective development practices).

In [[CMMI]], peer reviews are used as a principal means of verification in the Verification process area and as an objective evaluation method in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area. The results of technical peer reviews can be reported at milestone reviews. (See [[Milestone (project management)]].)

==Roles of participants==
;Moderator
Responsible for conducting the technical peer review process and collecting inspection data. Plays key role in all stages of the technical peer review process except rework. Required to perform several duties during a technical peer review in addition to inspector’s tasks.

;Inspectors
Responsible for finding defects in work product from a general point of view, as well as defects that affect their area of expertise.

;Author
Provides information about work product during all stages of process. Responsible for correcting all major defects and any minor and trivial defects that cost and schedule permit. Performs duties of an inspector.

;Reader
Guides team through work product during the technical peer review meeting. Reads or paraphrases work product in
detail. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to reader’s role.

;Recorder
Accurately records each defect found during inspection meeting on the Inspection Defect List. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to recorder’s role.

== Vested interest of reviewers ==
There are two philosophies about the vested interest of the inspectors in the product under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a vested interest in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the project
who do not have a vested interest in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team. 

Each inspector is invited to disclose vested interests to the rest of the technical peer review panel so the Moderator can exercise sound judgement in evaluating the inspector's inputs.

== Distinction from other types of technical review ==
Peer reviews are distinct from management reviews, which are conducted by management representatives rather than by colleagues, and for management and control purposes rather than for technical evaluation. They are also distinct from [[software audit review]]s, which are conducted by personnel external to the project, to evaluate compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other criteria.

A [[software peer review]] is a type of technical peer review. The [[IEEE]] defines formal structures, roles, and processes for software peer reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[IEEE]] Std. 1028-1997, "IEEE Standard for Software Reviews"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management involvement ==
Management representatives are typically not involved in the conduct of a peer review. This is especially true of line managers of the author or other participants in the review. A policy of encouraging management to stay out of peer reviews encourages the peer review team to concentrate on the product being reviewed and not on the people or personalities involved.

== Detailed instructions ==
For detailed instructions on conducting a technical peer review/inspection, see NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, Appendix N.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"/&gt;

The '''Usa Marine Biological Institute (UMBI)''' (sometimes referred to as '''MBI-Japan''', '''Japanese Marine Biological Institute''',  '''Usa Kaiyo Center''' or just '''Usa''') is one of the oldest and largest centers for [[phycology]], [[marine biology]] [[research]], graduate training, and public service in Japan. It is devoted to scientific research  leading to MS and PhD degrees in phycology, marine biology and related fields. It grants degrees jointly with [[Kochi University]].

UMBI is located in the village of [[Usa cho]], [[Kōchi Prefecture]], Japan.

==History==
The Usa Marine Biological Station was founded in 1953 as an independent research institute by the [[Japanese Government]]. In 1978, its name was changed to Usa Marine Biological Institute. 
[[Image:Usa1963.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Usa Marine Biological Institute researchers, 1963]]
Under the directorship of Professor Masao Ohno, the institute established a [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA) training program in marine biology, since when a large number of foreign researchers have come to the institute to pursue short term research projects. The current director, Professor Izumi Kinoshita, supervises and coordinates the JICA training program.

In 2004, UMBI started a new graduate program, Kuroshio Sciences, jointly with Kochi University, to study the [[Kuroshio|Kuroshio Current]] from an interdisciplinary perspective.

UMBI graduate students are supported by various financial aid schemes, especially the [[Monbukagakusho]] [[MEXT International PhD Program]].

Usa Marine Biological Institute is renowned for marine phycological research. Emeritus Professor Masao Ohno was the first person in Japan to use an artificial seeding method for the commercial cultivation of [[green algae]]. The institute is one of the pioneer research institutes in the world for the study of [[Ulvophycean]] algae and has state-of-art facilities for marine phycological research.

Contemporary marine phycology research in the UMBI focuses on culture studies to establish life-histories of Ulvophycean algae ([[Ulva]] and [[Monostroma]]), tank cultivation of [[Ulva]] using deep seawater (conducted jointly with the [[Deep Seawater Research Center]], [[Muroto, Kōchi|Muroto]], Japan) and the ecology of [[Ecklonia]] and [[Sargasm]] species in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Huber, and B.E. Vieux, 2008, Hydrology and Floodplain Analysis, Fourth Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 795 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; V''flo'' employs [[GIS]] maps for parameterization via a desktop interface.&lt;ref&gt;Vieux, B.E., Z. Cui, and A. Gaur, 2004, Evaluation of a physics-based distributed hydrologic model for flood forecasting. ''J. Hydrol.'', '''298'''(1-4): 155-177. DMIP special issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  The model is suited for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and in continuous operations.  V''flo'' output is in the form of [[hydrograph]]s at selected [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]] grids, as well as [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] runoff maps covering the watershed. Model applications include civil [[infrastructure]] operations and maintenance, [[stormwater]] prediction and [[emergency management]], continuous and short-term surface water [[runoff model (reservoir)|runoff]], recharge estimation, [[soil moisture]] monitoring, [[land use]] planning, [[water quality]] monitoring, and water resources management.

== History ==
V''flo'' considers the spatial character of the [[parameter]]s and precipitation controlling hydrologic processes, and thus improves upon lumped representations previously used in [[Hydrological modelling|hydrologic modeling]].  Historical practice has been to use lumped representations because of computational limitations or because sufficient data was not available to populate a [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] model database.&lt;ref&gt;Desconnets, J.-C., B.E. Vieux, B. Cappelaere, and F. Delclaux (1996), “A GIS for hydrologic modeling in the semi-arid, HAPEX-Sahel experiment area of Niger Africa.” ''Trans. in GIS'', '''1'''(2): 82-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advances in [[computation]]al speed; development of high-resolution precipitation data from [[weather radar|radar]] and satellites; and availability of worldwide digital data sets and [[GIS]] technology makes distributed, physics-based modeling possible.&lt;ref&gt;ASCE, 1999, ''GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed'', Report, ASCE Task Committee, GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed, P.A. DeBarry, R.G. Quimpo, eds., American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  V''flo'' is designed to take advantage of the spatial variability of high resolution [[Weather radar|radar rainfall]] input, [[GIS]] datasets, and hydraulic channel characteristics.  Because it is [[physics]]-based, it produces [[hydrograph]]s based on conservation equations and the hydraulics of the [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]], and can be employed in locations where there are no [[rain gauge]]s or previous modeling studies.  In addition, V''flo''’s network approach makes models scalable from upland [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] to river basins using the same [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]].

== Formulation ==
V''flo'' is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and continuous operations.  V''flo'' models may be [[calibration|calibrated]] by loading precipitation maps for historical events and comparing simulated volume/peak [[hydrograph]]s to observed hydrographs.  Elevation data are taken from a [[digital elevation model]].  A vector channel representation is employed.  Parameterization utilizes digital data sets at any resolution, including [[LIDAR]] terrain data and other digital maps of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impervious area]], soils, and land use/cover.  V''flo'' is developed to utilize multi-sensor inputs from [[Weather radar|radar]], satellites, [[rain gauge]]s, or model forecasts.  The kinematic wave analogy is used to represent hydraulic conditions in a [[Drainage basin|watershed]].

[[File:Vitae patrum von Heribert Rosweyde 1615.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 1615 first edition of ''Vitae Patrum'' by [[Heribert Rosweyde]]]]The '''''Vitae Patrum''''' (literally '''''Lives of the Fathers''''', also called ''Lives of the Desert Fathers'') is an encyclopedia of [[hagiography|hagiographical]] writings on the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] of early Christianity.  The bulk of the original texts date from the third and fourth centuries.&lt;ref name="Leader2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Leader|title=The Badia of Florence: Art and Observance in a Renaissance Monastery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjS8j-6mf1UC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35567-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitae-patrum.org.uk/|title=Vitae Patrum|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lives that were originally written in Greek were translated into Latin between the fourth and the seventh century. An Italian vernacular translation was made by Dominican friar [[Domenico Cavalca]] from [[Pisa]] at the beginning of the fourteenth century.
A printed edition, edited by the Jesuit [[Heribert Rosweyde]], was printed by Balthazar Moret in 1615. The book is a significant part of the much broader work, ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]''.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hippolyte Delehaye|title=The work of the Bollandists through three centuries, 1615-1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjoKxXmj6EC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=1922|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Vitae Patrum'' is based on extensive research by Rosweyde into all the available literature he could find on the early desert monastics. [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] described the work as "the epic of the origins of monasticism in Egypt and Syria, an epic unsurpassed in interest and grandeur." In the thirteenth century, a version of ''Vitae Patrum'' had been translated into Latin. It was such a popular book that numerous versions and editions were published, with extensive changes and variations in the stories. Rosweyde based his book on  twenty-three different versions of those earlier books, studying, dating, and classifying all the different versions and changes.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Rosweyde's ''Vitae Patrum'' consists of ten books. Book I has the lives of sixteen saints under the title ''Vitae virorum'' and eleven saints under the title ''Vitae mulierum'', beginning with [[St. Paul the Hermit]] and [[St. Anthony of the Desert]], and including women saints such as [[The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot|Saint Mary the Harlot]]. Books II, ''Historia monachorum'', and III, ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders), are attributed to [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], who was later found to be only their translator. Book IV is a compilation of writings by [[Sulpicius Severus]] and [[John Cassian]]. Book V is another collection of ''Verba seniorum'' from Latin and Greek by [[Pelagius]].&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Book VI and Book VII are further collections of ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders) by unknown Greek authors translated by John the subdeacon, possibly [[Pope John III]], and by [[Paschasius]]. Book VIII is a text that was previously known as ''The Paradise of Heraclides'', but which Rosweyde attributed to its real author, [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], and titled the ''[[Lausiac History]]''. Book IX is ''De Vitis Patrum'' by [[Theodoret]]. Book X is ''The Spiritual Meadow of Moschus''. Rosweyde wrote an introduction to each book.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

The '''Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition''' is a research organisation owned by [[Mars, Incorporated]] located at [[Waltham on the Wolds]], [[Leicestershire]], United Kingdom. Waltham conducts scientific research into pet care and nutrition, and works with a number of animal breeds including dogs, cats, birds, fish and horses.

==History==

The pet food subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated (Mars Petcare) began research into pet nutrition in the early 1950s, formally founding a Nutrition Research Unit in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WALTHAM Heritage Awards|url=http://www.waltham.com/about-waltham/heritage-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the institute was housed at a nearby location but was moved to an old stud farm at Waltham-on-the-Wolds in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars UK History|url=http://www.mars.com/uk/en/who-we-are/our-history/mars-petcare.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, a non-charitable organisation called the Waltham Foundation has funded a number of humane scientific research projects dedicated to furthering the health and nutrition of companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Waltham Foundation|url=http://www.waltham.com/waltham-research/funding-opportunities/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

*In July 2005, in collaboration with the [[Monell Chemical Senses Center]] in [[Pennsylvania]], Waltham discovered that cats cannot taste [[Sweetness|sweet food]] because they have a faulty gene. Lions, tigers, leopards and pumas ([[Felidae]] family) have the same defective gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4707793.stm|title=Why cats don't go for sweet foods|date=1 August 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2007, in collaboration with the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] of [[Bethesda, Maryland]], Waltham found that the genetic variation of dogs' size is due to mutations in the [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]] gene. This was discovered through research on the [[Portuguese Water Dog]]. This research was preparatory work for similar studies on the human genome.

==Publications==

*Waltham originally published the magazine ''Waltham Focus'' four times a year. This has since been renamed as ''Veterinary Focus'' and is distributed in more than fifty countries and is published in several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivis.org/journals/vetfocus/toc.asp|title=Veterinary Focus|work=ivis.org|publisher=International Veterinary Information Service|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Worlds Beginning''''' is a 1944 speculative fiction novel by [[Robert Ardrey]]. It proposed a new economic model and system of corporate ownership.&lt;ref name=Worlds&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''Worlds Beginning.'' New York: Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce. 244 p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Worlds Beginning'' was published one year after ''[[God and Texas]]'', Ardrey's one-act play about the [[Battle of the Alamo]], and two years before the production of ''[[Jeb (play)|Jeb]]'', Ardrey's [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] play.

==Synopsis &amp; Themes==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' gave the following synopsis of the novel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Twenty years from now a retired reporter takes time off from cultivating his petunias and his perennial border to write of his own experiences during the dark days after peace, when American civilization seemed about to crack up for good. The "myth of internationalism" had infected big business with a bad case of economic imperialism. But synthetic revolutions in industrial chemistry soon fixed things so foreign nations didn't need a thing we could sell them. Depression, unemployment, bankruptcies, hatred and fear plagued the country. The business-controlled Government was swept out of office by a labor popular front. But things got worse instead of better. ... [W]hile Americans everywhere sank into fatalistic apathy, a new hope was born in the desert town of Indian Pass in Texas, where the Trans-Pecos Chemical Commonwealth was making a plastic substitute for copper wire that was much cheaper and much better than copper. The significance lay in a new concept of ownership. ... The commonwealth idea got rid of all owners of property and also paid no wages, only shares in the earnings. The employees had no participation in the concern. The harder they worked and the more money the commonwealth made, the larger was their share of the earnings. Every foreman was subject to dismissal by a majority vote of the workers under him. Any lazy or inefficient worker was thrown out on his ear by his comrades. Efficiency was wonderful, morale perfect.&lt;ref name=Prescott /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Worlds Beginning'' also includes a one-page forward by the author in which he discusses his reasons for writing the novel. Included is his sense that during dark times there is hope for the future, but only if those concerned are willing to fight for it. This is a theme consistently developed throughout his work, including most notably in [[Thunder Rock (play)|Thunder Rock]], Ardrey's most famous play.&lt;ref&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "Forward." In Ardrey, Robert. ''Worlds Beginning.'' New York: Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce. p. i. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Worlds Beginning'' was the subject of two dedicated reviews in [[The New York Times]]. The first, by [[Carlos Baker]], appeared on September 24, 1944.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Baker, Carlos. "America Remade—On a New Yankee Pattern." ''The New York Times,'' 24 September 1944. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The second, by [[Orville Prescott]], appeared on September 27.&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Orville. "Books of the Times." ''The New York Times,'' 27 September 1944. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both offered praise.

Prescott asserted "Mr. Ardrey has written a novel with as thumping a thesis as Bellamy's 'Looking Backward,' or any other celebrated outlines of Utopia."&lt;ref name=Prescott /&gt; Baker wrote of the book that it was: "fresh, tough, cocky, exciting, shot through with the exuberance of discovery. However he does it, with stiletto or meat cleaver, ad copywriter's slogans or heroic analogies, reiteration either plain or fancy, Mr. Ardrey clears a path for the reader through the jungle of economics and brings him out, flushed and panting, to a new world in the making."&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;

In 1948 ''Worlds Beginning'' was included in [[Everett F. Bleiler|Everett F. Bleiler's]] ''The Checklist of Fantastic Literature.''

[[Image:Yde_bog_girl.jpg|thumb|Location where the Yde Girl was found]]

'''Yde Girl''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ɪ|d|ə|audio=Yde IPA.ogg}}) is a [[bog body]] found in the ''Stijfveen'' [[peat]] bog near the village of [[Yde]], [[Netherlands]]. She was found on 12 May 1897 and was reputedly uncannily well-preserved when discovered (especially her [[hair]]), but by the time the body was turned over to the authorities a [[fortnight]] later it had been severely damaged and deteriorated.&lt;ref name=deem&gt;{{cite web|last=Deem|first=James M.|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|title=Drents Museum in Assen, the Netherlands: The Yde Girl|accessdate=16 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152742/http://www.mummytombs.com/museums/nl.assen.drents.yde.htm|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her teeth had been pulled from the skull by villagers as well as a large amount of hair.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt; The peat cutting tools had also been reported to have severely damaged the body.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

==Examination==
[[Image:DrentseBody.jpg|thumb|left|The Yde Girl's body]]

[[Carbon-14]] tests have indicated that Yde Girl died between 54 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 128 CE at an approximate age of 16 years.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; She had long reddish blond hair, but one side of her head was initially thought to have been shaved before she died. Recent studies of [[Windeby I]], however, have suggested that the shaved hair phenomenon in some bog bodies may simply attest to one side of the head being exposed to oxygen slightly longer than the other. Scans have shown that she suffered from [[scoliosis]]. She stood at {{convert|137|cm|ftin}}, which is comparatively small for a sixteen-year-old.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt;

The body was found clad in a woolen cape and with a woolen band, made in a braiding technique known as [[sprang]], wrapped around the neck, suggesting she was executed or sacrificed.&lt;ref name=city&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper|title=BEST MUSEUM EXHIBIT: THE MYSTERIOUS BOG PEOPLE|date=7 December 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dan&gt;{{cite news|last=Nephin|first=Dan|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110791280.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=AP Online|title=Mummy Exhibit Shows Off Interactive Side|date=6 July 2005}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a stab wound in the area of her collarbone, but that was not determined as the cause of death. It is thought that she may have died while unconscious, as defensive wounds were absent on the hand that was recovered from the body, unlike a similar case in Germany, the [[Kayhausen Boy]], who had a cut on his left hand from an apparent defense attempt.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; As with most bog bodies, the skin and features are still preserved because of the [[tannic acid]] in the marsh water. When Yde Girl was excavated, the diggers accidentally caused a wound to the skull. Only the torso of the girl, the head, the right hand and the feet remain intact today. The rest of her body was not preserved or had been damaged by peat cutting tools.

The Yde Girl was put on display and further study was not carried out on the remains until 1992. [[Richard Neave]], of University of Manchester, took a [[CT scan]] of the skull of Yde Girl and determined her age, both anatomically and historically.&lt;ref name=visit/&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohd Isa|first=Marisa|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82747279.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=News Straits Times|title=Unveiling mummy secrets|date=6 January 2006}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yde Girl became internationally known when Neave made a reconstruction of her head, using techniques from [[plastic surgery]] and criminal [[pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Prag | first1 = John | last2 = Neave | first2 = Richard | title = Making faces: using forensic and archaeological evidence |trans-title=Bodies from the Bog | year = 1997 | publisher = British Museum | location = London | language = | isbn = 0-7141-1743-9 | pages = 157–171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the state of the body, the work on the reconstruction included some guesswork, for example, the nose.&lt;ref name=deem/&gt; Yde Girl and her modern reconstruction are displayed at the [[Drents Museum]] in [[Assen]].

Yde Girl, along with [[Roter Franz]] and the [[Weerdinge Men]], were transported across the world for a museum tour in both the early and mid 2000s.&lt;ref name=visit&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Sue Ellen|title=Visit the mummies before they leave for L.A.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-71012131.html|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Sunday Gazette-Mail|date=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=city/&gt;&lt;ref name=dan/&gt; Due to the intensity of the girl's death, protests in [[Canada]] prevented the tour from traveling through several locations in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CULTURE-CANADA: 'BOG PEOPLE' MUMMIES PROVOKE PROTESTS|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Inter Press Service English News Wire|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2003/01/arts-weekly-culture-canada-bog-people-display-provokes-protest/|first=Mark|last=Bourrie|date=13 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
