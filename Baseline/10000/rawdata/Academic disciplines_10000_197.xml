      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26216">'''Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom''',  also known as the '''ABC strategy''' or '''abstinence-plus sex education''', also known as abstinence-based sex education, is a [[sex education]] policy based on a combination of "risk avoidance" and [[harm reduction]] which modifies the approach of [[abstinence-only sex education]] by including education about the value of partner reduction [[safe sex]] and [[birth control]] methods. Abstinence-only sex education is strictly to promote the sexual abstinence until marriage, and does not teach about safe sex or contraceptives. The abstinence-based sex education program is meant to stress abstinence and include information on safe sex practices. In general terms, this strategy of sex education is a compromise between abstinence-only education and comprehensive sex education. The ABC approach was developed in response to the growing epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]], and to prevent the spread of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. This approach has been credited by some with the falling numbers of those infected with AIDS in Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe, among others. From 1990 to 2001 the percentage of Ugandans living with AIDS fell from 15% to between 5 and 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|year=2005|title=ABC in Uganda: success or subterfuge?|url=|journal=HIV/AIDS Policy&amp;Law Review|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Edward C.|last2=Halperin|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Nantulya|first3=Vinand|last4=Hogle|first4=Janice A.|date=2006-05-11|title=Uganda's HIV Prevention Success: The Role of Sexual Behavior Change and the National Response|journal=AIDS and Behavior|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=335–346|doi=10.1007/s10461-006-9073-y|issn=1090-7165|pmc=1544373|pmid=16688475}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fall is believed to result from the employment of the ABC approach, especially reduction in the number of sex partners, called "Zero-Grazing" in Uganda.

Abstinence-based sex education can include issues of human relationships, the basic biology of human reproduction, safe sex methods and contraceptives, [[HIV/AIDS]] information, and masturbation in place of sex. It recommends [[sexual abstinence]] outside marriage as an ideal, having only a single long-term sexual partner. The use of [[condom]]s and other safe sex practices is advocated only if it is not possible to remain with a single sexual partner. Advocating this ideal, whilst pragmatically dealing with the fact that abstinence only sex education is ineffective by itself, has made the ABC approach popular with many African governments and relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Edward C.|title=Rethinking AIDS Prevention|type=book |publisher=Preager|year=2003 |oclc=612065556|isbn=978-0865693166}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC approach has notably been used in African countries. Versions of this approach have been used for [[abstinence-only sex education in Uganda]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ABC of HIV prevention |publisher=[[AVERT]] |url=http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm|date=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its positive impact has been confirmed by a 2009 Stanford University survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eran |last1=Bendavid |first2=Jayanta |last2=Bhattacharya |title=The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=19349625 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19349625 |laysummary=http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/news/stanford_study_first_ever_to_show_us_aids_relief_program_saved_a_million_lives_20090406/ |laysource=[[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] |laydate=April 6, 2009 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-10-200905190-00117 |year=2009 |volume=150 |issue=10 |pages=688–95 |pmc=2892894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Abstinence, be faithful, use a Condom consists of three components:
*'''Abstinence''': The ABC approach encourages young adults to delay "sexual debut" (age of first sexual intercourse), or to use abstinence until marriage, the most effective way to avoid HIV infection, as advocated as the ideal by Christianity.  The program develops skills for practicing abstinence and encourages participants to adopt social norms that support abstinence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  
*'''Be Faithful''': In addition to abstinence, the ABC approach encourages participants to eliminate casual or other concurrent sex partners and to practice fidelity within their marriages and other sexual relationships.  This reduces exposure to HIV..{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* '''Use a Condom''': The Catholic Church has publicly stated its opposition to condom use. However, in 2010, during an interview, Pope Benedict XVI addressed the use of condoms and his view that condoms are the "first step" of morality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengiano|first=Giuseppe|last2=Carrara|first2=Sabina|last3=Filipi|first3=Valentina|last4=Brosens|first4=Ivo|year=2011|title=Condoms, HIV and the Roman Catholic Church|url=|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=22|pages=701–709|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Starting primarily in the 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of the "abstinence plus" sex education program grew into a common method of teaching students, in the [[United States]], about sexuality. The program understood that it would not be possible to stop all teenagers from having sex, but still stressed that abstinence is the only guaranteed way of avoiding unwanted pregnancies and contraction of STDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashbee |first=Edward |title=The Bush Administration, Sex and the Moral Agenda |location=New York |publisher=Manchester UP |year=2007 |pages=102–36 |isbn=978-0-7190-7277-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important message to teens from the program comes from [[Joycelyn Elders]], [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] first [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], that "if they have a baby there is an 80% likelihood they'll be poor, ignorant, and slaves for the rest of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;"Illegitimate rhetoric- Clinton administration's policies towards sex education", ''National Review'' (15 August 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] established a "Girl Power!" campaign focusing on girls ages 9–14 which encouraged abstinence as a form of empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE NATIONAL STRATEGY TO PREVENT OUT-OF-WEDLOCK TEEN PREGNANCIES|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/teenp/strategy.htm|work=aspe.hhs.gov|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who would reject abstinence, or have early sex forced upon them, abstinence-only messages provided little to no hope to prevent pregnancy and spread of disease. To account for this, some states included information about contraceptives in their sex education programs along with encouragement for students to be abstinent. Of the states that, in 1995, required abstinence education, fourteen also included the use of contraception within the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=327–39 |doi=10.1016/S0190-7409(97)00021-2 |title=Sex Education and Abstinence: Programs and Evaluation |year=1997 |last1=Besharov |first1=Douglas J. |last2=Gardiner |first2=Karen N. |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=19 |issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995, [[Hawaii]] passed the Abstinence-Based Education Policy. (Policy # 2110). It is meant to support abstinence and help develop skills to continue abstinence, help teens who have had sexual intercourse to abstain from further, and to provide teens with information on contraceptives and methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lilinote.k12.hi.us/STATE/BOE/POL1.NSF/85255a0a0010ae82852555340060479d/1bb88fd5ec2ea5940a2566a3000110ef?OpenDocument|title=Abstinence-Based Education Policy|publisher=Hawaii State Government|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the federal government increased funding for state abstinence education as an inclusion of the Welfare Reform Act, creating Title V, and the abstinence-only-until-marriage program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Jillian B.|last2=Packham|first2=Analisa|year=2016|title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes|url=|journal=Health Economics|volume=26|issue=4|pages=403–420|doi=10.1002/hec.3315|pmid=26918400|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in abstinence funding created incentives for states to maintain these rulings, which over 20 states have.

In 2006 and 2007, $176 million was given annually to abstinence-only programs, whose central message was to delay sexual activity until marriage, preventing the inclusion of information about safe-sex practices or contraception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|year=2011|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e24658|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|via=|pmid=22022362|pmc=3194801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2009, funding was cut off for abstinence-only education programs, with no further fund allocated in the 2010 FY budget, and the push for evidence-based sex education and teen pregnancy prevention programs. However, on September 29, 2009 funding was restored to abstinence-only programs, as well as leaving the decision of what sex education program would be taught in public schools up to the individual states&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The state of Texas, where the law states that comprehensive sex education is allowed to be taught, but 94% of school districts have been reported to use abstinence-only sex education, developed an abstinence-plus sex education program called ''Big Decisions'', which not only emphasized abstinence to high school students, but integrated education about condom use and contraception, contradicting the majority of the school districts' decisions to maintain an abstinence-only education program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Realini|first=Janet P.|last2=Buzi|first2=Ruth S.|last3=Smith|first3=Peggy B.|last4=Martinez|first4=Mario|year=2010|title=Evaluation of "Big Decisions": An Abstinence-Plus Sexuality Curriculum|url=|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|volume=36|issue=4|pages=313–326|via=|doi=10.1080/0092623x.2010.488113|pmid=20574887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== Uganda ===
Uganda has been touted as the success story of the ABC strategy, with a significant reduction of HIV/AIDS infection rates and a push towards sexual behavior change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This shift in sexual behavior began in the mid 1980s, when AIDS was a global disease, resulting in the reduction of multiple sexual partners for an individual, and the increase of condom use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkhurst|first=Justin O.|year=2010|title=Evidence, politics and Uganda's HIV success: Moving forward with ABC and HIV prevention|url=|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=23|issue=2|pages=240–252|doi=10.1002/jid.1667|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  there is debate over whether the ABC strategy was the sole factor that contributed to the decline in HIV/AIDS infection. There has also been debate and discourse over the emphasis of one tenet of ABC sex education over the other. Currently there is the debate over the emphasis of "A" over "C" and vis versa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Uganda's HIV/AIDS and sex education program has a greater focus on the use of condoms in preventing HIV/AIDS, however, religious institutions emphasize abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The success of the ABC strategy in sex education is in part due to the fact that the branches of this strategy are "proximate determinants of HIV infection", also known as ways of reducing or even avoiding the risk of infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Malawi ===
Like Uganda, there is a push to change the sexual behaviors, however, this message is being emphasized by religious leaders rather than state officials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trinitapoli|first=Jenny|year=2009|title=Religious teachings and influences on the ABCs of HIV prevention in Malawi|url=|journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=69|issue=2|pages=199–209|via=|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.04.018|pmid=19447536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three tenets of ABC are broken down in Malawi into groups. Abstinence is emphasized for individuals who are young and unmarried, who hear messages about AIDS regularly; Be faithful is emphasized with married couples whose religious leader "polices" their sexual behavior; Condom use is a contested area with religious leaders due to the fact that religious openly denounce condom use, however some leaders have privately consulted individuals on condom use, resulting in many members doing so.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, religious leaders do not comment on the risks and issues of AIDS, which can potentially put an entire congregation at risk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Religious and Ideological Influences ==
Many communities that have adopted the ABC strategy of sex education have used this strategy of sex education in congruence with religious or ideological influences. In Malawi, religious leaders influence and emphasize the use  this strategy&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, in the United States, ideologies influence the use of ABC strategy. In this case, political ideologies influence the use of various sex education programs. For example, conservatism had previously taught young women that sex was about danger, not pleasure, focusing on an abstinence-only education program, reinforcing the foundational conservative ideas  of fear, and that society is fragile and human nature is inherently bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Citizen's Guide to American Ideology|last=Marietta|first=Morgan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=14–17|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes to School|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=130|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political ideologies have long been influences in the debate over sex education programs, pushing political agendas.

Globally, the debate of sex education divides liberals and conservatives. In many countries, children do not receive proper sex education, and discourage the act of sex itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jonathan|year=2014|title=Sex education is a global dividing line between liberals and conservatives|url=|journal=The Washington Post|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==
The usefulness of the ABC approach is highly debated. The three elements are interpreted differently by different actors and critics argue that often abstinence and faithfulness are unduly promoted over condoms and other measures such as education, female empowerment and making available modern antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite journal |pages=590–3 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70219-X |title=HIV/AIDS: Sex, abstinence, and behaviour change |year=2005 |last1=Barnett |first1=Tony |last2=Parkhurst |first2=Justin |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=5 |issue=9 |pmid=16122682}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] under President George W Bush has been criticized for seeming to prioritize "A" and "B" over "C" within its funding criteria. "C" activities may only be directed at "high-risk" groups, and not to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Accountability Office, 2006; Cohen J. Tate T. 2005.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, donor funding has always been allocated overwhelmingly to condoms, reflecting clear US and European policy priorities, including under George W Bush.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Criticisms ===
Critics argue that in many countries women are frequently infected by their unfaithful husbands while being faithfully married, and thus women who follow the recommendations of ABC promoters face an increased risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=Sinding&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Steven W. |last1=Sinding |title=Does 'CNN' (Condoms, Needles, Negotiation) Work Better than 'ABC' (Abstinence, Being Faithful and Condom Use) in Attacking the AIDS Epidemic? |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |jstor=3649501 |pmid=15888408 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3103805.html |pages=38–40 |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.31.38.05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Condoms, needles, and negotiation]] is a proposed alternative approach  as is ''SAVE'' (Safer practices, Available medication, Voluntary testing &amp; counseling and Empowerment through education).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anerela.org/prevention-model.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over anerela. Deze website is te koop! |publisher=anerela.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics furthermore allege that the strategy overlooks the epidemic's social, political, and economic causes and "vulnerable populations", e.g. [[sex worker]]s and "those who lack the ability to negotiate safe sex" as well as risk groups such as [[homosexual]]s and [[intravenous drug user]]s. However, most infections in Africa occur outside these vulnerable groups, and ABC  was a US donor policy only for the "generalized" epidemics in Africa. Murphy et al. found that Uganda's ABC approach empowered  women. "Remarkably, in the 2000–2001 Uganda DHS, 91 percent of women said they could refuse sex with their husbands if they knew their husbands had STIs, a somewhat higher percentage than in several other African countries" &lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030379 |title=Was the "ABC" Approach (Abstinence, Being Faithful, Using Condoms) Responsible for Uganda's Decline in HIV? |year=2006 |last1=Murphy |first1=Elaine M. |last2=Greene |first2=Margaret E. |last3=Mihailovic |first3=Alexandra |last4=Olupot-Olupot |first4=Peter |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e379 |pmid=17002505 |pmc=1564179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also argue that using the word "abstinence," then teaching about safe sex and contraceptives, can be contradictory.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jonathan |last1=Cohen |first2=Tony |last2=Tate |title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence-Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |jstor=25475267 |pmid=18446994 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/uganda0305/index.htm |pages=174–178 |volume=14 |issue=28 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28249-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the argument of the gendered presentation of ABC success stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Shari L.|last2=Ehrhardt|first2=Anke A.|year=2007|title=Going Beyond "ABC" to Include "GEM": Critical Reflections on Progress in the HIV/AIDS Epidemic|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.074591|pmid=17138923|via=|pmc=1716252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated that the power roles in which men and women fall in the gender dynamic of relationships, as well as sexual double standards, sexual violence, and harmful cultural practices affect a greater number of women when trying to implement HIV/AIDS prevention through individual decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critiques of geographic location are also relevant in the success of ABC success. Migration patterns within a population affect both men and women where men who migrate are more likely to contract the infection and bring it back and infect their female partner, whose greatest risk of contracting HIV is from their husbands extramarital sexual encounters, but women are also seen contracting the disease outside of their primary relationship, focusing the ABC strategy on morality and "static individualized behavior".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parikh|first=Shanti A.|year=2007|title=The Political Economy of Marriage and HIV: The ABC Approach, "Safe" Infidelity, and Managing Moral Risk in Uganda|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=7|pages=1198–1208|via=|doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.088682|pmid=17538057|pmc=1913085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate in the U.S. ===
How sex education should be taught in public schools in the United States has been a topic for debate since the sexual revolution.  A majority of the debate is focused on whether or not there should be a comprehensive sex education program or an abstinence-only program.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education programs have been proven to be ineffective and there is little evidence showing that abstinence-only, or abstinence-only-until-marriage programs lower [[risky sexual behavior]] in teens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kelly L.|last2=Lee Smith|first2=Matthew|last3=Rosen|first3=Brittany L.|last4=Wiley|first4=David C.|year=2012|title=Adoption and implementation characteristics for abstinence-plus curriculum|url=|journal=American Journal of Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence to support a parental push for earlier sex education for students, starting in elementary school rather than middle school. Along with the push for earlier sex education, there is the call for age-appropriate sex education. This means that for elementary school students, the sex education they receive will be tailored to their age. A study conducted in 2013 found that parents who pushed for earlier sex education settled on the sex education elementary school students receive will be 89% communication skills, 65% human anatomy/reproductive information, 61% abstinence, 53% HIV/STD infection information, and 52% gender/sexual orientation issues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Elissa M.|last2=Moore|first2=Michelle J.|last3=Johnson|first3=Tammie|last4=Forrest|first4=Jamie|last5=Jordan|first5=Melissa|year=2014|title=New Evidence: Data Documenting Parental Support for Earlier Sexuality Education Authors|url=|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=84|issue=1|pages=10–17|doi=10.1111/josh.12112|via=|pmid=24320147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents in this study also supported a greater emphasis on sex education in middle schools and an increase in the teaching of the same topics from elementary school as well as a greater emphasis on birth control and condom use&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] has criticized some harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "if the soul is lacking, if Africans do not help one another, the scourge [of HIV] cannot be resolved by distributing condoms; quite the contrary, we risk worsening the problem".{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Whilst this position has been widely denounced for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yankee |last1=Doodling |title=The papal position on condoms and HIV |journal=BMJ |pmid=19321547 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19321547 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1217 |year=2009 |volume=338 |pages=b1217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1206 |title=Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem |year=2009 |last1=Roehr |first1=B. |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b1206 |pmid=19321545}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been expert scientific opinion and evidence supporting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pope May Be Right |first=Edward C. |last=Green |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702825.html |work=The Washington Post |date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle of Accra has stated that "the Catholic Church [offers] three methods to help solve this problem of AIDS in Africa: "A", abstain; "B", be faithful; "C", chastity, which is in consonance with traditional African values. Those [[Planned Parenthood]] people are only talking about condoms. By the way, they know full well that the condoms devoted to Africa are sub-standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/ghanaian-archbishop-says-church-has-failed-africa |title=Ghanaian archbishop says church has failed Africa |date=October 14, 2009 |first=John L. |last=Allen |work=National Catholic Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|no reliable sources]] that condoms distributed in Africa are inferior to those elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12294480 |year=1999 |title=South Africa plays down faulty condom scare |pages=10–1 |journal=AIDS Weekly Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major proponent of the ABC approach, author and member of Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and Aids in 2003-2007, Harvard University's Edward C Green, stated “Advocates of the ABCs often use the term to mean a primary emphasis on abstinence/delay of sexual debut and faithfulness/partner reduction, with condom use being a secondary but necessary strategy for those who do not or cannot practice abstinence or fidelity." Furthermore, Green in his seminal book Rethinking AIDS Prevention (Praeger 2003) argued  that the success in Uganda, where prevalence feel 21% to 6% between 1989-2003 was largely due to the "B" of the ABC approach, fidelity or reduction in multiple partners. This conclusion was validated and expanded to underscore the dangers of concurrent sexual partners by Helen Epstein, in The Invisible Cure &lt;ref&gt;{The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight Against AIDS. Farrar, Straus and Giroux 2007 |&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Souter''' (14 August 1873 – 17 January 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|s/souter_a|band=10|autor= Johannes Madey|artikel= Souter, Alexander|spalten=844-845}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[biblical scholar]].

==Biography==
Souter was born in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], and studied at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. He subsequently became a [[Latin language|Latin]] assistant at Aberdeen. While at Cambridge he studied under [[J. E. B. Mayor]], whom Souter would credit with influence on his later scholarship.&lt;ref name=speculum&gt;{{cite journal | author = Laistner, M.L.W. |author2= Lowe, E.A.|author3= Ullman, B.L. | title = Alexander Souter (in Memoirs of Fellows and Corresponding Fellows of the Mediaeval Academy) | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | year = 1950 | pages = 418–419 | doi = 10.1017/s0038713400174597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 he was appointed professor of [[New Testament Greek]] and [[Exegesis]] at [[Mansfield College, Oxford]]. In 1911 he moved back to the University of Aberdeen, succeeding [[William Mitchell Ramsay|William Ramsay]] as [[Regius Professor of Humanity]], in which position he remained until his retirement in 1937.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt;

Upon his retirement, Souter moved back to Oxford, where he became editor-in-chief of the proposed ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]''. The outbreak of World War II prevented its completion within his lifetime, but Souter did publish a smaller work borne of this endeavor, ''Glossary of Later Latin, A.D. 150–600''.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt;

Souter married Elizabeth Barr Anderson, daughter of Aberdeen Photographer William Blair Anderson. They had three daughters, Isabella Elise Souter (who married Alfred Dixon) born in 1901, Elizabeth Barr Anderson Souter born in 1903 and Alexandra Margaret Souter (known as Peggy, who married Peter Jackson) born in 1908. His brother-in-law was William Blair Anderson, who was Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge University and a leading Latin scholar of his day.

==Scholarship==
Souter's two main interests were in the text of the [[New Testament]] and in early Latin commentaries on the [[Pauline epistles]]. He published an edition of the New Testament in 1910 (revised edition 1947) giving the Greek text on which the English [[Revised Version]] of 1881 was based, along with commentary on variants. His work on the Pauline epistles included proposed revisions to many accepted attributions, notably of [[Ambrosiaster]], as well as numerous commentaries on and editions of other works.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt; A public lecture is held annually in the University of Aberdeen in memory of this scholar.

[[File:Nephila-clavipes-1.jpg|thumb|''[[Nephila clavipes]]'']]

'''Arachnology''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[spider]]s and related animals such as [[scorpion]]s, [[Pseudoscorpionida|pseudoscorpions]], and [[Opiliones|harvestmen]], collectively called [[arachnid]]s. Those who study spiders and other arachnids are '''arachnologists'''.

The word ''[[wiktionary:arachnology|arachnology]]'' derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀράχνη}}, ''arachnē'', "spider"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.

==Arachnology as a science==
Arachnologists are primarily responsible for [[biological classification|classifying]] arachnids and studying aspects of their biology. In the popular imagination they are sometimes referred to as 'spider experts'. Disciplines within arachnology include naming species and determining their [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]] to one another (taxonomy and systematics), studying how they interact with other members of their species and/or their environment ([[behavioural ecology]]), or how they are distributed in different regions and habitats ([[faunistics]]). Other arachnologists perform research on the [[anatomy]] or physiology of arachnids, including the venom of spiders and scorpions. Others study the impact of spiders in agricultural ecosystems and whether they can be used as biological control agents.

===Subdisciplines===
Arachnology can be broken down into more specific specialties. These topics include:
* '''[[acarology]]''' –  the study of [[tick]]s and [[mite]]s.
* '''[[araneology]]''' –  the study of [[spiders]].
* '''[[scorpiology]]''' – the study of [[scorpion]]s.

==Arachnological societies==
Arachnologists are served by a number of [[scientific societies]], both national and international in scope. Their main role is to encourage the exchange of ideas between researchers, to organise meetings and congresses, and in a number of cases to publish [[academic journals]]. Some are also involved in [[science outreach]] programs, like the ''European spider of the year'', which raise awareness of these animals among the general public.

==Popular arachnology==
In the 1970s, arachnids – particularly [[tarantulas]] – started to become popular as exotic pets. Many tarantulas thus become more widely known by their common names such as the [[Mexican redknee tarantula]] (''[[Brachypelma smithi]]'').

Various societies now focus on the [[husbandry]], care, study and captive breeding of tarantulas, and other arachnids. They also typically produce journals or newsletters with articles and advice on these subjects.

{{italic title}}
'''''Artibus et Historiae''''' is a semi-annual publication of art historical research published by [[IRSA]] (Institute for Art Historical Research) since 1980. It is a scholarly [[peer review]] journal embracing a broad range of topics within the field of art history; however, it aims to address interdisciplinary connections at the peripheries of art and other humanistic fields, such as psychology, sociology, philosophy, or literature.&lt;ref name="artibusethistoriae1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/ |title=Artibus et Historiae |publisher=Artibusethistoriae.org |date= |accessdate=2008-12-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081208074502/http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/| archivedate= 8 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears twice a year, in hardback. The articles are in one of four languages: English, Italian, German, or French

''Artibus et Historiae'' is indexed in the Bibliography of the History of Art (BHA) and its articles are deposited in electronic form accessible through [[JSTOR]].

==Title and Logo==

''Artibus et Historiae'' takes its title from the private experiences of its founder and editor-in-chief, Polish art historian Dr. hab. [[Józef Grabski]]. "Artibus" is an inscription on the fronton of an old and very prestigious art exhibition hall, "[[Zachęta]]" (Society for Encouragement of Fine Arts, founded in 1860), in his native Warsaw. The second part of the title, "Historiae", is a tribute paid to the Countess Karolina Lanckorońska, professor of art history and editor of Polish historical sources in her own "Institutum Historicum Polonicum" in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name="artibusethistoriae1"/&gt;

The logo of IRSA and ''Artibus et Historiae'' - a symbolic representation of a winged putto standing firmly on a balance, held in his own hands - comes from a Renaissance painting by Lorenzo Lotto (''Portrait of a Man Aged Thirty-Seven''. c. 1542 Collection Doria Pamphili, Rome) and symbolizes the Platonic idea of internal equilibrium between the spiritual and the physical aspects of the activities and existence of man.&lt;ref name="artibusethistoriae1"/&gt;

==History==
''Artibus et Historiae'' is the primary publication issued by IRSA. The idea of publishing a new art journal was conceived by Dr. Grabski in the late 1970s and realized after the [[International Congress of Art History]] (CIHA) in Bologna (1979). Thus IRSA Publishing House was brought into being and the first number of ''Artibus et Historiae'' appeared in 1980. It has since continued to feature groundbreaking articles at the forefront of art historical research. In 2009 the periodical will celebrate thirty years of international readership.

==Journal Profile==

''Artibus et Historiae'' presents scholarly contributions to the field of art history addressing a wide-ranging spectrum of topics. Although art history remains the main focus of the journal, many articles address interdisciplinary aspects at the frontiers of art and other humanistic fields, such as psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature. Likewise, articles are not limited to particular media or form and many address topics in photography or film as well as the theory and reception of art.

Certain works, which due to their length, could not have been published in periodical form, have appeared as volumes in the series from ''Bibliotheca Artibus et Historiae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/?menu=bib |title=Artibus et Historiae |publisher=Artibusethistoriae.org |date= |accessdate=2008-12-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209003329/http://www.artibusethistoriae.org/?menu=bib| archivedate= 9 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behavioral engineering''' is intended to identify issues associated with the interface of [[technology]] and the human operators in a system and to generate recommended design practices that consider the strengths and limitations of the human operators.
{{quote|"The behavior of the individual has been shaped according to revelations of 'good conduct' never as the result of experimental study."|[[B.F Skinner]]|''"[[Walden Two]]"''}}

Watson wrote in 1924 "Behaviorism ... holds that the subject matter of human psychology is the behavior of the human being. Behaviorism claims that consciousness is neither a definite nor a usable concept."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.B. (1924) ''Behaviorism''&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is often used in organizational behavior management, which is [[behavior analysis]] applied to organizations and behavioral community psychology.

==Success of approach==
Behavioral engineering has been used to increase safety in organizations (see [[Behavior-based safety]]).&lt;ref&gt;Alavosius, M.P., &amp; Sulzer-Azaroff, B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55872">The term '''bioarchaeology''' was first coined by British archaeologist [[Grahame Clark]] in 1972 as a reference to [[zooarchaeology]], or the study of animal bones from [[Archaeological site|archaeological sites]].  Redefined in 1977 by [[Jane Buikstra]], bioarchaeology in the US now refers to the scientific study of human remains from archaeological sites, a discipline known in other countries as '''osteoarchaeology''' or '''palaeo-osteology'''.  In England and other European countries, the term 'bioarchaeology' is borrowed to cover all biological remains from sites.

Bioarchaeology was largely born from the practices of [[New Archaeology]], which developed in the US in the 1970s as a reaction to a mainly [[Culture history|cultural-historical]] approach to understanding the past.  Proponents of New Archaeology advocated using processual methods to test hypotheses about the interaction between culture and biology, or a biocultural approach. Some archaeologists advocate a more holistic approach to bioarchaeology that incorporates [[critical theory]] and is more relevant to modern descent populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If possible, human remains from archaeological sites are analyzed to determine sex, age, and health.

== Paleodemography ==
Bioarchaeologists sometimes create [[Life table|life tables]], a type of [[Cohort study|cohort analysis]], to understand the demographic characteristics (such as risk of death or [[sex ratio]]) of a given age cohort within a population.  Age and sex are crucial variables in the construction of a life table, although this information is often not available to bioarchaeologists. Therefore, it is often necessary to estimate the age and sex of individuals based on specific morphological characteristics of the skeleton.

=== Age estimation ===
The estimation of age in bioarchaeology and [[osteology]] actually refers to an approximation of skeletal or biological age-at-death. The primary assumption in age estimation is that an individual's skeletal age is closely associated with their chronological age. Age estimation can be based on patterns of growth and development or degenerative changes in the skeleton. Many methods tracking these types of changes have been developed using a variety of skeletal series. For instance, in children age is typically estimated by assessing their dental development, ossification and fusion of specific skeletal elements, or long bone length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human skeletal remains: excavation, analysis, interpretation (3rd ed.)|last=Ubelaker|first=D.H.|publisher=Taraxacum|year=1999|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults, degenerative changes to the [[pubic symphysis]], the auricular surface of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], the sternal end of the 4th rib, and [[Attrition (dental)|dental attrition]] are commonly used to estimate skeletal age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standards for data collection from human skeletal remains|last=Buikstra|first=J.E.|author2=D.H. Ubelaker|publisher=Arkansas Archaeological Survey|year=1994|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=C.O.|author2=Meindl, R.S.|author3=Pryzbeck, T.R.|author4=Mensforth R.P.|year=1985|title=Chronological metamorphosis of the auricular surface of the ilium: a new method for the determination of adult skeletal age at death|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=68|pages=15–28|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330680103|pmid=4061599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=C.O.|year=1985|title=Dental wear in the Libben population: its functional pattern and role in the determination of adult skeletal age at death|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=68|pages=47–56|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330680105|pmid=4061601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex determination ===

[[Human skeleton|Differences in male and female skeletal anatomy]] are used by bioarchaeologists to determine the biological sex of human skeletons.  Humans are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], although overlap in body shape and sexual characteristics is possible. Not all skeletons can be assigned a sex, and some may be wrongly identified as male or female.  Sexing skeletons is based on the observation that biological males and biological females differ most in the skull and pelvis; bioarchaeologists focus on these parts of the body when determining sex, although other body parts can also be used.  The female pelvis is generally broader than the male pelvis, and the angle between the two inferior pubic rami (the sub-pubic angle) is wider and more U-shaped, while the sub-pubic angle of the male is more V-shaped and less than 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;  Phenice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phenice|first1=T.W.|year=1969|title=A Newly Developed Visual Method of Sexing the Os Pubis|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=30|issue=|pages=297–302|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330300214|pmid=5772048}}&lt;/ref&gt; details numerous visual differences between the male and female pelvis.

In general, the male skeleton is more robust than the female skeleton because of the greater muscles mass of the male. Males generally have more pronounced brow ridges, nuchal crests, and mastoid processes.  It should be remembered that skeletal size and robustness are influenced by nutrition and activity levels. Pelvic and cranial features are considered to be more reliable indicators of biological sex.  Sexing skeletons of young people who have not completed puberty is more difficult and problematic than sexing adults, because the body has not had time to develop fully.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;

Bioarchaeological sexing of skeletons is not error-proof.  In reviewing the sexing of Egyptian skulls from Qua and  Badari, Mann &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=George E|year=1989|title=On the Accuracy of Sexing of Skeletons in Archaeological Reports|url=|journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology|volume=75|issue=|pages=246–49|doi=10.2307/3821921}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 20.3% could be assigned to a different sex than the sex indicated in the archaeological literature. A re-evalutaion of Mann's work showed that he did not understand the tomb numbering system of the old excavation and assigned wrong tomb numbers to the skulls. The sexing of the bone material was actually quite correct.&lt;ref&gt;Tatjana Beuthe: ''On the vailidity of Sexing data from early excavations: examples from Qua'', in ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', 99 (2013), 308-311&lt;/ref&gt; However, recording errors and re-arranging of human remains may play a part in this great incidence of misidentification.

Direct testing of bioarchaeological methods for sexing skeletons by comparing gendered names on coffin plates from the crypt at [[Christ Church, Spitalfields|Christ Church, Spitalfields, London]] to the associated remains resulted in a 98 percent success rate.&lt;ref&gt;Molleson, Theya, and M. Cox. The Spitalfields Project, Volume 2: The Anthropology: Council For British Archaeology, York, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-based differences are not inherently a form of inequality, but become an inequality when members of one sex are given privileges based on their sex.  This stems from society investing differences with cultural and social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Ames, Kenneth M. "The Archaeology of Rank." ''Handbook of Archaeological Theories''. Eds. R. Alexander Bently, [[Herbert D. G. Maschner]] and [[Christopher Chippendale]]. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2008. 487–513.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gendered work patterns may make their marks on the bones and be identifiable in the archaeological record. Molleson&lt;ref name="Molleson, Theya 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molleson|first1=Theya|year=1994|title=The Eloquent Bones of Abu Hureyra|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=271|issue=2|pages=70–75|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0894-70}}&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence of gendered work patterns by noting extremely arthritic big toes, a collapse of the last dorsal vertebrae, and muscular arms and legs among female skeletons at Abu Hureyra.  She interpreted this sex-based pattern of skeletal difference as indicative of gendered work patterns. These kinds of skeletal changes could have resulted from women spending long periods of time kneeling while grinding grain with the toes curled forward. Investigation of gender from mortuary remains is of growing interest to archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Bettina, and Nancy L. Wicker. Gender and the Archaeology of Death. Walnut Creek, CA: Alta Mira Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-specific stress indicators ==

=== Dental non-specific stress indicators ===

==== Enamel hypoplasia ====
[[Enamel hypoplasia]] refers to transverse furrows or pits that form in the enamel surface of teeth when the normal process of tooth growth stops, resulting in a deficit of enamel.  Enamel hypoplasias generally form due to disease and/or poor nutrition.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998"&gt;Mays, Simon. The Archaeology of Human Bones. 1998. Second ed. New York: Routledge, 2010. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Linear furrows are commonly referred to as linear enamel hypoplasias (LEHs); LEHs can range in size from microscopic to visible to the naked eye.  By examining the spacing of [[perikymata]] grooves (horizontal growth lines), the duration of the stressor can be estimated,&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, Louise T. Enamel Traces of Early Lifetime Events. Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology: Cambridge University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although Mays argues that the width of the hypoplasia bears only an indirect relationship to the duration of the stressor.

Studies of dental enamel hypoplasia are used to study child health.  Unlike bone, teeth are not remodeled, so they can provide a more reliable indicator of past health events as long as the enamel remains intact. Dental hypoplasias provide an indicator of health status during the time in childhood when the enamel of the tooth crown is being formed. Not all of the enamel layers are visible on the surface of the tooth because enamel layers that are formed early in crown development are buried by later layers. Hypoplasias on this part of the tooth do not show on the surface of the tooth.  Because of this buried enamel, teeth record stressors form a few months after the start of the event.  The proportion of enamel crown formation time represented by this buried in enamel varies from up to 50 percent in molars to 15-20 percent in anterior teeth.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;  Surface hypoplasias record stressors occurring from about one to seven years, or up to 13 years if the third molar is included.&lt;ref&gt;Mays, Simon. The Archaeology of Human Bones. 1998. Second ed. New York: Routledge, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skeletal non-specific stress indicators ===

==== Porotic hyperostosis/cribra orbitalia ====
It was long assumed that [[iron deficiency anemia]] has marked effects on the flat bones of the cranium of infants and young children. That as the body attempts to compensate for low iron levels by increasing red blood cell production in the young, sieve-like lesions develop in the cranial vaults (termed [[porotic hyperostosis]]) and/or the [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]] (termed cribia orbitalia). This bone is spongy and soft.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez. Bioarchaeology: An Integrated Approach to Working with Human Remains. New York: Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is however, highly unlikely that iron deficiency anemia is a cause of either porotic hyperostosis or cribra orbitalia.&lt;ref&gt;Walker et al. 2009 "The Causes of Porotic Hyperostosis and Cribra Orbitalia: A Reappraisal of the Iron-Deficiency-Anemia Hypothesis" American Journal of Physical Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; These are more likely the result of vascular activity in these areas and are unlikely to be pathological.   The development of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis could also be attributed to other causes besides an iron deficiency in the diet, such as nutrients lost to intestinal parasites.  However, dietary deficiencies are the most probable cause.&lt;ref name="Schutkowski, Holger 2008"&gt;Schutkowski, Holger. "Thoughts for Food: Evidence and Meaning of Past Dietary Habits."  Between Biology and Culture. Ed. Holger Schutkowski. Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology: Cambridge University Press, 2008. 141–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anemia incidence may be a result of inequalities within society, and/or indicative of different work patterns and activities among different groups within society.  A study of iron-deficiency among early Mongolian nomads showed that although overall rates of cribra orbitalia declined from 28.7 percent (27.8 percent of the total female population, 28.4 percent of the total male population, 75 percent of the total juvenile population) during the Bronze and Iron Ages, to 15.5 percent during the Hunnu (2209–1907 BP) period, the rate of females with cribra orbitalia remained roughly the same, while the incidence of cribra orbitalia among males and children declined (29.4  percent of the total female population, 5.3 percent of the total male population, and 25 percent of the juvenile population had cribra orbitalia).&lt;ref&gt;Bazarsad, Naran. "Iron-Deficiency Anemia in Early Mongolian Nomads."  Ancient Health: Skeletal Indicators of Agricultural and Economic Intensification. Eds. Mark Nathan Cohen and Gillian M.M. Crane-Kramer. Gainesville/Tallahassee/Tampa/Boca Raton: University Press of Florida, 2007. 250–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bazarsad posits several reasons for this distribution of cribra orbitalia: adults may have lower rates of cribra orbitalia than juveniles because lesions either heal with age or lead to death.  Higher rates of cribia orbitalia among females may indicate lesser health status, or greater survival of young females with cribia orbitalia into adulthood.

==== Harris lines ====
[[Harris lines]] form before adulthood, when bone growth is temporarily halted or slowed down due to some sort of stress (either disease or malnutrition).  During this time, bone mineralization continues, but growth does not, or does so at very reduced levels.  If and when the stressor is overcome, bone growth will resume, resulting in a line of increased mineral density that will be visible in a [[radiograph]].&lt;ref name="Schutkowski, Holger 2008" /&gt; If there is not recovery from the stressor, no line will be formed.&lt;ref name="Danforth, Marie Elaine 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danforth|first1=Marie Elaine|year=1999|title=Nutrition and Politics in Prehistory|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=28|issue=|pages=1–25|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hair ===
The stress hormone [[cortisol]] is deposited in hair as it grows.  This has been used successfully to detect fluctuating levels of stress in the later lifespan of mummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schulich.uwo.ca/moleculartoxicology/files/Linked/Hair%20cortisol%20as%20a%20biological%20marker%20of%20chronic%20stress%20Current%20status%20future%20directions%20and%20unanswered%20questions.pdf|title=Hair cortisol as a biological marker of chronic stress: Current status, future directions and unanswered questions|date=2011-09-12|accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical stress and activity indicators ==

Examining the effects that activities and workload has upon the skeleton allows the archaeologist to examine who was doing what kinds of labor, and how activities were structured within society. The division of labor within the [[Household archaeology|household]] may be divided according to [[gender]] and age, or be based on other hierarchical social structures. Human remains can allow archaeologists to uncover patterns in the division of labor.

Living bones are subject to [[Wolff's law]], which states that bones are physically affected and remodeled by physical activity or inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=Julius|year=1893|title=Review: Das Gesetz Der Transformation Der Knochen (the Law of the Transformation of Bones)|url=|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=1673|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increases in mechanical stress tend to produce bones that are thicker and stronger.

One example of how these changes have been used to study activities is the [[African Burial Ground National Monument|New York African Burial Ground]] in New York. This provides evidence of the brutal working conditions under which the enslaved labored;&lt;ref&gt;Wilczak, C., R.C. Watkins, and M.L. Blakey. Skeletal Indicators of Work: Musculoskeletal, Arthritic, and Traumatic Events: US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[osteoarthritis]] of the vertebrae was very common, even among the young.  The pattern of osteoarthritis combined with the early age of onset provides evidence of labor that resulted in mechanical strain to the neck.  One male skeleton shows stress lesions at 37 percent of 33 muscle or ligament attachments, showing he experienced significant musculoskeletal stress.  Overall, the interred show signs of significant musculoskeletal stress and heavy workloads, although workload and activities varied among different individuals.  Some individuals show high levels of stress, while others do not.  This references the variety of types of labor (e.g., domestic vs. carrying heavy loads) labor that enslaved individuals were forced to perform.

=== Injury and workload ===
[[Bone fracture|Fractures]] to bones during or after excavation will appear relatively fresh, with broken surfaces appearing white and unweathered.  Distinguishing between fractures around the time of death and [[Taphonomy|post-depositional]] fractures in bone is difficult, as both types of fractures will show signs of weathering.  Unless evidence of bone healing or other factors are present, researchers may choose to regard all weathered fractures as post-depositional.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;

Evidence of perimortal fractures (or fractures inflicted on a fresh corpse) can be distinguished in unhealed metal blade injuries to the bones.  Living or freshly dead bones are somewhat resilient, so metal blade injuries to bone will generate a linear cut with relatively clean edges rather than irregular shattering.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt; Archaeologists have tried using the microscopic parallel scratch marks on cut bones in order to estimate the trajectory of the blade that caused the injury.&lt;ref&gt;Wenham, S.J., and J. Wakely. Features of Blade-Injuries to Bone Surfaces in  Six Anglo-Saxon Skeletons from Eccles, Kent: BAR 211 Oxford, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diet and dental health ==

=== Caries ===
[[Dental caries]], commonly referred to as cavities or tooth decay, are caused by localized destruction of tooth enamel, as a result of acids produced by bacteria feeding upon and fermenting carbohydrates in the mouth.  Subsistence based upon agriculture is strongly associated with a higher rate of caries than subsistence based upon foraging, because of the higher levels of carbohydrates in diets based upon agriculture.&lt;ref name="Danforth, Marie Elaine 1999" /&gt; For example, bioarchaeologists have used caries in skeletons to correlate a diet of rice and agriculture with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tayles|first1=N.|last2=Domett|first2=K.|last3=Nelsen|first3=K.|year=2000|title=Agriculture and dental caries?

== Stable isotope analysis ==
Stable isotope analysis of [[carbon]] and nitrogen in human bone collagen allows bioarchaeologists to carry out dietary reconstruction and to make nutritional inferences. These chemical signatures reflect long-term dietary patterns, rather than a single meal or [[Feasting and Inequality|feast]]. Stable isotope analysis monitors the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C), which is expressed as parts per mil (per thousand) using delta notation (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C).  The ratio of carbon isotopes varies according to the types of plants consumed with different photosynthesis pathways. The three  photosynthesis pathways are [[C3 carbon fixation]], [[C4 carbon fixation]] and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]]. C4 plants are mainly grasses from tropical and subtropical regions, and are adapted to higher levels of radiation than C3 plants.  Corn, millet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsen|first1=Clark Spencer|year=1995|title=Biological Changes in Human Populations with Agriculture|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=24|issue=|pages=185–213|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.24.1.185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sugar cane are some well-known C4 domesticates, while all trees and shrubs use the C3 pathway.&lt;ref name="Bocherens, Herve 2001"&gt;Bocherens, Herve.

[[Nitrogen]] isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) have been used to estimate the relative contributions of legumes verses nonlegumes, as well as terrestrial versus marine resources to the diet.&lt;ref name="Klepinger, Linda L 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White, Christine D. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Christine D.|display-authors=etal|year=2001|title=Social Complexity and Food Systems at Altun Ha, Belize: The Isotopic Evidence|url=|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=12|issue=4|pages=371–93|doi=10.2307/972085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletons excavated from the Coburn Street Burial Ground (1750 to 1827 CE) in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, were analyzed using stable isotope data by Cox ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Glenda|display-authors=etal|year=2001|title=Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopic Analyses of the Underclass at the Colonial Cape of Good Hope in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|url=|journal=World Archaeology|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–97|doi=10.1080/00438240126647}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to determine geographical histories and life histories of the interred.  The people buried in this cemetery were assumed to be slaves and members of the underclass based on the informal nature of the cemetery; biomechanical stress analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ledger|first1=Michael|display-authors=etal|year=2000|title=Biomechanical Beamanalysis of Long Bones from a Late 18th Century Slave Cemetery in Cape Town, South Africa|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=112|issue=2|pages=207–16|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-8644(2000)112:2&lt;207::aid-ajpa7&gt;3.0.co;2-k|pmid=10813703}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stable isotope analysis, combined with other archaeological data, seem to support this supposition.

Based on stable isotope levels, eight Cobern Street Burial Ground individuals consumed a diet based on C4 (tropical) plants in childhood, then consumed more C3 plants, which were more common at the Cape later in their lives.  Six of these individuals had dental modifications similar to those carried out by peoples inhabiting tropical areas known to be targeted by slavers who brought enslaved individuals from other parts of Africa to the colony.  Based on this evidence, Cox ''et al''. argue that these individuals represent enslaved persons from areas of Africa where C4 plants are consumed and who were brought to the Cape as laborers. Cox ''et al''. do not assign these individuals to a specific [[Ethnicity and archaeology|ethnicity]], but do point out that similar dental modifications are carried out by the Makua, Yao, and Marav peoples.  Four individuals were buried with no [[grave goods]], in accordance with Muslim tradition, facing [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]], which is a point of significance for local Muslims. Their isotopic signatures indicate that they grew up in a temperate environment consuming mostly C3 plants, but some C4 plants.  Many of the isotopic signatures of interred individuals indicate that they Cox ''et al''. argue that these individuals were from the Indian Ocean area. They also suggest that these individuals were [[Archaeology of religion and ritual|Muslims]].  Cox ''et al''. argue that stable isotopic analysis of burials, combined with historical and archaeological data can be an effective way in of investigating the worldwide migrations forced by the [[African Slave Trade]], as well as the emergence of the underclass and working class in the colonial Old World.

Stable isotope analysis of [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] can also be carried out.  The amounts of these isotopes vary in different geological locations.  Because bone is a dynamic tissue that is remodeled over time, and because different parts of the skeleton are laid down at particular times over the course of a human life,  stable isotope analysis can be used to investigate population movements in the past and indicate where people lived at various points of their lives.&lt;ref name="Mays, Simon 1998" /&gt;

== Archaeological uses of DNA ==
[[Ancient DNA|aDNA]] analysis of past populations is used by archaeology to genetically determine the sex of individuals, determine genetic relatedness, understand marriage patterns, and investigate prehistoric population movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaestle|first1=Fredericka A.|last2=Horsburgh|first2=K.

== Bioarchaeological treatments of equality and inequality ==
Aspects of the relationship between the physical body and socio-cultural conditions and practices can be recognized through the study of human remains.  This is most often emphasized in a "[[Biocultural anthropology|biocultural]] bioarchaeology" model. It has often been the case that bioarchaeology has been regarded as a [[positivist]], science-based discipline, while theories of the living body in the social sciences have been viewed as [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] in nature. Physical anthropology and bioarchaeology have been criticized for having little to no concern for culture or history. Blakey&lt;ref name="Blakey, Michael L 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blakey|first1=Michael L|year=2001|title=Bioarchaeology of the African Diaspora in the Americas: Its Origins and Scope|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=30|issue=|pages=387–422|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.30.1.387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blakey, Michael L. Introduction: Section 1: Background of the New York African Burial Ground Project. Philadelphia, PA: US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that scientific or forensic treatments of human remains from archaeological sites construct a view of the past that is neither cultural nor historic, and has suggested that a biocultural version of bioarchaeology will be able to construct a more meaningful and nuanced history that is more relevant to modern populations, especially descent populations.  By biocultural, Blakey means a type of bioarchaeology that is not simply descriptive, but  combines the standard forensic techniques of describing stature, sex and age with investigations of demography and epidemiology in order to verify or critique socioeconomic conditions experienced by human communities of the past.

Currently, some bioarchaeologists are coming to view the discipline as lying at a crucial interface between the science and the humanities; as the human body is non-static, and is constantly being made and re-made by both biological and cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, Kirsi.

Buikstra and Lane A Beck: Academic Press/Elsevier, 2006. 347–258.&lt;/ref&gt; considers her work to be aligned with Blakey's biocultural version of bioarchaeology because of her emphasis on models stemming from [[critical theory]] and [[political economy]].  She acknowledges that scholars such as [[Clark Spencer Larsen|Larsen]]&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Clark Spencer. "The Changing Face of Bioarchaeology: An Interdisciplinary Science."

Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; are productive, but points out that his is a different type of bioarchaeology that focuses on quality of life, lifestyle, behavior, biological relatedness, and population history.  It does not closely link skeletal remains to their archaeological context, and is best viewed as a "skeletal biology of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Buikstra, Jane E.

Inequalities exist in all human societies, even so-called “egalitarian” ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osborne|first1=Robin|year=2007|title=Is Archaeology Equal to Equality|url=|journal=World Archaeology|volume=39|issue=2|pages=143–50|doi=10.1080/00438240701249447}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that bioarchaeology has helped to dispel the idea that life for foragers of the past was “nasty, brutish and short”; bioarchaeological studies have shown that foragers of the past were often quite healthy, while agricultural societies tend to have increased incidence of malnutrition and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=Patricia M|year=2009|title=Health Versus Fitness: Competing Themes in the Origins and Spread of Agriculture?|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=50|issue=5|pages=603–08|doi=10.1086/605354}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, based on a comparison of foragers from Oakhurst to agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe, Steyn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steyne|first1=Maryna|year=1997|title=A Reassessment of the Human Skeletons from K2 and Mapungubwe (South Africa)|url=|journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=52|issue=165|pages=14–20|doi=10.2307/3888972}}&lt;/ref&gt; believes that agriculturalists from K2 and Mapungubwe were not subject to the lower nutritional levels expected for this type of subsistence system.
	
Danforth argues that more “complex” state-level societies display greater health differences between elites and the rest of society, with elites having the advantage, and that this disparity increases as societies become more unequal.  Some status differences in society do not necessarily mean radically different nutritional levels; Powell did not find evidence of great nutritional differences between elites and commoners, but did find lower rates of anemia among elites in Moundville.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, M.L.

== Archaeological ethics ==
There are ethical issues with bioarchaeology that revolve around treatment and respect for the dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Large-scale skeletal collections were first amassed in the US in the 19th century, largely from the remains of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].  No permission was ever granted from surviving family for study and display.  Recently, federal laws such as [[NAGPRA]] (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) have allowed Native Americans to regain control over the skeletal remains of their ancestors and associated artifacts in order to reassert their cultural identities.

NAGPRA passed in 1990.  At this time, many archaeologists underestimated the public perception of archaeologists as non-productive members of society and grave robbers.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Thomas C 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas C|year=1999|title=The Political Economy of Archaeology in the United States|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=28|issue=|pages=155–75|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about occasional mistreatment of Native American remains are not unfounded: in a Minnesota excavation 1971, White and Native American remains were treated differently; remains of White people were reburied, while remains of Native American people were placed in cardboard boxes and placed in a natural history museum.&lt;ref name="Patterson, Thomas C 1999" /&gt; Blakey &lt;ref name="Blakey, Michael L 2001" /&gt; relates the growth in African American bioarchaeology to NAGPRA and its effect of cutting physical anthropologist off from their study of Native American remains.

Bioarchaeology in Europe is not as affected by these repatriation issues as American bioarchaeology but regardless the ethical considerations associated with working with human remains are, and should, be considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, because much of European archaeology has been focused on classical roots, artifacts and art have been overemphasized and Roman and post-Roman skeletal remains were nearly completely neglected until the 1980s. Prehistoric archaeology in Europe is a different story, as biological remains began to be analyzed earlier than in classical archaeology.

'''Clothed male, naked female''' ('''CMNF'''), or '''clothed male, nude female''', is female [[nudity]] in which one or more women are nude while one or more men are clothed. 

==In media==
Entertainment columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] details several experiences involving one-sided female nudity in his book ''Show Business Laid Bare.''&lt;ref&gt;''Show Business Laid Bare'', by Earl Wilson, {{ISBN|0-399-11276-6}}, New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1974. Second Printing&lt;/ref&gt;  In the chapter titled "Cheri Caffaro: A Strange Interlewd," Wilson writes about his experience interviewing actress [[Cheri Caffaro]] while she was nude and he was fully dressed.&lt;ref&gt;The story can be found on pages 45-56 of the hardcover second printing of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

One-sided female nudity has been a theme in art, particularly in [[orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings of the 19th century. A typical scene may be a depiction of [[sexual slavery|white slavery]] in which one or several nude female slaves are displayed before an audience of men at a [[slave market]]. The archetypal example of this type of scene is [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s ''[[The Slave Market (Gérôme painting)|The Slave Market]]'', in which a nude female slave is examined by a potential buyer. Another example is Gérôme's ''[[Phryne before the Areopagus|Phryné devant l'Areopage]]'' (''Phryne before the [[Areopagus]]'', 1861) which was based on the trial of [[Phryne]] before the Areopagus in ancient Greece. The [[odalisque]] (harem scene) was also a popular subject for depicting one-sided female nudity, although the clothed figures in the scene were not always male.

Outside of the Orientalist style, a scenario for one-sided female nudity in 19th-century art was the knight-errant, in which the [[damsel in distress]] was used to explore the erotic subtext of the powerful knight coming to the rescue of a helpless woman. The best known example of this is John Everett Millais' painting ''[[Knight Errant]]'', in which a nude woman has been tied to a tree and a knight is shown cutting her loose.

Another example is [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' ("The Luncheon on the Grass"), in which a nude woman is depicted having lunch with two fully clothed men. The ''[[Concert Champêtre (Titian)|Pastoral Concert]]'' (c. 1510) attributed to [[Giorgione]] or his pupil [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1185639440044&amp;bmLocale=en From the Louvre Museum Official Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628061654/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1185639440044&amp;bmLocale=en |date=June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as an inspiration for Manet's painting.

A 1913 painting ''Adoration'' by [[William Strang]] presents a philosophical study of beauty, with the clothed soldier, painter, scholar, and elderly gentleman fascinated by the naked female subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17409">[[Image:LA2-katalogkort.jpg|thumb|A [[card catalog|catalogue]] using [[index card]]s]]

A [[museum]] is distinguished by a '''collection''' of often unique objects that forms the core of its activities for [[wikt:exhibition|exhibitions]], [[education]], [[research]], etc. This differentiates it from an [[archive]] or [[library]], where the contents may be more paper-based, replaceable and less exhibition oriented, or a [[private collection]] of art formed by an individual, family or institution that may grant no public access. A museum normally has a collecting policy for new acquisitions, so only objects in certain categories and of a certain quality are accepted into the collection.  The process by which an object is formally included in the collection is called ''accessioning'' and each object is given a unique [[Accession number (library science)|accession number]].

Museum collections, and archives in general, are normally catalogued in a [[collection catalogue]], traditionally in a [[card index]], but nowadays in a computerized [[database]]. Transferring collection catalogues onto computer-based media is a major undertaking for most museums. All new acquisitions are normally catalogued on a computer in modern museums, but there is typically a backlog of old catalogue entries to be computerized as time and funding allows.

== Types ==
Museum collections are widely varied. There are collections of [[art]], of scientific specimens, of historic objects, of living zoological specimens and much more. Because there are so many things to collect, most museums have a specific area of specialization. For example, a history museum may only collect objects relevant to a particular county or even a single person, or focus on a type of object such as automobiles or stamps. Art museums may focus on a period, such as modern art, or a region. Very large museums will often have many subcollections, each with its own criteria for collecting. A natural history museum, for example, will have mammals in a separate collection from insects.

Because museums cannot collect everything, each potential new addition must be carefully considered as to its appropriateness for a given museum's defined area of interest.

== Accessioning ==

'''Accessioning''' is the formal, legal process of accepting an object into a museum collection. Because accessioning an object carries an obligation to care for that object in perpetuity, it is a serious decision. While in the past many museums accepted objects with little deliberation, today most museums have accepted the need for formal accessioning procedures and practices. These are typically set out as part of a museum's '''Collections Management Policy''' or CMP.

While each museum has its own procedures for accessioning, in most cases it begins with either an offer from a donor to give an object to a museum, or a recommendation from a [[curator]] to acquire an object through purchase or trade.

Several issues must be considered in the decision to accept an object. Common issues include:

* Is the object relevant to the museum's mission and its scope of collecting, as defined by its governing body?
* Was the object lawfully acquired and if foreign in origin, imported in compliance with international law?
* Does the owner of an object have legal title to the object and therefore the right to transfer it?
* Are there any other parties with an interest in the object (e.g. heirs of a donor, descendant groups for cultural objects, etc.)?
* Is the object encumbered by any legal obligations or constraints (e.g., natural history objects that require special permits)?
* Would the object pose any threats or dangers to other objects or staff?
* Does the museum have the resources to properly care for the object (e.g., appropriate storage space, adequate funding)
* Is the object encumbered by any donor restrictions?

Answering these questions often required investigating an object's '''provenance''', the history of an object from the time it was made.

Many museums will not accession objects that have been acquired illegally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2010/10/20101022140412aidan0.7519953.html#By_James_Cuno|title=Who’s Right? Repatriation of Cultural Property|first=James|last=Cuno|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or where other parties have an interest in the object.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In art museums, special care is given to objects that changed hands in European countries during World War II and archaeological objects unearthed after the 1970 UNESCO Convention covering the transport of cultural property. Other disciplines have different concerns. For example, anthropology museums will pay special attention to Native American objects that may be subject to repatriation, and paleontology museums may look carefully at whether proper permitting procedures were followed when they are offered fossil collections.

While in the past, museums often accepted objects with donor-based restrictions, many museums today ask that gifts be given '''unrestricted'''. Common donor restrictions include requiring that an object always be exhibited, or that a collection stays together. However, such restrictions can prevent museums from changing their exhibits as scholarship evolves and may introduce conservation issues for delicate objects not suited to continued display.

Final decision to accept an object generally lies with the museum's board of trustees. In large museums, a special committee may meet regularly to review potential acquisitions. Once the decision has been made to accept an object, it is formally accessioned through a '''Deed of Gift''' and entered into the museum's catalog records. Each object is given a unique catalog number to identify it. Objects are then packed for appropriate archival storage, or prepared for exhibition or other educational use.

Once accessioned into the collection, museum objects must be appropriately cared for. New objects may be examined by a '''conservator''' and treated for any pre-existing damage. The object is then cataloged by a '''curator''' or other specialist with knowledge of the object's importance and history. The object will then be given an appropriate storage location.

Museum storage conditions are meant to protect the object and to minimize any deterioration. This often means keeping objects in a stable climate, preventing exposure to pests, minimizing any handling, and using only archival materials that will not deteriorate or harm the objects. Object safety also include providing appropriate security, and planning for disasters and other threats, and making sure that museum staff are trained in proper handling procedures.

Different types of objects have different requirements, and many museums have specialized storage areas. For example, framed paintings may be stored in racks in one room while unframed paintings are kept in large drawers in another. Some objects have extremely specialized needs. For example, material from underwater archaeological sites may need to be kept wet, and some very rare and badly deteriorated objects require oxygen-free environments.

At any given time, museums display only a portion of their collections. This is often because exhibition requires much more space than storage, and is impractical for the entire collection to be out. Museums may also contain many duplicate or similar objects and find that a few specimens are better suited to display than others. In addition, certain objects, particularly works on paper and textiles, are damaged by light and must only be displayed for short periods of time.

Museum collections are often made up of a variety of materials in a single collection including, but not limited to: canvas, oil and/or acrylic paints, wood, ivory, paper, bone, leather, and textiles.  The biggest conservation issue for museum collections is the fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature.&lt;ref name="Snyder, Jill 2001"&gt;Snyder, Jill.  Caring for Your Art: A Guide for Artists, Collectors, Galleries, and Institutions.  Allworth Press: New York, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   Relative Humidity (RH) is a measure of the percentage of saturation of the air.

Temperature is not as important to the life of a work of art, but it is true that chemical reactions occur faster at higher temperatures.  However, a museum must take into account the comfort of its staff and visitors and it has been widely accepted that 68&amp;nbsp;°F-75&amp;nbsp;°F does not cause a lot of problems for most artifacts and is comfortable for most humans.&lt;ref name="Snyder, Jill 2001"/&gt;

It has also been internationally agreed upon that the RH should be set at 50%–55%.&lt;ref&gt;Plenderleith, H.J. and Werner, A.E.A.  The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art.  Oxford University Press: London, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;   This has become widely accepted because the lower limit was set at 45% since damage to organic materials begin to occur below this point.  The upper limit is placed at 65% because mold flourishes at 70% RH.&lt;ref name="Bachmann, Konstanze 1992"&gt;Bachmann, Konstanze.  Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators. Smithsonian Institution Press: Washington DC, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is also cheaper for most institutions to maintain 50% RH rather than 45% or 60%.&lt;ref name="Lord 1999"&gt;Lord, Gail Dexter and Lord, Barry. [[Lord Cultural Resources|The Manual of Museum Planning]], Second Edition. Altimira Press: Walnut Creek, CA, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is some exception when it comes to tropical climates since the indigenous artifacts are acclimated to RH levels higher than the “museum norm”.&lt;ref name="Lord 1999"/&gt;   Changes can be made to a museum’s RH to accommodate the changing seasons, but they must be made gradually.  Humidity should change in 2% per month increments (an increase in 1&amp;nbsp;°F will affect a decrease of about 2% RH).&lt;ref name="Bachmann, Konstanze 1992"/&gt;

== Deaccessioning ==
{{Main|Deaccessioning (museum)}}
'''Deaccessioning''', the process of disposing, selling or trading objects from a museum collection, is not undertaken lightly in most museums. There are ethical issues to consider since many donors of objects typically expect the museum to care for them in perpetuity. Deaccessioning of an object in a collection may be appropriate if a museum has more than one example of that object and if the object is being transferred to another museum. It may also be appropriate if an object is badly deteriorated or threatening other objects.

The decision to deaccession includes two parts. These are making the decision to deaccession and deciding the method of disposal. Generally, first choice is to transfer an object to another use or division in a museum, such as deaccessioning a duplicate object from a permanent collection into a teaching collection. Second choice is to transfer the object to another institution, generally with local institutions having priority. The [[American Alliance of Museums]] and other regional associations often operate lists or boards to help facilitate such transfers. Last choice is sale on the open market. Open market sales are generally expected to take place at auction rather than through private sale, and are typically most common in art museums due to the high monetary value of art collections.

A controversial example occurred when the last remaining complete [[dodo]] [[taxidermy|mount]] in a museum collection at [[Oxford University]] was deaccessioned due to its deterioration in 1775.&lt;ref name="dodo"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051002/spectrum/nature.htm
|work=[[The Sunday Tribune]]
|title=No longer dead as a dodo
|quote=The only known major remains of the dodo are in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Even here, in the January of 1775, an inspector from the Oxford Museum discovered the only remaining dodo, stuffed and disintegrating, and decided to throw it away. The man in charge of this task saved the head and a foot, that were in good condition, and this is all we have of the dodo bird today.
|date=2005-10-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another case was the sale of a [[J. M. W. Turner]] painting in the collection of [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] to the [[Getty Museum]] to fund the maintenance of the building, despite the fact that the original benefactor had expressly requested that the collection be kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ian|last= MacKinnon|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Getty museum pays pounds 11m for Turner  |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/getty-museum-pays-pounds-11m-for-turner-1474651.html |quote=Last night the sale was condemned by Peter Longman, director of the Museums and Galleries Commission, which advises the Government. 'It is a great pity that they have been allowed to sell it,' he said. 'It is in clear contravention of the donor's intentions and it is an integral part of an important collection.' He said it was particularly sad that the painting was being sold against the benefactor's, wishes with the Government's connivance at a time when it was inviting people to make donations and gifts to galleries. |work=[[The Independent]] |date=February 23, 1993 |accessdate=2009-06-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ethical guidelines for deaccessioning require that the funds generated by disposing of collection items be used only to increase or maintain the remaining collection. For example, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) Code of Ethics states that:

"Money or compensation received from the deaccessioning and disposal of objects and specimens from a museum collection should be used solely for the benefit of the collection and usually for acquisitions to that same collection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/ethics.html#section2 ICOM ''Code of Ethics for Museums, 2006'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], guidelines governing deaccessioning and other ethically difficult issues can be found in the [[Museums Association]]'s ''Code of Ethics''.  In the [[United States]], the guidelines on these matters are issued by the [[American Alliance of Museums]].&lt;ref name="aam-us.org"&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/code-of-ethics-for-museums The American Alliance of Museums ''Code of Ethics for Museums'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Alliance of Museums Code of Ethics takes the position that "in no event shall they [deaccessioning proceeds] be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections".&lt;ref name="aam-us.org"/&gt;

Other museums may have additional restrictions on the use of funds from deaccessioning. For example, at some museums funds from deaccessioning a work of art can only be used to purchase a work of similar style or period (for example, funds from selling a 20th-century American print could not be used to buy a 17th-century Italian painting) and the name of the donor of the sold work remains associated with the purchased artwork.

Selling artwork to fund budget deficits and pay salaries is like "burning down your house to heat the kitchen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Deborah Solomon]] |coauthors= |title=Museum Under Fire for Selling Its Art |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/arts/design/censured-delaware-art-museum-plans-to-divest-more-works.html?|quote=Selling artwork to fund operations (as opposed to acquisitions) is widely viewed as self-defeating, like burning down your house to heat the kitchen.

'''Collectivist anarchism''' (also known as '''anarcho-collectivism''') is a [[revolutionary]]&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. ''Marx in Context''. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchism|anarchist]] doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] as it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.

For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations of voluntary membership based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"&gt;Bakunin Mikail. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Thus notwithstanding the title, [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s "collectivist anarchism" is seen as a blend of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: ''The Philosophy of Freedom''. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Bakunin, the [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the [[First International]] and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

== The First International ==

[[Giuseppe Fanelli]] met Bakunin at [[Ischia]] in 1866.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} In October 1868, Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to [[Barcelona]] to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the [[International Workingmen's Association]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=12–15}} Fanelli's trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish exiles]], the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest Anarchist movement in modern Europe.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Elie Recluse.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Recluse and Fanelli were at odds over Recluse's friendships with Spanish republicans and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including [[Anselmo Lorenzo]], to the First National.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=13}} In February 1869, Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} While in Barcelona again, he met with painter [[Josep Lluís Pellicer]] and his cousin [[Rafael Farga i Pellicer|Rafael Farga Pellicer]] along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} as well as the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Alliance]] section.

In 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in [[Lyon]] on the principles later exemplified by the [[Paris Commune]], calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his ''Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis'', he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action: {{quote|[W]e must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis], Mikhail Bakunin, 1870&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

These ideas and corresponded strikingly closely with the program of the Paris Commune of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as [[Marxism|Marxists]] were almost entirely absent from the Commune. Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a "rebellion against the State" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the state, but also revolutionary dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/paris-commune.htm The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. The collectivist anarchists at first used the term "collectivism" to distinguish themselves from the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] of the followers of Proudhon and the state socialists associated with [[Karl Marx]]. Bakunin wrote that "we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian ("Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism", 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=marxists.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin's disagreements with Marx, which led to the attempt by the Marx party to expel him at the Hague Congress (see below), illustrated the growing divergence between the anti-authoritarian sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers and peasants in order to abolish the state and capitalism; and the sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was "Marx’s flamboyant chief opponent" and "presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people".&lt;ref&gt;Verslius, Arthur (2005-06-20) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/jun/20/00023/ Death of the Left?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-authoritarian majority, which included most sections of the International, created their own First International at the [[Saint-Imier|St. Imier]] [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Congress]], adopted a revolutionary anarchist program and repudiated the Hague resolutions, rescinding Bakunin's alleged expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], Black Rose Books, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bakunin accepted elements of Marx’s [[class analysis]] and theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging "Marx’s genius", he thought Marx's analysis was one-sided and that Marx's methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized "[[authoritarian socialism]]" (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] which he adamantly refused.

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that "the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government", in which each worker will have the "right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting". This revolutionary transformation could "only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm No profile created for this contactAnarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One |]. Black Rose Books. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by an anarchist veteran of the First International, Jose Llunas Pujols, in his essay "Collectivism".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt;

By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full [[communism]]. The anarchist communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] attacked this position in his essay "The Collectivist Wages System", which was reprinted in his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' in 1892.

Bakunin's socialism was known as "collectivist anarchism", where "socially: it seeks the confirmation of political equality by economic equality. This is not the removal of natural individual differences, but equality in the social rights of every individual from birth; in particular, equal means of subsistence, support, education and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity and equal resources, and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor".&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm ''Revolutionary Catechism''], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"/&gt;

=== Critique of Marxism ===
The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between [[anarchism]] and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need to be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", a concept that vanguardist socialism including Marxist–Leninism would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat.&lt;ref name=GW158&gt;Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', p. 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-020622-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any "enlightened elite" must only exert influence by remaining "[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance".&lt;ref name="Struggle.ws"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.&lt;ref name=GW158/&gt; Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.

{{quote|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.|Mikhail Bakunin, ''Statism and Anarchism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm |title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2 |publisher=Gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, [[egalitarian]] society [[Classless society|without social classes]] and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the [[direct action]] of the masses, culminating in [[social revolution]]; and refuse any intermediate stage such as the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists "anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844: {{quote|As far as learning was concerned, Marx was, and still is, incomparably more advanced than I. I knew nothing at that time of political economy, I had not yet rid myself of my metaphysical observations... He called me a sentimental idealist and he was right; I called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into Russian. In turn, Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that "[i]n the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader".&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily Tribune (October 2, 1852) on 'Revolution and Counter Revolution in Germany'&lt;/ref&gt; Marx wrote to [[Friedrich Engels]] of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia, saying: "On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the "[[new class]]", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the "[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls—or, if you will, rises—to the position of a machine".

Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the [[lumpenproletariat]] and the [[proletariat]]. As such, "[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/pubs/marxism_anarchism_roberston.pdf|title="Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict – Part Two" by Ann Robertson.|website=workerscompass.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn. "The lumpenproletariat and the proletarian unnameable" in ''Deleuze, Marx and Politics''].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with anarcho-communism ===
The difference between collectivist anarchism and [[anarcho-communism]] is that under the former a wage system is retained based on the amount of labor performed. Anarchist communism, like collectivist anarchism, also advocates for the socialization of production, but the distribution of goods as well. Instead of "to each according to his labor", in anarcho-communism the community would supply the subsistence requirements to each member free of charge according to the maxim "to each according to his needs".&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph sourced by Shatz, Marshall; Guess, Raymond; Skinner, Quentin.

Collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while communist anarchism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group. Anarcho-communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions. Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but disagree on the subject of remuneration as some collectivist anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists, such as [[Peter Kropotkin]], believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state. It could thus be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could thus be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.

Collectivist anarchists are not necessarily opposed to the use of currency, but some while opposing the retaining of money—propose the adoption of [[labour voucher]]s or "personal credit" (such as [[Participatory economics|participatory economists]]). Most collectivist anarchists see their philosophy as a carryover to anarcho-communist, but some see the system and the use of a labour voucher system as permanent rather than a transition. Collectivist anarchist James Guillaume argued that such a society would "guarantee the mutual use of the tools of production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole [...] federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able to [...] regulate the rate of production to meet the fluctuating needs of society".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue for [[workplace autonomy]] and self-management "the workers in the various factories have not the slightest intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to a superior power calling itself the 'corporation'".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with anarcho-communism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of "money" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, "[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchism''. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed. Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed. However, most anarcho-collectivists think that, over time, as productivity increases and the sense of community becomes stronger, money will disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secA3.html%23seca32&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:42:45 A.3 What types of anarchism are there?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Performance ==
Application of many collectivist anarchists projects have been successful&lt;ref name="libcom.org"&gt;"Workers Power and the Spanish Revolution," by Tom Wetzel, http://libcom.org/library/workers-power-and-the-spanish-revolution-tom-wetzel&lt;/ref&gt; as sources during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] noted in the Catalan region: {{quote|In distribution the collectives' co-operatives eliminated middlemen, small merchants, wholesalers, and profiteers, thus greatly reducing consumer prices. The collectives eliminated most of the parasitic elements from rural life, and would have wiped them out altogether if they were not protected by corrupt officials and by the political parties. Non-collectivised areas benefited indirectly from the lower prices as well as from free services often rendered by the collectives (laundries, cinemas, schools, barber and beauty parlours, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Anarchist Collectives]]'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tom Wetzel describes another collectivization: {{quote|Another industry that was totally re-organized was hair-cutting. Before July 19th, there had been 1,100 hairdressing parlors in Barcelona, most of them extremely marginal. The 5,000 assistant hairdressers were among the lowest-paid workers in Barcelona. The Generalitat had decreed a 40-hour week and 15 percent wage increase after July 19th—one of the Esquerra’s attempts to woo worker support. This spelled ruin for many hairdressing shops. A general assembly was held and it was agreed to shut down all the unprofitable shops. The 1,100 shops were replaced by a network of 235 neighborhood haircutting centers, with better equipment and lighting than the old shops. Due to the efficiencies gained, it was possible to raise wages by 40 percent. The entire network was run through assemblies of the CNT barber’s union. The former owners became members of the union.&lt;ref name="libcom.org"/&gt;}}

'''Comparative education''' Comparative education is a discipline in the social sciences which entails the scrutiny and evaluation of different educational systems, such as those in various countries. Professionals in this area of endeavor are absorbed in advancing evocative terminologies and guidelines for education worldwide, enhancing educational structures and producing a context to which the success and effectivity of education programs and initiatives can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bray|first=M|date=1995|title=Levels of Comparison in Education Studies.|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=65|pages=472-490|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives and Scope ==
According to [[Harold J. Noah|Harold Noah]] (1985),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and Farooq Joubish (2009),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} comparative education has four purposes:
#To describe educational systems, processes, or outcomes.
#To assist in the development of educational institutions and practices.
#To highlight the relationships between education and society.
#To establish generalized statements about education that are valid in more than one country.
#To help the current generation, understand the nowardays education systems, with reference to the past.
Comparative education is often incorrectly assumed to exclusively encompass studies that compare two or more different countries. In fact, since its early days researchers in this field have often eschewed such approaches, preferring rather to focus on comparisons within a single country over time. Still, some large scale projects, such as the [[PISA]] and [[TIMSS]] studies, have made important findings through explicitly comparative macroanalysis of massive data sets. Recent examples in this regard include studies analyzing intra-European &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-03-29|title=Elementary Teacher Education in the Top Performing European TIMSS Countries: A Comparative Study|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/view/74480|journal=International Education Studies|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=152|doi=10.5539/ies.v11n4p152|issn=1913-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intra-American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=2018-04-09|title=Comparing the Costs and Benefits of Attending the Top Three U.S. Elementary Teacher Education Programs|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/hes/article/view/74711|journal=Higher Education Studies|language=en-US|volume=8|issue=2|pages=70|doi=10.5539/hes.v8n2p70|issn=1925-475X}}&lt;/ref&gt; teacher education.

== Rationale for the Field ==
Many important educational questions can best be examined from an international and comparative perspective. For example, in the [[United States]] there is no nationwide certificate of completion of [[secondary education]]. This raises the question of what the advantages and disadvantages are of leaving such certification to each of the 50 states.{{By whom|date=June 2018}} Comparative education draws on the experience of countries such as [[Japan]] and [[France]] to show how a centralized system works, and what the advantages and disadvantages of a centralized certification are.

Critics of comparative education refer to it as Policy Borrowing.{{Definition needed|date=June 2018}}

== Disciplinary Identity ==
Comparative education is closely allied to, and may overlap with, [[international education]], [[international development education]], and [[comparative sociology]].

== Comparative and International Education Society ==
The [[Comparative and International Education Society]] (CIES) was founded in 1956 to foster "cross-cultural understanding, scholarship, academic achievement, and societal development through the international study of educational ideas, systems, and practices."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="999">The '''Container Revolution''' is the introduction of [[pottery]] into the Eastern Woodlands of [[North America]] during the [[Archaic period in southeastern North America|Archaic period]].  As these societies became more sedentary, they were able to manufacture and use vessels that would have broken during transportation.  Pots allowed for more efficient processing of wild seeds, which created less work for people when the pots were made waterproof. More-efficient seed collection systems and the deliberate manipulation of the native plants, in turn led to the domestication of several plant species.  This is just one of many cultural developments that began during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian M., ''Ancient North America''. London: Thames and Hudson, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryptography''' or '''cryptology''' (from {{lang-grc|{{wikt-lang|grc|κρυπτός}}|translit=kryptós}} "hidden, secret"; and {{wikt-lang|grc|γράφειν}} ''graphein'', "to write", or {{wikt-lang|grc|-λογία}} ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', "study", respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Liddell|first=Henry George|authorlink=Henry George Liddell|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|last3=Jones|first3=Henry Stuart|authorlink3=Henry Stuart Jones|last4=McKenzie|first4=Roderick|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1984|title-link=A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice and study of techniques for [[secure communication]] in the presence of third parties called [[adversary (cryptography)|adversaries]].&lt;ref name="rivest90"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Rivest|authorlink=Ron Rivest|editor=J. Van Leeuwen|title=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science|chapter=Cryptography|volume=1|publisher=Elsevier|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing [[communications protocol|protocols]] that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages;&lt;ref name="modern-crypto"&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Mihir|last1=Bellare|first2=Phillip|last2=Rogaway|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography|chapter=Introduction|page=10|date=21 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; various aspects in [[information security]] such as data [[confidentiality]], [[data integrity]], [[authentication]], and [[non-repudiation]]&lt;ref name="hac"/&gt; are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[electrical engineering]], [[communication science]], and [[physics]]. Applications of cryptography include [[electronic commerce]], [[Credit card chip|chip-based payment cards]], [[digital currencies]], [[password|computer passwords]], and [[military communications]].

Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with ''[[encryption]]'', the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent [[nonsense]]. The originator of an encrypted message shares the decoding technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature often uses the name Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve ("[[eavesdropper]]") for the adversary.&lt;ref name="codesintro"&gt;{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Biggs|title=Codes: An introduction to Information Communication and Cryptography|publisher=Springer|year=2008|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the development of [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher machines]] in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] and the advent of [[computer]]s in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread.

{{Anchor|infeasible}}Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around [[computational hardness assumption]]s, making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in [[integer factorization]] algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist [[Information theoretic security|information-theoretically secure]] schemes that {{not a typo|probably}} cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the [[one-time pad]]—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.

The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the information age. Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for [[espionage]] and [[sedition]] has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export.&lt;ref name="cryptolaw"/&gt; In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to [[Key disclosure law|compel the disclosure]] of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation.&lt;ref name="UK law"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-undercover-war-on-your-internet-secrets-how-online-surveillance-cracked-our-trust-in-the-web/ | title=The undercover war on your internet secrets: How online surveillance cracked our trust in the web | last=Ranger | first=Steve | website= | publisher=TechRepublic  | date=24 March 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612190952/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-undercover-war-on-your-internet-secrets-how-online-surveillance-cracked-our-trust-in-the-web/ | archive-date=2016-06-12| access-date=2016-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptography also plays a major role in [[digital rights management]] and [[copyright infringement]] of digital media.&lt;ref name="AACS"/&gt;

==Terminology==

[[File:Caesar cipher left shift of 3.svg|Caesar cipher left shift of 3|thumb|alt=diagram showing shift three alphabetic cypher D becomes A and E becomes B|Alphabet shift ciphers are believed to have been used by [[Julius Caesar]] over 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="codesintro" /&gt; This is an example with k=3. In other words, the letters in the alphabet are shifted three in one direction to encrypt and three in the other direction to decrypt.]]
The first use of the term ''cryptograph'' (as opposed to ''cryptogram'') dates back to the 19th century—it originated in ''[[The Gold-Bug]]'', a novel by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosenheim|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to ''encryption'', which is the process of converting ordinary information (called [[plaintext]]) into unintelligible form (called [[ciphertext]]).&lt;ref name="kahnbook" /&gt; Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A ''[[cipher]]'' (or ''cypher'') is a pair of [[algorithm]]s that create the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a "[[key (cryptography)|key]]". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a short string of characters, which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext.  Formally, a "[[cryptosystem]]" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond to each key.  Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes.

Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as [[authentication]] or integrity checks. There are two kinds of cryptosystems: [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric]] and [[Public-key cryptography|asymmetric]]. In symmetric systems the same key (the secret key) is used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is faster than asymmetric systems as they generally use shorter key lengths. Asymmetric systems use a public key to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt it. Use of asymmetric systems enhances the security of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/2604/introduction-modern-cryptosystems/104482|title = An Introduction to Modern Cryptosystems|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of asymmetric systems include RSA ([[Rivest-Shamir-Adleman]]), and ECC ([[Elliptic Curve Cryptography]]). Symmetric models include the commonly used AES ([[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) which replaced the older DES ([[Data Encryption Standard]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Quantum cryptography: An emerging technology in network security|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6107841&amp;isnumber=6107829|journal = 2011 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)|date = 2011-11-01|pages = 13–19|doi = 10.1109/THS.2011.6107841|first = M.S.|last = Sharbaf|isbn = 978-1457713767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[colloquial]] use, the term "[[code (cryptography)|code]]" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, ''code'' has a more specific meaning. It means the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a [[code word]] (for example, "wallaby" replaces "attack at dawn").

[[Cryptanalysis]] is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to crack encryption algorithms or their implementations.

Some use the terms ''cryptography'' and ''cryptology'' interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use ''cryptography'' to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and ''cryptology'' to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis.&lt;ref name="goldreichbook"&gt;[[Oded Goldreich]], ''Foundations of Cryptography, Volume 1: Basic Tools'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0521791723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="websters"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]] |title=Cryptology (definition) |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cryptology |accessdate=26 March 2015 |edition=11th |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is more flexible than several other languages in which ''cryptology'' (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. {{IETF RFC|2828}} advises that [[steganography]] is sometimes included in cryptology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|rfc=2828|title=Internet Security Glossary|website=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]|date=May 2000|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2828|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called cryptolinguistics.

==History of cryptography and cryptanalysis==
{{Main|History of cryptography}}
Before the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of [[information|messages]] from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure [[secrecy]] in [[communications]], such as those of [[spy|spies]], military leaders, and [[diplomat]]s. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity [[authentication]], [[digital signature]]s, [[Interactive proof system|interactive proofs]] and [[secure multiparty computation|secure computation]], among others.

===Classic cryptography===
[[File:Skytala&amp;EmptyStrip-Shaded.png|thumb|alt=Skytala stick with strip of paper wound around in spiral|Reconstructed [[ancient Greek]] ''[[scytale]]'', an early cipher device]]
The main classical cipher types are [[transposition cipher]]s, which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and [[substitution cipher]]s, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the [[Latin alphabet]]). Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the [[Caesar cipher]], in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet. [[Suetonius]] reports that [[Julius Caesar]] used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. [[Atbash]] is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in [[Egypt]] (ca 1900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.

The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks of Classical times]] are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the [[Sparta]]n military).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=V.V.|last=I︠A︡shchenko|title=Cryptography: an introduction|year=2002|url={{Google books|cH-NGrpcIMcC|page=6|plainurl=yes}}|publisher=AMS Bookstore|page=6|isbn=978-0821829868}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steganography]] (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from [[Herodotus]], was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair.&lt;ref name="kahnbook"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kahn|first=David|authorlink=David Kahn (writer)|title=The Codebreakers|year=1967|isbn=978-0684831305|title-link=The Codebreakers}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern examples of steganography include the use of [[invisible ink]], [[microdot]]s, and [[digital watermark]]s to conceal information.

In India, the 2000-year-old [[Kamasutra]] of [[Vātsyāyana]] speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.&lt;ref name="kahnbook" /&gt;

In [[Sassanid Persia]], there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author [[Ibn al-Nadim]]: the ''šāh-dabīrīya'' (literally "King's script") which was used for official correspondence, and the ''rāz-saharīya'' which was used to communicate secret messages with other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/codes-romuz-sg|title=CODES – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al-kindi cryptographic.png|thumb|alt=Arabic text of a book by Al-Kindi|First page of a book by [[Al-Kindi]] which discusses encryption of messages]]

Ciphertexts produced by a [[classical cipher]] (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of [[frequency analysis]], perhaps by the [[mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]] and [[polymath]] [[Al-Kindi]] (also known as ''Alkindus'') in the 9th century,&lt;ref name="Singh14-20"&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Singh |authorlink=Simon Singh |title=The Code Book |pages=14–20 |location=New York |publisher=[[Anchor Books]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0385495325|title-link=The Code Book }}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as [[puzzle]]s (see [[cryptogram]]). Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled ''Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma'' (''Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages''), which described the first known use of frequency analysis [[cryptanalysis]] techniques.&lt;ref name="Singh14-20"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kadi&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ibrahim A.|last=Al-Kadi|date=April 1992|title=The origins of cryptology: The Arab contributions|journal=[[Cryptologia]]|volume=16|number=2|pages=97–126|doi=10.1080/0161-119291866801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as [[Substitution cipher#Homophonic substitution|homophonic cipher]] that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.

Essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi.&lt;ref name=Kadi/&gt; Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic [[Alberti Cipher Disk|cipher device]], a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the [[Vigenère cipher]], a [[polyalphabetic cipher]], encryption uses a ''key word'', which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century [[Charles Babbage]] showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to [[Kasiski examination]], but this was first published about ten years later by [[Friedrich Kasiski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrödel |first=Tobias|date=October 2008|title=Breaking Short Vigenère Ciphers |journal=[[Cryptologia]]|volume=32|issue=4|pages=334–337|doi=10.1080/01611190802336097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]] and is generally called [[Kerckhoffs's Principle]]; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by [[Claude Shannon]], the inventor of [[information theory]] and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as ''Shannon's Maxim''—'the enemy knows the system'.

Different physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of [[ancient Greece]], a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher (see image above). In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the [[grille (cryptography)|cipher grille]], which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own [[cipher disk]], [[Johannes Trithemius]]' [[tabula recta]] scheme, and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Jefferson disk|wheel cypher]] (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by [[Bazeries]] around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them [[rotor machine]]s—famously including the [[Enigma machine]] used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hakim | first = Joy | authorlink = Joy Hakim | title = A History of US: War, Peace and all that Jazz | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1995 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0195095142 | title-link = A History of US }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gannon|first=James|authorlink=James Gannon|title=Stealing Secrets, Telling Lies: How Spies and Codebreakers Helped Shape the Twentieth Century|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Brassey's|year=2001|isbn=978-1574883671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer era===
[[Cryptanalysis]] of the new mechanical devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at [[Bletchley Park]] during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitious tasks. This culminated in the development of the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first fully electronic, digital, [[computer programming|programmable]] computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's [[Lorenz SZ40/42]] machine.

Just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on [[binary numeral system|binary]] [[bit]] sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.

Extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent; it began only in the mid-1970s. In recent times, IBM personnel designed the algorithm that became the Federal (i.e., US) [[Data Encryption Standard]]; [[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]] published [[Diffie-Hellman|their key agreement algorithm]];&lt;ref name="dh2"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Whitfield|last=Diffie|authorlink=Whitfield Diffie|first2=Martin|last2=Hellman|authorlink2=Martin Hellman|title=New Directions in Cryptography|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=IT-22|issue=6|date=November 1976|pages=644–654|url=http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf|doi=10.1109/tit.1976.1055638|citeseerx=10.1.1.37.9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm was published in [[Martin Gardner]]'s ''[[Scientific American]]'' column. Following their work in 1976, it became popular to consider cryptography systems based on mathematical problems that are easy to state but have been found difficult to solve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1089|isbn=978-1579550080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, [[computer network]]s, and [[computer security]] generally. Some modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable]], such as the [[integer factorization]] or the [[discrete logarithm]] problems, so there are deep connections with [[abstract mathematics]]. There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure. The [[one-time pad]] is one, and was proven to be so by Claude Shannon. There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions. For example, the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] is secure, and some other systems, but even so proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open. In practice, these are widely used, and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers.  There are systems similar to RSA, such as one by [[Michael O. Rabin]] that are provably secure provided factoring  ''n = pq'' is impossible;  it is quite unusable in practice. The [[discrete logarithm problem]] is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure, and again, there are related, less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Cryptography: Theory and Practice'', Third Edition (Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications), 2005, by Douglas R. Stinson, Chapman and Hall/CRC&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being aware of cryptographic history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of [[brute-force attack]]s, so when specifying [[key length]]s, the required key lengths are similarly advancing.&lt;ref name="fortify"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortify.net/related/cryptographers.html|title=Minimal key lengths for symmetric ciphers to provide adequate commercial security|first1=Matt|last1=Blaze|authorlink1=Matt Blaze|first2=Whitefield|last2=Diffie|authorlink2=Whitfield Diffie|first3=Ronald L.|last3=Rivest|authorlink3=Ron Rivest|first4=Bruce|last4=Schneier|authorlink4=Bruce Schneier|first5=Tsutomu|last5=Shimomura|authorlink5=Tsutomu Shimomura|first6=Eric|last6=Thompson|first7=Michael|last7=Wiener| date=January 1996 |publisher=[[Fortify (Netscape)|Fortify]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential effects of [[quantum computing]] are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing [[post-quantum cryptography]]; the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.&lt;ref name="hac"&gt;{{cite book|first=A.J. |last=Menezes |first2=P.C. |last2=van Oorschot |first3=S.A. |last3=Vanstone |url=http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ |title=Handbook of Applied Cryptography |publisher= |isbn=978-0849385230 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307081354/http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ |archivedate=7 March 2005 |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, prior to the early 20th century, cryptography was chiefly concerned with [[language|linguistic]] and [[lexicographic code|lexicographic]] patterns. Since then the emphasis has shifted, and cryptography now makes extensive use of mathematics, including aspects of [[information theory]], [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[statistics]], [[combinatorics]], [[abstract algebra]], [[number theory]], and finite mathematics generally. Cryptography is also a branch of [[engineering]], but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition (see [[cryptographic engineering]] and [[security engineering]]); other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and [[quantum physics]] (see [[quantum cryptography]] and [[quantum computer]]).

==Modern cryptography==
The modern field of cryptography can be divided into several areas of study. The chief ones are discussed here; see [[Topics in Cryptography]] for more.

===Symmetric-key cryptography===
{{Main|Symmetric-key algorithm}}
[[File:Symmetric key encryption.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=diagram showing encrypt with a key and decrypt process|Symmetric-key cryptography, where a single key is used for encryption and decryption]]
Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.&lt;ref name="dh2"/&gt;
[[File:International Data Encryption Algorithm InfoBox Diagram.svg|thumb|alt=logic diagram showing International Data Encryption Algorithm cypher process|One round (out of 8.5) of the [[International Data Encryption Algorithm|IDEA]] cipher, used in some versions of [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] for high-speed encryption of, for instance, [[electronic mail|e-mail]]]]
Symmetric key ciphers are implemented as either [[block ciphers]] or [[stream ciphers]]. A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a stream cipher.

The [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES) and the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) are block cipher designs that have been designated [[cryptography standards]] by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted).&lt;ref name="aes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf|title=FIPS PUB 197: The official Advanced Encryption Standard|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|website=Computer Security Resource Center|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure [[triple-DES]] variant) remains quite popular; it is used across a wide range of applications, from ATM encryption&lt;ref name="atm"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Documents/LCU2004-09.pdf|title=NCUA letter to credit unions|website=[[National Credit Union Administration]]|format=PDF|date=July 2004|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[e-mail privacy]]&lt;ref name="opgp"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Open PGP Message Format|rfc=2440|website=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2440|date=November 1998|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Secure Shell|secure remote access]].&lt;ref name="ssh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/SSH.html|title=SSH|website=WindowSecurity|first=Pawel|last=Golen|date=19 July 2002|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many, even some designed by capable practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as [[FEAL]].&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt;&lt;ref name="schneierbook"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Bruce|last=Schneier|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|edition=2nd|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0471117094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream ciphers, in contrast to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the [[one-time pad]]. In a stream cipher, the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates. That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material. [[RC4]] is a widely used stream cipher; see [[:Category:Stream ciphers]].&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt; Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers; see [[Block cipher modes of operation]].

[[Cryptographic hash functions]] are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take a message of any length as input, and output a short, fixed length [[hash function|hash]], which can be used in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash. [[MD4]] is a long-used hash function that is now broken; [[MD5]], a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US [[National Security Agency]] developed the Secure Hash Algorithm series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; [[SHA-1]] is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the [[SHA-2]] family improves on SHA-1, but it isn't yet widely deployed; and the US standards authority thought it "prudent" from a security perspective to develop a new standard to "significantly improve the robustness of [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]'s overall hash algorithm toolkit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Notices|journal=[[Federal Register]]|volume=72|number=212|date=2 November 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228075550/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/FR_Notice_Nov07.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a [[NIST hash function competition|hash function design competition]] was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called [[SHA-3]], by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012 when the NIST announced that [[Keccak]] would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/csd/sha-100212.cfm|title=NIST Selects Winner of Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-3) Competition|website=Tech Beat|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|date=October 2, 2012|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.

[[Message authentication code]]s (MACs) are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value upon receipt;&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt; this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare [[Md5|digest algorithms]], and so has been thought worth the effort.

===Public-key cryptography===
{{Main|Public-key cryptography}}
[[File:Public key encryption.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=diagram of Public-key cryptography showing public key and private key|Public-key cryptography, where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.]]
[[File:TLS indicator in Firefox 34.png|thumb|250px|alt=padlock icon in the internet browser line next to the url|Padlock icon from the [[Firefox]] [[Web browser]], which indicates that [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]], a public-key cryptography system, is in use.]]
Symmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the [[key management]] necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the number of network members, which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret. The difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two communicating parties, when a [[secure channel]] does not already exist between them, also presents a [[chicken-and-egg problem]] which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

{{stack|[[File:Diffie and Hellman.jpg|thumb|alt=headshots of Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman|[[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]], authors of the first published paper on public-key cryptography.]]}}
In a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of ''public-key'' (also, more generally, called ''asymmetric key'') cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a ''public'' key and a ''private'' key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Whitfield|last=Diffie|authorlink=Whitfield Diffie|first2=Martin|last2=Hellman|authorlink2=Martin Hellman|title=Multi-user cryptographic techniques|journal=AFIPS Proceedings|volume=45|pages=109–112|date=8 June 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other (the 'public key'), even though they are necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Merkle]] was working on similar ideas at the time and encountered publication delays, and Hellman has suggested that the term used should be Diffie–Hellman–Merkle aysmmetric key cryptography.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] described public-key cryptography as "the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Kahn|title=Cryptology Goes Public|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|volume=58|number=1|date=Fall 1979|page=153|doi=10.2307/20040343|jstor=20040343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key encryption system, the ''public key'' is used for encryption, while the ''private'' or ''secret key'' is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]] protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a [[symmetric-key algorithm|shared encryption key]].&lt;ref name="dh2"/&gt;

Diffie and Hellman's publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public-key encryption system. This race was finally won in 1978 by [[Ronald Rivest]], [[Adi Shamir]], and [[Len Adleman]], whose solution has since become known as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ronald L.|last=Rivest|authorlink=Ronald L.

The Diffie–Hellman and RSA algorithms, in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high quality public-key algorithms, have been among the most widely used. Other [[:Category:Asymmetric-key algorithms|asymmetric-key algorithms]] include the [[Cramer–Shoup cryptosystem]], [[ElGamal encryption]], and various [[Elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve techniques]].{{fact|date=August 2018}}

To much surprise, a document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters ([[GCHQ]]), a British intelligence organization, revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wayner|first=Peter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/122497encrypt.html|title=British Document Outlines Early Encryption Discovery|date=24 December 1997|accessdate=2015-03-26|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, around 1970, [[James H. Ellis]] had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography. In 1973, [[Clifford Cocks]] invented a solution that essentially resembles the RSA algorithm.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/matyas/lecture/paper2.pdf|first=Clifford|last=Cocks|title=A Note on 'Non-Secret Encryption'|journal=CESG Research Report|date=20 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1974, [[Malcolm J. Williamson]] is claimed to have developed the Diffie–Hellman key exchange.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{ cite book | first=Simon | last=Singh | title=The Code Book | publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] | year=1999 | pages=279–292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Private key signing.png|thumb|250px|In this example the message is only signed and not encrypted.
1) Alice signs a message with her private key.
2) Bob can verify that Alice sent the message and that the message has not been modified.]]
Public-key cryptography can also be used for implementing [[digital signature]] schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary [[signature]]; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to [[forgery|forge]]. Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: one for ''signing'', in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for ''verification'', in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] are two of the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of [[public key infrastructure]]s and many network security schemes (e.g., [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]], many [[VPN]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="schneierbook" /&gt;

Public-key algorithms are most often based on the [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of "hard" problems, often from [[number theory]]. For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the [[integer factorization]] problem, while Diffie–Hellman and DSA are related to the [[discrete logarithm]] problem. More recently, [[elliptic curve cryptography]] has developed, a system in which security is based on number theoretic problems involving [[elliptic curve]]s. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations such as [[modular arithmetic|modular]] multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, public-key cryptosystems are commonly [[hybrid cryptosystem]]s, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm. Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used, in which a cryptographic hash function is computed, and only the resulting hash is digitally signed.&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt;

===Cryptanalysis===
{{Main|Cryptanalysis}}
[[File:Enigma.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Enigma machine typewriter keypad over many rotors in a wood box|Variants of the [[Enigma machine]], used by Germany's military and civil authorities from the late 1920s through [[World War II]], implemented a complex electro-mechanical polyalphabetic [[cipher]]. [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Breaking and reading of the Enigma cipher]] at Poland's [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]], for 7 years before the war, and subsequent decryption at [[Bletchley Park]], was important to Allied victory.&lt;ref name="kahnbook" /&gt;]]
The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.

It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at [[Bell Labs]], [[Claude Shannon]] proved that the [[one-time pad]] cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly [[Statistical randomness|random]], never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Claude|last=Shannon|first2=Warren|last2=Weaver|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|year=1963|isbn=978-0252725487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[cipher]]s, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by [[brute force attack]], but the amount of effort needed may be [[exponential time|exponentially]] dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required (i.e., "work factor", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher.

There are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. In a [[ciphertext-only attack]], Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a [[known-plaintext attack]], Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a [[chosen-plaintext attack]], Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is [[gardening (cryptanalysis)|gardening]], used by the British during WWII. In a [[chosen-ciphertext attack]], Eve may be able to ''choose'' ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts.&lt;ref name="hac" /&gt; Finally in a [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] attack Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it to the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www8.cs.umu.se/education/examina/Rapporter/MattiasEriksson.pdf|title = An Example of a Man-in-the-middle Attack Against Server Authenticated SSL-sessions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one of the [[cryptographic protocol|protocols]] involved; see [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma]] for some historical examples of this).
[[File:2008-09 Kaiserschloss Kryptologen.JPG|thumb|alt=Kaiserschloss Kryptologen monument numbers on stele|[[Poznań]] monument (''center'') to Polish cryptologists whose breaking of Germany's Enigma machine ciphers, beginning in 1932, altered the course of World War II]]
Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 2&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a [[linear cryptanalysis]] attack against DES requires 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; known plaintexts and approximately 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; DES operations.&lt;ref name="junod"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Pascal|last=Junod|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22094/http:zSzzSzeprint.iacr.orgzSz2001zSz056.pdf/junod01complexity.pdf|title=On the Complexity of Matsui's Attack|journal=[[Selected Areas in Cryptography]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks.

Public-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of these is [[integer factorization]] (e.g., the RSA algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring), but the [[discrete logarithm]] problem is also important. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time). For instance, the best known algorithms for solving the [[elliptic curve cryptography|elliptic curve-based]] version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming than the best known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. Thus, other things being equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance, factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s.

While pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called ''[[side-channel attack]]s''. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, he may be able to use a [[timing attack]] to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as [[traffic analysis]]&lt;ref name="SWT"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Dawn|last=Song|first2=David A.|last2=Wagner|authorlink2=David A. Wagner|first3=Xuqing|last3=Tian|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/22094/http:zSzzSzeprint.iacr.orgzSz2001zSz056.pdf/junod01complexity.pdf|title=Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on SSH|journal=Tenth USENIX Security Symposium|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues. [[social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] and other attacks against the personnel who work with cryptosystems or the messages they handle (e.g., [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[blackmail]], [[espionage]], [[torture]], ...) may be the most productive attacks of all.

===Cryptographic primitives===
Much of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns [[cryptographic primitive|cryptographic ''primitives'']]—algorithms with basic cryptographic properties—and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called ''cryptosystems'' or ''cryptographic protocols'', which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note however, that the distinction between cryptographic ''primitives'' and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include [[pseudorandom function]]s, [[one-way function]]s, etc.

===Cryptosystems===
One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or ''cryptosystem''. Cryptosystems (e.g., [[ElGamal encryption|El-Gamal encryption]]) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)]] security in the [[random oracle model]]). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system's security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected [[backup]] data). Such cryptosystems are sometimes called ''[[cryptographic protocol]]s''.

Some widely known cryptosystems include [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA encryption]], [[Schnorr signature]], [[ElGamal encryption|El-Gamal encryption]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], etc. More complex cryptosystems include [[electronic cash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=S. |last=Brands |url=http://ftp.se.kde.org/pub/security/docs/ecash/crypto93.ps.gz |title=Untraceable Off-line Cash in Wallets with Observers |journal=Advances in Cryptology—Proceedings of CRYPTO |year=1994 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214409/http://ftp.se.kde.org/pub/security/docs/ecash/crypto93.ps.gz |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; systems, [[signcryption]] systems, etc. Some more 'theoretical' cryptosystems include [[interactive proof system]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=László|last=Babai|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=22192|title=Trading group theory for randomness|journal=Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computing|pages=421–429|year=1985|doi=10.1145/22145.22192|isbn=978-0897911511|citeseerx=10.1.1.130.3397}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like [[zero-knowledge proof]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=Shafi Goldwasser|first=S.|last=Goldwasser|authorlink2=Silvio Micali|first2=S.|last2=Micali|authorlink3=Charles Rackoff|first3=C.|last3=Rackoff|title=The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof Systems|journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume=18|number=1|pages=186–208|year=1989|doi=10.1137/0218012|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4002}}&lt;/ref&gt; systems for [[secret sharing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=George Blakley|first=G.|last=Blakley|title=Safeguarding cryptographic keys|journal=Proceedings of AFIPS 1979|volume=48|pages=313–317|date=June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A.|last=Shamir|title=How to share a secret|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=22|issue=11|pages=612–613|year=1979|doi=10.1145/359168.359176}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Until recently{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} most security properties of most cryptosystems were demonstrated using empirical techniques or using ad hoc reasoning. Recently{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} there has been considerable effort to develop formal techniques for establishing the security of cryptosystems; this has been generally called ''[[provable security]]''. The general idea of provable security is to give arguments about the computational difficulty needed to compromise some security aspect of the cryptosystem (i.e., to any adversary).

The study of how best to implement and integrate cryptography in software applications is itself a distinct field (see [[Cryptographic engineering]] and [[Security engineering]]).

==Legal issues==
{{See also|Cryptography laws in different nations}}

===Prohibitions===
Cryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]].&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt; Secret communications may be criminal or even [[treason]]ous {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--it is not clear how secure communication might be construed as treason--&gt;. Because of its facilitation of [[privacy]], and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition, cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters. Accordingly, there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography, especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high quality cryptography possible.

In some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, [[France]] significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran]], a license is still required to use cryptography.&lt;ref name="cryptolaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cryptolaw.org/cls2.htm |title=Overview per country|website=Crypto Law Survey|date=February 2013|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography. Among the more restrictive are laws in [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Singapore]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/cryptographic-policies-countries.htm|title=6.5.1 What Are the Cryptographic Policies of Some Countries?|publisher=[[RSA Laboratories]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], cryptography is legal for domestic use, but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography.&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt; One particularly important issue has been the [[export of cryptography]] and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in [[World War II]] and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of cryptography. After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the [[United States Munitions List]].&lt;ref name="cyberlaw"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Cryptography &amp; Speech|last=Rosenoer|first=Jonathan|website=CyberLaw|date=1995}}&lt;br /&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201184530/http://www.cyberlaw.com/cylw1095.html |date=1 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the development of the [[personal computer]], asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the [[Internet]], this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.

===Export controls===
{{Main|Export of cryptography}}
In the 1990s, there were several challenges to US export regulation of cryptography. After the [[source code]] for [[Philip Zimmermann]]'s [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) encryption program found its way onto the Internet in June 1991, a complaint by [[RSA Security]] (then called RSA Data Security, Inc.) resulted in a lengthy criminal investigation of Zimmermann by the US Customs Service and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], though no charges were ever filed.&lt;ref name="zim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieee-security.org/Cipher/Newsbriefs/1996/960214.zimmerman.html|title=Case Closed on Zimmermann PGP Investigation|website=[[IEEE Computer Society]]'s Technical Committee on Security and Privacy|date=14 February 1996|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levybook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Levy |title=Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government—Saving Privacy in the Digital Age |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0140244328 |page=56 |oclc=244148644}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], then a graduate student at [[UC Berkeley]], brought a lawsuit against the US government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on [[1st Amendment|free speech]] grounds. The 1995 case [[Bernstein v. United States]] ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as [[freedom of speech|free speech]] by the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name="b v us"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bernstein v USDOJ|url=http://www.epic.org/crypto/export_controls/bernstein_decision_9_cir.html|publisher=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]|website=[[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]|date=6 May 1999|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, thirty-nine countries signed the [[Wassenaar Arrangement]], an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and "dual-use" technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled.&lt;ref name="wa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulations-docs/445-category-5-part-2-information-security/file|format=PDF|title=Dual-use List – Category 5 – Part 2 – "Information Security"|website=[[Wassenaar Arrangement]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=.4 United States Cryptography Export/Import Laws|website=[[RSA Laboratories]]|url=http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/united-states-cryptography-export-import.htm|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-[[Export of cryptography|exported]] mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the [[Internet]] include US-sourced [[web browser]]s such as [[Firefox]] or [[Internet Explorer]], almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via [[Transport Layer Security]]). The [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[Microsoft Outlook]] [[E-mail client]] programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive email encrypted with [[S/MIME]]. Many Internet users don't realize that their basic application software contains such extensive [[cryptosystem]]s. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally don't find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===NSA involvement===
[[File:National Security Agency headquarters, Fort Meade, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland]]
{{See also|Clipper chip}}
Another contentious issue connected to cryptography in the United States is the influence of the [[National Security Agency]] on cipher development and policy.&lt;ref name="RangerSteve1"/&gt; The NSA was involved with the design of [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] during its development at [[IBM]] and its consideration by the [[National Bureau of Standards]] as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography.&lt;ref name="cryptogram"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0006.html#DES|title=The Data Encryption Standard (DES)|authorlink=Bruce Schneier|first=Bruce|last=Schneier|website=Crypto-Gram|date=15 June 2000|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DES was designed to be resistant to [[differential cryptanalysis]],&lt;ref name="coppersmith-des"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Coppersmith| first = D.|date=May 1994| title = The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its strength against attacks| journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development| volume = 38| issue = 3| pages = 243–250| url = http://domino.watson.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/0/94f78816c77fc77885256bfa0067fb98?OpenDocument| format = PDF| doi = 10.1147/rd.383.0243|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authorlink=Eli Biham|first=E.|last=Biham|first2=A.|last2=Shamir|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/K54H077NP8714058.pdf|format=PDF|title=Differential cryptanalysis of DES-like cryptosystems|journal=Journal of Cryptology|volume=4|number=1|pages=3–72|year=1991|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.1007/bf00630563}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Steven Levy]], IBM discovered differential cryptanalysis,&lt;ref name="levybook"/&gt; but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.

Another instance of the NSA's involvement was the 1993 [[Clipper chip]] affair, an encryption microchip intended to be part of the [[Capstone (cryptography)|Capstone]] cryptography-control initiative. Clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons. The cipher algorithm (called [[Skipjack (cipher)|Skipjack]]) was then classified (declassified in 1998, long after the Clipper initiative lapsed). The classified cipher caused concerns that the NSA had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts. The whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of [[Kerckhoffs's Principle]], as the scheme included a special [[key escrow|escrow key]] held by the government for use by law enforcement, for example in wiretaps.&lt;ref name="levybook"/&gt;

===Digital rights management===
{{Main|Digital rights management}}
Cryptography is central to digital rights management (DRM), a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of [[copyright]]ed material, being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders. In 1998, [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), which criminalized all production, dissemination, and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology (now known or later discovered); specifically, those that could be used to circumvent DRM technological schemes.&lt;ref name="DMCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |website=[[United States Copyright Office]]|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that ''any'' cryptanalytic research violated, or might violate, the DMCA. Similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions, including the implementation in the [[Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society|EU Copyright Directive]]. Similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] member-states.

The [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] have not enforced the DMCA as rigorously as had been feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. [[Niels Ferguson]], a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated that he will not release some of his research into an [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Censorship in action: why I don't publish my HDCP results|last=Ferguson|first=Niels|date=15 August 2001}}&lt;br /&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011201184919/http://www.macfergus.com/niels/dmca/cia.html |date=1 December 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryptanalyst [[Bruce Schneier]] has argued that the DMCA encourages [[vendor lock-in]], while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2001/08/arrest_of_computer_r.html |title=Arrest of Computer Researcher Is Arrest of First Amendment Rights |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |publisher=InternetWeek |date=2001-08-06 |accessdate=2017-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Alan Cox]] (longtime [[Linux kernel]] developer) and [[Edward Felten]] (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. [[Dmitry Sklyarov]] was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]] content scrambling were [[AACS encryption key controversy|discovered and released onto the Internet]]. In both cases, the [[MPAA]] sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash&lt;ref name="AACS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2007/05/02/digg-users-revolt-ov.html|title=Digg users revolt over AACS key|accessdate=26 March 2015|date=2 May 2007|first=Cory|last=Doctorow|website=[[Boing Boing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on [[fair use]] and [[free speech]].

===Forced disclosure of encryption keys===
{{Main|Key disclosure law}}
In the United Kingdom, the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]] gives UK police the powers to force suspects to decrypt files or hand over passwords that protect encryption keys. Failure to comply is an offense in its own right, punishable on conviction by a two-year jail sentence or up to five years in cases involving national security.&lt;ref name="UK law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/137881/uk_data_encryption_disclosure_law_takes_effect.html |title=UK Data Encryption Disclosure Law Takes Effect |website=[[PC World]] |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful prosecutions have occurred under the Act; the first, in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/11/ripa_iii_figures/ |title=Two convicted for refusal to decrypt data|first=Christopher|last=Williams |website=[[The Register]] |date=11 August 2009|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a term of 13 months' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/24/ripa_jfl/ |title=UK jails schizophrenic for refusal to decrypt files|first=Christopher|last=Williams |website=[[The Register]] |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar forced disclosure laws in Australia, Finland, France, and India compel individual suspects under investigation to hand over encryption keys or passwords during a criminal investigation.

In the United States, the federal criminal case of [[United States v. Fricosu]] addressed whether a search warrant can compel a person to reveal an [[encryption]] [[passphrase]] or password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19669803 |title=Password case reframes Fifth Amendment rights in context of digital world |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=January 4, 2012 |first=John |last=Ingold |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) argued that this is a violation of the protection from self-incrimination given by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leyden |first=John |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/13/eff_piles_in_against_forced_decryption/ |title=US court test for rights not to hand over crypto keys |website=[[The Register]] |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the court ruled that under the [[All Writs Act]], the defendant was required to produce an unencrypted hard drive for the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Order Granting Application under the All Writs Act Requiring Defendant Fricosu to Assist in the Execution of Previously Issued Search Warrants|publisher=[[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]]|url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/01/decrypt.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, the legal status of forced disclosure remains unclear.

The 2016 [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]] concerns the ability of courts in the United States to compel manufacturers' assistance in unlocking cell phones whose contents are cryptographically protected.

As a potential counter-measure to forced disclosure some cryptographic software supports [[plausible deniability]], where the encrypted data is indistinguishable from unused random data (for example such as that of a [[Data remanence|drive which has been securely wiped]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Dialogue''', in fiction, is a verbal exchange between two or more characters. If there is only ''one'' character talking aloud, it is a [[monologue]].

==Identifiers==
''"This breakfast is making me sick," George said.''

The ''George said'' is the identifier. ''Said'' is the [[verb]] most writers use because reader familiarity with ''said'' prevents it from drawing attention to itself. Although other verbs such as ''ask'', ''shout'', or ''reply'' are acceptable, some identifiers get in the reader's way. For example:

''"Hello," he croaked nervously, "my name's Horace."''&lt;br&gt;
''"What's yours?" he asked with as much aplomb as he could muster.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
another example is:
"My name is Peg, what's yours?" I asked.
"My name is William, but my friends call me Will," said Will.

[[Stephen King]], in his book ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'', expresses his belief that ''said'' is the best identifier to use. King recommends reading a novel by [[Larry McMurtry]], who he claims has mastered the art of well-written dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|King|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitutes are known as ''said-bookisms''. For example, in the sentence ''"What do you mean?" he smiled.'', the word ''smiled'' is a said-bookism.

The '''Foundation for Teaching Economics''' (FTE) is an organization founded in 1975 that promotes [[economics education]] by hosting free workshops for high school students and teachers, and by providing educational resources to teachers.

==History==
The organization was established in 1975 by [[Jaquelin H. Hume]], the co-founder of [[Basic American Foods]], the world's largest producer of dried onion and garlic as well as dried potato products (used primarily for [[instant mash potatoes]]).&lt;ref name="brucelambert"&gt;Bruce Lambert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/04/nyregion/jaquelin-hume-86-dried-food-producer-and-philanthropist.html Jaquelin Hume, 86, Dried Fruit Producer and Philanthropist], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 04, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-10-06/news/9103310403_1_mr-hume-dehydrated-potatoes-ronald-reagan-presidential-foundation Food Processing Pioneer Jack Hume], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 06, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princetonalumni"&gt;[http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/70/4/index.xml Jaquelin Holliday Hume '28] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305190630/http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/70/4/index.xml |date=2016-03-05 }}, ''Princeton Alumni Weekly'', January 22, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes the teaching of economics in elementary and high schools in the United States.&lt;ref name="brucelambert"/&gt;

As of 2009, Jaquelin H. Hume's two sons [[William J. Hume]] and [[George H. Hume]] served on the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name="fte"&gt;[http://www.fte.org/about-the-fte/board-of-trustees/ Foundation for Teaching Economics: Board of Trustees]&lt;/ref&gt; The other trustees were [[Orley Ashenfelter]], a Professor of Economics at [[Princeton University]]; Arthur J.

Landry, an attorney; John Manfredi, an investor; [[Douglass North]], the 1993 winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]; [[Vernon L. Smith]], the 2002 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences; and Christopher A. Wright, an investor.&lt;ref name="fte"/&gt;

'''Functional illiteracy''' is [[reading (activity)|reading]] and [[writing]] skills that are inadequate "to manage daily living and employment tasks that require reading skills beyond a basic level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schlechty |first=Phillip C. |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/wiley031/00009570.pdf |format=Pdf |title=Shaking Up the Schoolhouse: How to Support and Sustain Educational Innovation |publisher=Catdir.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional illiteracy is contrasted with [[illiterate|illiteracy]] in the strict sense, meaning the inability to read or write simple sentences in any language.

Foreigners who cannot read and write in the native language where they live may also be considered functionally illiterate.

==Definition==
Illiteracy as well as functional illiteracy were defined on the 20th session of UNESCO in 1978 as follows:

{{quotation | A person is illiterate who cannot with understanding both read and write a short simple statement on his everyday life.

A person is functionally illiterate who cannot engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of his group and community and also for enabling him to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his own and the community’s development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001140/114032E.pdf|title=Records of the 20th General Conference of UNESCO: Resolutions|year=1978|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The characteristics of functional illiteracy vary from one culture to another, as some cultures require better reading and writing skills than others.  A reading level that might be sufficient to make a farmer functionally literate in a rural area of a developing country might qualify as functional illiteracy in an urban area of a technologically advanced country. In languages with [[phonemic orthography|regular spelling]], functional illiteracy is usually defined simply as reading too slow for practical use, inability to effectively use dictionaries and written manuals, etc.

==Links with poverty and crime==
In developed countries, the level of functional literacy of an individual is proportional to income level and inversely proportional to the risk of committing crime. For example, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics in the United States:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/2006483.pdf|title=The Health Literacy of America’s Adults|publisher=[[United States Department of Education]]|format=PDF|year=2006|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over 60% of adults in the US prison system read at or below the fourth grade level
* 85% of US juvenile inmates are functionally illiterate
* 43% of adults at the lowest level of literacy lived below the poverty line, as opposed to 4% of those with the highest levels of literacy.

According to begintoread.com:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.begintoread.com/research/literacystatistics.html|title=Literacy Statistics|publisher=BegintoRead.com|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two-thirds of students who cannot read proficiently by the fourth grade will end up in jail or on welfare.
* Three out of four individuals who receive [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] read on the two lowest levels of literacy.
* 16-to-19-year-old girls at the poverty line and below with below-average reading skills are 6 times more likely to have out-of-wedlock children than their more literate counterparts.

==Prevalence==
In the United States, according to ''Business'' magazine, an estimated 15 million functionally illiterate adults held jobs at the beginning of the 21st century. The [[American Council of Life Insurers]] reported that 75% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies provide some level of remedial training for their workers. All over the U.S.A. 30 million (14% of adults) are unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/naal/kf_demographics.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) - Demographics - Overall |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Center for Education Statistics provides more detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/datafiles.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) - Data Files from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy is broken down into three parameters: prose, document, and quantitative literacy. Each parameter has four levels: below basic, basic, intermediate, and proficient.  For prose literacy, for example, a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information, while a person who is below basic in quantitative literacy would be able to do simple addition. In the US, 14% of the adult population is at the "below basic" level for prose literacy; 12% are at the "below basic" level for document literacy; and 22% are at that level for quantitative literacy. Only 13% of the population is proficient in these three areas—able to compare viewpoints in two editorials; interpret a table about blood pressure, age, and physical activity; or compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items.

The UK government's Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47% of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional mathematics, and 42% fail to achieve a basic level of functional English.{{not in citation given|date=May 2018}} Every year, 100,000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kirsty Scott |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/egweekly/story/0,,2122125,00.html |title=Sounds incredible |publisher=Education.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Russia, where more than 99% percent of the population is technically literate, only one third of high school graduates can comprehend the content of scientific and literary texts, according to a 2015 study.&lt;ref name="NKJ201506"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ludmila|last=Yasukova|url=https://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/26453/ | title=Illiteracy — why? (In Russian) |publisher=''Nauka i Zhizn'' (Science and Life) |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research findings==
A Literacy at Work study, published by the Northeast Institute in 2001, found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity, errors, and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy.

[[Sociology|Sociological]] research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of [[scientific literacy]] among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies. This correspondence suggests that the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship contributes to a society's level of civic literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sase.org/conf2001/papers/milner_henry.pdf SASE - Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629215446/http://www.sase.org/conf2001/papers/milner_henry.pdf |date=2006-06-29 }} — Civic Literacy: How Informed Citizens Make Democracy Work Henry Milner, Umeå University and Université Laval, accessed May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4735">The '''Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL)''' is a spatial database of the [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world. It is a project of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]]. 

==Mission==
The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable geographic information on [[country subdivision|administrative units]] for all the [[country|countries]] in the world, thereby contributing to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. In this framework, its purposes are:

* to overcome the fragmentation of the global dataset occurring when administrative units layers are digitized on a country-by-country basis
* to keep historical track of changes occurring on the shapes and extent of the administrative units
* to promote a unified [[georeference|coding]] system that reduces maintenance efforts.

==Characteristics==
The GAUL always maintains global geographic layers (in [[shapefile]] format) with a unified coding system at the levels of country, first administrative (e.g. regions), and second administrative (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country-by-country basis down to third, fourth and lower levels. The target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, universities, and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. 

Because the GAUL works at global level, controversial [[border|boundaries]] can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain [[territorial dispute|disputed]] areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries.

The coastline of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by the UN Cartographic Section except for some countries (e.g. [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. [[Landsat program|Landsat]] ETM). For future releases of the GAUL, the process of updating the coastline will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.

The GAUL keeps track of administrative units that have been changed, added, or deleted in the past. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named the '''GAUL Set'''. The GAUL project does not implement changes dated before 1990.

GAUL codes are numeric and unique for all administrative units at any of the administrative hierarchical level. Any GAUL code is independent from the codes of its higher administrative levels. GAUL codes assigned to administrative units of a given country are not necessarily sequential numbers. The main benefit of the GAUL Coding System is that changing in the codes of an administrative unit might not imply a change of codes of the correspondent units at lower levels. This means that the effort to maintain the links between thematic data and associated administrative units is reduced to a minimum.

==Organization==
The implementation of the GAUL initiative is based on a collaborative work among international agencies and national authorities generating and collecting spatial information on administrative units. The role of FAO is to keep this network of collaborators active, to evaluate and compile data from available sources, to establish procedures for data integration, to generate the GAUL codes and periodically to disseminate the GAUL Set. The overall methodology consists in:

# collecting the best available data from most reliable sources
# establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible)
# adding selected data to the global layer based on the international boundaries provided by the UN Cartographic Unit
# generating codes using the GAUL Coding System
# distributing data to the users

The GAUL has a consistent framework for the delivery of the data. Once a year, an updated version of the GAUL set is released through [http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/ Geonetwork].  A new version includes all updates made in the course of the previous year. The dataset is free of charge and it can be downloaded by login (to receive an account, just send an email to the contacts listed at the bottom of this article). The new version GAUL 2009 will be available on Geonetwork from January 2009.

'''Hans Jonas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|oʊ|n|æ|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈjoːnas|lang}}; 10 May 1903&amp;nbsp;– 5 February 1993) was a [[Germany|German]]-born American Jewish philosopher, from 1955 to 1976 the Alvin Johnson Professor of Philosophy at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Hans Jonas' birth house in Moenchengladbach.JPG|thumb|Birth house of Hans Jonas in Mönchengladbach.]]
[[Image:Moenchengladbach Stolpersteine Mozartstrasse.jpg|thumb|In front of the house, two [[Stolpersteine]] were installed in 2008. The left one commemorates the philosopher's mother Rosa Jonas, murdered in Auschwitz in 1942.]]

Jonas was born in [[Mönchengladbach]], on 10 May 1903. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]], and finally earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1928 from the [[University of Marburg]]&lt;ref name="W"&gt;H. Jonas, "''Wissenschaft'' as Personal Experience," ''The Hastings Center report'' 32:4 (Jul–Aug 2002), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; with a thesis on [[Gnosticism]] entitled ''Der Begriff der Gnosis'' (''The Concept of [[Gnosis]]'') and directed by [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Wellistony C. Viana, ''Das Prinzip Verantwortung von Hans Jonas aus der Perspektive des objektiven Idealismus der Intersubjektivität von Vittorio Hösle'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2010, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; During his study years his academic advisors included [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Rudolf Bultmann]].&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; In Marburg he met [[Hannah Arendt]], who was also pursuing her PhD there, and the two of them were to remain friends for the rest of their lives.

Heidegger joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933, which may have disturbed Jonas, as he was Jewish and an active [[Zionist]].  Certainly, in 1964 Jonas would repudiate his mentor Heidegger, for his affiliation with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/06/nyregion/hans-jonas-influential-philosopher-is-dead-at-89.html Hans Jonas, Influential Philosopher, Is Dead at 89], [[The New York Times]], Eric Pace, 6 February 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
He left Germany for [[England]] in 1933, and from England he moved to Palestine in 1934. There he met [[Lore Weiner]], to whom he became betrothed. In 1940 he returned to Europe to join the [[British Army]] which had been arranging a special brigade for German Jews wanting to fight against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (See ''[[Jewish Brigade|The Jewish Brigade]]''). He was sent to [[Italy]], and in the last phase of the war moved into Germany. Thus, he kept his promise that he would return only as a soldier in the victorious army. In this time he wrote several letters to Lore about philosophy, in particular philosophy of biology, that would form the basis of his later publications on the subject. They finally married in 1943.

Immediately after the war he returned to Mönchengladbach to search for his mother but found that she had been sent to the gas chambers in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Having heard this, he refused to live in Germany again. He returned to Palestine and took part in Israel's [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war of independence]] in 1948. Jonas taught briefly at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] before moving to North America. In 1950 he left for [[Canada]], teaching at [[Carleton University]]. From there he moved in 1955 to [[New York City]], where he was to live for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the Hastings Center and Professor of Philosophy at [[New School for Social Research]] from 1955 to 1976 (where he was Alvin Johnson Professor). From 1982 to 1983 Jonas held the [[Eric Voegelin]] Visiting Professorship at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rEu61KIK6FYC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=voegelin+hans+jonas&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zU6iNo95S3&amp;sig=URhgwghOXKgP8Hbo0pK0H5LAo-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA168,M1 ''The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin: Selected Correspondence, 1950-1984''], University of Missouri Press, 2007, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York, on 5 February 1993, aged 89.&lt;ref&gt;

==Works==

Jonas's writings were very influential in different spheres. For example, ''The Gnostic Religion'', based on his early research on the Gnosis and first published in 1958, was for many years the standard work in English on the subject of [[Gnosticism]]. ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' ([[German language|German]] 1979, [[English language|English]] 1984) centers on social and ethical problems created by [[technology]]. Jonas insists that human survival depends on our efforts to care for our planet and its future. He formulated a new and distinctive supreme principle of morality: "Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life".

While ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' has been credited with catalyzing the environmental movement in Germany, his work ''The Phenomenon of Life'' (1966) forms the philosophical undergirding of one major school of [[bioethics]] in America. [[Murray Bookchin]] and [[Leon Kass]] both referred to Hans Jonas's work as major, or primary, inspiration. Heavily influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]], ''The Phenomenon of Life'' attempts to synthesize the philosophy of matter with the philosophy of mind, producing a rich existential understanding of biology, which ultimately argues for a simultaneously material and moral human nature.

His writing on the history of [[Gnosticism]] revisits terrain covered by earlier standard works on the subject such as [[Ernesto Buonaiuti]]'s ''Lo gnosticismo: storia di antiche lotte religiose'' (1907), interpreting the religion from an [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophical viewpoint. He was one of the first philosophers to concern himself with ethical questions in biological science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2046">'''The Harvard Five''' was a group of architects that settled in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] in the 1940s: [[John M. Johansen]], [[Marcel Breuer]], [[Landis Gores]], [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Eliot Noyes]].  Marcel Breuer was an instructor at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], while Gores, Johansen, Johnson and Noyes were students there.&lt;ref&gt;"The Harvard Five in New Canaan", William D. Earls AIA, W. W Norton and Co., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-393-73183-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were all influenced by [[Walter Gropius]], who founded the [[Bauhaus]] in 1919, and thereafter became head of the architecture program at [[Harvard]].

The small town of New Canaan is nationally recognized for its many examples of [[modern architecture]]. Approximately 100 modern homes were built in town, including Johnson's [[Glass House]] and the [[Landis Gores House]], and about 20 have been torn down.  Four are now listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]]: the [[Landis Gores House]], the [[Richard and Geraldine Hodgson House]], the [[Philip Johnson Glass House]], and the [[Noyes House (New Canaan, Connecticut)|Noyes House]].

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Hydroelectricity''' is [[Electricity generation|electricity produced]] from [[hydropower]]. In 2015, hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]],&lt;ref name="ren21.net"&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the [[Asia-Pacific]] region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013. [[China]] is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 920 TWh of production in 2013, representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use.

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 [[megawatt]]s is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per [[kilowatt-hour]].&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and in many cases, has a considerably lower output level of [[greenhouse gas]]es than [[fossil fuel]] powered energy plants.&lt;ref name="REN21-2011"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR2011_FINAL.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower], ''[[REN21]]'', published 2011, accessed 2016-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the mid-1770s, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late 19th century, the [[electrical generator]] was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]], England by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]]. It was used to power a single [[arc lamp]] in his art gallery.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The old [[Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station#Origins|Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1]] near [[Niagara Falls]] in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first [[Thomas Alva Edison|Edison]] hydroelectric power station, the [[Vulcan Street Plant]], began operating September 30, 1882, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/darvill/altenerg/hydro.htm|title= Hydroelectric power - energy from falling water|publisher=Clara.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the U.S. and Canada. By 1889 there were 200 in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="doehis"/&gt;

[[File:Warwick Castle - Engine House, Waterwheel, Weir, and Old Castle Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Warwick Castle]] water-powered generator house, used for the generation of electricity for the castle from 1894 until 1940]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. [[Grenoble]], France held the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] with over one million visitors. By 1920 as 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the [[Federal Power Act]] was enacted into law. The Act created the [[Federal Power Commission]] to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes to include [[flood control]], [[irrigation]] and [[navigable|navigation]]. Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (1933) and the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] (1937) were created.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] which had begun a series of western U.S. irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 [[Boulder Canyon Project Act|Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder Canyon Project Act|url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|date=December 21, 1928|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142851/http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was also involved in hydroelectric development, completing the [[Bonneville Dam]] in 1937 and being recognized by the [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] as the premier federal flood control agency.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;[http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936, Joseph L.

Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower was referred to as ''white coal'' for its power and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Book of Knowledge|volume=Vol. 9|page=3220|edition=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoover Dam]]'s initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/otherside/sights/hoover.html|title=Hoover Dam and Lake Mead|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Itaipu Dam]] opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including [[Norway]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Brazil]], with over 85% of their electricity. The United States currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4% of its total electrical production output, which is 49% of its renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt;

==Future potential==
The technical potential for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. 
The political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A few countries are highly developed and have very little room for growth, Switzerland 12% and Mexico 20%.

==Generating methods==

[[File:Hydroelectric dam.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Cross section of a conventional hydroelectric dam.]]

[[File:Water turbine - edit1.svg|thumb|A typical [[Water turbine|turbine]] and [[electrical generator|generator]]]]

===Conventional (dams)===
{{See also|List of conventional hydroelectric power stations}}

Most hydroelectric power comes from the [[potential energy]] of [[dam]]med water driving a [[water turbine]] and [[electric generator|generator]]. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow. This height difference is called the [[head (hydraulic)|head]]. A large pipe (the "[[penstock]]") delivers water from the [[reservoir]] to the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricityforum.com/hydroelectricity.html|title=hydro electricity - explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumped-storage===
{{Main article|Pumped-storage hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations}}

This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between [[reservoir]]s at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. Pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale [[grid energy storage]] and improve the daily [[capacity factor]] of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a negative number in listings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained Pumped Storage, Explained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231233454/http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Run-of-the-river===
{{Main article|Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of run-of-the-river hydroelectric power stations}}

Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river. In the United States, run of the river hydropower could potentially provide {{convert|60000|MW}} (about 13.7% of total use in 2011 if continuously available).&lt;!--total use in 2011 was 3841 billion kWh from Annual Energy Outlook http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/er/ --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/run-of-the-river-hydropower-goes-with-the-flow|title=Run-of-the-River Hydropower Goes With the Flow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tide===
{{Main article|Tide power}}
{{See also|List of tidal power stations}}

A [[tidal power]] station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides; such sources are highly predictable, and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs, can also be [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] to generate power during high demand periods. Less common types of hydro schemes use water's [[kinetic energy]] or undammed sources such as undershot [[water wheel]]s. Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world. In Great Britain, there are eight sites that could be developed, which 
have the potential to generate 20% of the electricity used in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darvill.clara.net/altenerg/tidal.htm|title=Energy Resources: Tidal power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes, types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities==

=== Large facilities ===
{{See also|List of largest power stations in the world|List of largest hydroelectric power stations}}

Large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current [[List of nuclear power stations|largest nuclear power stations]].

Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred [[megawatt]]s are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities.

Currently, only four facilities over {{nowrap|10 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}} ({{nowrap|10,000 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}) are in operation worldwide, see table below.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Small===
{{Main article|Small hydro}}

Small hydro is the development of [[hydroelectric power]] on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro. This may be stretched to 25 MW and 30 MW in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 29% from 2005 to 2008, raising the total world small-hydro capacity to {{nowrap|85 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}}. Over 70% of this was in [[China]] ({{nowrap|65 GW}}), followed by [[Japan]] ({{nowrap|3.5 GW}}), the United States ({{nowrap|3 GW}}), and [[India]] ({{nowrap|2 GW}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=July 18, 2011 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production.

===Micro===
{{Main article|Micro hydro}}

Micro hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|100 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}} of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |title=Micro Hydro in the fight against poverty |publisher=Tve.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426092643/http://tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro hydro systems complement [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] solar energy systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.

===Pico===
{{Main article|Pico hydro}}

Pico hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] generation of under {{nowrap|5 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}}. It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio for a few homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|title=Pico Hydro Power|publisher=T4cd.org|accessdate=2010-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731064419/http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even smaller turbines of 200-300W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only {{Convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. A Pico-hydro setup is typically [[#Run-of-the-river|run-of-the-river]], meaning that dams are not used, but rather pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before returning it to the stream.

===Underground===
{{Main article|Underground power station}}

An [[underground power station]] is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. An underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway.[[File:Tailrace-Forebay-Limestone.JPG|thumb|Measurement of the tailrace and forebay rates at the [[Limestone Generating Station]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].]]

===Calculating available power===
{{Main article|Hydropower}}
A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is: &lt;math&gt; P = \rho hrgk &lt;/math&gt;, where
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is Power in watts,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water (~1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is height in meters,
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration due to [[gravity]] of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1. Efficiency is often higher (that is, closer to 1) with larger and more modern turbines.

Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply. In some installations, the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year.

==Properties==

===Advantages===
[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] can generate {{nowrap|360 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising.]]

====Flexibility====
Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Huggins2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Huggins|title=Energy Storage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn5y9gQeIlwC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants.&lt;ref name="SusskindRaseman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herbert Susskind|author2=Chad J. Raseman|title=Combined Hydroelectric Pumped Storage and Nuclear Power Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbu5m1Een2sC|year=1970|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bent Sørensen|title=Renewable Energy: Its Physics, Engineering, Use, Environmental Impacts, Economy, and Planning Aspects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y17FoN2VUEwC&amp;pg=PA556|year=2004|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-656153-1|pages=556–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs.&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geological Survey (U.S.)|title=Geological Survey Professional Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37dUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=1980|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004" /&gt;

====Low cost/high value power====
The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch later]] as high value clean electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to [[intermittent energy source]]s.

Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf Hydropower – A Way of Becoming Independent of Fossil Energy?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528070938/http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.

Where a dam serves multiple purposes, a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the [[Three Gorges Dam]] will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |title=Beyond Three Gorges in China |publisher=Waterpowermagazine.com |date=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050746/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.&lt;ref&gt;(http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2406852), Should We Build More Large Dams? The Actual Costs of Hydropower Megaproject Development, Energy Policy, March 2014, pp. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suitability for industrial applications====
While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific [[industry|industrial]] enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for [[aluminium]] electrolytic plants, for example. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] switched to support [[Alcoa]] aluminium in [[Bellingham, Washington]], [[United States]] for American [[World War II]] airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In [[Suriname]], the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] was constructed to provide electricity for the [[Alcoa]] aluminium industry. [[New Zealand]]'s [[Manapouri Power Station]] was constructed to supply electricity to the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Comalco|Tiwai Point]].

====Reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions====
Since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel, power generation does not produce [[carbon dioxide]].  While carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project, and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs, hydro in specific nordic cases, has the lowest [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions]] for power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions pg19&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to fossil fuels generating an equivalent amount of electricity, hydro displaced three billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/subtopics/hydropower/&lt;/ref&gt; One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] and the [[University of Stuttgart]] which was funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="ExternEFTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |title=Final Technical Report, Version 2 |author=Rabl A. et. al. |date=August 2005 |work=Externalities of Energy: Extension of Accounting Framework and Policy Applications |publisher=European Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307120342/http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study, hydroelectricity in Europe produces the least amount of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[externality]] of any energy source.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format)|year=2005|publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]])|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101201452/http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=|work=ExternE-Pol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming in second place was [[wind energy|wind]], third was [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and fourth was [[solar energy|solar]] [[photovoltaic]].&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"/&gt; The low [[greenhouse gas]] impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in [[temperate climate]]s. The above study was for local energy in [[Europe]]; presumably similar conditions prevail in North America and Northern Asia, which all see a regular, natural freeze/thaw cycle (with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth). Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of [[methane]] than those in temperate areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n9/full/ngeo1226.html|title=Climate science: Renewable but not carbon-free|first=Bernhard|last=Wehrli|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=4|issue=9|pages=585–586|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/ngeo1226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other uses of the reservoir====
Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for [[List of water sports|water sports]], and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, [[aquaculture]] in reservoirs is common. [[Multipurpose reservoir|Multi-use dams]] installed for [[irrigation]] support [[agriculture]] with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project.&lt;ref name="Water: Science and Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkins|first=William|title=Hydroelectric Power|journal=Water: Science and Issues|year=2003|volume=2|pages=187–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
{{see also|Renewable energy debate#Disadvantages of hydroelectricity}}

====Ecosystem damage and loss of land====
[[File:MeroweDam01.jpg|thumb|[[Merowe Dam]] in [[Sudan]]. Hydroelectric power stations that use [[dam]]s submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a [[reservoir]]. These changes to land color or [[albedo]], alongside certain projects that concurrently submerge rainforests, can in these specific cases, result in the global warming impact, or equivalent [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse gases]] of hydroelectricity projects, to exceed that of coal power stations.]]

Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; The loss of land is often exacerbated by [[habitat fragmentation]] of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Paul|title=Hydropower|journal=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society|year=2007|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic [[ecosystem]]s both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/node/1476|title=Sedimentation Problems with Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.

====Water loss by evaporation====
A 2011 study by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that hydroelectric plants in the U.S. consumed between 1,425 and 18,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour (gal/MWh) of electricity generated, through evaporation losses in the reservoir. The median loss was 4,491 gal/MWh, which is higher than the loss for generation technologies that use cooling towers, including concentrating solar power (865 gal/MWh for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWh for CSP tower), coal (687 gal/MWh), nuclear (672 gal/MWh), and natural gas (198 gal/MWh). Where there are multiple uses of reservoirs such as water supply, recreation, and flood control,  all reservoir evaporation is attributed to power production.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siltation and flow shortage====
When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. [[Siltation]] can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrick James|first=H Chansen|title=Teaching Case Studies in Reservoir Siltation and Catchment Erosion|url=http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|publisher=TEMPUS Publications|location=Great Britain|pages=265–275|year=1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902184753/http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Șentürk|first=Fuat|title=Hydraulics of dams and reservoirs|year=1994|publisher=Water Resources Publications|location=Highlands Ranch, Colo.|isbn=0-918334-80-2|edition=reference.|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=September 20, 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; One study from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; [[Brazil]] in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

====Methane emissions (from reservoirs)====
[[File:Hoover Dam Nevada Luftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] in the [[United States]] is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility, with an installed capacity of {{nowrap|2,080 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}.]]

{{See also|Environmental impacts of reservoirs}}

Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of [[methane]]. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment, and forming methane, a [[greenhouse gas]]. According to the [[World Commission on Dams]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dams.org/report/|title=WCD Findal Report|publisher=Dams.org|date=2000-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821120709/http://www.dams.org/report/|archivedate=2013-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046|title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed|publisher=Newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boreal forest|boreal]] reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, however, [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emissions]] are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/2006/12/01/rediscovered-wood-the-triton-sawfish/#more-1973|title="Rediscovered" Wood &amp; The Triton Sawfish|publisher=Inhabitat|date=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relocation====
Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/way-forward/world-commission-dams/world-commission-dams-framework-brief-introduction|title=Briefing of World Commission on Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Failure risks====
{{See also|Dam failure|List of hydroelectric power station failures}}

Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure.

During Typhoon Nina in 1975 [[Banqiao Dam]] failed in Southern China when more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours. The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless.

The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy, where almost 2,000 people died.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;References may be found in the list of [[Dam failure]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malpasset Dam]] failure in [[Fréjus]] on the [[French Riviera]] (Côte d'Azur), southern France, collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_french/malpasset/malpasset.htm retrieved 02sep2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller dams and [[micro hydro]] facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small earthen embankment [[Kelly Barnes Dam]] failed in 1977, twenty years after its power station was decommissioned; causing 39 deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/news/historical-toccoa/ Toccoa Flood] USGS Historical Site, retrieved 02sep2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison and interactions with other methods of power generation===
Hydroelectricity eliminates the [[flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion]], including pollutants such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the [[coal]]. Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of [[coal mining]] and the indirect health effects of coal emissions.

====Nuclear power====

Compared to [[nuclear power]], hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint, and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The creation of [[Garrison Dam]], for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Michael L. (1982). ''Dammed Indians: the Pick-Sloan Plan and the Missouri River Sioux, 1944–1980''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, nuclear power is relatively inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for [[baseload]]. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for [[load following]]. Country examples were they are paired in a close to 50/50 share include [[Electricity sector in Switzerland|the electric grid in Switzerland]],  the [[Electricity sector in Sweden]] and to a lesser extent, [[Energy in Ukraine#Electricity|Ukraine]] and the [[Electricity sector in Finland]].

====Wind power====

[[Wind power]] goes through predictable [[Variable renewable energy|variation]] by season, but is [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] on a daily basis. Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption, the wind may peak at night when power isn't needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest. Occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time, a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid. Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower. In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power. Conversely, in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons.

In areas that do not have hydropower, [[pumped storage]] serves a similar role, but at a much higher cost and 20% lower efficiency. An example of this is [[Electricity sector in Norway|Norway's trading]] with [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and possibly [[Germany]] or the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sintef.no/en/latest-news/norway-is-europes-cheapest-battery/&lt;/ref&gt; Norway is 98% hydropower, while it's flatland neighbors are installing wind power.

==World hydroelectric capacity==
[[File:Ren2008.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|World renewable energy share (2008)]]

[[File:Top 5 Hydropower-Producing Countries.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in the top five hydroelectricity-producing countries]]

{{See also|List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|Cost of electricity by source}}
{{See also|Category:Hydroelectricity by country}}

The ranking of hydro-electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="ren21.net"/&gt;
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generated 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Paraguay]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Venezuela]] have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power. [[Paraguay]] produces 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, and exports 90% of its production to Brazil and to Argentina. [[Norway]] produces 98–99% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources.&lt;ref name=norway/&gt;

A hydro-electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year; the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the [[capacity factor]].

The '''Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR)''' is an organization founded in 1987 by [[Heidi Hartmann]] to meet the need for [[women]]-centered, policy-oriented research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=10903&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was co-founded by current IWPR President Heidi Hartmann in 1986. IWPR has informed policy by putting relevant, high quality facts in the hands of thousands of local leaders and advocates, increasing their ability to shape and implement legislation that benefits women and their families. IWPR has published hundreds of reports, fact sheets, and research-in-briefs that place women as the central point of analysis. The research serves as a reliable resource to policymakers, providing background and context for present and future policy agendas impacting women in the United States and around the world. IWPR’s research addresses issues of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In addition, IWPR research focuses specifically on policies that help or hurt women in their efforts to achieve social, economic, and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwpr.org/about/history&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Areas==
===Employment, Economic Change &amp; Education===
IWPR examines the quality of jobs across a diverse range of workers and job types as well as produces research that explores access to employment benefits.

On average, women earn less than men in virtually every single occupation for which there is sufficient data for both men and women to calculate an earnings ratio. IWPR tracks the gender wage gap over time. Given the existing gender wage gap, educational attainment is especially crucial for women, as women need more education to reach the same average income levels as men.

===Democracy and Society===
IWPR seeks to identify successful strategies to encourage women’s participation in civic and political life by analyzing data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels.

===Poverty, Welfare and Income Security===
Around the world, research shows that women tend to be in poverty at greater rates than men. IWPR has served as a resource on women’s poverty issues by producing research on income security and suggesting improvements to planning and policies that take into consideration the welfare of women.

===Work and Family===
For most Americans, work and family go hand in hand. Early care and education programs are crucial to a thriving economy, not only because they allow parents to work, but because the child care sector is large and purchases numerous goods and services. IWPR aims to improve access to child care, measure workplace flexibility and determine whether the defining characteristics of a good job are being implemented in American society.

===Health and Safety===
Women have specific concerns when it comes to health. More often than not, women make the majority of health care-related decisions regarding health issues for their families, are the primary caregivers, and spend more than their male counterparts on health (KFF 2009; Agency for 2004). IWPR’s research on women’s health and safety informs policy decisions by identifying gender and racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes and access to health care services in addition to highlighting opportunities for improvement.

==IWPR Projects and Initiatives==
===Status of Women in the States Reports=== 
IWPR has analyzed data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels, including demographics, economic security, educational attainment, reproductive rights, political participation, civic engagement, and access to health care and work support in order to publish a collection of comprehensive reports. Each report offers policy recommendations shaped by the research findings for that state, city or area.

===Women and Social Security===
Women are more likely to rely on Social Security because they have fewer alternative sources of income, often outlive their husbands, and are more likely to be left to rear children when their husbands die or become disabled. Specifically, adult women are 57 percent of all social security beneficiaries aged 65 and older. IWPR produces and disseminates materials to keep women involved on the ongoing Social Security debate and to ensure that women’s concerns are addressed when or if any changes to the system take place.

===Student Parent Success Initiative=== 
The Student Parent Success Initiative focuses on supporting students with dependent children who are pursuing college education. Funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the project gives IWPR the opportunity to initiate new research and foster communication and collaboration among advocates, policymakers, and practitioners invested in the success of student parents in postsecondary education.

Intellipedia uses [[MediaWiki]], the same software used by the [[Wikipedia]] free-content encyclopedia project.&lt;ref name="National Defense Magazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2006/November/Pages/SecurityBeat2819.aspx?PF=1 |title=Wikipedia for Intel Officers Proves Useful |work=National Defense Magazine |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IvkVRnyJ?url=http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2006/November/Pages/SecurityBeat2819.aspx?PF=1 |archivedate=2013-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary of mainstream ''Wikipedia'', its intelligence analogue encourages editing that incorporates personal points of view regardless of rank as it was decided that, "much of the self-corrective knowledge in the Intelligence Community resides in personal points of view," and that, "not all good ideas originate at the top."&lt;ref name="D. Calvin Andrus" /&gt;

The Secret version connected to SIPRNet predominantly serves [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] personnel, many of whom do not use the Top Secret JWICS network on a day-to-day basis. Users on unclassified networks can access Intellipedia from remote terminals outside their workspaces via a [[VPN]], in addition to their normal workstations. [[Open Source Intelligence]] (OSINT) users share information on the unclassified Intelink-U wiki.

==History==
Intellipedia was created to share information on some of the most difficult subjects facing U.S. intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce.&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2006-11-02-intellipedia_x.htm |title=Over 3,600 intelligence professionals tapping into Intellipedia |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=Associated Press |first=Katherine |last=Shrader |date=2006-02-11 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows information to be assembled and reviewed by a wide variety of sources and agencies, to address concerns that pre-war intelligence did not include robust dissenting opinions on Iraq's alleged weapons programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartbrief.com/alchemy/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=53427FBF-AE22-4442-B244-C4E7C872397A&amp;lmid=archives "Data from spies now assembled wiki-style"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products. In the summer of 2006, Intellipedia was the main collaboration tool in constructing a [[National Intelligence Estimate]] on [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;Bruce Finley, [http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_4216851 "Intelligence Fixes Floated at Conference," ''Denver Post'', 08/22/2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellipedia was at least partially inspired by a paper written for the [[Galileo Award]] (an essay competition set up by the CIA, later taken over by the DNI), which encouraged any employee at any intelligence agency to submit new ideas to improve information sharing. The first essay selected was by [[Calvin Andrus]], chief technology officer of the Center for Mission Innovation at the CIA, entitled "The Wiki and the Blog: Toward a Complex Adaptive Intelligence Community". Andrus' essay argued that the real power of the Internet had come from the boom in self-publishing, and noted how the open-door policy of [[Wikipedia]] allowed it to cover new subjects quickly.&lt;ref name="D. Calvin Andrus"&gt;D. Calvin Andrus, Ph.D. Office of Application Services, Central Intelligence Agency. [http://www.acadac.net/wiki/images/a/af/SSRN-id755904.pdf The wiki and the blog: Toward a complex adaptive intelligence community], ''Studies in Intelligence'', Volume 49, Number 3, September 2005. Published on the Web as, {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Wik_and_%20Blog_7.htm |title=The wiki and the blog: Toward a complex adaptive intelligence community|author=D. Calvin Andrus |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency Center for the Study of Intelligence |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/magazine/03intelligence.html |title=Open-Source Spying |author=Clive Thompson |work=The New York Times Magazine|date=2006-12-03|accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard A. Russell, Deputy Assistant [[Director of National Intelligence]] for [[Information Sharing Customer Outreach (ISCO)]] said it was created so "analysts in different agencies that work X or Y can go in and see what other people are doing on subject X or Y and actually add in their two cents worth ... or documents that they have. ... What we're after here is 'decision superiority', not 'information superiority'. ... We have to get inside the decision cycle of the enemy. We have to be able to discover what they're doing and respond to it effectively."&lt;ref name="National Defense Magazine" /&gt;

In September 2007, sixteen months after its creation, officials noted that the top-secret version of Intellipedia alone (hosted on [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System|JWICS]]) has 29,255 articles, with an average of 114 new articles and more than 6,000 edits to articles added each workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Shane|title=Logged In and Sharing Gossip, Er, Intelligence|date=September 2, 2007|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/weekinreview/02shane.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2009, the overall Intellipedia project hosted 900,000 pages edited by 100,000 users, with 5,000 page edits per day.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1890084,00.html |title=Wikipedia for Spies: The CIA Discovers Web 2.0 |work=Time |date=2009-04-08 |accessdate=2009-04-09 |first=Massimo |last=Calabresi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2014, Intellipedia contained around 269,000 articles&lt;ref&gt;Kaven Waddel. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/the-governments-secret-wiki-for-intelligence/518508/?google_editors_picks=true The Government’s Secret Wiki for Intelligence: Analysts reportedly tucked classified information about Russian hacking inside Intellipedia for safekeeping,] ''The Atlantic,'' March 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Top Secret Intellipedia counting 113,000 content pages with 255,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=jasonsmathers|url=https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/intellipedia-usage-statistics-10058/|title=FOIA request for Intellipedia usage statistics|publisher=MuckRock|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===10 years later===
A 2017 two-part ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' series on Intellipedia and next steps reported that after 10 years of usage Intellipedia helped the IC get caught up to "Web 2.0" but never reformed how official reports were created like [[National Intelligence Estimate]]s. A more official version of Intellipedia called the Living Intelligence System was created after the fact and focused on collaboratively writing official reports. It failed to catch on because each agency has a different process for writing official, classified reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2017/03/intellipedia-wikipedia-spies-much/ The Wikipedia for Spies and Where It Goes From Here], Wired, March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the lessons learned from Intellipedia and the Living Intelligence System, a pilot program within the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency created the Tearline apps focused on writing official collaborative reports in the less bureaucratic space of unclassified content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2017/04/american-spies-now-smartphone-app/ American Spies Now Have Their Own Smartphone App], Wired, April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential problems==
Some are concerned that individual intelligence agencies will create their own wikis, draining ideas and input from Intellipedia.&lt;ref name="Intellipedia Discussion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/11/intellipedia.html#comment-25336444|title=Intellipedia - Marginal REVOLUTION|date=2 November 2006|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Dennehy, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] official involved in integrating the system into the intelligence fabric, said disseminating material to the widest possible audience of analysts is key to avoiding mistakes. He said analysts from multiple agencies had used the network to post frequent updates on recent events, including [[2006 New York City plane crash|the crash of a small plane into a New York City apartment building in October 2006]] and [[2006 North Korean missile test|North Korea's test of a missile in July 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/people/michael_wertheimer/|title=Intellipedia Roundtable Discussion|website=esenai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some view it as risky because it allows more information to be viewed and shared;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esenai.com/blog/intellipedia/|title=U.S. intelligence unveils spy version of Wikipedia|website=esenai.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Michael Wertheimer]], [[John Michael McConnell|McConnell's]] assistant deputy director for analysis, it is worth the risk. The project was greeted initially with "a lot of resistance," said Wertheimer, because it runs counter to past practice which sought to limit the pooling of information.&lt;ref name="metimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20061103-075107-4557r|title=US spies create their own 'Wiki' intelligence|website=metimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said there are risks in everything everyone does: "the key is risk management, not risk avoidance." Some encouragement has been necessary to spur contributions from the traditional intelligence community.&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"/&gt; However, he said the system appeals to the new generation of intelligence analysts because "this is how they like to work" and "it's a new way of thinking."&lt;ref name="USAToday11_02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metimes"/&gt;

==Successes==
[[File:Intellipedia2008.png|thumb|[[2008 Mumbai attacks]] page on Intellipedia]]
[[Thomas Fingar]], [[Director of National Intelligence|Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis]] (DDNI/A), cited the successful use of Intellipedia to develop an article on how Iraqi insurgents were using [[chlorine]] in [[improvised explosive devices]] saying, "They developed it in a couple of days interacting in Intellipedia,"..."No bureaucracy, no mother-may-I, no convening meetings. They did it and it came out pretty good. That's going to continue to grow."&lt;ref&gt;[http://defensenews.com/story.php?F=2733832&amp;C=america "U.S. Intel Agencies Modernize Info Sharing", ''DefenseNews.com'', May 7, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dni.gov/speeches/20070905_speech.pdf 2007 Analytic Transformation Symposium], 6 September 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 10, 2007 testimony before the [[United States Congress]], [[John Michael McConnell|Michael McConnell]], [[Director of National Intelligence]], cited the increasing use of Intellipedia among analysts and its ability to help experts pool their knowledge, form virtual teams, and make quick assessments.&lt;ref name="10 September 2007 hearing"&gt;[http://dni.gov/testimonies/20070910_testimony.pdf Michael McConnell. "Confronting the Terrorist Threat to the Homeland: Six Years after 9/11]", ''Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee'', September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations]]'', a 2008 book by several experts in the field of intelligence analysis, cited Intellipedia as evidence of the changing nature of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Roger George, James Bruce, et al., ''Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations'', Georgtown University Press, April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Haseltine]], former ODNI Associate Director for Science and Technology said that "It's hard to overstate what [Burke and Dennehy] did . ... They made a major transformation almost overnight with no money after other programs failed to achieve these results with millions of dollars in funding."  Haseltine said intelligence analysts had "reacted 'more quickly and more intelligently' to potential terrorist threats than they would have without Intellipedia".&lt;ref name=medals/&gt;

==Community practices==
[[File:Intellipedia shovel.jpg|thumb|An Intellipedia shovel, awarded to exemplary wiki contributors.]]
The wiki provides so much flexibility that several offices throughout the community are using it to maintain and transfer knowledge on daily operations and events.&lt;ref name="Spotlight/Wilson"&gt;Executive Biz, [http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=jwilson Executive Spotlight with Jesse Wilson], October 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone with access to read it has permission to create and edit articles after registering and acquiring an account with [[Intelink]]. Since Intellipedia is intended to be a platform for harmonizing the various points of view of the agencies and analysts of the Intelligence Community, Intellipedia does not enforce a [[neutrality (philosophy)|neutral point of view]] policy.&lt;ref name="NTY Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/magazine/03intelligence.html?ex=1322802000&amp;en=46027e63d79046ce&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|title=Open-Source Spying|work=New York Times Magazine|date=December 2006|accessdate=2006-12-03 |first=Clive |last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, viewpoints are attributed to the agencies, offices, and individuals participating, with the hope that a consensus view will emerge. Intellipedia also contains a great deal of non-encyclopedic content including meeting notes and items of internal, administrative interest. Deputy DNI [[Thomas Fingar]] made a comparison to [[eBay]], the auction Web site where the reliability of sellers is rated by buyers. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intellipedia. It's been written up. It's the Wikipedia on a classified network, with one very important difference: it's not anonymous. We want people to establish a reputation. If you're really good, we want people to know you're good. If you're making contributions, we want that known. If you're an idiot, we want that known too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/15754/intelligence_reform_rush_transcript_federal_news_service.html|title=Intelligence Reform [Rush Transcript; Federal News Service]|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mazzetti |last=Mark |title=Intelligence Chief Announces Renewed Plan for Overhaul |date=April 12, 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/washington/12intel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During 2006–2007, Intellipedia editors awarded symbolic ''shovels'' to users to distinguish exemplary Wiki ''gardening'' and to encourage others in the community to contribute. A template with a picture of the limited-edition shovel (actually a trowel), was created to place on user pages for Intellipedians to show their ''gardening'' status. The handle bears the imprint: "I dig Intellipedia! It's wiki wiki, Baby." The idea was inspired by the [[Wikipedia:Barnstars|barnstar]],&lt;ref name="eekim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eekim.com/blog/2006/09/27/intellipediashovel |title=EEK Speaks |work=Eugene Eric Kim's Blog |accessdate=2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used on both [[Wikipedia:Barnstars|Wikipedia]] and [[MeatballWiki]] for similar purposes. The shovels have since been replaced with a mug bearing the tag line, "Intellipedia: it's what we know".

Different agencies have experimented with other ways of encouraging participation. For example, at the CIA, managers have held contests for best pages with prizes such as free dinners.&lt;ref name="web2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9096658&amp;pageNumber=1 |title=CIA, Pfizer, Wachovia and Sony execs suggest options for adopting Web 2.0 |author=Heather Havenstein |publisher=Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Rasmussen, knowledge management officer at the Defense Department's [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), argues that "gimmicks" like the Intellipedia shovel, posters, and handbills, encourage people to use [[Web 2.0]] tools like Intellipedia and are effective low-tech solutions to promote their use. Also, Rasmussen argues that "[[social software]]–based contributions should be written in an employee's performance plan".&lt;ref name="FCW"&gt;"[http://www.fcw.com/print/13_16/news/102750-1.html Government taps the power of us: Officials turn to blogs and wikis to share information and achieve goals]", ''Federal Computer Week'', May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training===
Several agencies in the Intelligence community, most notably the CIA and NGA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.executivebiz.com/web20-adoption-in-large-enterprises/|title=Web2.0 Adoption in Large Enterprises|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed training programs to provide time to integrate social software tools into analysts' daily work habits. These classes generally focus on the use of Intellipedia to capture and manage knowledge, but they also incorporate the use of the other social software tools. These include [[blog]]s, [[RSS]], and social bookmarking. The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia. The courses also expose participants to social media technologies on the Internet.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;[http://www.federalnewsradio.com/?sid=1286296&amp;nid=250 Radio interview] that highlights Intelligence Community social software training programs, Federal News Radio, November 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sean d"&gt;[http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=sdennehy Executive Spotlight Interview with Sean Dennehy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206042130/http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=sdennehy |date=2008-12-06 }}, ExecutiveBiz, December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chris R"&gt;[http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=crasmussen Executive Spotlight Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204094209/http://www.executivebiz.com/newsletter-executives-detail.php?who=crasmussen |date=2008-12-04 }} with Chris Rasmussen, ExecutiveBiz, October 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2009, Don Burke and Sean P. Dennehy, two of the originators of Intellipedia, were awarded with the "Homeland Security Service to America Medal" by the [[Partnership for Public Service]]. The award noted that they "Promoted information sharing across the intelligence community through the development and implementation of Intellipedia, a Wikipedia-like clearinghouse of intelligence expertise."&lt;ref name=medals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://servicetoamericamedals.org/honorees/view_profile.php?profile=215|title=2009 'Service to America Medal Recipients' |accessdate=2010-01-05 |publisher=[[Service to America Medals]] |date=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''Interdisciplinary Telecommunications Program''' (its acronym is '''ITP''') is a part of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] and offers graduate degrees in [[telecommunications]]: a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and [[Master of Science]] in Telecommunications and a [[Master of Engineering]] in Telecommunications.  It is the oldest telecommunications program in the United States and was founded in 1971 by Frank S. Barnes (Engineering) and George Codding (deceased, International Relations).  Since its inception, ITP has taken an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to telecommunications, involving the study of [[engineering]], [[law]], [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[business]].  Over the course of the past 35 years, ITP has graduated approximately 2,000 [[alumni]] who are in various positions around the world as [[CEO]]s, government officials, and management.

In 2004, ITP founder Frank S. Barnes was awarded the prestigious [[Gordon Prize]] for having founded ITP due to its innovative character and the influence that it has had within academia and industry.  As the first program of its kind in the United States, it broke ground for the many academic programs that followed. When [[Peterson's]] first started listing telecommunications programs in 1996, the director of ITP was asked to write the introduction on the topic for Peterson's publisher.  There is no question that many other prominent university programs have been directly influenced by ITP.  For further information, there is now a consortium of universities that teach the telecommunications discipline, known as [[ITERA]].

Students may participate in the program through either full-time academic study on campus or by participating in a distance-education platform.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4065">The '''International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation''' is an interdisciplinary English-language [[master's degree]] program offered at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]].  

== History ==
The International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation, founded in October 2009, teaches students from around the world the fundamentals of conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="References"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/studying-conflict-resolution-living-the-conflict-1.364744 'Studying conflict resolution, living the conflict', Profile of the International Program, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Consisting of three consecutive semesters, the International Program aims to provide students with the insight and skills needed to address the assessment, management, and resolution of conflicts in the international arena.

The first semester exposes students to a comprehensive survey of conflicts and their resolution from diverse perspectives, including international law, psychology, political science, anthropology and economics. The second and third semesters gives students the chance to choose from a variety of courses according to their interests. Throughout the semesters, special focus is placed on combining practical experience to the theoretical knowledge through interactive teaching, culminating in the intensive mediation workshop taught in smaller groups and through simulations.

Academic trips are planned throughout the year, visiting various sites around Israel in conjunction with the curriculum. In addition, speakers from the United Nations, the [[Israeli Foreign Ministry]], embassies, NGOs and visiting professors are invited each week to share their experiences and research, and provide students with professional networking opportunities.

Courses reflect the relevant in the field of conflict resolution, in addition to the resources in Israel and the Middle East: core courses on Middle East History and Israeli politics; framing coursework to focus on international approaches; and offering a greater variety of interdisciplinary elective courses.

Courses are taught in the afternoon, four days per week, allowing students to pursue volunteering and internship opportunities, as well as language courses in [[Hebrew]] and colloquial [[Arabic]].

Know Risk aims to reduce the level of underinsurance and non-insurance for individuals and small businesses across all classes of insurance while improving general knowledge and risk management planning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eldersinsurance.com.au/about-elders/know-risk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knowrisk.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:KnowRisk250.png|thumbnail|Know Risk logo]]

==History==
Know Risk was developed following a series of natural disasters that affected Australia and New Zealand during the 2000s. Events such as the [[Black Saturday bushfires]], the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|Christchurch earthquakes]], [[Cyclone Yasi]] and the [[2010-11 Queensland floods|extensive flooding]] that blanketed Australia resulted in the tragic loss of both life and property. In many cases, those affected were underinsured, or not insured at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Darren |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/black-saturday-cost-44-billion-20100801-11116.html |title=Black Saturday cost $4.4 billion |website=Theage.com.au |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Know Risk aims to counter this issue and improve community resilience.

Know Risk was conceived in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anziif.com/~/media/files/pdfs/about%20pdfs/media%20releases/2011%20the%20institute%20launches%20the%20know%20risk%20network.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Institute launches the Know Risk Network |website=ANZIIF.com |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched with Insurance Tracker on 12 June 2013 by The Hon Bill Shorten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://billshorten.com.au/launch-of-anziif-%E2%80%98know-risk%E2%80%99-initiative |title=Launch Of ANZIIF ‘Know Risk’ Initiative « |website=Billshorten.com.au |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2015-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208064007/http://billshorten.com.au/launch-of-anziif-%E2%80%98know-risk%E2%80%99-initiative |archivedate=2015-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korean sculpture''' has a long history.

==Ancient Sculpture==
Korean sculpture was exported abroad, primarily during the [[Baekje]] period, to [[Japan]], where [[Korean Buddhist sculpture]]s from the seventh century still exist. Main Korean sculptures were generally made of wood, then later stone, and then ceramics, with votive sculptures being the greatest in  number. Smaller sculptures were also made using jade, gold and other metals. The greatest Korean sculptures were produced in the time of [[Korean Buddhist art]].

==Modern Sculpture==
A modern sculpture project that can be mentioned is ''[[Greetingman]]'', by [[Yoo Young-ho]].&lt;!-- Please read the article --&gt;

'''Malcolm L. McCallum''' (born December 26, 1968 in Maywood, Illinois&lt;ref&gt;Birth Announcements. Joliet Herald News. January 3, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American [[environmental scientist]], [[conservation biology|conservationist]], [[herpetologist]], and [[natural historian]] and is known for his work on the [[Holocene extinction|Holocene Extinction]]. He is also a co-founder of the herpetology journal, ''[[Herpetological Conservation and Biology]]''.&lt;ref name="herpconbio.org"&gt;[http://www.herpconbio.org/volume_1/issue_1/Bury_et_al._2006.pdf Bury, RB, ML McCallum, SE Trauth, and RA Saumure. 2006.

==Education, research, teaching and service==
In 1997 his discovery of deformed frogs in Madison County, Illinois&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilacadofsci.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/092-24MS9831-print.pdf McCallum, M.L.  1999.

He also organized and edited the First International Symposium on the conservation and sustainability of the ornamental fish industry on Rio Negro River, Manaus.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, M.L. (Editor). Proceedings of the First International Conference on Biodiversity and Sustainability of the Rio Negro Basin Brazil.  Mid-America Aquacenter Publications.

Many of his early papers were focused on [[natural history]], but they also cover amphibian conservation, ecological immunology, and general biology.  He is widely published on the life history and conservation of [[Blanchard's cricket frog]] (''[[Acris crepitans blanchardi|Acris blanchardi]]'' ) with papers on its systematics, immunology, behavior, life history, and conservation needs.  He earned the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[Environmental Science]] from [[Arkansas State University]], specializing in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[conservation biology|conservation ecology]].  He continued this research as an Assistant Professor at [[Louisiana State University at Shreveport]] from 2003–2005.

McCallum used [[fuzzy logic]] in his paper, ''Amphibian decline or extinction? Current losses dwarf background extinction rates'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first= M.L. |year=2007|title= Amphibian decline or extinction?

His calculations demonstrated that the losses in amphibian biodiversity in recent times represented one of the most rapid losses in biodiversity ever observed. In 2008 the study was listed by ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' as #4 among ten "landmark papers" on the topic of [[Decline in amphibian populations|amphibian extinctions and declines]].&lt;ref name=Discover10studies/&gt;  His use of fuzzy approaches was extended to two studies addressing climate change impacts on herpetofauna.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=lOHMjvYAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=lOHMjvYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC McCallum, M.L., J.L.

'''Medical resident work hours''' refers to the (often lengthy) shifts worked by [[medical intern]]s and residents during their [[medical residency]].

As per ACGME residents are allowed to work a max of 80hours a week. so typically residents will work 40-80  hours a week depends on speciality and rotation within the speciality ,&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents occasionally logging 136 (out of 168) hours in a week.&lt;ref name=HRG&gt;[http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310201116/http://www.internetfreespeech.org/print_article.cfm?ID=6666 |date=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that about 40% of this work is not direct patient care, but ancillary care, such as paperwork.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Trainee doctors are often not paid on an hourly basis, but on a fixed salary; in some locations, they are paid for booked overtime. Limits on working hours have led to misreporting, where the resident works more hours than they record.&lt;ref name="dishonesty" /&gt;

Medical resident work hours have become a hot topic of discussion due to the potential negative results of sleep deprivation on both residents and their patients. According to a study of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, 71.3% reported sleeping less than 3 hours while on night call.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Defoe, Deidre M., et al. "Long Hours and Little Sleep: Work Schedules of Residents in Obstetrics and Gynecology." ''Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology'', vol. 97, no. 6, June 2001, pp. 1015–18. ''ScienceDirect'', doi:10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01363-1.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 3604 first- and second-year residents, 20% reported sleeping an average of 5 hours or less per night, and 66% averaged 6 hours or less per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=DeWitt C.|last2=Daugherty|first2=Steven R.|date=2004-03-01|title=Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue in Residency Training: Results of a National Survey of First- and Second-Year Residents|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/27/2/217/2708402|journal=Sleep|volume=27|issue=2|pages=217–223|doi=10.1093/sleep/27.2.217|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of high workloads ==
Medical residencies usually require lengthy hours of trainees. Trainees are traditionally required to be present for set shifts, with the ending time of the shift dependent on momentary circumstances. The flexibility of this system makes it easy to abuse.

Junior doctors often lack bargaining power and have difficulty changing employers. This leaves them with little say over their working conditions. Critics of long residency hours note that resident physicians in the US [[National Resident Matching Program#Controversy and lawsuits|have no alternatives to the position that they are matched to]], meaning residents must accept all conditions of employment, including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision.&lt;ref name="HRG"/&gt;  This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours. The Match program has also been [[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges|accused of deliberately limiting the available residency posts]], thus reducing the [[demand (economics)|demand]] for residents, despite the work for much larger numbers of residents being available.

In emergencies and in chronically understaffed health systems, all staff, including junior doctors, may be overworked. In some cases, excess work may be disproportionately assigned to junior doctors.

There are financial incentives for overworking junior doctors. Since the least-experienced staff are usually paid less, it is cheaper to assign paid overtime to them. Deliberate understaffing and paid or unpaid overtime for junior doctors is thus used to reduce costs for medical facilities, although this may also reduce quality of care, which can be expensive.

The medical culture has also been blamed. "Generation-bashing", where senior doctors look down on junior doctors who work fewer residency hours than they did, can push junior doctors to overwork.&lt;ref name=schultz/&gt; A desire for formal recognition, such as promotion, may also be important.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt; A higher "entry barrier", with work conditions poor enough to burn out some residents, may be actively desired.

There is also a belief that long hours do, or can, improve training. The ability to follow a patient from admission through the next 30 or 40 hours may be valued more than observing several patients for shorter periods.

The desire to continue caring for a patient frequently leads doctors to work for longer than is permitted.&lt;ref name=dishonesty/&gt;

==Effects on health==

===Effects of sleep deprivation on residents===
The evidence for harm to people who are deprived of sleep, or work irregular hours, is robust.

Research from Europe and the United States on nonstandard work hours and sleep deprivation found that late-hour workers are subject to higher risks of gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight of their newborns.&lt;ref&gt;See Biological Rhythms: Implications for the Worker, publication OTA-BA-463 (U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, 1991); {{cite journal | author = Bøggild Henrik, Knutsson Anders | year = 1999 | title = Shift Work, Risk Factors, and Cardiovascular Disease | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work and Environmental Health | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 85–99 | doi=10.5271/sjweh.410}}; and Alexander Wedderburn (ed.), "Shiftwork and Health," special issue of the Bulletin of European Studies on Time (BEST), vol. 1 (Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2000), on the Internet at www.eurofound.ie, (visited Feb. 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that slow-wave sleep assists in clearing out toxins that build up during the day. Consequently, the disruption of slow-wave sleep increases the level of amyloid-beta, a protein aggregate commonly found in Alzheimer's, present in cerebrospinal fluid the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Yo-El S|last2=Ooms|first2=Sharon J|last3=Sutphen|first3=Courtney|last4=Macauley|first4=Shannon L.|last5=Zangrilli|first5=Margaret A.|last6=Jerome|first6=Gina|last7=Fagan|first7=Anne M.|last8=Mignot|first8=Emmanuel|last9=Zempel|first9=John M.|date=2017-08-01|title=Slow wave sleep disruption increases cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/8/2104/3933862|journal=Brain|volume=140|issue=8|pages=2104–2111|doi=10.1093/brain/awx148|issn=0006-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic sleep deprivation and the resulting fatigue and stress can affect job productivity and the incidence of workplace accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kauppinen |first=Timo |year=2001 |title=The 24-Hour Society and Industrial Relations Strategies |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=European Industrial Relations Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also social effects. Married fathers in the United States who work fixed night shifts are 6 times more likely than their counterparts who work days to face divorce; for married mothers, fixed nights increase the odds by a factor of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Presser |first=Harriet B. |year=2003 |title=Working in a 24/7 Economy: Challenges for American Families |location=New York |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of resident sleep deprivation on patients===
The public and the medical education establishment recognize that long hours can be counter-productive, since [[sleep deprivation]] increases rates of [[medical error]]s and affect [[Sleep deprivation#On attention and working memory|attention and working memory]]. Chronically sleep-deprived people also tend to strongly underestimate their degree of impairment.&lt;ref name="SleepDepPVT"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Dongen HA |title=The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness: dose-response effects on neurobehavioral functions and sleep physiology from chronic sleep restriction and total sleep deprivation |journal=Sleep |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=117–26 |year= 2002 |url=http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/FactSheets/DrowsyDriving.pdf |pmid=12683469|last2=Maislin |first2=G |last3=Mullington |first3=JM |last4=Dinges |first4=DF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness, hand-eye coordination decreased to a level equal to the performance observed at a blood alcohol concentration of roughly 0.10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Drew|last2=Reid|first2=Kathryn|date=July 1997|title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/40775|journal=Nature|volume=388|issue=6639|pages=235–235|doi=10.1038/40775|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a meta-analysis of 959 physicians, staying awake for a continuous 24 to 30 hours decreased physicians' overall performance by nearly 1 standard deviation and clinical performance by more than 1.5 standard deviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philibert|first=Ingrid|date=2005-11-01|title=Sleep Loss and Performance in Residents and Nonphysicians: A Meta-Analytic Examination|url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/28/11/1392/2707966|journal=Sleep|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1392–1402|doi=10.1093/sleep/28.11.1392|issn=0161-8105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schedule details matter. Competence is affected by the number of work hours, number of continuous work hours, regularity of sleep, and frequency and speed of handovers to the next shift. "Night float" seems to have particularly bad effects, due to the circadian misalignment cause by abrupt switches between day and night shifts, but is the most commonly used method of adapting to duty hour restrictions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1| issn = 1949-8357| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 349–363| last1 = Bolster| first1 = Lauren| last2 = Rourke| first2 = Liam| title = The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review| journal = Journal of Graduate Medical Education| date = 2015| pmid = 26457139| pmc = 4597944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=float&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/0014013031000085671| issn = 0014-0139| volume = 46| issue = 7| pages = 653–663| last1 = CAVALLO| first1 = ANITA| last2 = RIS| first2 = M.

Many studies have found performance impairment in medical residents due to sleep deprivation. The average sleep time was less for the same emergency department residents working night shifts than when working day shifts, and they took longer to intubate a mannequin and made more errors in a triage simulation when working on the night shift than the day shift.&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Coggins R, Rosekind MR, Buccino KR.

A 2004 landmark study found reducing sleep deprivation substantially reduced errors in intensive care units. The study redesigned first-year junior doctors' schedules to minimize the effects of sleep deprivation, circadian disruption, and handover problems, assigning four shifts where there had been three and allowing an hour's overlap for handovers at the ends of shifts. Each junior doctor was closely observed under both schedules. Errors were recorded (and corrected); they were then rated for severity by other doctors [[blind experiment|blinded]] to which treatment the errors had occurred under. Doctors and observers inevitably knew that they were part of a study.&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

In 2015 two controlled studies of the effect of the ACGME-mandated maximum shift began, involving nearly 190 hospitals and residency training programs. The studies randomly assigned medical residents to shifts longer than specified by the ACGME regulations. A study led by the University of Pennsylvania, which will end in 2019, assigned residents in 32 medical training programs to shifts as long as 30 hours. It used 31 other programs as a control group. Despite the longer shifts, the other overall rules were still adhered to. The other study, led by Northwestern University and ending in 2015, was similar in design. Both were conducted with the approval of the ACGME. In neither study were residents and patients necessarily told they were part of a human subjects experiment and informed consent was not required, which caused some controversy.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some new doctors are working 30-hour shifts at hospitals around the U.S. |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 28, 2015 |last=Bernstein |first=Lenny |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/some-new-doctors-are-working-30-hour-shifts-at-hospitals-around-the-us/2015/10/28/ab7e8948-7b83-11e5-beba-927fd8634498_story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trib19Nov2015"&gt;{{cite news |title=Northwestern-led study of medical residents working 28-hour shifts decried |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=November 19, 2015 |last=Russell |first=John |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-northwestern-long-hours-1119-biz-20151119-story.html |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Duty hour restrictions ==
===Effects of duty hour restrictions===
Regulatory duty hour restrictions, in theory, should reduce the number of duty hours worked. In practice, they may not&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;{{Cite web| title = Medical Residents Work Long Hours Despite Rules| work = NPR.org| accessdate = 2016-05-06| url = https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/12/04/166477987/medical-residents-work-long-hours-despite-rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|problems]]. Studies to evaluate the effects of duty hour restrictions on patient outcomes have been somewhat mixed.

Many of the studies rely on self-reported hours, self-reported errors, and self-reported sleep deprivation, with large opportunities for bias. More objective measures, such as tracking, perceptual tests, and blood hormone levels, are generally not used. Measurements of patient deaths and harm are often used as response variables. Many of the studies that have been done on this topic are specialty specific and so cannot be generalized to all medical residency programs.

===Observations on the ACGME restrictions in US===
The 2003 working-hour restrictions imposed in the US by the [[ACGME]] allowed many studies comparing patient outcomes before and after the reforms. They generally show little effect. This corresponds to the impressions of medical staff.

One 2014 systematic review of 135 studies spanning 1980 to 2013 showed no overall improvement in patient safety but still indicated that duty hour restrictions have increased morbidity in some cases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Najma|last2=Devitt|first2=Katharine S.|last3=Keshet|first3=Itay|last4=Spicer|first4=Jonathan|last5=Imrie|first5=Kevin|last6=Feldman|first6=Liane|last7=Cools-Lartigue|first7=Jonathan|last8=Kayssi|first8=Ahmed|last9=Lipsman|first9=Nir|date=2014-06-01|title=A systematic review of the effects of resident duty hour restrictions in surgery: impact on resident wellness, training, and patient outcomes|journal=Annals of Surgery|volume=259|issue=6|pages=1041–1053|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000000595|issn=1528-1140|pmc=4047317|pmid=24662409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another systematic review of 27 studies conducted in 2015 found similar results, and a 2007 study of over 8 million hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries that compared mortality rate before and after implementation of the ACGME standards showed no difference in mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolster|first=Lauren|last2=Rourke|first2=Liam|date=2015-09-01|title=The Effect of Restricting Residents' Duty Hours on Patient Safety, Resident Well-Being, and Resident Education: An Updated Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=7|issue=3|pages=349–363|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-14-00612.1|issn=1949-8357|pmc=4597944|pmid=26457139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Wang|first6=Yanli|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=975–983|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.975|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 reform===
One study of 318,636 patients done in a Veterans Administration setting showed that work hour restrictions reduced mortality substantially for a similar set of diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpp|first=Kevin G.|last2=Rosen|first2=Amy K.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Paul R.|last4=Romano|first4=Patrick S.|last5=Even-Shoshan|first5=Orit|last6=Canamucio|first6=Anne|last7=Bellini|first7=Lisa|last8=Behringer|first8=Tiffany|last9=Silber|first9=Jeffrey H.|date=2007-09-05|title=Mortality among patients in VA hospitals in the first 2 years following ACGME resident duty hour reform|journal=JAMA|volume=298|issue=9|pages=984–992|doi=10.1001/jama.298.9.984|issn=1538-3598|pmid=17785643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that the 2003 ACGME reform restrictions were associated with a small reduction in the relative risk for death in 1,268,738 non-surgical patients drawn from a national survey of hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shetty|first=Kanaka D.|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jayanta|date=2007-07-17|title=Changes in hospital mortality associated with residency work-hour regulations|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=147|issue=2|pages=73–80|issn=1539-3704|pmid=17548403|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-2-200707170-00161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 reform===
When surveyed about duty hour restrictions, both medical and surgical residents, as well as residency faculty perceive that patient safety hasn't changed or has suffered as a result.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Srijan|last2=Kranzler|first2=Henry R.|last3=Didwania|first3=Aashish K.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Ann C.|last5=Amarnath|first5=Sudha|last6=Kolars|first6=Joseph C.|last7=Dalack|first7=Gregory W.|last8=Nichols|first8=Breck|last9=Guille|first9=Constance|date=2013-04-22|title=Effects of the 2011 duty hour reforms on interns and their patients: a prospective longitudinal cohort study|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=173|issue=8|pages=657–662; discussion 663|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.351|issn=2168-6114|pmc=4016974|pmid=23529201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Chakraborty|first2=Anindita|last3=Friedman|first3=William A.|date=2011-12-01|title=Results of a national neurosurgery resident survey on duty hour regulations|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1162–1170|doi=10.1227/NEU.0b013e3182245989|issn=1524-4040|pmid=21606883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choby|first=Beth|last2=Passmore|first2=Cindy|date=2007-06-01|title=Faculty perceptions of the ACGME resident duty hour regulations in family medicine|journal=Family Medicine|volume=39|issue=6|pages=392–398|issn=0742-3225|pmid=17549647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Megha|last2=Drolet|first2=Brian C.|last3=Tammaro|first3=Dominick|last4=Fischer|first4=Staci A.|date=2014-10-01|title=Resident duty hours: a survey of internal medicine program directors|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=29|issue=10|pages=1349–1354|doi=10.1007/s11606-014-2912-z|issn=1525-1497|pmc=4175662|pmid=24913004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many residents note an increase in self-reported errors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are a number of possible explanations for these results. See [[Medical resident work hours#Problems with Duty Hour Restrictions|Problems with duty hour restrictions]].

=== Problems with duty hour restrictions ===
It is largely felt that actual duty hours (opposed to reported duty hours) have not changed substantially: prior to the implementation of work hour regulations, residents were already working an average of 82 hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Czeisler, APSS 2009 6.9.09&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies rely on self-reported hours, but significant bias to under-report duty hours exists for a few important reasons: One is that statutes do not provide whistleblower protections to residents who report work hour violations. Second, the penalty for work hour violation is loss of accreditation, which would adversely affect medical residents and prevent them from becoming board certified. Finally, some residents may be pressured by their residency programs to underreport hours&lt;ref name=dishonesty&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fargen|first=Kyle M.|last2=Rosen|first2=Charles L.|date=2013-12-01|title=Are Duty Hour Regulations Promoting a Culture of Dishonesty Among Resident Physicians?|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|volume=5|issue=4|pages=553–555|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-13-00220.1|issn=1949-8349|pmc=3886449|pmid=24454999}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even punished if they do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.169| issn = 2168-6262| volume = 148| issue = 5| pages = 427–433| last1 = Drolet| first1 = Brian C.| last2 = Sangisetty| first2 = Suma| last3 = Tracy| first3 = Thomas F.| last4 = Cioffi| first4 = William G.| title = Surgical residents' perceptions of 2011 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hour regulations| journal = JAMA Surgery| date =2013| pmid = 23677406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, these studies – particularly the ones that find favorable results - may fail to account for confounders that positively impact outcomes, including the wide adoption of electronic medical records, a shift toward team-based care, and implementation of best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jena|first=Anupam B.|last2=Prasad|first2=Vinay|date=2013-09-01|title=Duty hour reform in a shifting medical landscape|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|volume=28|issue=9|pages=1238–1240|doi=10.1007/s11606-013-2439-8|issn=1525-1497|pmc=3744286|pmid=23568191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duty hour regulations may not address the root causes of medical errors, and may inadvertently create new problems that impact patient outcomes. In order to adhere to duty-hour standards, residents must handoff their patients to other residents more frequently, which can lead to miscommunication, interrupted continuity of care and increased errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty Hours, Quality of Care, and Patient Safety: General Surgery Resident Perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1072-7515|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, most studies show that residents see more patients now, despite having less time, leading to more administrative work and less time for direct patient care and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Stuart H.|last2=Miller|first2=Robert H.|last3=Weng|first3=Cindy|last4=Gurgel|first4=Richard K.|date=2014-10-01|title=The effect of duty hour regulation on resident surgical case volume in otolaryngology|journal=Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery|volume=151|issue=4|pages=599–605|doi=10.1177/0194599814546111|issn=1097-6817|pmid=25135524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hundert|first=Samuel A.|last2=White|first2=Andrew A.|last3=Reilly|first3=Dominic F.|date=2015-08-01|title=Number of General Medicine Hospital Admissions Performed by Internal Medicine Residents Before and After the 2011 Duty-Hour Regulations|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=108|issue=8|pages=476–481|doi=10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000323|issn=1541-8243|pmid=26280773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One systematic review found that resident learning has been unfavorably impacted by duty hour regulations, and because medical education affects knowledge and competence, this may result in poor decision-making and medical errors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Proposed methods of reducing workloads ==
The most commonly proposed method is regulation of working hours, but this is ineffective if regulations are ignored. Whistle-blower protection laws, protecting residents who report violations of working-hour regulations from losing their residencies and thus their route to professional accreditation, have been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilkey/&gt;

Increasing the bargaining power of residents has been proposed, on the argument that they would then choose the best training programs. The 2002 ''[[Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges]]'' anti-trust case sought more freedom for medical residents to negotiate working conditions. In order to obtain accreditation as doctors, American medical residents are required to enter into a contract to accept whatever residency position they are assigned; they are then matched to a job by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and told what the working conditions and pay are. The plaintiffs allege that this is an anti-competitive practice, and that the defendants artificially limit the number of resident positions available.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is a shortage of doctors, proposed solutions include reducing the costs of medical training and more extensive training for nurses, who then take over duties formerly done by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.doleta.gov/performance/results/AnnualReports/PY2012/Healthcare%20Labor%20Shortages%20and%20Potential%20Solutions.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the working conditions of doctors might also increase recruitment.

===Regulations===

====EU regulation====
Junior doctors in the [[European Union]] fall under the [[European Working Time Directive]], which specifies:

* 48 working hours per week (down from 56 under the old UK regulations), calculated over a period of 26 weeks.
* 11 hours continuous rest per day 
* one day off each week, or two days off each [[fortnight]] 
* 20 minutes of continuous rest every 6 hours

However, junior doctors may choose to work more than 48 hours a week, or opt out of the EWTD entirely by signing a waiver with the employer. They may not be punished for not working more than the directed hours.  Many trainees nonetheless feel obliged to work longer hours. The rest times are mandatory, but may be taken at another time if it cannot be taken as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bma.org.uk/support-at-work/ewtd/ewtd-juniors&lt;/ref&gt;

====American regulation====
The issue is politically controversial in the [[United States]], where federal regulations did not limit the number of hours that can be assigned during a graduate medical student's [[medical residency]]. Starting in 2003, with revisions in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PDFs/dh-ComparisonTable2003v2011.pdf Regulation changes]&lt;/ref&gt; regulations from the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] capped the work-week at 80 hours. As of 2018, shifts are capped (with limited exceptions) at a maximum of 24 consecutive hours for first, second, and third year residents.&lt;ref name="WaPo28Oct2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2003rulesJAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Philibert I, Friedmann P, Williams WT |title=New requirements for resident duty hours |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=9 |pages=1112–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12204081 |doi= 10.1001/jama.288.9.1112|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011rulesNEJM"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas J.

What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly, overnight call frequency to no more than one in three, 30-hour maximum straight shifts, and at least 10 hours off between shifts.  While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for accreditation.

The [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) built upon the recommendations of the ACGME in the December 2008 report [https://archive.is/20121211093643/http://www.iom.edu/residenthours ''Resident Duty Hours: Enhancing Sleep, Supervision and Safety''.] While keeping the ACGME's recommendations of an 80-hour work week averaged over 4 weeks, the IOM report recommends that duty hours should not exceed 16 hours per shift for interns (PGY 1).  The IOM also recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am for shifts lasting up to 30 hours.  The ACGME officially recommended strategic napping between the hours of 10pm and 8am on 30 hour shifts for residents who are post graduate year 2 and above but did not make this a requirement for program compliance.   The report also suggests residents be given variable off-duty periods between shifts, based on the timing and duration of the shift, to allow residents to catch up on sleep each day and make up for chronic sleep deprivation on days off.

Though the ACGME regulations were intended to increase medical resident sleep hours and improve patient safety, they had also created unintended negative consequences in the education of new residents and the workplace learning culture. In 2017, the ACGME changed its regulations once again, citing a trial conducted from July 2014 to June 2015 in 117 general surgery residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, David A., et al. "Resident Duty Hours and Medical Education Policy — Raising the Evidence Bar." ''New England Journal of Medicine'', vol. 376, no. 18, May 2017, pp. 1704–06. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM'', doi:10.1056/NEJMp1703690.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial, programs were randomly assigned to a group following current ACGME duty-hour restrictions or a group with more flexible policies that waived rules on maximum shift lengths and time off between shifts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bilimoria KY, Chung JW, Hedges LV, et al.

N Engl J Med 2016;374:713-727&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at primary outcomes of 30-day rate of postoperative death or serious complications, less-restrictive duty-hour policies were not associated with an increased rate of death or serious complications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Starting July 1, 2017, the ACGME raised the maximum number of consecutive hours a first year resident can work from 16 hours to 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knowledgeplus.nejm.org/blog/acgme-duty-hours-not-the-only-big-change-in-requirements/|title=ACGME Duty Hours Have Changed. What's the Impact? NEJM Knowledge+|website=knowledgeplus.nejm.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sleep deprivation medical residents constantly experience due to long working hours, a minority of residents still wish to not have work hour regulations at all.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the survey of 4510 obstetric-gynecologic residents, about one in five opposed any limits on their work hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These residents cited "additional experience" as the most common reason (69.0%), followed by "opportunity to see rare cases" (46.5%) and "continuity with patients" (31.8%).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The [[Libby Zion Law|Libby Zion case]], in which an 18-year-old college student died of a fatal drug interaction after being treated by a fatigued intern and resident in a New York hospital, led to the establishment of the Bell Commission in 1987 to address physician training hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Nachiket|date=2014-12-30|title=Learning lessons: the Libby Zion case revisited|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=64|issue=25|pages=2802–2804|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2014.11.007|issn=1558-3597|pmid=25541134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its recommendations were adopted by the state of New York in 1989, and limited residents to no more than 24 consecutive hours in the hospital, and no more than 80 hours a week with an in-house supervising attending physician present at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/24/AR2006112400985.html|title=A Case That Shook Medicine|last=Lerner|first=Barron H.|date=2006-11-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though other federal regulatory and legislative attempts to limit medical resident work hours have materialized, none have attained passage.

Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has called for re-evaluation of the residency training process, declaring "We need to take a look again at the issue of why is the resident there."&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) rejected a petition seeking to restrict medical resident work hours, opting to rely on standards adopted by ACGME, a private trade association that represents and accredits residency programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Medial Residents' Working Hours |url=http://www.citizen.org/hrg/healthcare/articles.cfm?ID=6666 |publisher=Public Citizen, Health Research Group |accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2003, the ACGME instituted duty hours requirements for all accredited residency programs, since revised in 2011.&lt;ref name="ACGMEDutyHours"/&gt;

The ACGME duty hour standards that went into effect in July 2003 require:
# An 80-hour weekly limit, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of all in-house call activities;
# A 10-hour rest period between duty periods and after in-house call;
# A 24-hour limit on continuous duty, with up to 6 additional hours for continuity of care and education;
# No new patients to be accepted after 24 hours of continuous duty;
# One day in 7 free from patient care and educational obligations, averaged over 4 weeks, inclusive of call; and
# In-house call no more than once every 3 nights, averaged over 4 weeks.

Following the ACGME's proposed regulation of duty hours the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) followed suit. Below are the requirements adopted by the American Osteopathic association.&lt;ref&gt;"Accreditation Document for Postdoctoral Training Institutions and the Basic Document for Postdoctoral Training Programs."  2006.  Page 45 of 154.  [http://www.osteopathic.org/pdf/sir_postdoctrainproced.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The trainee shall not be assigned to work physically on duty in excess of 80 hours per week averaged over a 4-week period, inclusive of in-house night call.
#The trainee shall not work in excess of 24 consecutive hours inclusive of morning and noon educational programs. Allowances for inpatient and outpatient continuity, transfer of care, educational debriefing and formal didactic activities may occur, but may not exceed 6 hours. Residents may not assume responsibility for a new patient after working 24 hours.
#The trainee shall have on alternate weeks 48-hour periods off, or at least one 24-hour period off each week, averaged over a 4-week period.
#Upon conclusion of a 24-hour duty shift, trainees shall have a minimum of 10 hours off before being required to be on duty again. Upon completing a lesser hour duty period, adequate time for rest and personal activity must be provided.
#All off-duty time must be totally free from assignment to clinical or educational activity.
#Rotations in which trainee is assigned to Emergency Department duty shall ensure that trainees work no longer than 12-hour shifts.
#The trainee and training institution must always remember the patient care responsibility is not precluded by the work hour policy. In cases where a trainee is engaged in patient responsibility which cannot be interrupted, additional coverage should be provided as soon as possible to relieve the resident involved.
#The trainee may not be assigned to call more often than every third night averaged over any consecutive four-week period.

Another related issue regarding the imposition of maximum hour policies for medical residents is the question of enforcement, where some enforcement proposals have included extending U.S. federal whistle-blower protection to medical residents in order to ensure compliance and afford medical residents certain employment protection.&lt;ref name=Wilkey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkey|first=Robert Neil|title=Federal Whistleblower Protection: A Means to Enforcing Maximum-Hour Legislation for Medical Residents|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://open.wmitchell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dmedical%2520residents%2520whistleblower%2520protection%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26ved%3D0CF8QFjAA%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fopen.wmitchell.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1070%2526context%253Dwmlr%26ei%3D2b8NT76sEuLZ0QGn8cTZBQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNHfdcQ1oJI-5g27EWkk|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still inherent problems with the current ACGME policy.  Resident duty hour restrictions are difficult to assess and enforce.  Also, it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for monitoring duty hour adherence (i.e. state licensing boards, residency programs, attendings, residents, etc.).  Additionally, a one-size-fits all solution may not be ideal, since the need for certain duty hours may vary among specialties.

==Coping mechanisms== 
Although strategic napping is recommended by the ACGME, no studies have assessed the effect of napping as a fatigue mitigation technique. Requiring naps during long shifts could be a small step toward reducing fatigue and potentially decreasing errors. Resident surveys suggest that a greater emphasis on education, decreased workload, and more ancillary support would better improve patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borman|first=Karen R.|last2=Jones|first2=Andrew T.|last3=Shea|first3=Judy A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Duty hours, quality of care, and patient safety: general surgery resident perceptions|journal=Journal of the American College of Surgeons|volume=215|issue=1|pages=70–77; discussion 77–79|doi=10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2012.02.010|issn=1879-1190|pmc=3385860|pmid=22632914}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focusing on hospital best practices and physician incentives like pay-for-performance in residency could help with the implementation of some of these solutions.

Techniques to reduce circadian misalignment include avoiding abrupt changes in shift time, getting more sleep, which makes the sleep schedule more flexible, and the use of caffeine and ambient light of specific wavelengths.&lt;ref name=float/&gt;&lt;ref name=ICU/&gt;

'''Medieval technology''' is the technology used in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] under [[Christendom|Christian rule]]. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.&lt;/ref&gt; The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]], the invention of vertical [[windmill]]s, [[spectacles]], [[mechanical clock]]s, and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques ([[Gothic architecture]], [[medieval castle]]s), and [[agriculture]] in general ([[three-field crop rotation]]).

The [[List of early medieval watermills|development of water mills]] from their [[List of ancient watermills|ancient origins]] was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone. By the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', most large villages had turnable mills, around 6,500 in [[England]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1988|pp=7–8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water-power was also widely used in [[mining]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

European technical advancements from the 12th to 14th centuries were either built on long-established techniques in medieval Europe, originating from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], [[China]], and [[History of India|India]]. Often, the revolutionary aspect lay not in the act of invention itself, but in its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though [[gunpowder]] along with other weapons had been started by Chinese, it was the Europeans who developed and perfected its military potential, precipitating European expansion and eventual imperialism in the Modern Era.

Also significant in this respect were advances in maritime technology. Advances in shipbuilding included the multi-masted [[ship]]s with [[lateen]] sails, the [[Rudder|sternpost-mounted rudder]] and the skeleton-first [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] construction. Along with new navigational techniques such as the [[Compass|dry compass]], the [[Jacob's staff]] and the [[astrolabe]], these allowed economic and military control of the seas adjacent to Europe and enabled the global navigational achievements of the dawning [[Age of Exploration]].

At the turn to the [[Renaissance]], [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s invention of [[Printing press|mechanical printing]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience. The technical drawings of late-medieval artist-engineers [[Guido da Vigevano]] and [[Villard de Honnecourt]] can be viewed as forerunners of later Renaissance works such as [[Taccola]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]].

== Civil technologies ==
The following is a list of some important medieval technologies. The approximate date or first mention of a technology in medieval Europe is given. Technologies were often a matter of cultural exchange and date and place of first inventions are not listed here (see main links for a more complete history of each).

=== Agriculture ===

'''[[Carruca]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)
[[File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg|thumb|340x340px|Carruca (Heavy Plough )]]
A type of heavy wheeled plough commonly found in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device consisted of four major parts. The first part was a [[Coulter (agriculture)]] at the bottom of the plough.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This knife was used to vertically cut into the top sod to allow for the [[plowshare]] to work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The plowshare was the second pair of knives which cut the sod horizontally, detaching it from the ground below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third part was the moldboard, which curled the sod outward.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth part of the device was the team of eight oxen guided by the farmer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This type of plough eliminated the need for cross-plowing by turning over the furrow instead of merely pushing it outward.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of wheeled plough made seed placement more consistent throughout the farm as the blade could be locked in at a certain level relative to the wheels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A disadvantage to this type of plough was its maneuverability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since this equipment was large and lead by a small herd of oxen, turning the plough was difficult and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This caused many farmers to turn away from traditional square fields and adopt a longer, more rectangular field to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ard (plough)]]''' (5th century)

An early medieval plough that consisted of a sharpened wooden post pulled by either animals or humans.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This lightweight and primitive plough was used primarily before the invention of the [[carruca]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ard was inefficient in more firm northern soil but did decent work in southern areas where the soil was much softer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the ard required the user to apply constant pressure to the plough in order to make sure the edge could break the ground, the soil was merely pushed to the sides instead of being properly turned over.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horse collar]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)

Once oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the [[yoke]] became obsolete due to its shape not working well with a horses' posture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first design for a horse collar was a throat-and-girth-harness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These types of harnesses were unreliable though due to them not being sufficiently set in place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The loose straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the horse was working and often caused asphyxiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around the eighth century, the introduction of the rigid collar eliminated the problem of choking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The rigid collar was "placed over the horses head and rested on its shoulders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This permitted unobstructed breathing and placed the weight of the plow or wagon where the horse could best support it."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horseshoe]]s''' (9th century)

Allowed horses to carry larger loads and move around with greater traction on hard to walk surfaces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The practice of shoeing horses was initially practiced in the Roman Empire but lost popularity throughout the Middle Ages until around the 11th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horses in the southern lands could easily work while on the softer soil, the rocky soil of the north proved to be damaging to the horses' hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since the north was the problematic area, this is where shoeing horses first became popular.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The introduction of gravel roadways was also cause for the popularity of horseshoeing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The loads a shoed horse could take on these roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By the 14th century, not only did horses have shoes, but many farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the life of their hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The size and weight of the horseshoe changed significantly over the course of the middle ages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the 10th century, horseshoes were secured by six nails and weighed around one-quarter of a pound, but throughout the years, the shoes grew larger and by the 14th century, the shoes were being secured with eight nails and weighed nearly half a pound.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crop rotation]]''' (8th century)

Also called the Two-field system. This system included the farmers' field being divided into two separate crops.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One field would grow a crop while the other was allowed to lie fallow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Every year, the two fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 11th century, this system was introduced into Sweden and spread to become the most popular form of farming.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Three-field system]]''' (8th century)
[[File:De Grey Hours f.9.r Wine pressing.jpg|thumb|An individual grape stomping as a form of wine pressing.]]
The ideal three-field system is one that separates a section of land into three equal parts.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Each one of the three parts holds a different crop.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One part holds a spring crop, such as barley or oats, another part holds a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third part is an off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This system increases agricultural productivity over the [[Two-field system]] by only having one-third of the field not being used instead of one half.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another advantage of crop rotation is that many scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wine press]]''' (12th century)

This device was the first practical means of [[Pressing (wine)]] on a plane surface.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The wine press was an expensive piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The method of [[Grape stomping]] was often used as a less expensive alternative.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While white wines required the use of a wine press in order to preserve the color of the wine by removing the juices quickly from the skin, red wine did not need to be pressed until the end of the juice removal process since the color did not matter.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many red wine winemakers used their feet to smash the grapes then used a press to remove any juice that remained in the grape skins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Qanat]]''' (5th century)

An underground passage used to water fields, crops, and provide drinking water.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These tunnels had a gradual slope which used gravity to pull the water from either an [[aquifer]] or [[water well]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Folk Astronomy and Agriculture in Arabia and the Yemen|last=Varisoc|first=Daniel Martin|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|year=1997|isbn=0-86078-651-X|location=Brookfield, Vermont|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was originally found in middle eastern areas and is still used today in places where surface water is hard to find.

=== Architecture and construction ===
'''[[Pendentive]] architecture''' (6th century)

A specific spherical form in the upper corners to support a dome. Although the first experimentation was made in the 200s, it was in the 6th century in the [[Byzantine Empire]] that its potential was fully achieved.

'''[[Artesian well]]''' (1126)

A thin rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer, underground water pressure forces the water up the hole without pumping. Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled by Carthusian monks in 1126.

'''[[Central heating]] through [[Underfloor heating|underfloor channels]]''' (9th century)

In the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman [[hypocaust]] at some places. In [[Reichenau Abbey]] a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=456–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vault (architecture)#Rib vault|Rib vault]]''' (12th century)

An essential element for the rise of [[Gothic architecture]], rib vaults allowed vaults to be built for the first time over rectangles of unequal lengths. It also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the older [[groin vault]].

'''[[Chimney]]''' (12th century)

The earliest true chimneys appeared in Northern Europe during the 12th century, and with them came the first true fireplaces.

'''[[Arch bridge|Segmental arch bridge]]''' (1345)

The [[Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] is considered medieval Europe's first stone segmental arch bridge.

[[File:Treadmillcrane.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Treadwheel crane]]]]
'''[[Treadwheel crane]]''' (1220s)

The earliest reference to a [[treadwheel]] in archival literature is in France about 1225,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally cranks were employed for powering cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[List of historical harbour cranes|Stationary harbour crane]]''' (1244)

Stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; '''Slewing cranes''' which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crane vessel|Floating crane]]'''

Beside the stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Crane (machine)|Mast crane]]'''

Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gdańsk, Cologne and Bremen.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Wheelbarrow]]''' (1170s)

The wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. Literary evidence for the use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western Europe. The first depiction is in a drawing by [[Matthew Paris]] in the mid-13th century.

=== Art ===
[[File:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'', oil painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (1433)]]
'''[[Oil paint]]''' (by 1125)

As early as the 13th century, oil was used to add details to tempera paintings and paint wooden statues. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck]] developed the use of a stable oil mixture for [[panel painting]] around 1410.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel van Mander]] propagated a myth that van Eyck invented oil painting, but [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions in his 1125 treatise, ''On Divers Arts''. The van Eyck brothers were among the earliest Early Netherlandish painters to employ it for detailed panel painting and achieved new effects through the use of glazes, [[wet-on-wet]] and other techniques. {{cite book|authorlink=Ernst Gombrich|last=Gombrich|first=E.

=== Clocks ===
'''[[Hourglass]]''' (1338)

Reasonably dependable, affordable and accurate measure of time. Unlike water in a [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. Hourglasses are a medieval innovation (first documented in [[Siena]], Italy).

'''[[Clock|Mechanical clocks]]''' (13th to 14th centuries)

A European innovation, these weight-driven clocks were used primarily in clock towers.

=== Mechanics ===
'''[[Crank (mechanism)|Compound crank]]'''

The Italian physician [[Guido da Vigevano]] combines in his 1335 ''Texaurus'', a collection of war machines intended for the recapture of the Holy Land, two simple cranks to form a compound crank for manually powering war carriages and [[Paddle steamer#History|paddle wheel boats]]. The devices were fitted directly to the vehicle's axle respectively to the shafts turning the paddle wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metallurgy ===
'''[[Blast furnace]]''' (1150–1350)

Cast iron had been made in China before the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  European cast iron first appears in Middle Europe (for instance Lapphyttan in Sweden, Dürstel in Switzerland and the Märkische Sauerland in Germany) around 1150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace-Technology in Central Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208193313/http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm |date=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in some places according to recent research even before 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Radomir Pleiner: Vom Rennfeuer zum Hochofen.

=== Milling ===
{{Further|List of early medieval watermills}}
'''[[Ship mill]]''' (6th century)

The ship mill is a Byzantine invention, designed to mill grains using hydraulic power. The technology eventually spread to the rest of Europe and was in use until ca. 1800.
'''[[Paper mill]]''' (13th century)

The first certain use of a water-powered [[paper mill]], evidence for which is elusive in both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]] 1985, pp. 68−73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim paper making,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; dates to 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rolling mill]]''' (15th century)

Used to produce metal sheet of an even thickness. First used on soft, malleable metals, such as [[lead]], [[gold]] and [[tin]]. Leonardo da Vinci described a rolling mill for wrought iron.

'''[[Tide mill|Tidal Mill]]s''' (6th century)

The earliest tidal mills were excavated on the Irish coast where watermillers knew and employed the two main [[waterwheel]] types: a 6th-century tide mill at Killoteran near [[Waterford]] was powered by a vertical waterwheel,&lt;ref name="Murphy 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the tide changes at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] were exploited by a twin-flume horizontal-wheeled mill (c. 630) and a vertical undershot waterwheel alongside it.&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 155–157"&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|pp=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Rynne|2000|pp=17, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is the [[Nendrum Monastery mill]] from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven to eight [[horsepower]] at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McErlean|Crothers|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ Nendrum Monastery mill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225336/http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Windmill|Vertical windmill]]s''' (1180s)

Invented in Europe as the pivotable post mill, the first surviving mention of one comes from Yorkshire in England in 1185. They were efficient at grinding grain or draining water. Stationary tower mills were also developed in the 13th century.

'''[[Trip hammer|Water hammer]]''' (12th century at the latest)

Used in metallurgy to forge the metal blooms from [[bloomery|bloomeries]] and [[Catalan forge]]s, they replaced manual hammerwork. The water hammer was eventually superseded by [[steam hammer]]s in the 19th century.

=== Navigation ===
'''[[History of the compass#Dry compass|Dry compass]]''' (12th century)

The first European mention of the directional compass is in [[Alexander Neckam]]'s ''On the Natures of Things'', written in Paris around 1190.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Kreutz, “Mediterranean Contributions to the Medieval Mariner's Compass,” ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 14, No. 3. (July 1973), p.368&lt;/ref&gt; It was either [[Compass#Question of diffusion|transmitted from China or the Arabs]] or an [[Compass#Question of independent European invention|independent European innovation]]. Dry compass were invented in the Mediterranean around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Lane, “The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,” ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Compass|Astronomical compass]]''' (1269)

The French scholar [[Pierre de Maricourt]] describes in his experimental study ''Epistola de magnete'' (1269) three different compass designs he has devised for the purpose of astronomical observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1951|pp=2ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pintle and gudgeon rudder system scheme.svg|thumb|180px|Scheme of a sternpost-mounted medieval rudder]]
'''[[Rudder|Stern-mounted rudders]]''' (1180s)

The first depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder on church carvings dates to around 1180. They first appeared with [[Cog (ship)|cog]]s in the North and Baltic Seas and quickly spread to Mediterranean. The iron hinge system was the first stern rudder permanently attached to the ship hull and made a vital contribution to the navigation achievements of the [[age of discovery]] and thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V. Mott, ''The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1600: A Technological Tale'', Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Printing, paper and reading ===
'''[[Movable type]] [[printing press]]''' (1440s)

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s great innovation was not the printing itself, but instead of using carved plates as in [[woodblock printing]], he used separate letters (''types'') from which the printing plates for pages were made up. This meant the types were recyclable and a page cast could be made up far faster.

'''[[Paper]]''' (13th century)

Paper was invented in China and transmitted through Islamic Spain in the 13th century. In Europe, the paper-making processes was mechanized by water-powered mills and paper presses (see [[paper mill]]).

[[File:Friedrich Herlin, Reading Saint Peter (1466).jpg|thumb|180px|Reading [[Saint Peter]] with eyeglasses (1466)]]

'''[[Rotating bookmark]]''' (13th century)

A rotating disc and string device used to mark the page, column, and precise level in the text where a person left off reading in a text.  Materials used were often leather, velum, or paper.

'''[[Spectacles]]''' (1280s)

The first spectacles, invented in Florence, used convex lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted. Concave lenses were not developed prior to the 15th century.

'''[[Watermark]]''' (1282)

This medieval innovation was used to mark paper products and to discourage counterfeiting. It was first introduced in [[Bologna]], Italy.

=== Science and learning ===

'''[[Theory of impetus]]''' (6th century)

A scientific theory that was introduced by [[John Philoponus]] who made criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics, and it served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to [[Galileo Galilei]]  who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed. It is the intellectual precursor to the concepts of [[inertia]], [[momentum]] and [[acceleration]] in [[classical mechanics]].

'''[[Arabic numerals]]''' (13th century)

The first recorded mention in Europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] with his ''Liber Abaci''.

'''[[University]]'''

The first [[medieval universities]] were founded between the 11th and 13th centuries leading to a rise in literacy and learning. By 1500, the institution had spread throughout most of Europe and played a key role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Today, the educational concept and institution has been globally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1970|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textile industry and garments ===
'''[[button|Functional button]]''' (13th century)

German buttons appeared in 13th-century Germany as an indigenous innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White: "The Act of Invention: Causes, Contexts, Continuities and Consequences", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1962), pp. 486-500 (497f. &amp; 500)&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting clothing.

'''[[Loom|Horizontal loom]]''' (11th century)

Horizontal looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient.

'''[[Silk]]''' (6th century)

Manufacture of silk began in Eastern Europe in the 6th century and in Western Europe in the 11th or 12th century. Silk had been imported over the [[Silk Road]] since antiquity. The technology of "silk throwing" was mastered in Tuscany in the 13th century. The silk works used waterpower and some regard these as the first mechanized textile mills.

'''[[Spinning wheel]]''' (13th century)

Brought to Europe probably from India.

=== Miscellaneous ===
[[File:KnightsTemplarPlayingChess1283.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knights Templar]] playing chess, ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'' (1283)]]
'''[[Chess]]''' (1450)

The earliest predecessors of the game originated in 6th-century AD India and spread via Persia and the Muslim world to Europe. Here the game evolved into its current form in the 15th century.

'''[[Forest glass]]''' (c. 1000)

This type of glass uses [[wood ash]] and sand as the main raw materials and is characterised by a variety of greenish-yellow colours.

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Grindstone]]s''' (834)

Grindstones are a rough stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron. The first rotary grindstone (turned with a leveraged handle) occurs in the ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]'', illustrated between 816 and 834.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hägermann, the pen drawing is a copy of a late-antique manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=425f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second crank which was mounted on the other end of the axle is depicted in the ''[[Luttrell Psalter]]'' from around 1340.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Liquor]]''' (12th century)

Primitive forms of distillation were known to the [[Babylonia]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levey |first=Martin |title=Chemistry and Chemical Technology in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=1959 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76ILAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Indians in the first centuries AD.&lt;ref name="habib"&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 55], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of distillation also comes from [[Alchemy|alchemists]] working in [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Roman Egypt]], in the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Forbes1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert James|title=A short history of the art of distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|accessdate=29 June 2010|year=1970|publisher=BRILL|pages=57, 89|isbn=978-90-04-00617-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220084813/http://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Arabs]] adopted the distillation process,&lt;ref name="Gorak"&gt;{{cite book|title=Distillation: Fundamentals and Principles|page=5-10|editor=Andrzej Gorak, Eva Sorensen|publisher=Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=9780123865489}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later spread to Europe. Texts on the distillation of waters, wine, and other spirits were written in [[Salerno]] and [[Cologne]] in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Gorak" /&gt;

Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the [[Black Death]]. These spirits would have had a much lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal [[elixir]]s. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye were discovered. Thus began the [[List of national liquors|"national" drinks]] of Europe, including  [[gin]] (England) and ''[[grappa]]'' (Italy). In 1437, "burned water" ([[brandy]]) was mentioned in the records of the [[County of Katzenelnbogen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com/begriffe.html graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com], ''Trinkglas.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Magnet]]s''' (12th century)

Magnets were first referenced in the ''[[Roman d'Enéas]]'', composed between 1155 and 1160.

'''[[Mirror]]s''' (1180)

The first mention of a "glass" mirror is in 1180 by [[Alexander Neckham]] who said "Take away the lead which is behind the [[glass]] and there will be no image of the one looking in."

'''Illustrated surgical atlas''' (1345)

Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280 − 1349) was the first author to add illustrations to his anatomical descriptions. His ''Anathomia'' provides [[picture]]s of [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] structures and techniques such as the dissection of the head by means of [[trephination]], and depictions of the [[meninges]], [[cerebrum]], and [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Di Ieva|2007|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Quarantine]]''' (1377)

Initially a 40-day-period, the quarantine was introduced by the [[Republic of Ragusa]] as a measure of disease prevention related to the [[Black Death]]. It was later adopted by Venice from where the practice spread all around in Europe.

'''[[Mouse trap|Rat trap]]s''' (1170s)

The first mention of a rat trap is in the medieval romance ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]].

'''[[Soap]]''' (9th century)

Soap came into widespread European use in the 9th century in semi-liquid form, with hard soap perfected by the Arabs in the 12th century.

== Military technologies ==

=== Armour ===
'''[[Gambeson|Quilted Armour]]''' (pre 5th - 14th Century)

There was a vast amount of armour technology available through the 5th to 16th centuries. 
Most soldiers during this time wore padded or quilted armor. This was the cheapest and most available armor for the majority of soldiers. Quilted armour was usually just a jacket made of thick linen and wool meant to pad or soften the impact of blunt weapons and light blows. Although, this technology predated the 5th century, it was still extremely prevalent because of the low cost and the weapon technology at the time made the bronze armor of the Greeks and Romans obsolete. Quilted armour was also used in conjunction with other types of armour. Usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later plate armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=72|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Boiled_leather|Cuir Bouilli]]''' (5th-10th Century)

Hardened leather armour also called Cuir Bouilli was a step up from quilted armour. Made by boiling leather in either water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flank|first1=Lenny|title=A History of European Armor|journal=Hidden History|date=May 24, 2016|url=https://lflank.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/a-history-of-european-armor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pieces of armour could be made such as breast plates, helmets, and leg guards, but many times smaller pieces would be sewn into the quilting of quilted armour or strips would be sewn together on the outside of a linen jacket. This was not as affordable as the quilted armour but offered much better protection against edged slashing weapons.

'''[[Chain mail|Chain Mail]]''' (11th-16th Century)

The most common type during the 11th through the 16th centuries was the '''[[Hauberk]]''', also known earlier than the 11th century as the Carolingian byrnie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technologies|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=64|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of interlinked rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a coif that covered the head and a tunic that covered the torso, arms, and legs down to the knees. Chain mail was very effective at protecting against light slashing blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting blows. The great advantage was that it allowed a great freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant protection over quilted or hardened leather armour. It was far more expensive than the hardened leather or quilted armour because of the massive amount of labor it required to create. This made it unattainable for most soldiers and only the more wealthy soldiers could afford it. Later, toward the end of the 13th century '''[[banded mail]]''' became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the interlinked metal rings of chain mail, banded mail was much more affordable to manufacture. The washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater protection from arrow and bolt attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|pages=134-138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Banded_Mail_Armour.jpg|thumb|right|Banded Mail Armour Construction]]

'''[[Jazerant]]''' (11th century)

The Jazerant or Jazeraint was an adaptation of chain mail in which the chain mail would be sewn in between layers of linen or quilted armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andre-Driussi|first1=Micheal|title=Lexicon Urthus|date=2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=0964279517|page=192|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptional protection against light slashing weapons and slightly improved protection against small thrusting weapons, but little protection against large blunt weapons such as maces and axes. This gave birth to reinforced chain mail and became more prevalent in the 12th and 13th century. Reinforced armour was made up of chain mail with metal plates or hardened leather plates sewn in. This greatly improved protection from stabbing and thrusting blows. 

'''[[Scale Armour]]''' (12th century)

A type of '''[[Lamellar armour]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medievil Militay Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=70|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made up entirely of small, overlapping plates. Either sewn together, usually with leather straps, or attached to a backing such as linen, or a quilted armor. Scale armour does not require the labor to produce that chain mail does and therefore is more affordable. It also affords much better protection against thrusting blows and pointed weapons. Though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free movement. 

[[File:KHM Wien S XIII - Jousting armour by Jörg and Lorenz Helmschmid front.jpg|thumb|180px|Jousting armor commissioned by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1494]]

'''[[Plate armour|Plate Armour]]''' (14th century)

Plate armour covered the entire body. Although parts of the body were already covered in plate armour as early as 1250, such as the Poleyns for covering the knees and Couters - plates that protected the elbows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first complete full suit without any textiles was seen around 1410-1430. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Components of medieval armour]]''' that made up a full suit consisted of a cuirass, a gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal leather straps. Improved weaponry such as crossbows and the long bow had greatly increased range and power. This made penetration of the chain mail hauberk much easier and more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=74|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1400's most plate was worn alone and without the need of a hauberk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henery|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in metal working such as the blast furnace and new techniques for carburizing made plate armour nearly impenetrable and the best armour protection available at the time. Although plate armour was fairly heavy, because each suit was custom tailored to the wearer, it was very easy to move around in. A full suit of plate armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the majority of soldiers. Only very wealthy land owners and nobility could afford it. The quality of plate armour increases as more armour makers became more proficient in metal working. A suit of plate armour became a symbol of social status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings. Plate armour saw continued use in battle until the 17th century.

=== Cavalry ===
'''[[Saddle|Arched saddle]]''' (11th century)

The arched saddle enabled mounted [[knight]]s to wield [[lance]]s underarm and prevent the charge from turning into an unintentional pole-vault. This innovation gave birth to true shock [[cavalry]], enabling fighters to charge on full gallop.

'''[[Spur]]s''' (11th century)

Spurs were invented by the Normans and appeared at the same time as the cantled saddle. They enabled the horseman to control his horse with his feet, replacing the whip and leaving his arms free. Rowel spurs familiar from cowboy films were already known in the 13th century. Gilded spurs were the ultimate symbol of the knighthood - even today someone is said to "earn his spurs" by proving his or her worthiness.

'''[[Stirrup]]''' (6th century)

Stirrups were invented by steppe nomads in what is today Mongolia and northern China in the 4th century. They were introduced in Byzantium in the 6th century and in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th. They allowed a mounted knight to wield a sword and strike from a distance leading to a great advantage for mounted cavalry.

=== Gunpowder weapons ===
'''[[Cannon]]''' (1324)

Cannons are first recorded in Europe at the siege of Metz in 1324. In 1350 [[Petrarch]] wrote "these instruments which discharge balls of metal with most tremendous noise and flashes of fire...were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as any other kinds of arms."&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Volley gun]]'''

See [[Ribauldequin]].

'''[[Gunpowder|Corned gunpowder]]''' (late 14th century)

First practiced in Western Europe, corning the black powder allowed for more powerful and faster ignition of cannons. It also facilitated the storage and transportation of black powder. Corning constituted a crucial step in the evolution of gunpowder warfare.

[[File:Mons Meg, Medieval Bombard, Edinburgh, Scotland. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|180px|Scottish bombard [[Mons Meg]]]]
'''[[Supergun]]''' (late 14th century)

Extant examples include the wrought-iron [[Pumhart von Steyr]], [[Dulle Griet]] and [[Mons Meg]] as well as the cast-bronze [[Faule Mette]] and [[Faule Grete]] (all from the 15th century).

=== Mechanical artillery ===
'''[[Trebuchet|Counterweight trebuchet]]''' (12th century)

Powered solely by the force of gravity, these catapults revolutionized medieval siege warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge stones unprecedented distances. Originating somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean basin, counterweight trebuchets were introduced in the [[Byzantine Empire]] around 1100 CE, and was later adopted by the [[Crusader states]] and as well by the other armies of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf Paul E. Chevedden, "The Invention of the Counterweight Trebuchet: A Study in Cultural Diffusion", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', No. 54 (2000), pp.71-116 (104f.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205183303/http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missile weapons ===
'''[[Greek fire]]''' (7th century)

An incendiary weapon which could even burn on water is also attributed to the Byzantines where they installed it on their ships. It played a crucial role in the Byzantine Empire's victory over the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)]]

'''[[Grenade]]''' (8th century) [[File:Liquid fire granades Chania.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by [[caltrop]]s, 10th–12th century, [[National Historical Museum (Greece)|National Historical Museum]], Athens, Greece]]

Rudimentary incendiary grenades appeared in the [[Byzantine Empire]], as the Byzantine soldiers learned that [[Greek fire]], a Byzantine invention of the previous century, could not only be thrown by [[flamethrower]]s at the enemy, but also in stone and ceramic jars. 

'''[[English longbow|Longbow]] with massed, disciplined archery''' (13th century)

Having a high rate of fire and penetration power, the longbow contributed to the eventual demise of the medieval [[knight]] class{{dubious|date=July 2016}}. Used particularly by the English to great effect against the French cavalry during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453).

'''[[Arbalest|Steel crossbow]]''' (late 14th century)

European innovation. Came with several different cocking aids to enhance draw power, making the weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.

=== Miscellaneous ===
'''[[Combined arms]] tactics''' (14th century)

The [[battle of Halidon Hill]] 1333 was the first battle where intentional and disciplined combined arms infantry tactics were employed.{{dubious|date=October 2012}} The English men-at-arms dismounted aside the archers, combining thus the staying power of super-heavy infantry and striking power of their two-handed weapons with the missiles and mobility of the archers using longbows and shortbows
. Combining dismounted knights and men-at-arms with archers was the archetypal Western Medieval battle tactics until the [[battle of Flodden]] 1513 and final emergence of firearms.

[https://www.musanet.org/ MusaNet]  is a global network of scientists and other stakeholders working on [[banana]] ([[Musa (genus)|''Musa spp.'']]) [[plant genetic resources|genetic resources]]. Founded in 2011 and coordinated by [https://www.bioversityinternational.org/ Bioversity International], it has over 100 individual members representing various banana research institutes and organizations. 

==Vision and Mission==

MusaNet aims to optimize the conservation and use of ''Musa'' genetic resources by coordinating and strengthening the [[conservation]] and related research efforts of a worldwide network of public and private sector stakeholders.

The vision of MusaNet is ''a world in which ''Musa'' [[genetic diversity]] is valued, secured and supporting all life.'' 

The mission of MusaNet is ''To build upon existing strengths in the global, regional and national collections by bringing people to optimize the effort to conserve, add value and promote the use and safe distribution of a wide range of ''Musa'' genetic diversity as a foundation for further breeding or direct use by farmers.'' 

MusaNet is committed to overseeing the further development and monitoring of the implementation of The Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of ''Musa'' Genetic Resources (MusaNet 2016) &lt;ref name="Strategy"&gt; [https://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/global-strategy-for-the-conservation-and-use-of-musa-genetic-resources/ MusaNet 2016. Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of ''Musa'' Genetic Resources] | (B. Laliberté, compiler). Bioversity International, Montpellier, France&lt;/ref&gt; by meeting the following objectives:

*Ensure the secured conservation of the entire ''Musa'' [[genepool]] by assessing the diversity conserved and filling gaps in collections, with an emphasis on threatened material.
*Strengthen the capacity of partners for the cost-effective long-term conservation and management of [[germplasm]] collections and facilitate access to useful ''Musa'' genetic resources in improvement programmes and by other users.
*Enhance the value of ''Musa'' genetic resources for breeding, through effective collaborative characterization, evaluation and pre-breeding efforts.
*Raise awareness with key partners on the importance of ''Musa'' genetic resources conservation, documentation, exchange and sharing the benefits arising from their use. Set priorities for research, breeding, and use of ''Musa'' genetic resources, ensuring critical links with the four regional banana networks.

==Structure==

Members of MusaNet belong to one or more of the five thematic research groups focused on the following subjects: Diversity, Conservation, Evaluation, Genomics and Information. Each of these thematic groups has elected a Chair and Co-chair to represent the group at monthly Expert Committee meetings and has developed objectives and a workplan for the next 10 years. 

Also present in the Expert Committee are representatives of the four regional banana networks - [http://banana-networks.org/Bapnet/ BAPNET] (Asia and the Pacific), [http://banana-networks.org/barnesa/ BARNESA] (Eastern and Southern Africa), [http://banana-networks.org/innovate-plantain/ Innovate Plantain] (Western and Central Africa) and [http://banana-networks.org/musalac/ MUSALAC] (Latin America and the Caribbean), which geographically cover all the banana producing countries. A representative from the information platform [[ProMusa]] is also present at the meetings.

Part of the Diversity Thematic Group, the [https://sites.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/musanet/about-musanet/taxonomic-advisorary-group/ Taxonomic Advisory Group (TAG)] comprises 12 experts that work together on particular projects concerning banana taxonomy, such as developing morphological field descriptors and verifying the genetic integrity of banana germplasm.

==Membership==

Membership to MusaNet is based on individuals, not institutes, and is solicited by thematic group Chairs and Co-chairs. Members are active in banana genetic resources-related research with a commitment to fruitful collaboration and knowledge exchange.

==''Musa'' Collections==

There are more than 60 banana ''ex situ'' collections worldwide located mostly in banana producing countries. The majority of the collections are supported by national funding to conserve banana diversity and conduct related research. Detailed information of the collections can be found on the [https://www.musanet.org/ MusaNet] website.

==Activities==

Projects in MusaNet are developed within and among the five thematic groups. 

Some recent activities carried out by MusaNet members are:

The following [[outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to natural science:

'''[[Natural science]]''' &amp;ndash; a major branch of [[science]] that tries to explain, and predict, nature's phenomena based on [[empirical evidence]]. In natural science, [[hypothesis]] must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: [[life science]], and [[physical science]]. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

== What type of thing is natural science? ==

Natural science can be described as all of the following:

* Branch of [[Outline of science|science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J. L. Heilbron]], (2003, editor-in-chief). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science''.

* [[List of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines#Natural sciences|Major category]] of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, Gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

== Branches of natural science ==

===Physical science===
*[[Outline of physical science|Physical science]] – branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to the biological sciences. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science", together called the "physical sciences". However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena (organic chemistry, for example).

====Physics====
** [[Outline of physics|Physics]] – physical science that studies matter and its motion through space-time, and related concepts such as energy and force
*** [[Acoustics]] – study of mechanical waves in solids, liquids, and gases (such as vibration and sound)
*** [[Agrophysics]] – study of physics applied to [[agroecosystems]]
**** [[Soil physics]] – study of soil physical properties and processes.
*** [[Astrophysics]] – study of the physical aspects of celestial objects
***[[Outline of astronomy|Astronomy]] – studies the universe beyond Earth, including its formation and development, and the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects (such as galaxies, planets, etc.) and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth (such as the cosmic background radiation).
**** [[Astrodynamics]] – application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft.
**** [[Astrometry]] – branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestially  bodies.
**** [[Cosmology]] – discipline that deals with the nature of the Universe as a whole.
**** [[Extragalactic astronomy]] – branch of astronomy concerned with objects outside our own Milky Way Galaxy
**** [[Galactic astronomy]] – study of our own Milky Way galaxy and all its contents.
**** [[Physical cosmology]] – study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its formation and evolution.
**** [[Planetary science]] – scientific study of planets (including Earth), moons, and planetary systems, in particular those of the Solar System and the processes that form them.
**** [[Astronomy#Stellar astronomy|Stellar astronomy]] – natural science that deals with the study of celestial objects (such as stars, planets, comets, nebulae, star clusters and galaxies) and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth (such as cosmic background radiation)
*** [[Atmospheric physics]] – study of the application of physics to the atmosphere
*** [[Atomic, molecular, and optical physics]] – study of how matter and light interact
*** [[Biophysics]] – study of physical processes relating to biology
**** [[Medical physics]] – application of physics concepts, theories and methods to medicine.
**** [[Neurophysics]] – branch of biophysics dealing with the nervous system.

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

==History==
[[File:Adolph Glasbrenner Guckkästner.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A boy looks into a peep show device (illustration by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1835)]]
Peep shows,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weynants, [http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html "From the Rarekiek, 17th. &amp; 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television"]
&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter.

For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W. Meeker, "Do peep shows 'cause' crime?", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regal Show World====
Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

===Washington===
The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[File:Writing on a grain of rice.jpg|thumb|A person writing on a grain of rice.]]
'''Rice writing''' is the art and skill of being able to write small enough to write on a grain of [[rice]].

==History==
Rice writing originated in Ancient [[Anatolia]] in Turkey and India. Many rituals and rites use rice as a medium, but at some point in ancient [[Anatolia]] artisans who were skilled in making miniature paintings decided to turn their skill to making art with what had always been an ancient symbol of prosperity, the oldest example of which lies in [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, Turkey. The artisans would inscribe messages or names on a single grain of rice after it was treated and polished. Grains that were long and flat were favorites as they offered proper surfaces for writing. Apart from Turkey, India also had a large number of  artisans skilled in making miniature art including rice art.

==Rice art Symbolism==
Rice art is considered to bring good luck hence some of its most popular forms is good luck pendants, hope bracelets and cell phone charms.

==Rice art and Rice jewelry today==
[[File:Grain of rice necklace-2.jpg|thumb|A necklace containing a grain of rice with the name "Filip" written on it.]]
Within time rice writing and rice art evolved, soon creating rice jewelry where the rice grain was enclosed in a vial with a liquid/oil that magnifies the individual grain making it easier to appreciate the painstaking and intricate details. This went further with rice jewelry like good luck pendants, charm bracelets, anklets and earrings. In modern times most of these artisans and artists set up shop with street side stalls where they can personally write your message or name on a rice grain while displaying their wares and hard work.

==Technique==
Most modern day rice writers use the following tools:  
#Common long grain white rice:  This rice is a flat cylinder shape.  Because it is flat it provides two wide surfaces for writing.
#Sharp utility knife:  This is used to scrape the rice slightly to remove ridges to provide a smooth surface for writing.  This scraping method can also be used to remove minor mistakes. 
#[[Clay]]:  Some people use a utility gripper clay and others use a modeling clay.  The clay is used to hold the rice in place while performing the writing.
#[[Technical pen]]:  This is a drawing pen with an ultra-fine tip.  Most pens used are either size .18 (4x0) or .13 (6x0).  These can be purchased online, or at some arts and crafts stores.
#Waterproof Ink: This ink is sold with the technical pen.

Once the rice writing is complete, it is usually preserved in a small vial of liquid/oil.  Many craftsman mount these vials into [[jewelery]] such as necklaces, bracelets and key chains.

[[Image:Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239, January 2008]]

== History ==
The school was founded in 1918. Originally, it was located in the Lobanov-Rostovsky house, also known as "house with lions" at the corner of [[Saint Isaac's Square]] and [[Admiralteysky Prospect]]. It was one of only handful of schools to remain open during [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In 1961 the school was granted status of city's school with specialization in physics and mathematics. In 1964 the school moved to the building on Kazansky Street 48/1, which was previously occupied by school of working youth, and in 1966 it moved again to [[Moika River]], 108. Finally, in 1975 the school relocated to its current location, into the historic [[Annenschule]] building.
In 1990, the Russian Ministry of Education granted school the status of physico-mathematical lyceum and experimental laboratory for standard of education in physics, mathematics and informatics in Saint Petersburg. In 1994, the school won the [[George Soros]] grant. The US Mathematical society voted the school as one of top ten schools of former Soviet Union. The first of January 2014 the school received a status of "''Presidential'' Physics and Mathematics Lyceum №239".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15195">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''sequence learning''' is inherent to human ability because it is an integrated part of conscious and nonconscious learning as well as activities. Sequences of information or sequences of actions are used in various everyday tasks: "from sequencing sounds in speech, to sequencing movements in typing or playing instruments, to sequencing actions in driving an automobile."&lt;ref name="Clegg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Benjamin A|author2=DiGirolamo, Gregory J |author3=Keele, Steven W |title=Sequence learning|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=August 1998|volume=2|issue=8|pages=275&amp;ndash;81|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01202-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence learning can be used to study skill acquisition and in studies of various groups ranging from neuropsychological patients to infants.&lt;ref name="Clegg" /&gt; According to Ritter and Nerb, “The order in which material is presented can strongly influence what is learned, how fast performance increases, and sometimes even whether the material is learned at all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Frank E. Ritter|title=In order to learn: how the sequence of topics influences learning|series=Oxford series on cognitive models and architectures|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford/New York|isbn=978-0-19-517884-5|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence learning, more known and understood as a form of explicit learning, is now also being studied as a form of [[implicit learning]] as well as other forms of learning. Sequence learning can also be referred to as sequential behavior, behavior sequencing, and serial order in behavior.

==History==
In the first half of the 20th century, [[Margaret Floy Washburn]], [[John B. Watson]], and other [[behaviorists]] believed behavioral sequencing to be governed by the reflex chain, which states that stimulation caused by an initial movement triggers an additional movement, which triggers another additional movement, and so on. In 1951, [[Karl Lashley]], a [[neurophysiologist]] at [[Harvard University]], published “The Problem of Serial Order in Behavior,” addressing the current beliefs about sequence learning and introducing his hypothesis. He criticized the previous view on the basis of six lines of evidence: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The first line is that movements can occur even when [[sensory feedback]] is interrupted. The second is that some movement sequences occur too quickly for elements of the sequences to be triggered by feedback from the preceding elements. Next is that the errors in behavior suggest internal plans for what will be done later. Also, the time to initiate a movement sequence can increase with the length or complexity of the sequence. The next line is the properties of movements occurring early in a sequence can anticipate later features. Then lastly the neural activity can indicate preparation of upcoming behavior events, including upcoming behavior events in the relatively long-term future.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=David|author2=Rajal G. Cohen |author3=Steven A. Jax |author4=Daniel J. Weiss |author5=Robrecht van der Wel |title=The problem of serial order in behavior: Lashley’s legacy|journal=Human Movement Science|year=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=525&amp;ndash;54|doi=10.1016/j.humov.2007.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lashley argued that sequence learning, or behavioral sequencing or serial order in behavior, is not attributable to sensory feedback. Rather, he proposed that there are plans for behavior since the nervous system prepares for some behaviors but not others. He said that there was a [[hierarchical organization]] of plans. He came up with several lines of evidence. The first of these is that the context changes functional interpretations of the same behaviors, such as the way “wright, right, right, rite, and write” are interpreted based on the context of the sentence. “Right” can be interpreted as a direction or as something good depending on the context. A second line of evidence says that errors are involved in human behavior as hierarchical organization. In addition, “hierarchical organization of plans comes from the timing of behavioral sequences.” The larger the phrase, the longer the response time, which factors into “decoding” or “unpacking” hierarchical plans. Additional evidence is how easy or hard it is to learn a sequence. The mind can create a “memory for what is about to happen” as well as a “memory for what has happened.” The final evidence for the hierarchical organization of plans is characterized by [[chunking (psychology)|"chunking"]]. This skill combines multiple units into larger units.&lt;ref name= "Rosenbaum" /&gt;

==Types of sequence learning==
There are two broad categories of sequence learning&amp;mdash;explicit and implicit&amp;mdash;with subcategories. Explicit sequence learning has been known and studied since the discovery of sequence learning. However, recently, implicit sequence learning has gained more attention and research. A form of [[implicit learning]], implicit sequence learning refers to the underlying methods of learning that people are unaware of&amp;mdash;in other words, learning without knowing. The exact properties and number of mechanisms of implicit learning are debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lin|first=Hsiang-Ling Jennifer|title=Implicit sequence learning: One or two learning mechanisms?|type=MA thesis|year=1994|publisher=University of Missouri|location=Columbia, Missouri|oclc=	36106139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of implicit sequence learning include motor sequence learning, temporal sequence learning, and [[Associative Sequence Learning|associative sequence learning]].

==Sequence learning problems==
Sequence learning problems are used to better understand the different types of sequence learning. There are four basic sequence learning problems: sequence prediction, sequence generation, sequence recognition, and sequential decision making. These “problems” show how sequences are formulated. They show the patterns sequences follow and how these different sequence learning problems are related to each other.

Sequence prediction attempts to predict the next immediate element of a sequence based on all the preceding elements. Sequence generation is basically the same as sequence prediction: an attempt to piece together a sequence one by one the way it naturally occurs. Sequence recognition takes certain criteria and determines whether the sequence is legitimate. Sequential decision making or sequence generation through actions breaks down into three variations: goal-oriented, trajectory-oriented, and reinforcement-maximizing. These three variations all want to pick the action(s) or step(s) that will lead to the goal in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sun|first=Ron|title=Introduction to Sequence Learning|url=http://www.cogsci.rpi.edu/~rsun/sun.seq-intro.ps|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sequence learning problems reflect hierarchical organization of plans because each element in the sequences builds on the previous elements.

In a classic experiment published in 1967, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]] demonstrated that though subjects viewing portraits reported apprehending the portrait as a whole, their eye movements successively fixated on the most informative parts of the image. These observations suggest that underlying an apparently parallel process of face perception, a serial [[oculomotor]] process is concealed.&lt;ref&gt;Yarbus, Alfred L., "Eye movements during perception of complex objects", Yarbus, Alfred L., tr. Basil Haigh, ed. Lorrin A. Riggs, ''Eye Movements and Vision'', New York: Plenum, 1967, OCLC 220267263, ch. 7, pp. 171&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common observation that when a [[skill]] is being acquired, we are more attentive in the initial phase, but after repeated practice, the skill becomes nearly automatic;&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, P. M., "Perceptual motor skill learning", in Arthur W. Melton (ed.), ''Categories of Human Learning'', New York: Academic Press, 1964, OCLC 180195, pp. 243&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; this is also known as [[unconscious competence]]. We can then concentrate on learning a new action while performing previously learned actions skillfully. Thus, it appears that a neural code or representation for the learned skill is created in our brain, which is usually called [[procedural memory]]. The procedural memory encodes procedures or algorithms rather than facts.

==Ongoing research==
There are many other areas of application for sequence learning. How humans learn sequential procedures has been a long-standing research problem in [[cognitive science]] and currently is a major topic in [[neuroscience]]. Research work has been going on in several disciplines, including [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Ron|author2=C.

{{Cleanup reorganize|date=March 2014}}
In [[music]], '''sharp''', '''dièse''' (from [[French language|French]]), or '''diesis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]){{efn|For the etymology of the words diese and diesis, see [[Diesis]].}} means higher in pitch. More specifically, in [[musical notation]], sharp means "higher in [[pitch (music)|pitch]] by one [[semitone]] (half step)". Sharp is the opposite of [[Flat (music)|flat]], which is a lowering of pitch.

There is an associated sharp symbol which resembles "#", {{Music|sharp}}, which may be found in [[key signature]]s or as an [[accidental (music)|accidental]]. For instance, the music below has a key signature with three sharps (indicating either [[A major]] or [[F-sharp minor|F{{Music|sharp}} minor]], the [[Relative key|relative minor]]) and the note, [[A♯ (musical note)|A{{Music|sharp}}]], has a sharp accidental.

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key a \major \time 4/4 \hide Staff.TimeSignature ais1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
Moreover, under [[twelve-tone equal temperament]], B{{music|#}}, for instance, sounds the same as, or is [[enharmonically equivalent]] to, C [[natural sign|natural]] (C{{music|natural}}), and E{{music|#}} is enharmonically equivalent to F{{music|natural}}. In other [[Musical tuning#Tuning systems|tuning system]]s, such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended [[just intonation]], composer [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] uses a sharp to indicate a note is raised 70.6 [[cent (music)|cent]]s (ratio 25:24), or a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Fonville]]. "Ben Johnston's Extended Just Intonation – A Guide for Interpreters", p.109, ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer, 1991), pp. 106-137. "...the [[just chromatic semitone|25/24 ratio]] is the sharp ({{music|#}}) ratio...this raises a note approximately 70.6 cents."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], sharp can also mean "slightly higher in pitch" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the higher-pitched one (assuming the lower one is properly pitched) is "sharp" with respect to the other. Furthermore, the verb ''sharpen'' means to raise the pitch of a note, typically by a [[Comma (music)|small musical interval]].

==Variants==
'''Double sharps''' are indicated by the symbol {{Music|x}} and raise a note by two [[semitone]]s, or one [[Major second|whole tone]]. They should not be confused with a [[ghost note]].

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 \hide Staff.TimeSignature bisis1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
Less often (in for instance [[microtonal music]] [[Accidental (music)#Microtonal notation|notation]]) a score indicates other types of sharps. A '''half sharp''' raises a note by a [[quarter tone]] = 50 [[cent (music)|cents]] ({{audio|Quarter tone on C.mid|Play}}), and may be marked with various symbols including {{music|t}}. A '''sharp-and-a-half''' (or '''three-quarter-tone sharp''') raises a note by three quarter tones = 150 cents ({{audio|Neutral second on C.mid|Play}}) and may be denoted {{music|#t}}.

:'''&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 \hide Staff.TimeSignature dih1 eisih
} }

&lt;/score&gt;'''

Although very uncommon, a '''triple sharp''' ({{Music|#x}}) can sometimes be found. It raises a note by three semitones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayrton|first=William|year=1827|publisher=Samuel Leigh|ISBN=1276309457|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88IJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22double+sharp+major%22+scale#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=V|page=47|title=The Harmonicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm|title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correctly drawing and printing the sharp sign==
&lt;!--This section should have info about distinguishing the double sharp from the letter x. Please discuss this HTML comment on the talk page if there are any objections.--&gt;
The sharp symbol ({{music|sharp}}) resembles the [[number sign|number (hash or pound) sign]] (#). Both signs have two sets of parallel double-lines. However, a correctly drawn sharp sign has two slanted parallel lines that rise from left to right, to avoid obscuring the staff lines. The number sign, in contrast, has two completely horizontal strokes in this place. In addition, while the sharp also always has two perfectly vertical lines, the number sign (#) may or may not contain perfectly vertical lines (according to typeface and writing style).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Order of sharps==
{{Main|Circle of fifths}}
The order of sharps in [[key signature]] [[Modern musical symbols|notation]] is F{{music|sharp}}, C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}}, A{{music|sharp}}, E{{music|sharp}}, B{{music|sharp}}, each extra sharp being added successively in the following sequence of major keys: C→G→D→A→E→B→F{{music|sharp}}→C{{music|sharp}}. (These are sometimes learned using an [[acrostic]] phrase as a [[mnemonic]], for example '''F'''ather '''C'''harles '''G'''oes '''D'''own '''A'''nd '''E'''nds '''B'''attle or '''F'''ather '''C'''hristmas '''G'''ave '''D'''ad '''A'''n '''E'''lectric '''B'''lanket.) Similarly the order of flats is based on the same natural notes in reverse order: B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}}, F{{music|b}} ('''B'''attle '''E'''nds '''A'''nd '''D'''own '''G'''oes '''C'''harles's '''F'''ather or '''B'''lanket '''E'''xploded '''A'''nd '''D'''ad '''G'''ot '''C'''old Feet.), encountered in the following series of major keys: C→F→B{{music|b}}→E{{music|b}}→A{{music|b}}→D{{music|b}}→G{{music|b}}→C{{music|b}}.

In the above progression, key of C{{music|sharp}} major (with seven sharps) may be more conveniently written as the harmonically equivalent key D{{music|b}} major (with five flats), and likewise C{{music|b}} major (with seven flats) written as B major (with five sharps). Nonetheless, it is possible to extend the order of sharp keys yet further, through C{{music|sharp}}→G{{music|sharp}}→D{{music|sharp}}→A{{music|sharp}}→E{{music|sharp}}→B{{music|sharp}}→F{{music|x}}→C{{music|x}}, adding the double-sharped notes F{{music|x}}, C{{music|x}}, G{{music|x}}, D{{music|x}}, A{{music|x}}, E{{music|x}} and finally B{{music|x}}, and similarly for the flat keys, but with progressively decreasing convenience and usage.

The '''State Institute for Music Research''' ({{lang-de|Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung}} or ''SIMPK'') is a [[Musicology|musicological]] research facility in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] for the study of [[Musical Instruments]], [[Music History]], [[Music Theory]] and [[Music technology]]. It is an agency of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and operates the [[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum]].

==History==
The current Institute is a direct descendant of several institutions of the former [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. In 1888, a formalized collection of ancient musical instruments was established at the Prussian Royal Academy of Music. By 1902, the collection had grown substantially through the financial support of [[Wilhelm II]].  In 1919 [[Curt Sachs]], one of the founders of the field of [[organology]] (the study of musical instruments), was appointed the first Director of the instrument collection. In 1917, an Institute for Musicological Research was also founded under the patronage of [[Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe]] in [[Bückeburg]].

At the start of the [[Third Reich]] in 1933, Sachs was dismissed and forced to emigrate by the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1935 a new National Institute for German Music Research was founded in Berlin, led by [[Max Seiffert]], incorporating the old Royal College and the [[Bückeburg]] Institute. [[World War II]] then saw the nearly complete destruction of the Institute and the Museum. In 1943, the instruments, scores and library collections were evacuated from Berlin to protect them from [[Bombing of Berlin during World War II|Allied bombing]]. Despite extensive security, the majority were lost. In January 1945, "by Decree of the Reich Minister for Science, Education and Education", the Institute was closed. At war's end, only 700 of the original 4,000 musical instruments survived.

After the war, what remained of the Institute came under the direct control of the [[West Berlin]] city government and a painstaking reconstruction began, with a focus on the valuable instruments collection. In 1949 it was given accommodations at [[Charlottenburg Palace]]. On the 200th anniversary of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s death in 1950, the Institute held the first chamber music concert on historic instruments. In 1962 the Institute came under the administration of the newly created [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]], and the Department for Musical Acoustics was established in 1965 through a grant from the [[Fritz Thyssen]] Foundation. A ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone for the Institute's current building in 1979 on the [[Kulturforum]], which opened to the public in 1984.

==Organization==

===Division I: Musical Instruments Museum ===
The [[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum]] or "MIM" collects instruments from the European [[art music]] school from the 16th to the 21st century. It holds about 3,200 instruments, of which 800 can be seen on permanent display. Those that are playable are played regularly. It is one of the most representative collections in Germany in its diversity. The museum also operates a restoration workshop and has its own concert hall with an active program of chamber concerts.

===Division II: Music Theory and Music History===
This department conducts large-scale research projects in the fields of [[Music Theory]] and [[Music History]] from antiquity to the present. It also operates the Institute's library with a special focus on [[organology]] and the [[Second Viennese School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sim.spk-berlin.de/wiener_schule_301.html The conceptual plan to edit the correspondence of the Second Viennese School]&lt;/ref&gt; It also manages the German National contribution to the [[RILM]] Abstract of Music Literature. Bibliographical work of the Institute is currently organized in the form of interactive database 
[[Bibliography of Music Literature|'''BMS ''online''''']].

===Division III: Acoustics and Music technology===
This Department researches [[Recording studio]] technology, services the Institute's Electronic equipment, and manages the full digitization its resources. One major project captures the sounds of the historic musical instruments in the Museum systematically and them develops mathematical models to describe them. Recordings from concerts at the Museum are also part of the tasks of the Department. [[Digital recording]] studio space allows it to create high-quality master CDs in-house.

'''Swaffelen''' (or '''zwaffelen''') is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term meaning to hit one's [[penis]]—often repeatedly—against an object or another person's body. Swaffelen was named as the word of the year in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] in 2008.

The act of swaffelen often takes place in the form of teasing, crude humour or a degrading context, but can also be a [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]]. When the act is practised on a person, it is often the person's cheek that is hit. The penis is ideally semi-erect during the act. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Origin==
The term "swaffelen" is believed to have originated in English-speaking areas.&lt;ref name=UPI /&gt; It is believed to originate from Dutch words meaning swing, sway and swoop, as well as the German words for tail or penis (Schweif and Schwanz).&lt;ref name=UPI /&gt;&lt;ref name=Expatica /&gt;

==Media coverage==
In April 2008, the term received wide media attention in the Netherlands and Belgium,&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Binnenland/article/detail/303064/2008/04/14/Zaak-swaffelaar-erg-opgeblazen.dhtml ''Algemeen Dagblad, 14 april 2008: Zaak 'swaffelaar' erg opgeblazen."]&lt;/ref&gt; when a Dutch student Joost Wanders committed the act on the [[Taj Mahal]] and uploaded the video to [[YouTube]]. The student was suspended for this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/256983/2008/04/09/Student-van-school-wegens-swaffelen.dhtml ''Algemeen Dagblad'', 9 april 2008: "Student van school wegens 'swaffelen'."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the [[BNN (Dutch broadcaster)|BNN]] TV program ''[[Spuiten en Slikken]]'' invited viewers to make their own videos of other objects being swaffeled. They also called for a ''BNN Nationale Swaffeldag'' (''BNN National Swaffel Day'') to be declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZS4LageGlQ BNN-uitzending over de ''BNN Nationale Swaffeldag'' op YouTube.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]] and the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]] were among the objects swaffeled in the submissions.

Swaffelen received further attention when [[Australian]] folk singer [[Iain Campbell Smith]] aka Fred Smith, on his return to Australia from Afghanistan{{when|date=March 2015}} released an album entitled "Dust of Uruzgan", consisting of songs responding to the war in Afghanistan, especially his comedic song ''Niet Swaffelen op de Dixi'' about Dutch soldiers in Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2015 a firefighter in [[Enkhuizen]] was fired for swaffeling a colleague.&lt;ref name=ad.nl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kooijman|first1=Tim|title=Ontslag voor brandweerman na swaffelen van collega|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3827964/2015/01/12/Ontslag-voor-brandweerman-na-swaffelen-van-collega.dhtml|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=AD|date=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the topic of swearing in various languages arose, in episode 4, series N, of the British panel show ''[[QI]]'', one of the show's panelists, [[Jeremy Clarkson]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, mentioned the word,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=rockattack|title=Jeremy Clarkson on Dutch swear words (BBC Qi)|date=2016-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2dhjDE2Ro&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining it as meaning, ''specifically'', "...to bang your penis against The [[Taj Mahal]]."

It was featured in episode 5 of the [[Amazon Video]] show ''[[The Grand Tour (TV series)|The Grand Tour]]''.

==Word of the year==
Swaffelen was voted as the word of the year in a 2008 competition organized by [[Genootschap Onze Taal]] (Society for Our Language), Van Dale Uitgevers (Van Dale Publishers) and the newspaper [[De Pers]].&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite news|title=Dutch pick penis-shaking term as top word|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2008/12/17/Dutch-pick-penis-shaking-term-as-top-word/UPI-73411229494794/|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=UPI|date=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Expatica&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaffelen is Dutch word of the year|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Dutch-word-of-the-year-is-swaffelen.html|work=Dutch News|publisher=Expatica|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1108992.ece/Swaffelen_woord_van_het_jaar ''De Volkskrant'', 15 december 2008: "Swaffelen woord van het jaar."]&lt;/ref&gt;  The blog [[GeenStijl.nl]] encouraged readers to vote for "swaffelen".&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/270096/Swaffelen-is-de-favoriet.html ''De Pers'', 16 december 2008.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LewinTransformationNetwork.png|thumb|300px|Figure 7.9 from Lewin's ''GMIT'']] --&gt;
'''Transformational theory''' is a branch of [[music theory]] [[David Lewin]] developed in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''.  The theory—which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]]—can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]].

The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from [[musical object]]s—such as the "C [[major chord]]" or "G major chord"—to relations between objects.  Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been "transformed" into the second by the "[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation."  (Symbolically, one might write "Dominant(C major) = G major.")  While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur.  According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, "[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'" (from "Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations", hereafter GMIT, p.&amp;nbsp;159)

==Formalism==

The formal setting for Lewin's theory is a set S (or "space") of musical objects, and a set T of transformations on that space.  Transformations are modeled as functions acting on the entire space, meaning that every transformation must be applicable to every object.

Lewin points out that this requirement significantly constrains the spaces and transformations that can be considered.  For example, if the space S is the space of diatonic triads (represented by the Roman numerals I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii°), the "Dominant transformation" must be defined so as to apply to each of these triads.  This means, for example, that some diatonic triad must be selected as the "dominant" of the diminished triad on vii.  Ordinary musical discourse, however, typically holds that the "dominant" relationship is only between the I and V chords.  (Certainly, no diatonic triad is ordinarily considered the dominant of the diminished triad.)  In other words, "dominant," as used informally, is not a function that applies to all chords, but rather describes a particular relationship between two of them.

There are, however, any number of situations in which "transformations" can extend to an entire space.  Here, transformational theory provides a degree of abstraction that could be a significant music-theoretical asset.  One transformational network can describe the relationships among musical events in more than one musical excerpt, thus offering an elegant way of relating them.  For example, figure 7.9 in Lewin's GMIT can describe the first phrases of both the first and third movements of [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21]].  In this case, the transformation graph's objects are the same in both excerpts from the Beethoven Symphony, but this graph could apply to many more musical examples when the object labels are removed.  Further, such a transformational network that gives only the intervals between pitch classes in an excerpt may also describe the differences in the relative durations of another excerpt in a piece, thus succinctly relating two different domains of music analysis.  Lewin's observation that only the transformations, and not the objects on which they act, are necessary to specify a transformational network is the main benefit of transformational analysis over traditional object-oriented analysis.

==Transformations as functions==

The "transformations" of transformational theory are typically modeled as functions that act over some musical space S, meaning that they are entirely defined by their inputs and outputs: for instance, the "ascending major third" might be modeled as a function that takes a particular pitch class as input and outputs the pitch class a major third above it.

However, several theorists have pointed out that ordinary musical discourse often includes more information than functions.&lt;ref name=CQT&gt;Clifton Callender, Ian Quinn, and Dmitri Tymoczko. "Generalized Voice Leading Spaces," Science 320: 346-348.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a single pair of pitch classes (such as C and E) can stand in multiple relationships: E is both a major third above C and a minor sixth below it.  (This is analogous to the fact that, on an ordinary clockface, the number 4 is both four steps clockwise from 12 and 8 steps counterclockwise from it.)  For this reason, theorists such as [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] have proposed replacing Lewinnian "pitch class intervals" with "paths in pitch class space."&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL"&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri, "Scale Theory, Serial Theory, and Voice Leading," Music Analysis 27/1 (2008), 1-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, this suggests that there are situations where it might not be useful to model musical motion ("transformations" in the intuitive sense) using functions ("transformations" in the strict sense of Lewinnian theory).

Another issue concerns the role of "distance" in transformational theory.  In the opening pages of GMIT, Lewin suggests that a subspecies of "transformations" (namely, musical intervals) can be used to model "directed measurements, distances, or motions ".  However, the mathematical formalism he uses—which models "transformations" by group elements—does not obviously represent distances, since group elements are not typically considered to have size.  (Groups are typically individuated only up to isomorphism, and isomorphism does not necessarily preserve the "sizes" assigned to group elements.)  Theorists such as Ed Gollin, Dmitri Tymoczko, and Rachel Hall, have all written about this subject, with Gollin attempting to incorporate "distances" into a broadly Lewinnian framework.

Tymoczko's "Generalizing Musical Intervals"&lt;ref name="Tymoczko GMI"&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri, "Generalizing Musical Intervals," Journal of Music Theory 53/2 (2009): 227–254.&lt;/ref&gt; contains one of the few extended critiques of transformational theory, arguing (1) that intervals are sometimes "local" objects that, like vectors, cannot be transported around a musical space; (2) that musical spaces often have boundaries, or multiple paths between the same points, both prohibited by Lewin's formalism; and (3) that transformational theory implicitly relies on notions of distance extraneous to the formalism as such.

==Reception==

Although transformation theory is more than thirty years old, it did not become a widespread theoretical or analytical pursuit until the late 1990s.  Following Lewin's revival (in GMIT) of [[Hugo Riemann]]'s three contextual inversion operations on triads ([[Parallel key|parallel]], [[Relative key|relative]], and Leittonwechsel) as formal transformations, the branch of transformation theory called [[Neo-Riemannian theory]] was popularized by Brian Hyer (1995), Michael Kevin Mooney (1996), [[Richard Cohn]] (1997), and an entire issue of the ''[[Journal of Music Theory]]'' (42/2, 1998).  Transformation theory has received further treatment by [[Fred Lerdahl]] (2001), [[Julian Hook]] (2002), David Kopp (2002), and many others.

The status of transformational theory is currently a topic of debate in music-theoretical circles.  Some authors, such as Ed Gollin, [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] and Julian Hook, have argued that Lewin's transformational formalism is too restrictive, and have called for extending the system in various ways.  Others, such as [[Richard Cohn]] and Steven Rings, while acknowledging the validity of some of these criticisms, continue to use broadly Lewinnian techniques.

'''''War and Peace in the Global Village''''' by [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Quentin Fiore]] is a collage of images and text that illustrates the effects of electronic media and new technology on man.  Marshall McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a major inspiration for this study of war throughout history as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future. (1st Ed.: Bantam, NY; reissued by [[Gingko Press]], 2001  {{ISBN|1-58423-074-6}}),

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves portmanteaus of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

The '''wetted perimeter''' is the perimeter of the cross sectional area that is "wet".&lt;ref name="Knighton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knighton|first=David|title=Fluvial forms and processes: a new perspective|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|date=1998|isbn=978-0340663134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term wetted perimeter is common in [[Civil Engineering|civil engineering]], [[Environmental Engineering|environmental engineering]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]], and [[heat transfer]] applications; it is associated with the [[hydraulic diameter]] or [[hydraulic radius]]. Engineers commonly cite the cross sectional area of a river.

The wetted perimeter can be defined mathematically as 
:&lt;math&gt;P = \sum_{i=0}^\infty{l_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''l&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the length of each surface in contact with the aqueous body.

In [[open channel flow]], the wetted perimeter is defined as the surface of the channel bottom and sides in direct contact with the aqueous body. [[Friction]] losses typically increase with an increasing wetted perimeter, resulting in a decrease in [[Hydraulic head|head]].&lt;ref name="Knighton" /&gt; In a practical experiment, one is able to measure the wetted perimeter with a tape measure weighted down to the river bed to get a more accurate [[measurement]].

When a channel is much wider than it is deep, the wetted perimeter approximates the channel width.&lt;ref name="Knighton" /&gt;

The '''Woods Hole Research Center''' (WHRC) is a scientific research organization that studies climate change impacts and solutions. WHRC was named the world's top climate change think tank for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 by the International Center for Climate Governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20160701/NEWS/160709923|title=Woods Hole think tank takes top spot on climate change|last=Driscoll|first=Sean|date=July 1, 2016|work=Cape Cod Times|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center conducts research on the causes and impacts of climate change throughout the tropics, the Arctic, and North America. All of WHRC's work is designed to inform policy or answer policy questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whrc.org/our-work/interactive-map/|title=Woods Hole Research Center - Where We Work|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Woods Hole Research Center|access-date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/12/09/a-paris-climate-agreement-is-supposed-to-help-save-the-planet-but-the-planet-may-have-other-ideas/|title=How the Earth itself could undermine a Paris climate agreement|last=Mooney|first=Chris|date=December 9, 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gustavo-silvachavez/forests-emerge-as-a-big-w_b_8793226.html|title=Forests Emerge as a Big Winner in Paris Agreement|last=Silva-Chavez|first=Gustavo|date=December 12, 2015|work=Huffington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
WHRC's mission is to advance scientific discovery and seek science-based solutions for the world’s environmental and economic challenges through research and education.

== History ==
The Woods Hole Research Center was established in 1985 in [[Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]] by [[George Woodwell]]. WHRC was one of the first organizations dedicated to fighting global climate change and Woodwell testified to Congress in 1986 about the dangers of sea level rise and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/06/11/30-years-ago-scientists-warned-congress-on-global-warming-what-they-said-sounds-eerily-familiar/|title=30 years ago scientists warned Congress on global warming. What they said sounds eerily familiar|last=Mooney|first=Chris|date=June 11, 2016|work=Washington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan for developing the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] was drafted at the Woods Hole Research Center in the late 1980s by Woodwell and Kiliparti Ramakrishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://capeandislands.org/post/paris-agreement-effect-much-work-remains-stabilize-climate#stream/0|title=Paris Agreement in Effect, But Much Work Remains to Stabilize Climate|last=Goldstone|first=Heather|date=November 7, 2016|work=WCAI|access-date=January 4, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Dr. [[John P. Holdren]] became the director and he continued to lead the organization until he was appointed as President Obama's science advisor in 2009.  Holdren returned to WHRC as a senior advisor in 2017 after President Obama left office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20170302/former-obama-science-adviser-returns-to-cape|title=Former Obama science adviser returns to Cape|last=Fraser|first=Doug|work=capecodtimes.com|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's current president is Dr. Philip Duffy, a physicist who was formerly the White House [[National Science and Technology Council]]’s Senior Advisor to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://capeandislands.org/post/meet-directors-three-new-presidents-take-helm-woods-hole#stream/0|title=Meet the Directors: Three New Presidents Take the Helm in Woods Hole|last=Goldstone|first=Heather|date=November 2, 2015|work=WCAI|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHRC has about 60 staff members. 
[[File:WHRC.jpg|thumb|The Woods Hole Research Center headquarters in Falmouth, MA]]
The Center’s Gilman Ordway Campus, located on Cape Cod in the town of [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]], was completed in 2004. The {{convert|19300|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building is composed of a renovated summer estate (ca. 1874) and a new wing. The campus is [[Energy neutral design|energy neutral]], with renewable power generated by a 100kW wind turbine, as well as rooftop photo-voltaic power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whrc.org/about-whrc/environmentally-friendly-campus/|title=Environmentally-Friendly Campus – Woods Hole Research Center|website=whrc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newby-McMahon Building''', commonly referred to as the '''world's littlest skyscraper''', is located at 701 La Salle (on the corner of Seventh and La Salle streets) in downtown [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]]. This late [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style red brick and [[cast stone]] structure is {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall,&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; and its exterior dimensions are {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt; Its interior dimensions are approximately {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}}, or approximately {{convert|108|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Steep, narrow, internal stairways leading to the upper floors occupy roughly 25 percent of the interior area.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

Reportedly the result of a fraudulent investment scheme by a [[Confidence trick|confidence man]], the Newby-McMahon Building was a source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents after its completion in 1919. During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in [[Robert Ripley]]'s ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper," a nickname that has stuck with it ever since. The Newby-McMahon Building is now part of the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Wichita County, Texas|Depot Square Historic District]] of Wichita Falls, a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]].

==Background==
A large [[petroleum reservoir]] was discovered just west of the city of [[Burkburnett, Texas|Burkburnett]], a small town in [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita County]], Texas in 1912.&lt;ref name=Kelly1982/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olien2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart2010/&gt; Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became [[boomtown]]s, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative [[oil field]], and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and [[mineral rights]] deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;

==Proposal and blueprints==
The Newby-McMahon Building is a four-story brick building located near the railroad depot in downtown Wichita Falls, built in 1906 by Augustus Newby (1855–1909),&lt;ref name=WDT1909/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; a director of the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City Railway Company.&lt;ref name=OK1898/&gt; The oil-rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon, a [[Landman (oil worker)|petroleum landman]] and [[structural engineer]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;

According to local legend,&lt;ref name=Kelso2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Texas Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff|edition=3rd|chapter=North Texas|page=112|author=Kelso J|publisher=Morris Book Publishing|location=Kearney, Nebraska|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7627-4109-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gW9ye7wu0E0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Texas+Curiosities:+Quirky+Characters,+Roadside+Oddities+%26+Other+Offbeat+Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; when McMahon announced in 1919 that he would build a highrise annex to the Newby Building as a solution to the newly wealthy city's urgent need for office space, investors were eager to invest in the project.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010725/&gt;&lt;ref name=TAC20000915/&gt; McMahon collected $200,000 (US ${{Inflation|US|200000|1919|r=-5|fmt=c}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in [[Financial capital|investment capital]] from this group of naive investors, promising to construct a highrise office building across the street from the [[St. James Hotel (Wichita Falls, Texas)|St. James Hotel]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN20091230/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

The key to McMahon's swindle, and his successful defense in the ensuing lawsuit, was that he never verbally stated that the actual height of the building would be {{convert|480|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fodors2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; The proposed skyscraper depicted in the blueprints that he distributed (and which were approved by the investors) was clearly labeled as consisting of four floors and {{convert|480|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Construction and ensuing legal battle==
McMahon used his own construction crews to build the McMahon Building on the small, unused piece of property next to the Newby Building, without obtaining prior consent from the owner of the property, who lived in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; As the building began to take shape, the investors realized they had been swindled into purchasing a four-story edifice that was only {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, rather than the {{convert|480|ft|m|abbr=on}} structure they were expecting.

They brought a lawsuit against McMahon, but to their dismay, the real estate and construction deal was declared legally binding by a local judge &amp;ndash; as McMahon had built exactly according to the blueprints they had approved, no legal remedy was available for the deceived investors.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; They did recover a small portion of their investment from the elevator company, which refused to honor the contract after they learned of the confidence trick. No stairway was installed in the building upon its initial completion, as none was included in the original blueprints. Rather, a ladder was employed to gain access to the upper three floors.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt; By the time construction was complete, McMahon had left Wichita Falls and perhaps even Texas, taking with him the balance of the investors' money.&lt;ref name=Pohlen2006/&gt;

==Early occupancy and subsequent abandonment==
Upon its completion and opening in 1919, the Newby-McMahon Building was an immediate source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20010327/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20040506/&gt; The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; Throughout most of the 1920s, the building housed only two firms.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt; During the 1920s, the Newby-McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' syndicated column as "the world's littlest skyscraper", which is a name that has stuck with it ever since.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990917/&gt;

The oil industry would ultimately prove to be a [[resource curse]] to Wichita Falls, and the [[Texas Oil Boom]] ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the [[Great Depression]] struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20021208/&gt;

After the Great Depression, the building housed a succession of tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because a sufficient number of local residents came to its defense.&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As the building continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.&lt;ref name=ARN19980820/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt;

==Purchase and renovation==
By 1999, the Newby-McMahon Building had proved to be an excessive burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS.&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990810/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991018/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN19991020/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20000806/&gt; The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building.&lt;ref name=Stowers2008/&gt; Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building.&lt;ref name=Bundy/&gt; In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $3,748.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20001216/&gt;

On June 11, 2003, a storm swept through Wichita Falls, bringing gusts of wind as strong as {{convert|97|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. A 15-ft (4.6-m) section of brick wall from the McMahon Building complex was knocked down.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20030614/&gt; The damage from this storm was repaired, but full restoration of the building and the adjacent Newby Building was delayed until late 2005. In June of that year, the City Council granted $25,000 in funds from the city's [[tax increment financing]] fund, to be invested in the restoration of the McMahon Building.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt; Restoration of the building is estimated to have cost more than $254,000, the remainder of which was paid by the owners (Bundy, Young, Sims &amp; Potter, Inc. and Marvin Groves Electric).&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050619/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050622/&gt;

[[File:Newby-McMahon Building-02.jpg|thumb|alt=|Plaque attached to the Newby-McMahon Building, also known as the "world's littlest skyscraper". This plaque refers to the building adjacent to the "skyscraper" which was completed in 1906, the "skyscraper" building was completed in 1919.]]

With the passage of time, the Newby-McMahon Building has become a monument to a long-gone era. It has survived tornadoes, a fire, and decades of neglect to stand as a monument to the greed, genius, graft, and gullibility of the [[oil boom]] days of [[North Texas]].&lt;ref name=OConnor1986/&gt; The building is currently part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls,&lt;ref name=TSOT0721/&gt; which has been declared a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|Texas Historic Landmark]] and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=WFTRN19990319/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Depot Square Historic District |work=Texas Historic Sites Atlas |publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]] |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=2003001552 |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has never met the criteria for the definition of a [[skyscraper]],&lt;ref name=ESN24419/&gt; nor even that of a "[[Tower block|highrise]]" building.&lt;ref name=ESN18727/&gt; After its renovation, the building was home to an antiques dealership, the Antique Wood, which opened in 2006 on the ground floor.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20050728/&gt;&lt;ref name=WFTRN20070326/&gt; Since 2013, besides being a local tourist attraction, a furniture and home décor consignment boutique, Hello Again has occupied the entire building.  At times, floors of the skyscraper have been subleased to various local artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGinnis|first1=Judith|title=Downtown retail future gets boost from the past|publisher=Wichita Falls Times Record News|date=Feb 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newby-McMahon Building is among several historic buildings featured in the documentary film ''Wichita Falls: The Future of Our Past'', a retrospective analysis of the city's architectural past produced in 2006 by Barry Levy, a public information officer with the city of Wichita Falls.&lt;ref name=WFTRN20061202/&gt;
&lt;!--A document written by Delores Mathews and updated by Ruth E. Reuther gives more of the history of the building.--&gt;
