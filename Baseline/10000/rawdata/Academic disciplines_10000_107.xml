===Uptime Institute history===
Founded in 1987 by Kenneth G. Brill, the Uptime Institute was founded as an industry proponent to help owners and operators quantify and qualify their ability to provide a predictable level of performance from data centers, regardless of the status of external factors, such as power utilities. In 2009, the Uptime Institute was acquired by ''The 451 Group'' .&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22408554 Company Overview of The 451 Group LLC] at ''investing.businessweek.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the Seattle-based Uptime Institute has been an independent division of ''The 451 Group''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.451research.com/our-company The 451 Group - Our Company] at 451research.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uptime Institute tier certifications===
The Uptime Institute's [[Data center#Data center tiers|data center tier concepts]] have grown from a simple publication in the late 1990s of the ''Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance'' white paper &lt;ref&gt;[https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology/ Tier Classifications Define Site Infrastructure Performance]&lt;/ref&gt; to a globally recognized standard guiding design and investment for data centers globally. The data center Tier standards are a standardized methodology used to determine availability in a facility. It offers companies a way to measure [[return on investment]] (ROI) and define desired levels of delivered performance. As of 2017, more than 1000 data centers worldwide have formally certified their data centers using the Tier standard.

There are two parts of the Tier certification process:
*Tier Certification of Design Documents - typically the first step in the Tier process and used to align the design and construction of a new facility with an organization's business needs.
*Tier Certification of Constructed Facility - the final part of the process which assures that the actual constructed data centers delivers the results specified in the Tier Standard: Topology specification.

The Tier certifications are awarded in four levels:
*Tier IV - Fault tolerant site infrastructure
*Tier III - Concurrently maintainable site infrastructure
*Tier II - Redundant capacity components site infrastructure (redundant)
*Tier I - Basic site infrastructure (non-redundant)
The full Tier Standard:Topology is available on the Uptime Institute website&lt;ref&gt;https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/asset/tier-standard-topology&lt;/ref&gt;

Other design standards have been created by various industry groups over the years. All of these other specifications share the common trait that they are self-certified and the author of the specification does not get involved with the certification/assurance of standard compliance.  One such standard is [[Telecommunications Industry Association|Telecommunications Industry Association's]] standard, [[TIA-942]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?currency_code=USD&amp;customer_id=2125442B2B0A&amp;oshid=2125442B2C0A&amp;shopping_cart_id=292558332D4B50304F5A3D3F2C0A&amp;country_code=US&amp;lang_code=ENGL&amp;item_s_key=00414811&amp;item_key_date=940819&amp;input_doc_number=TIA-942&amp;input_doc_title= TIA-942 TIA-942 Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers] at ''ihs.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Uptime Institute and TIA agree on clear separation between their respective bench-marking systems to avoid industry confusion and drive accountability.&lt;ref&gt;http://uptimeinstitute.com/component/content/article/8-certifications/203-tiersvstia2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Occupational hazards}}
[[File:DIN 4844-2 D-P009.svg|alt=A red no symbol over a hand reaching towards a bolt of electricity symbol|thumb|This [[Electric shock|electrical hazard]] [[warning sign]] used in Germany is an example of an administrative control.]]

'''Administrative controls''' are training, procedure, policy, or shift designs that lessen the threat of a hazard to an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-125/pdfs/2009-125.pdf|title=Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology|last=|first=|date=March 2009|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|publisher=|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative controls typically change the behavior of people (e.g., factory workers) rather than removing the actual hazard or providing [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE).

Administrative controls are fourth in larger [[hierarchy of hazard controls]], which ranks the effectiveness and efficiency of hazard controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative controls are more effective than PPE because they involve some manner of prior planning and avoidance, whereas PPE only serves only as a final barrier between the hazard and worker. Administrative controls are second lowest because they require workers or employers to actively think or comply with regulations and do not offer permanent solutions to problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy10/sh-20839-10/hierarchy_of_controls.pdf|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|publisher=|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, administrative controls are cheaper to begin, but they may become more expensive over time as higher failure rates and the need for constant training or re-certification eclipse the initial investments of the three more desirable hazard controls in the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/|title=Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] recommends administrative controls when hazards cannot be [[Hazard elimination|removed]] or [[Hazard substitution|changed]], and [[engineering controls]] are not practical.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some common examples of administrative controls include work practice controls such as prohibiting mouth [[pipette|pipetting]] and recapping of needles, as well as rotating [[Shift work|worker shifts]] in coal mines to prevent hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-100/pdf/2017-100.pdf|title=NIOSH Chemical Carcinogen Policy|last=|first=|date=December 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dllr.state.md.us/labor/bbp/bbpwpcon.shtml|title=Guidelines and Instructions for Developing a Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan|last=|first=|date=March 2010|website=[[Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation]]|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/s&amp;hinfo/noisetoolboxes/Administrative%20Controls.ppt|title=Administrative Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=20030605&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=1&amp;View=f&amp;|title=Administrative controls for reducing worker noise exposures|last=Bauer|first=ER|last2=Babich|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[hours of service]] regulations for commercial vehicle operators,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/administrativecontrols.html|title=Administrative Controls|last=|first=|date=25 July 2016|website=Interactive Learning Paradigms Incorporated|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warning sign|warning signage]] for hazards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ehs.iu.edu/docs/LCSP-Part-06---2.0-Control-Measures.pdf|title=Control Measures|last=|first=|date=|website=Environmental Health and Safety – Bloomington [[Indiana University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215075131/http://ehs.iu.edu/docs/LCSP-Part-06---2.0-Control-Measures.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regular maintenance of equipment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/hazard_control.html|title=Hazard Control|last=|first=|date=17 March 2017|website=[[Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]]|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See [[Risala (disambiguation)]] for other books known as "Ar-Risala".''
The '''''Risāla''''' by  [[Al-Shafi‘i|ash-Shafi'i]] (d. 820), full title ''Kitab ar-Risāla fī Uṣūl al-Fiqh'' ({{lang-ar| كتاب الرسالة في أصول الفقه}} "book of the communication on the foundations of  comprehension (i.e. [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]])") is a seminal text on the [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]]

The word ''risāla'' in Arabic means a "message" or "letter, communication". Shafi'i's treatise received its name owing to a traditional, though unverified, story that Shafi'i composed the work in response to a request from a leading [[Hadith studies|traditionist]] in [[Basra]], [https://bewley.virtualave.net/mad18.html ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Mahdī]; the story goes that Ibn Mahdī wanted Shafi'i to explain the legal significance of the [[Quran]] and the [[Sunnah|sunna]], and the ''Risāla'' was Shafi'i's response.&lt;ref name=majid&gt;''Islamic Jurisprudence: Shafi'i's Risala'', trans. by [[Majid Khadduri]], Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1961, pp. 19-21 (Translator's Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this work, al-Shafi'i is said to have outlined four sources of [[Sharia|Islamic law]],&lt;ref name=majid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, William H., and Marilyn Robinson Waldman.  ''The Islamic World''.  University of Chicago Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; though this division based on four has been attributed to later commentators on the work rather than to Shafi'i himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Does Shafi'i Have a Theory of 'Four Sources' of Law?, taken from the PhD dissertation of Joseph E. Lowry, ''The Legal-Theoretical Content of the Risala of Muhammad B. Idris al-Shafi'i'', [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Shafi'i is  said he revised and re-read Al-Risala four hundred times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haddad|first1=G. F.|title=Imam Shafi`i|url=http://islamqa.org/shafii/qibla-shafii/34146|website=islamqa.org|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

# Introduction
# On al-Bayān (Perspicuous Declaration)
# On Legal Knowledge
# On the Book of God
# On the Obligation of Man to Accept the Authority of the Prophet
# On the Abrogation of Divine Legislation
# On Duties
# On the Nature of God's Orders of Prohibition and the Prophet's Orders of Prohibition
# On Traditions
# On Single-Individual Traditions
# On Consensus (Ijmā‘)
# On Analogy (Qiyās)
# On Personal Reasoning (Ijtihād)
# On Juristic Preference (Istiḥsān)
# On Disagreement (Ikhtilāf)

The above list of contents follows Khadduri's translation. However, Khadduri rearranged the treatise in two places. Khadduri's chapters 8 and 3 (in that order) both follow Shafi'i's chapter on Traditions in the original. Khadduri rearranged those chapters because they did "not appear to fit into the logical order of the book."&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, p. 53 (Translator's Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one wishes to read Khadduri's translation while following Shafi'i's original arrangement, one can read the chapters in the following order: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

==Sources of law in ''Al-Risāla''==
The primary sources of law attributed to Shafi'is book are the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]]. Most Muslim commentators have also referred to Shafi'is sections on [[Ijma|consensus]] and [[Qiyas|analogical reason]] as comprising legal sources.&lt;ref name=majid/&gt;

On the question of consensus, Shafi'i obligated affirmation of all living Muslims - both the learned and the laymen - in order to declare a true consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, Introduction to Shafi'i's Risala, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Later followers of his school considered this to be practically impossible, and thus expanded upon the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, pp. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandria University''' ({{lang-ar|جامعة الإسكندرية}}) is a public university in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. It was established in 1938 as a satellite of [[Cairo University|Fouad University]] (the name of which was later changed to Cairo University), becoming an independent entity in 1942. It was known as Farouk University until the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] when its name was changed to the University of Alexandria. [[Taha Hussein]] was the founding [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of Alexandria University. It is now the second largest university in Egypt and has many affiliations to various universities for ongoing [[research]].

This kind of table was unknown at the time and place of the [[Last Supper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artinsociety.com/on-the-trail-of-the-last-supper.html |first=Philip |last=McCouat |title=On the trail of the last supper |work=Journal of Art in Society |year=2014 |accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''anachronism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}} {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}}, "against" and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|khronos}}, "time") is a [[chronology|chronological]] inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of persons, events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period in time that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.

An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.

==Types== 
[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]

=== Parachronism &lt;!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''parachronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|παρά}}, "on the side", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).

This may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion.

Examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era—with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.

=== Prochronism &lt;!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here--&gt;===
A '''prochronism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πρό}}, "before", and {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, "time") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.

===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===
The intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.

[[Image:Constantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|thumb|''Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns Become Brothers'': 19th-century flags in 16th-century scene]]
== Politically motivated anachronism ==
Some writings and works of art promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]—two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history—with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s. Here anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made.

== Art and literature ==
[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. It is only since the close of the 18th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Sir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: "It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. "Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; "Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker."&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anachronism can also be an aesthetic choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronisms abound in the works of [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Raphael Santi: His Life and His Works|last=von Wolzogen|first=Alfred Freiherr|publisher=[[Smith, Elder &amp; Co.]]|year=1866|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZhAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare and the Uses of Antiquity: An Introductory Essay|last=Martindale |first=Michelle |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2005 |isbn=9781134848508 |pages=121–125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDwrK5FNnN0C&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Anachronisms can exist in ancient texts. [[Carol Meyers]] says that these anachronisms can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/14/276782474/the-genesis-of-camels |title=Archaeology Find: Camels In 'Bible' Are Literary Anachronisms|last=Montagne|first=Renee |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2014-02-14|accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as Roman legionaries that wear leather armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-03-31/time-meddlers-anachronisms-in-print-and-on-film|title=Time meddlers: anachronisms in print and on film|last=Cole|first=Tom|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumb|[[Dinosaurs]] co-existing with [[hominid]]s, as here in ''[[The Flintstones]]'', is a relatively common anachronistic depiction in comics and animated cartoons.]]
=== Comical anachronism ===
[[Comedy]] fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174969-hollywood-history-and-the-art-of-the-big-anachronism/|title=Hollywood, History, and the Art of the Big Anachronism|last=van Riper|first=A. Bowdoin|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future anachronism === &lt;!-- Section is linked from the redirected [Future anachronism] article; use caution. --&gt;
{{see also|Retrofuturism}}
[[File:Amazing_stories_193107.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In the future envisioned on this 1931 cover of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', [[Propeller (aeronautics) |propeller airplanes]] would coexist with [[space technology]] advanced enough for a large-scale [[colonization of Mars]].]]

Even with careful research, [[science fiction]] writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political and technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction|last1=Athans|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Athans|last2=Salvatore|first2=R. A.|authorlink2=R. A. Salvatore|publisher=[[Adams Media]]|year=2010|isbn=9781440507298|pages=167–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9l5JO_FM6cC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, many books and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the [[Soviet Union]], to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia as [[Leningrad]], to [[Cold War|the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs]] and to [[History of Germany (1945–90)|divided Germany and divided Berlin]]. ''[[Star Trek]]'' has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of "[[Retroactive continuity|retconning]]" these errors, the [[Star Trek (film)|2009 film]] retained them for consistency with older franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/living-the-star-trek-life/|title=Living the Star Trek life|last=Glaskowsky|first=Peter|work=[[CNET]]|date=2009-05-08|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Buildings or natural features, such as the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], can become out of place once they disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/12/06/AR2005033116653.html|title='Empire': Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language anachronism ===
[[Language]] anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/26/172955182/historical-vocab-when-we-get-it-wrong-does-it-matter|title=Historical Vocab: When We Get It Wrong, Does It Matter?|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, we [[Suspension of disbelief|willingly accept]] characters speaking an updated language, and modern [[slang]] and figures of speech are often used in these films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-3-26-00-on-language-anachronism.html|title=The Way We Live Now: 3-26-00: On Language; Anachronism |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2000-03-26|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subconscious anachronism==
[[File:RR5011-0017R.gif|thumbnail|right|A Russian commemorative coin depicting the meeting of Soviet and American troops at [[Torgau]] in 1945 shows the 50-star [[flag of the United States of America]], a flag not in use until 1960. The US flag used during the Second World War had 48 stars.]]

Unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the recorder's perspective is conditioned by the assumptions and practices of his or her own times (a form of [[cultural bias]]). One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time travel==
The extensive science fiction subgenre depicting [[Time travel in fiction| time travel]] in effect consists of deliberate, consciously created anachronisms, letting people of one time meet and interact with those of another time. Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.

== In academia ==
In historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.

The use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Detection of anachronism==

The ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. [[Anthony Grafton]] discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], of [[Isaac Casaubon]] (1559–1614), and of [[Richard August Reitzenstein|Richard Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the "[[Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]]", through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms.&lt;ref&gt;Grafton 1990, pp. 75–98.&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of [[diplomatics]], the critical analysis of the forms of documents, developed by the [[Maurist]] scholar [[Jean Mabillon]] (1632–1707) and his successors [[René-Prosper Tassin]] (1697–1777) and [[Charles-François Toustain]] (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The falsehood of a writing will often be detected, by its making direct mention of, or allusions more or less indirect to, some fact posterior to the date which it bears. ... ''The mention of posterior facts;'' – first indication of forgery.&lt;br&gt;

In a living language there are always variations in words, in the meaning of words, in the construction of phrases, in the manner of spelling, which may detect the age of a writing, and lead to legitimate suspicions of forgery. ... ''The use of words not used till after the date of the writing;'' – second indication of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeremy |last=Bentham |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham |title=A Treatise on Judicial Evidence |editor-first=Étienne |editor-last=Dumont |editor-link=Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont |place=London |publisher=Baldwin, Cradock and Joy |year=1825 |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMsDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exposure by [[Lorenzo Valla]] in 1440 of the so-called [[Donation of Constantine]], a decree purportedly issued by the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]] in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of [[Constantinople]] (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD). A large number of apparent [[anachronisms in the Book of Mormon]] have served to convince critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America. The use of 19th- and 20th-century [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] terminology demonstrates that the purported "[[Franklin Prophecy]]" (attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]], who died in 1790) is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/franklin_prophecy/print.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Myth: The Franklin "Prophecy" |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ""[[William Lynch speech]]", an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as "program" and "refueling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |last=Cobb |first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41764">'''Ancient Egyptian technology''' describes devices and technologies invented or used in [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many [[simple machines]], such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] and the [[lever]], to aid construction processes. They used [[rope]] [[truss]]es to stiffen the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of ships. Egyptian [[paper]], made from [[papyrus]], and [[ancient Egyptian pottery|pottery]] were mass-produced and exported throughout the [[Mediterranean]] basin. The [[wheel]] was used for a number of purposes, but [[chariots]] only came into use after the [[Second Intermediate period]]. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean [[maritime history|maritime]] technology including [[ship]]s and [[lighthouse]]s.

==Technology in Dynastic Egypt==
Significant advances in [[ancient Egypt]] during the [[History of ancient Egypt|dynastic period]] include [[astronomy]], [[Egyptian mathematics|mathematics]], and [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medicine]]. Their [[geometry]] was a necessary outgrowth of [[surveying]] to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the [[Nile river]]. The 3,4,5 [[right triangle]] and other rules of thumb served to represent rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt also was a center of [[Alchemy#Alchemy in Ancient Egypt|alchemy]] research for much of the western world.

===Paper and writing===
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|222px|A section of the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]], which is written and drawn on papyrus]]
The word ''paper'' comes from the Greek term for the ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[writing material]] called [[papyrus]], which was formed from beaten strips of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus plants]]. Papyrus was produced in Egypt as early as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, and was sold to ancient [[Greece]] and [[Rome]]. The establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] limited the supply of papyrus for others. According to the Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] ([[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] records, xiii.21), as a result of this, [[parchment]] was invented under the patronage of [[Eumenes II of Pergamon]] to build his rival library at [[Pergamon]]. However, this is a myth; [[parchment]] had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], a [[phonetic]] [[writing system]], served as the basis for the [[Phoenician alphabet]] from which later alphabets, such as Hebrew, Greek and Latin were derived. With this ability, writing and record keeping, the Egyptians developed one of the —if not ''the''— first [[Decimal|decimal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers. Page 162 (cf., "''As we have seen, Sumer used a sexagesimal base; whereas the system of Ancient Egypt was strictly decimal.''")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E Krebs, 
Groundbreaking scientific experiments, inventions, and discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Page 127. {{ISBN|0-313-32433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Little Heath, Manual of Greek Mathematics. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Alexandria]] retained preeminence for its records and scrolls with its [[Library of Alexandria|library]]. This ancient library was damaged by fire when it fell under Roman rule,&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Caesar'' 49.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and was destroyed completely by 642&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]] (1203): "the library which [[Amr ibn al-A'as|'Amr ibn al-'As]] burnt with the permission of '[[Umar]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Europe: A History'', p 139. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1996. {{ISBN|0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; With it, a vast supply of antique literature, history, and knowledge was lost.

===Structures and construction===

====Tools====
Some of the older tools used in the construction of Egyptian housing included reeds and clay. According to Lucas and Harris, “reeds were plastered with clay in order to keep out of heat and cold more effectually”. &lt;ref&gt;A. Lucas and J. Harris, "Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries" (New York: Courier Corporation, 2012), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tools that were used were "limestone, chiseled stones, wooden mallets, and stone hammers". &lt;ref&gt;A. Lucas and J. Harris, "Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries" (New York: Courier Corporation, 2012), 64.&lt;/ref&gt; With these tools, ancient Egyptians were able to create more than just housing, but also sculptures of their gods, goddesses, pyramids, etc.

====Buildings====
Many [[Egyptian temple|temple]]s from Ancient Egypt are  not standing today. Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, [[Hatshepsut]], were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh [[Tutankamun]]'s rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewellery and antiques. In some late myths, [[Ptah]] was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. [[Imhotep]], who was included in the [[Egyptian pantheon]], was the first documented engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |title=What is Civil Engineering: Imhotep |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112195627/http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |archivedate=2008-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] on the island of Pharos.]]
In [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], [[lighthouse]] technology was developed, the most famous example being the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]]. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247&amp;nbsp;BC) on the island of Pharos in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.

====Monuments====
{{main|Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}
The Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential [[civilization]]s in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the [[pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Great Sphinx]]—among the largest and most famous buildings in the world.

[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|222px|thumb|Giza Plateau, Cairo. Khafre's pyramid in the background]]
The most famous [[pyramid]]s are the [[Egyptian pyramids]]—huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as [[tomb]]s for [[pharaoh]]s. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as ''mer'', literally "place of ascendance." The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over {{convert|13|acre|m2}} in area. It is one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.

The [[Red Pyramid]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of [[Egyptian pyramids]]. [[Menkaure's Pyramid]], likely dating to the same era, was constructed of [[limestone]] and granite blocks. The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (c. [[26th century BC|2580 BC]]) contains a huge granite [[sarcophagus]] fashioned of "Red [[Aswan]] Granite." The mostly ruined [[Black Pyramid]] dating from the reign of [[Amenemhat III]] once had a polished granite [[pyramidion]] or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] (see [[Dahshur]]). Other uses in [[Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Mosques/CAIRO_Rocks_1.htm eeescience utoledo.edu : Cairo Rocks]&lt;/ref&gt; include [[column]]s, door [[lintel]]s, [[Sill plate|sill]]s, [[jamb]]s, and wall and floor [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]].

The ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in [[Sakkara]]). How the [[Egyptians]] worked the solid [[granite]] is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist [[Patrick Hunt (archeologist)|Patrick Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm Arce/Nc Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014031747/http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has postulated that the Egyptians used [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] shown to have higher [[Hardenability|hardness]] on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the [[lever]] moved and uplifted [[obelisk]]s weighing more than 100 [[Tonne|tons]].

====Obelisks and pillars====
[[Obelisk]]s were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclopædia Britannica wrote, "The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of [[Senusret I]] of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68&amp;nbsp;feet high)". The word "obelisk" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the ''unfinished obelisk'' being built by [[Hatshepsut]] to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity [[Ra]] and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the [[sun]] (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patricia Blackwell Gary |author2=Richard Talcott |title=Stargazing in Ancient Egypt |journal=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |pages=62–7 |date=June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used [[Column|pillar]]s extensively.

It is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had [[kite]]s, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html Caltech researchers successfully raised an obelisk with a kite to test theory about ancient pyramids]&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines. Maureen Clemmons subsequently led a team of researchers demonstrating a kite made of natural material and reinforced with shellac (which according to their research pulled with 97% the efficiency of nylon), in a 9&amp;nbsp;mph wind, would easily pull an average 2-ton pyramid stone up the 1st two courses of a pyramid (in collaboration with Cal Poly, Pomona, on a 53-stone pyramid built in Rosamond, CA).

===Navigation and ship building===
The Ancient Egyptians had knowledge to some extent of [[sail]] construction. This is governed by the [[science]] of [[aerodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;A primary feature of a properly designed sail is an amount of "[[draft (sailing)|draft]]", caused by curvature of the surface of the sail. When the sail is oriented into the wind, this curvature induces lift, much like the wing of an airplane.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Egyptian sails were simply placed to catch the wind and push a vessel.&lt;ref name="SportsStudies"&gt;Encyclopedia Of International Sports Studies. Page 31&lt;/ref&gt; Later Egyptian sails dating to 2400 BCE were built with the recognition that ships could sail [[close-hauled|against the wind]] using the [[forces on sails|lift of the sails]].&lt;ref name="SportsStudies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technological Choices: Transformation in Material Cultures. Page 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Queen [[Hatshepsut]] oversaw the preparations and funding of an expedition of five ships, each measuring seventy feet long, and ''with several sails''.{{dubious - discuss|date=July 2017}}{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}Various others exist, also.

Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship [[Praise of the Two Lands (ship)|Praise of the Two Lands]] is the first reference recorded to a ship being referred to by name.&lt;ref name ="famousfirstfacts"&gt;Anzovin, item # 5393, page 385 ''Reference to a ship with a name appears in an inscription of 2613 BCE that recounts the shipbuilding achievements of the fourth-dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Sneferu. He was recorded as the builder of a cedarwood vessel called "Praise of the Two Lands."''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although quarter rudders were the norm in Nile navigation, the Egyptians were the first to use also stern-mounted rudders (not of the modern type but center mounted steering oars).

===Irrigation and agriculture===
Irrigation as the artificial application of water to the soil was used to some extent in Ancient Egypt, a [[hydraulic civilization]] (which entails [[hydraulic engineering]]).&lt;ref&gt;Blake L. White, [http://www.strategic-tech.org/images/Egyptian_Engineering_and_Culture.pdf Ancient Egypt Provides an Early Example of How A Society's Worldview Drives Engineering and the Development of Science]. Strategic Technology Institute. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing rainfall in periods of drought, as opposed to reliance on direct rainfall (referred to as dryland farming or as rainfed farming). Before technology advanced, the people of Egypt relied on the natural flow of the Nile River to tend to the crops. Although the Nile provided sufficient watering survival domesticated animals, crops, and the people of Egypt, there were times where the Nile would flood the area wreaking havoc amongst the land. &lt;ref&gt;JG Manning, "Water, Irrigation, and Their Connection to State Power in Egypt" (Econ Yale 2012), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Amenemhet III]] in the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|twelfth dynasty]] (about 1800 [[Common era|BCE]]) using the natural lake of the [[Al Fayyum|Fayûm]] as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons, as the lake swelled annually with the [[flooding of the Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Glassworking===
The earliest known [[glass]] beads from [[Egypt]] were made during the [[New Kingdom]] around 1500&amp;nbsp;BC and were produced in a variety of colors. They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The [[Egyptians]] made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like [[iron]] and the more modern [[crucible steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html#Origin%20Myth| title = Glassmaking in Antiquity| accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Susan Hampton| publisher = The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405113459/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html| archivedate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
{{main|Egyptian calendar|Archaeoastronomy}}
The Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A Wells, "Archaeoastronomy in Egypt", in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p.28&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.&lt;ref&gt;John Britton and Christopher Walker, Astrology and Astronomy in Mesopotamia, in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of [[Sirius]] in its [[heliacal rising]] after its annual absence of about 70 days.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce, Pyramids: The Real Story Behind Egypt's Ancient Monuments, Viking, 2003, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

After unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E. Neugebauer | title = The Exact Sciences in Antiquity | origyear = 1957 | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-22332-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; However, by Seti I's time day and night were normally divided into 12 hours each, the length of which would vary according to the time of year.

Key to much of this was the motion of the sun god [[Ra]] and his annual movement along the horizon at sunrise. Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] came the development of the [[Egyptian calendar]], time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of [[Ramesses VI]] shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.

During the [[Fifth Dynasty]] six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by [[Niuserre]] at [[Abu Gurab]] and [[Userkaf]] at [[Abusir]] have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Claims have been made that [[precession of the equinoxes]] was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] prior to the time of [[Hipparchus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Santillana |first=G. |last2=Von Dechend |first2=H. |title=Hamlet's Mill |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql7ATHGee50C |publisher=David R. Godine |isbn=9780879232153}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been disputed however on the grounds that pre-Hipparchus texts do not mention precession and that "it is only by cunning interpretation of ancient myths and images, which are ostensibly about something else, that precession can be discerned in them, aided by some pretty esoteric numerological speculation involving the 72 years that mark one degree of shift in the zodiacal system and any number of permutations by multiplication, division, and addition." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeological Fantasies:How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-30593-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oB7pBZ3s6dIC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=precession+Egyptians#v=onepage&amp;q=precession%20Egyptians&amp;f=false|author =Paul Jordan|editor=Garrett G. Fagan|page=123|chapter=Esoteric Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note however that the Egyptian observation of a slowly changing stellar alignment over a multi-year period does not necessarily mean that they understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.

===Medicine===
The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of [[neuroscience]]. However, medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology was largely ineffective.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf Microsoft Word – Proceedings-2001.doc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=April 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a paper published by Michael D. Parkins, 72% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf 10th Annual Proceedings of the History of Medicine Days] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=April 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael D. Parkins, sewage pharmacology first began in ancient Egypt and was continued through the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and while the use of animal dung can have curative properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0838/is_n65/ai_12694466 |title=animal dung can have curative properties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20040918170945/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0838/is_n65/ai_12694466 |archivedate=2004-09-18 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; it is not without its risk. Practices such as applying cow dung to wounds, ear piercing, tattooing, and chronic ear infections were important factors in developing tetanus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/7.2.185 |vauthors=Mamtani R, Malhotra P, Gupta PS, Jain BK |title=A comparative study of urban and rural tetanus in adults |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=185–8 |date=June 1978 |pmid=681065 |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=681065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank J. Snoek wrote that Egyptian medicine used fly specks, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies which he believes could have been harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Frank J. Snoek |date=August 2001 |title=The Mind Matters |journal=Diabetes Spectrum |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=116–117 |doi=10.2337/diaspect.14.3.116 |url=http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/3/116.full }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mummy|Mummification]] of the dead was not always practiced in Egypt. Once the practice began, an individual was placed at a final resting place through a set of rituals and protocol. The Egyptian funeral was a complex ceremony including various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in honor of the deceased. The poor, who could not afford expensive tombs, were buried in shallow graves in the sand, and because of the arid environment they were often naturally mummified.

===The Wheel===
Evidence indicates that Egyptians made use of [[potter's wheel]]s in the manufacturing of pottery from as early as the [[4th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Doherty |first=Sarah |date=2013 |title=The origins and the use of the potters wheel in Ancient Egypt. |type= |chapter= |publisher=Cardiff University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/45612/ |access-date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chariots]], however, are only believed to have been introduced by the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] in the [[Second Intermediate period]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/documents/egyptchariots_000.pdf Hyskos introduced chariots to ancient Egypt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629203129/http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/documents/egyptchariots_000.pdf |date=June 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[New Kingdom|New Kingdom era]], [[Chariotry in ancient Egypt|chariotry]] became central to Egypt's [[Military of ancient Egypt#New Kingdom Armies|military]].

===Other developments===
[[File:Henry Holiday weaving and spinning in ancient Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stained glass window from c. 1914 depicting weaving and spinning in ancient Egypt]]
The Egyptians developed a variety of [[furniture]]. There in the lands of ancient Egypt is the first evidence for [[Chair|stool]]s, [[bed]]s, and [[Table (furniture)|table]]s (such as from the tombs similar to Tutenkhamen's). Recovered Ancient Egyptian furniture includes a third millennium BC bed discovered in the Tarkhan Tomb, a c.2550&amp;nbsp;BC. gilded set from the tomb of Queen [[Hetepheres I]], and a c. 1550&amp;nbsp;BC. stool from Thebes.

Some have suggested that the Egyptians had some form of understanding [[electric]] [[phenomena]] from observing [[lightning]] and interacting with [[electric fish]] (such as ''[[Malapterurus electricus]]'') or other animals (such as [[electric eel]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Karl Brugsch-Bey and Henry Danby Seymour, "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0CJl3KVQupibKmzuADNu17&amp;id=LoiTizgRo9kC A History of Egypt Under the Pharaohs]''". J. Murray, 1881. Page 422. (cf., [... the symbol of a]'' 'serpent' is rather a fish, which still serves, in the Coptic language, to designate the electric fish'' [...])&lt;/ref&gt; The comment about lightning appears to come from a misunderstanding of a text referring to "high poles covered with copper plates" to argue this&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Kolbe, Francis ed Legge, Joseph Skellon, tr., "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0o90G64Z2FDIyKUsLs9&amp;id=150IAAAAIAAJ An Introduction to Electricity]''". Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, 1908. 429 pages. Page 391. (cf., "[...] ''high poles covered with copper plates and with gilded tops were erected 'to break the stones coming from on high'.'' J. Dümichen, Baugeschichte des Dendera-Tempels, Strassburg, 1877")&lt;/ref&gt; but Dr. Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stern | first = Bolko | title = Ägyptische Kulturgeschichte | publisher = Reprint-Verlag-Leipzig |origyear=1896 |date=1998 | pages = 106–108 | isbn = 978-3-8262-1908-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dendera light 002.jpg|222px|thumb|The single representation of the image, called the "[[Dendera light]]" by some alternative suggestions, exists on the left wall of the right wing in one of the crypts of the [[Hathor temple]]]]

Those exploring [[fringe science|fringe theories]] of [[History of technology|ancient technology]] have suggested that there were [[Dendera light|electric lights used in Ancient Egypt]]. Engineers have constructed a working model based on their interpretation of a relief found in the [[Hathor]] temple at the Dendera Temple complex.&lt;ref name="KrassaHabeck"&gt;Krassa, P., and R. Habeck, "''Das Licht der Pharaonen.''". {{ISBN|3-548-35657-5}} (Tr. ''The Light of the Pharaohs'')&lt;/ref&gt; Authors (such as [[Peter Krassa]] and [[Reinhard Habeck]]) have produced a basic theory of the device's operation.&lt;ref name="KrassaHabeck"/&gt; The standard explanation, however, for the ''[[Dendera light]]'', which comprises three stone reliefs (one single and a double representation) is that the depicted image represents a lotus leaf and flower from which a sacred snake is spawned in accordance with Egyptian mythological beliefs. This sacred snake sometimes is identified as the Milky Way (the snake) in the night sky (the leaf, lotus, or "bulb") that became identified with Hathor because of her similar association in creation.

==Later technology in Egypt==

===Greco-Roman Egypt===
{{main|Ancient Greek technology|Roman technology}}

Under [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic rule]], Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the [[Hellenistic civilization]]. The ancient Egyptian city of [[Rhakotis]] was renovated as [[Alexandria]], which became the largest city around the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Under [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman rule]], Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the [[Roman Empire]], with Alexandria being second only to [[ancient Rome]] in size.

Recent scholarship suggests that the [[water wheel]] originates from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], where it appeared by the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Wikander/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; This is seen as an evolution of the paddle-driven water-lifting wheels that had been known in Egypt a century earlier.&lt;ref name=Wikander&gt;{{Cite book|contribution=Chapter 6: Sources of Energy and Exploitation of Power|author =Örjan Wikander| author-link = Örjan Wikander|title=The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World|editor=John Peter Oleson|editor-link=John Peter Oleson|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2008|isbn=0-19-518731-8|pages=141–2|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Peter Oleson]], both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic Noria may have been invented in Egypt by the 4th century BC, with the [[Sakia]] being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds at [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]], where the oldest archeological evidence of a water-wheel has been found, in the form of a Sakia dating back to the 3rd century BC. A [[papyrus]] dating to the 2nd century BC also found in Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC [[fresco]] found at [[Alexandria]] depicts a compartmented Sakia, and the writings of [[Callixenus of Rhodes]] mention the use of a Sakia in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] during the reign of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]] in the late 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{Cite book|title=Water architecture in the lands of Syria: the water-wheels|author =Adriana de Miranda|publisher=L'Erma di Bretschneider|year=2007|isbn=88-8265-433-8|pages=38–9|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek technology]] was often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Ancient Roman technology]] is a set of artifacts and customs which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years.

===Arabic-Islamic Egypt===
{{main|Inventions in medieval Islam|Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Timeline of science and engineering in the Islamic world}}

Under [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab rule]], Egypt once again became one of the most prosperous regions around the Mediterranean. The Egyptian city of [[Cairo]] was founded by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and served as its capital city. At the time, Cairo was second only to [[Baghdad]], capital of the rival [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. After the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]], however, Cairo overtook it as the largest city in the Mediterranean region until the [[early modern period]].

[[Inventions in medieval Islam]] covers the inventions developed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], a region that extended from [[Al-Andalus]] and [[Africa]] in the west to the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Central Asia]] in the east. The [[timeline of Islamic science and engineering]] covers the general development of science and technology in the Islamic world.

'''Artificial intuition''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] capacity of an [[artificial]] software to function similarly to human [[consciousness]], specifically in the capacity of human consciousness known as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]]. 

==Comparison of human and the theoretically artificial ==
Intuition is the function of the mind, the experience of which, is described as knowledge based on "a hunch", resulting (as the word itself does) from "contemplation" or "insight". &lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cVnNIB89_nIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBiMPq2sLdAhUIgVwKHYWqALAQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false Inside Intuition] - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cVnNIB89_nIC p.3] Routledge, 6 Aug 2012 {{ISBN|1134121830}} Accessed 17th September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/intuition etymonline] Accessed 17th September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] showed that intuitive functioning within the normally developing human child at the ''Intuitive Thought Substage''  of the [[preoperational stage]] occurred at from four to seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour, Richard Gross  {{ISBN|978-1-4441-0831-6}}  see: [[Jean Piaget]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, John W.

Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill College - Chapter 8  ''from'' [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Carl Jung's concept of [[synchronicity]], the concept of "intuitive intelligence" is described as something like a capacity that transcends ordinary-level functioning to a point where information is understood with a greater depth than is available in more simple rationally-thinking entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=wikipedia&amp;q=isbn%3A0670032921 worldcat] retrieved 11:03(GMT) 26.10.201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/synchronicity  ''Farlex''] retrieved 11:08(GMT) 26.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung 1921"&gt;Jung, C.G.

[[Artificial intelligence in fiction]] often crosses the line to apparent artificial intuition, although it can't be shown if the intent of the fiction creator was to show a simulation of intuition or that real artificial intuition is part of the story's AI, because this depends on the internal structure of the programming of the AI, which is not usually shown in stories.

In [[astrology]], an [[astrological aspect|aspect]] is an angle a planet makes to another planet or point of astrological interest. As the second-brightest object in the [[night sky]] after the [[Moon]], often prominent during the morning or evening, [[Venus]] has aspects that are readily apparent to the [[naked eye|casual eye]]. They were of historical importance in the development of [[geocentric]] and ultimately [[heliocentric]] models of the [[Solar System]].

==Aspects of the planet Venus==
The table contains special positions of [[Venus]] until 2021. In general, Venus (or [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) is an "evening star" when it has an eastern [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] from the Sun, and is a "morning star" when it has a western elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.space.com/31851-what-is-morning-star-evening-star.html |title=What Is a 'Morning Star,' and What Is an 'Evening Star'? |date=2016-02-16 |publisher=[[Space.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthsky.org/sky-archive/venus-at-its-brightest-as-the-morning-star |title=Venus at its brightest in morning sky |first=Bruce |last=McClure |publisher=[[EarthSky]] |date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: ''Greatest brilliancy'' is often confused with "maximum brightness". Although they are related, they are not quite the same thing. The "greatest brilliancy" is really a geometric maximum: it occurs when the apparent area of the sunlit part of Venus is greatest. Only if the [[luminance]] of Venus' apparent surface would be constant (i.e. the same at every point and at every [[planetary phase|phase]]) would the "greatest brilliancy" of Venus coincide with its maximum brightness.  However, the reflection of sunlight on Venus more closely follows [[Lambert's cosine law|Lambert's law]], which means that the maximum brightness occurs at a somewhat larger [[phases of Venus|phase of Venus]] than its greatest brilliancy.

'''Asteroseismology''' or '''astroseismology''' is the study of oscillations in stars.  Because a star's different oscillation modes are sensitive to different parts of the star, they inform astronomers about the internal structure of the star, which is otherwise not directly possible from overall properties like brightness and surface temperature.  Asteroseismology is closely related to [[helioseismology]], the study of stellar oscillations specifically in the [[Sun]].  Though both are based on the same underlying physics, more and qualitatively different information is available for the Sun because its surface can be resolved.

Between about 100 and 400 µHz, modes would potentially have two oscillating regions: these are known as ''mixed'' modes.  The dashed line shows the acoustic cut-off frequency, computed from more precise modelling, and above which modes are not trapped in the star, and roughly-speaking do not resonate.]]

By linearly perturbing the equations defining the mechanical equilibrium of a star (i.e. mass conservation and [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four [[differential equations]] whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation.  The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by [[spherical harmonics]], indexed by an angular degree &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and azimuthal order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.  In non-rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must all have the same frequency because there is no preferred axis.  The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations. As a consequence, modes can only be detected up to an angular degree of about 3 in intensity and about 4 if observed in radial velocity.

By additionally assuming that the perturbation to the gravitational potential is negligible (the ''Cowling'' approximation) and that the star's structure varies more slowly with radius than the oscillation mode, the equations can be reduced approximately to one second-order equation for the radial component of the displacement eigenfunction &lt;math&gt;\xi_r&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\xi_r}{dr^2}=\frac{\omega^2}{c_s^2}\left(1-\frac{N^2}{\omega^2}\right)
\left(\frac{S_\ell^2}{\omega^2}-1\right)\xi_r&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radial co-ordinate in the star,
&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency of the oscillation mode,
&lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sound speed inside the star,
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the Brunt-Vaisala or buoyancy frequency and
&lt;math&gt;S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the Lamb frequency.
The last two are defined by

&lt;math&gt;N^2=g\left(\frac{1}{\Gamma_1P}\frac{dp}{dr}-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{d\rho}{dr}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;S_\ell^2=\frac{\ell(\ell+1)c_s^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

respectively.  By analogy with the behaviour of simple harmonic oscillators,
this implies that oscillating solutions exist when the frequency is either
greater or less than both &lt;math&gt;S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.  We identify the former case
as high-frequency pressure modes (p-modes) and the latter as low-frequency
gravity modes (g-modes).

This basic separation allows us to determine (to reasonable accuracy)
where we expect what kind of mode to resonate in a star.  By plotting the
curves &lt;math&gt;\omega=N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega=S_\ell&lt;/math&gt; (for given
&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;), we expect p-modes to resonate at frequencies below both
curves or frequencies above both curves.

== Excitation mechanisms ==

=== &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism ===

{{main|Kappa mechanism}}

Under fairly specific conditions, some stars have regions where heat is transported by radiation and the opacity is a sharply decreasing function of temperature.  This opacity ''bump'' can drive oscillations through the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism (or ''Eddington valve''). Suppose that, at the beginning of an oscillation cycle, the stellar envelope has contracted. By expanding and cooling slightly, the layer in the opacity bump becomes more opaque, absorbs more radiation, and heats up. This heating causes expansion, further cooling and the layer becomes even more opaque. This continues until the material opacity stops increasing so rapidly, at which point the radiation trapped in the layer can escape. The star contracts and the cycle prepares to commence again. In this sense, the opacity acts like a valve that traps heat in the star's envelope.

Pulsations driven by the &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;-mechanism are coherent and have relatively large amplitudes.  It drives the pulsations in many of the longest-known variable stars, including the [[Cepheid variable|Cepheid]] and [[RR Lyrae variable|RR Lyrae variables]].

=== Surface convection ===

In stars with surface convection zones, turbulent fluids motions near the surface simultaneously excite and damp oscillations across a broad range of frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Goldreich | first1 = Peter | authorlink1 = Peter Goldreich | last2 = Keeley | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Solar seismology.

Because the modes are intrinsically stable, they have low amplitudes and are relatively short-lived.  This is the driving mechanism in all solar-like oscillators.

=== Convective blocking ===

If the base of a surface convection zone is sharp and the convective timescales slower than the pulsation timescales, the convective flows react too slowly perturbations{{clarify |date=April 2018}} that can build up into large, coherent pulsations.  This mechanism is known as ''convective blocking''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Pesnell | first1 = W.

=== Tidal excitation ===

Observations from the ''Kepler'' satellite revealed eccentric binary systems in which oscillations are excited during the closest approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Thompson | first1 = S.

== Types of oscillators ==

=== Solar-like oscillators ===

{{main|Solar-like oscillations}}

Because solar oscillations are driven by near-surface convection, any stellar oscillations caused similarly are known as ''solar-like oscillations'' and the stars themselves as ''solar-like oscillators''.  However, solar-like oscillations also occur in evolved stars (subgiants and red giants), which have convective envelopes, even though the stars are not ''Sun-like''.

=== Cepheid variables ===

{{main|Cepheid variable}}

Cepheid variables are one of the most important classes of pulsating star.  They are core-helium burning stars with masses above about 5 solar masses.  They principally oscillate at their fundamental modes, with typical periods ranging from days to months.  Their pulsation periods are closely related to their luminosities, so it is possible to determine the distance to a Cepheid by measuring its oscillation period, computing its luminosity, and comparing this to its observed brightness.

Cepheid pulsations are excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization zone of helium.

=== RR Lyrae variables ===

{{main|RR Lyrae variable}}

RR Lyraes are similar to Cepheid variables but of lower metallicity (i.e. [[Population II]]) and much lower masses (about 0.6 to 0.8 time solar).  They are core helium-burning giants that oscillate in one or both of their fundamental mode or first overtone.  The oscillation are also driven by the kappa mechanism acting through the second ionization of helium.  Many RR Lyraes, including RR Lyrae itself, show long period amplitude modulations, known as the [[Blazhko effect]].

=== Delta Scuti and Gamma Doradus stars ===

{{main|Delta Scuti variable|Gamma Doradus variable}}

Delta Scuti variables are found roughly where the classical instability strip intersects the main sequence.  They are typically A- to early F-type dwarfs and subgiants and the oscillation modes are low-order radial and non-radial pressure modes, with periods ranging from 0.25 to 8 hours and magnitude variations anywhere between. Like Cepheid variables, the oscillations are driven by the kappa mechanism acting on the second ionization of helium.

SX Phoenicis variables are regarded as metal-poor relatives of Delta Scuti variables.

Gamma Doradus variables occur in similar stars to the red end of the Delta Scuti variables, usually of early F-type.  The stars show multiple oscillation frequencies between about 0.5 and 3 days, which is much slower than the low-order pressure modes.  Gamma Doradus oscillations are generally thought to be high-order gravity modes, excited by convective blocking.

Following results from ''Kepler'', it appears that nearly all Delta Scuti stars also show Gamma Doradus oscillations and are therefore hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Grigahc\`ene | first1 = A. | last2 = Antoci | first2 = V. | last3 = Balona | first3 = L. | last4 = Catanzaro | first4 = G. and | title = Hybrid $\gamma$ Doradus-$\delta$ Scuti Pulsators: New Insights into the Physics of the Oscillations from Kepler Observations | year = 2010 | journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]] Letters | volume = 713 | pages = L192| bibcode = 2010ApJ...713L.192G|arxiv = 1001.0747 |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/713/2/L192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Balona | first1 = L.

=== Rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars ===

{{main|Rapidly oscillating Ap star}}

Rapidly oscillating Ap stars have similar parameters to Delta Scuti variables, mostly being A- and F-type, but they are also strongly magnetic and chemically peculiar (hence the ''p'' spectral subtype).  Their dense mode spectra are understood in terms of the ''oblique pulsator model'': the modes frequencies are modulated by the magnetic field, which is not necessarily aligned with the star's rotation (as is the case in the Earth).  The oscillation modes have frequencies around 1500 μHz and amplitudes of a few mmag.

=== Slowly-pulsating B stars and Beta Cephei variables ===

{{main|Slowly pulsating B-type star|Beta Cephei variable}}

Slowly-pulsating B (SPB) stars are B-type stars with oscillation periods of a few days, understood to be high-order gravity modes excited by the kappa mechanism.  Beta Cephei variables are slightly hotter (and thus more massive), also have modes excited by the kappa mechanism and additionally oscillate in low-order gravity modes with periods of several hours.  Both classes of oscillators contain only slowly-rotating stars.

=== Variable subdwarf B stars ===

{{main|Subdwarf B star}}

Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are in essence the cores of core-helium burning giants who have somehow lost most of their hydrogen envelopes, to the extent that there is no hydrogen burning shell.  They have multiple oscillation periods that range between about 1 and 10 minutes and amplitudes anywhere between 0.001 and 0.3 mag in visible light.  The oscillations are low-order pressure modes, excited by the kappa mechanism acting on the iron opacity bump.

=== White dwarfs ===

{{main|Pulsating white dwarf}}

White dwarfs are characterized by spectral type, much like ordinary stars, except that the relationship between spectral type and effective temperature does not correspond in the same way.  Thus, white dwarfs are known by types DO, DA and DB.  Cooler types are physically possible but the Universe is too young for them to have cooled enough.  White dwarfs of all three types are found to pulsate.  The pulsators are known as GW Virginis stars (DO variables, sometimes also known as PG 1159 stars), V777 Herculis stars (DB variables) and ZZ Ceti stars (DA variables).  All pulsate in low-degree, high-order g-modes.  The oscillation periods broadly decrease with effective temperature, ranging from about 30 min down to about 1 minute.  GW Virginis and ZZ Ceti stars are thought to be  excited by the kappa mechanism; V777 Herculis stars by convective blocking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">'''Baltistics''' is a multidisciplinary study of language and culture (history, literature, folklore, mythology) of the [[Balts|Baltic nations]]. Baltistics by its subject splits into Lithuanistics, Latvistics, Prussistics, etc. Special attention is paid to the language studies, especially to the Baltic protolanguage.
Currently there are about 30 centres of Baltistics, most of them based in Europe, the [[Vilnius University|University of Vilnius]] considered to be the most active centre.

== History ==
[[File:LT-2014-10litų-Baltistika-b.png|thumb|200px|right|A commemorative [[Lithuanian litas]] coin, dedicated to Baltistics, depicts an [[amber]] disk from the [[Neolithic]] era]]

First signs of researching and comparing of the [[Baltic languages]] – [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] – were seen in the writings of the grammar creators ([[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]], ''Grammatica Litvanica'' 1653, [[Gotthard Friedrich Stender]], ''Lettische Grammatik'' 1783). For the first time, scientifically Baltic languages were researched and compared with other [[Indo-European languages]] in the 19th century, when [[Franz Bopp]] in 1816 laid the ground for [[comparative linguistics]]. In his ''Vergleichende Grammatik'', published in 1833, Lithuanian was included. [[Prussian language]] was researched by [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] (''Die Sprache der alten Preussen an ihren Ueberresten erlaeutert'', 1845) and [[Erich Berneker]] (''Die preussische Sprache'', 1896). It was Nesselmann who first suggested the term "Baltic languages".

From 1718 to 1944, a seminar for the study of the Lithuanian language took place in the [[University of Königsberg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65842">{{short description|The reworking of soils and sediments by animals or plants}}
'''Bioturbation''' is defined as the reworking of [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s by animals or plants. These include burrowing, ingestion and defecation of sediment grains. Bioturbating activities have a profound effect on the environment and &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  are thought to be a primary driver of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The formal study of bioturbation began in the 1800s by [[Charles Darwin]] experimenting in his garden.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The disruption of aquatic sediments and terrestrial soils through bioturbating activities provides significant [[ecosystem services]]. These include the alteration of [[nutrient]]s in aquatic sediment and overlying water, shelter to other species in the form of burrows in terrestrial and water ecosystems, and soil production on land.&lt;ref name="shaler1891"&gt;Shaler, N. S., 1891, The origin and nature of soils, in Powell, J. W., ed., USGS 12th Annual report 1890-1891: Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, p. 213-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Bioturbators are deemed [[ecosystem engineer]]s because they alter resource availability to other species through the physical changes they make to their environments.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; This type of ecosystem change affects the evolution of cohabitating species and the environment,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; which is evident in [[trace fossil]]s left in marine and terrestrial sediments. Other bioturbation effects include altering the texture of sediments [[diagenesis|(diagenesis]]), [[bioirrigation]], and displacement of microorganisms and non-living particles. Bioturbation is sometimes confused with the process of bioirrigation, however these processes differ in what they are mixing; bioirrigation refers to the mixing of water and solutes in sediments and is an effect of bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== History of the Study of Bioturbation ==
Bioturbation's importance for soil processes and [[geomorphology]] was ﬁrst realized by Charles Darwin, who devoted his last scientific book to the subject (''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin spread chalk dust over a field to observe changes in the depth of the chalk layer over time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Excavations 30 years after the initial deposit of chalk revealed that the chalk was buried 18 centimeters under the sediment, which indicated a burial rate of 6 millimeters per year.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin attributed this burial to the activity of earthworms in the sediment and determined that these disruptions were important in soil formation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Marshall T.|last2=Richards|first2=Paul J.|last3=Humphreys|first3=Geoff S.|date=2009-12-01|title=Breaking ground: Pedological, geological, and ecological implications of soil bioturbation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825209001470|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=97|issue=1|pages=257–272|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.09.005|bibcode=2009ESRv...97..257W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, geologist [[Nathaniel Shaler]] expanded Darwin's concept to include soil disruption by ants and trees.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; The term "bioturbation" was later coined by Rudolf Richter in 1952 to describe structures in sediment caused by living organisms.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristensen|first=E|last2=Penha-Lopes|first2=G|last3=Delefosse|first3=M|last4=Valdemarsen|first4=T|last5=Quintana|first5=CO|last6=Banta|first6=GT|date=2012-02-02|title=What is bioturbation?

== Evolution and Ecology ==

=== Evolution  ===

* '''Gallery-diffusers''' create complex tube networks within the upper sediment layers and transport sediment through feeding, burrow construction, and general movement throughout their galleries.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47927758|title=Organism-sediment interactions|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Published for the Belle W.

*'''Biodiffusers''' transport sediment particles randomly over short distances as they move through sediments. Animals mostly attributed to this category include [[Bivalvia|bivalves]] such as clams, and [[Amphipoda|amphipod]] species, but can also include larger vertebrates, such as bottom-dwelling fish and rays that feed along the sea floor.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Biodiffusers can be further divided into two subgroups, which include [[epifaunal]] (organisms that live on the surface sediments) biodiffusers and surface biodiffusers.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; This subgrouping may also include gallery-diffusers,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; reducing the number of functional groups.

* '''Regenerators''' are categorized by their ability to release sediment to the overlying water column, which is then dispersed as they burrow.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; After regenerators abandon their burrows, water flow at the sediment surface can push in and collapse the burrow.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Examples of regenerator species include [[Fiddler crab|fiddler]] and [[Ghost crab|ghost]] crabs.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Since its onset around 541 million years ago, bioturbation has been responsible for changes in ocean chemistry, primarily through nutrient cycling.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19451639|pmc=2688866|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.8123C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators played, and continue to play, an important role in nutrient transport across sediments.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

For example, bioturbating animals are hypothesized to have affected the cycling of sulfur in the early oceans. According to this hypothesis, bioturbating activities had a large effect on the sulfate concentration in the ocean. Around the Cambrian-Precambrian boundary (541 million years ago), animals begin to mix reduced sulfur from ocean sediments to overlying water causing sulfide to oxidize, which increased the sulfate composition in the ocean. During large extinction events, the sulfate concentration in the ocean was reduced. Although this is difficult to measure directly, seawater sulfur isotope compositions during these times indicates bioturbators influenced the sulfur cycling in the early Earth.

Bioturbators have also altered phosphorus cycling on geologic scales.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=A.W|date=2016|title=A model for microbial phosphorus cycling in bioturbated marine sediments: Significance for phosphorus burial in the early Paleozoic|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=189|pages=251–268|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2016.05.046|bibcode=2016GeCoA.189..251D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators mix readily available particulate organic phosphorus (P) deeper into ocean sediment layers which prevents the precipitation of phosphorus [[Mineralization (biology)|(mineralization)]] by increasing the sequestration of phosphorus above normal chemical rates. The sequestration of phosphorus limits oxygen concentrations by decreasing production on a geologic time scale.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; This decrease in production results in an overall decrease in oxygen levels, and it has been proposed that the rise of bioturbation corresponds to a decrease in oxygen levels of that time.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle|first1=R.A.|date=2014|title=Stabilization of the coupled oxygen and phosphorus cycles by the evolution of bioturbation|volume=7|page=671|doi=10.1038/ngeo2213|journal=Nature Geoscience|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..671B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback of animals sequestering phosphorus in the sediments and subsequently reducing oxygen concentrations in the environment limits the intensity of bioturbation in this early environment.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Nutrient cycling is still affected by bioturbation in the modern Earth. Some examples in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are below.

=== Aquatic ===
==== Terrestrial freshwater ecosystems ====
Important sources of bioturbation in freshwater ecosystems include [[Bottom feeder|benthivorous]] (bottom-dwelling) fish, macroinvertebrates such as worms, insect larvae, crustaceans and molluscs, and seasonal influences from [[Fish migration|anadromous]] (migrating) fish such as salmon. Anadromous fish migrate from the sea into fresh-water rivers and streams to spawn. Macroinvertebrates act as biological pumps for moving material between the sediments and water column, feeding on sediment organic matter and transporting mineralized nutrients into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adámek|first=Zdeněk|last2=Maršálek|first2=Blahoslav|date=2013-02-01|title=Bioturbation of sediments by benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and its implication for pond ecosystems: a review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|journal=Aquaculture International|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|issn=0967-6120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both benthivorous and anadromous fish can affect ecosystems by decreasing primary production through sediment re-suspension,&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; the subsequent displacement of benthic primary producers, and recycling nutrients from the sediment back into the water column.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuzaki|first=Shin-ichiro S.|last2=Usio|first2=Nisikawa|last3=Takamura|first3=Noriko|last4=Washitani|first4=Izumi|date=2007-01-01|title=Effects of common carp on nutrient dynamics and littoral community composition: roles of excretion and bioturbation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/fal/2007/00000168/00000001/art00004|journal=Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv f??r Hydrobiologie|volume=168|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtgrieve|first=Gordon W.|last2=Schindler|first2=Daniel E.|date=2011-02-01|title=Marine-derived nutrients, bioturbation, and ecosystem metabolism: reconsidering the role of salmon in streams|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/09-1694.1/abstract|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=373–385|doi=10.1890/09-1694.1|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lakes and ponds ====
[[File:Chironomidae.jpg|thumb|Chironomid larvae.]]
The sediments of lake and pond ecosystems are rich in organic matter, with higher organic matter and nutrient contents in the sediments than in the overlying water.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Nutrient re-regeneration through sediment bioturbation moves nutrients into the water column, thereby enhancing the growth of aquatic plants and phytoplankton ([[primary producers]]).&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The major nutrients of interest in this flux are nitrogen and phosphorus, which often limit the levels of primary production in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Bioturbation increases the flux of mineralized (inorganic) forms of these elements, which can be directly used by primary producers. In addition, bioturbation increases the water column concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus-containing organic matter, which can then be consumed by fauna and mineralized.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Lake and pond sediments often transition from the aerobic (oxygen containing) character of the overlaying water to the anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions of the lower sediment over sediment depths of only a few millimeters, therefore, even bioturbators of modest size can affect this transition of the chemical characteristics of sediments.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By mixing anaerobic sediments into the water column, bioturbators allow aerobic processes to interact with the re-suspended sediments and the newly exposed bottom sediment surfaces.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Macroinvertebrates including [[Chironomidae|chironomid]] (non-biting midges) larvae and [[Tubifex tubifex|tubificed worms]] (detritus worms) are important agents of bioturbation in these ecosystems and have different effects based on their respective feeding habits. Tubificed worms do not form burrows, they are upward conveyors. Chironomids, on the other hand, form burrows in the sediment, acting as bioirrigators and aerating the sediments and are downward conveyors. This activity, combined with chironomid's respiration within their burrows, decrease available oxygen in the sediment and increase the loss of nitrates through enhanced rates of [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The increased oxygen input to sediments by macroinvertebrate bioirrigation coupled with bioturbation at the sediment-water interface complicates the total flux of phosphorus . While bioturbation results in a net flux of phosphorus into the water column, the bio-irrigation of the sediments with oxygenated water enhances the adsorption of phosphorus onto iron-oxide compounds, thereby reducing the total flux of phosphorus into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The presence of macroinvertebrates in sediment can initiate bioturbation due to their status as an important food source for benthivorous fish such as [[Common carp|carp]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Of the bioturbating, benthivorous fish species, carp in particular are important ecosystem engineers and their foraging and burrowing activities can alter the water quality characteristics of ponds and lakes.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Carp increase water [[turbidity]] by the re-suspension of benthic sediments. This increased turbidity limits light penetration and coupled with increased nutrient flux from the sediment into the water column, inhibits the growth of macrophytes (aquatic plants) favoring the growth of phytoplankton in the surface waters. Surface phytoplankton colonies benefit from both increased suspended nutrients and from recruitment of buried phytoplankton cells released from the sediments by the fish bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Macrophyte growth has also been shown to be inhibited by displacement from the bottom sediments due to fish burrowing.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

==== Rivers and streams ====
River and stream ecosystems show similar responses to bioturbation activities, with chironomid larvae and tubificid worm macroinvertebrates remaining as important benthic agents of bioturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mermillod-Blondin|first=Florian|last2=Gaudet|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Gerino|first3=Magali|last4=Desrosiers|first4=Gaston|last5=Jose|first5=Jacques|last6=Châtelliers|first6=Michel Creuzé des|date=2004-07-01|title=Relative influence of bioturbation and predation on organic matter processing in river sediments: a microcosm experiment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x/abstract|journal=Freshwater Biology|language=en|volume=49|issue=7|pages=895–912|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x|issn=1365-2427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These environments are can also be subject to strong season bioturbation effects from anadromous fish.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Salmon function as bioturbators on both gravel to sand-sized sediment and a nutrient scale, by moving and re-working sediments in the construction of redds (gravel depressions or "nests" containing eggs buried under a thin layer of sediment) in rivers and streams&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gottesfeld|first=AS|last2=Hassan|first2=MA|last3=Tunnicliffe|first3=JF|date=2008|title=Salmon bioturbation and stream process|url=|journal=American Fisheries Society Symposium|volume=65|pages=|via=researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by mobilization of nutrients.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buxton|first=Todd H.|last2=Buffington|first2=John M.|last3=Tonina|first3=Daniele|last4=Fremier|first4=Alexander K.|last5=Yager|first5=Elowyn M.|date=2015-04-13|title=Modeling the influence of salmon spawning on hyporheic exchange of marine-derived nutrients in gravel stream beds|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=72|issue=8|pages=1146–1158|doi=10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|issn=0706-652X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of salmon redds functions to increase the ease of fluid movement ([[hydraulic conductivity]]) and porosity of the stream bed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In select rivers, if salmon congregate in large enough concentrations in a given area of the river, the total sediment transport from redd construction can equal or exceed the sediment transport from flood events.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The net effect on sediment movement is the downstream transfer of gravel, sand and finer materials and enhancement of water mixing within the river substrate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The construction of salmon redds increases sediment and nutrient fluxes through the [[hyporheic zone]] (area between surface water and groundwater) of rivers and effects the dispersion and retention of marine derived nutrients (MDN) within the river ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; MDN are delivered to river and stream ecosystems by the fecal matter of spawning salmon and the decaying carcasses of salmon that have completed spawning and died.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Numerical modeling suggests that residence time of MDN within a salmon spawning reach is inversely proportional to the amount of redd construction within the river.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Measurements of respiration within a salmon-bearing river in Alaska further suggest that salmon bioturbation of the river bed plays a significant role in mobilizing MDN and limiting primary productivity while salmon spawning is active.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The river ecosystem was found to switch from a net [[autotroph]]ic to [[heterotroph]]ic system in response to decreased primary production and increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The decreased primary production in this study was attributed to the loss of benthic primary producers who were dislodged due to bioturbation, while increased respiration was thought to be due to increased respiration of organic carbon, also attributed to sediment mobilization from salmon redd construction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While marine derived nutrients are generally thought to increase productivity in riparian and freshwater ecosystems, several studies have suggested that temporal effects of bioturbation should be considered when characterizing salmon influences on nutrient cycles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Marine environments ====
Major marine bioturbators range from small [[Sediment-dwelling organism|infaunal]] invertebrates to fish and marine mammals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In most marine sediments, however, they are dominated by small invertebrates, including polychaetes, bivalves, burrowing shrimp, and amphipods.

===== Shallow and Coastal =====
Coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, are generally highly productive, which results in the accumulation of large quantities of [[detritus]] (organic waste). These large quantities, in addition to typically small sediment grain size and dense populations, make bioturbators important in estuarine respiration.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/798834896|title=Interactions between macro- and microorganisms in marine sediments|date=2005|publisher=American Geophysical Union|others=American Geophysical Union.|isbn=9781118665442|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=798834896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators enhance the transport of oxygen into sediments through irrigation and increase the surface area of oxygenated sediments through burrow construction.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Bioturbators also transport organic matter deeper into sediments through general reworking activities and production of fecal matter.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This ability to replenish oxygen and other solutes at sediment depth allows for enhanced respiration by both bioturbators as well as the microbial community, thus altering estuarine elemental cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nitrogen Cycling in Coastal Marine Environments|last=Aller|first=Robert C.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1988|isbn=|editor-last=Blackburn|editor-first=T.H.|location=|pages=301–338|chapter=13.

Burrowing animals, such as earth worms and small mammals form passageways for air and water transport which changes the soil properties, such as the vertical particle-size distribution, soil [[porosity]], and nutrient content.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Invertebrates that burrow and consume plant detritus help produce an organic-rich topsoil known as the [[soil biomantle]], and thus contribute to the formation of [[Soil horizon|soil horizons.]]&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; Small mammals such as [[pocket gophers]] also play an important role in the production of soil, possibly with an equal magnitude to abiotic processes.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichman|first=O.J.|last2=Seabloom|first2=Eric W.|title=The role of pocket gophers as subterranean ecosystem engineers|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534701023291|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17|issue=1|pages=44–49|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02329-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocket gophers form above-ground mounds, which moves soil from the lower soil horizons to the surface, exposing minimally weathered rock to surface erosion processes, speeding soil formation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pocket gophers are thought to play an important role in the downslope transport of soil, as the soil that forms their mounds is more susceptible to erosion and subsequent transport. Similar to tree root effects, the construction of burrows-even when backfilled- decreases soil density.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; The formation of surface mounds also buries surface vegetation, creating nutrient hotspots when the vegetation decomposes, increasing soil organic matter. Due to the high metabolic demands of their burrow-excavating subterranean lifestyle, pocket gophers must consume large amounts of plant material.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; Though this has a detrimental effect on individual plants, the net effect of pocket gophers is increased plant growth from their positive effects on soil nutrient content and physical soil properties.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

=== In the sediment record ===
Patterns or traces of bioturbation are preserved in [[Lithification|lithified]] rock. The study of such patterns is called [[ichnology]], or the study of "trace fossils", which, in the case of bioturbators, are fossils left behind by digging or burrowing animals. This can be compared to the footprint left behind by these animals. In some cases bioturbation is so pervasive that it completely obliterates [[sedimentary structures]], such as laminated layers or [[cross-bedding]]. Thus, it affects the disciplines of [[sedimentology]] and [[stratigraphy]] within geology. The study of bioturbator ichnofabrics uses the depth of the fossils, the cross-cutting of fossils, and the sharpness (or how well defined) of the fossil&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=A. M.|last2=Goldring|first2=R.|date=|title=Description and analysis of bioturbation and ichnofabric|url=https://doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=150|issue=1|pages=141–148|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|via=|year=1993|bibcode=1993JGSoc.150..141T}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assess the activity that occurred in old sediments. Typically the deeper the fossil, the better preserved and well defined the specimen.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Important [[trace fossil]]s from bioturbation have been found in marine sediments from tidal, coastal and deep sea sediments. In addition sand dune, or [[Eolian dust|Eolian]], sediments are important for preserving a wide variety of fossils.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Evidence of bioturbation has been found in deep-sea sediment cores including into long records, although the act extracting the core can disturb the signs of bioturbation, especially at shallower depths.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertweck|first1=G|last2=Liebezeit|first2=G|title=Bioturbation structures of polychaetes in modern shallow marine environments and their analogues to Chondrites group traces|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2007|volume=245|issue=3|pages=382–389|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthropods, in particular are important to the geologic record of bioturbation of Eolian sediments.

== Mathematical Models ==
The role of bioturbators in sediment biogeochemistry makes bioturbation a common parameter in sediment biogeochemical models, which are often [[Numerical modeling (geology)|numerical models]] built using [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851842693|title=Diagenetic Models and Their Implementation : Modelling Transport and Reactions in Aquatic Sediments|last=P.|first=Boudreau, Bernard|date=1997|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=364264399X|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851842693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbation is typically represented as D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, or the biodiffusion coefficient, and is described by a [[Diffusion equation|diffusion]] and, sometimes, an [[Advective derivative|advective]] term.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; This representation and subsequent variations account for the different modes of mixing by functional groups and bioirrigation that results from them. The biodiffusion coefficient is usually measured using [[radioactive tracer]]s such as Pb&lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=P.|last2=Gardner|first2=L.

Parameterization of bioturbation, however, can vary, as newer and more complex models can be used to fit tracer profiles. Unlike the standard biodiffusion model, these more complex models, such as expanded versions of the biodiffusion model, random walk, and particle-tracking models, can provide more accuracy, incorporate different modes of sediment transport, and account for more spatial heterogeneity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aquino|first=Tomás|last2=Roche|first2=Kevin R.|last3=Aubeneau|first3=Antoine|last4=Packman|first4=Aaron I.|last5=Bolster|first5=Diogo|date=2017|title=A Process-Based Model for Bioturbation-Induced Mixing|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14705-1|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-14705-1|issn=2045-2322|via=|bibcode=2017NatSR...714287A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheatcroft|first=R.

The '''British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science''' ('''BCTCS''') is an organisation that hosts an annual event for [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based researchers in [[theoretical computer science]]. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of [[PhD]] students.

The purpose of BCTCS is:

# to offer a regular forum in which UK-based researchers in all aspects of theoretical computer science can meet, present research findings, and discuss recent developments in the field;
# to foster an environment within which PhD students undertaking research in theoretical computer science may gain experience in presenting their work in a formal arena, broaden their outlook on the subject, and benefit from contact with established researchers in the community; and
# to provide a platform by which the interests and future well-being of British theoretical computer science may be advanced.

The scope of BCTCS includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including [[algorithm]]s, [[complexity]], [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]], [[Formal language|formal methods]], [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]], [[Type theory|types]], [[Formal language|languages]] and [[Mathematical logic|logics]].  An emphasis on breadth, together with the inherently mathematical nature of theoretical computer science, means that BCTCS always actively solicits both [[computer scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s as participants, and offers an environment within which the two communities can meet and exchange ideas.

BCTCS is primarily for the benefit of UK-based researchers.  However, to help promote British theoretical computer science in the wider community, BCTCS is also advertised at the international level; participants from outside of the UK are welcome to attend the annual meeting, and the programme of invited talks regularly includes high-profile researchers from outside of the UK.

The first BCTCS meeting was organised in 1985 by [[John V. Tucker]] at the [[University of Leeds]].

The BCTCS operates under the direction of an Organising Committee, with an Executive consisting of a President, Secretary and Treasurer. The current President is [[Faron Moller]].

'''Carmine Benincasa''' (born 17 December 1947 in [[Eboli]]) is an Italian art critic and [[Art History|art historian]] professor.

== Biography ==
'''Carmine Benincasa''' was born in [[Eboli]] in the south of Italy. After studying in a religious school he moved to [[Rome]] to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]].

He was a professor of art history at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Macerata]], the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Florence]] and Professor of History of Art at the [[Faculty of Architecture]] of the [[University La Sapienza]] in Rome. During this period he met intellectuals like [[Jean-Paul Sartre]],&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=0357919&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Bruno Zevi]] and many more.

From 1978 to 1982 he was a member of the [[Venice Biennale]] Visual Arts Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/10/16/biennale-il-psi-fa-incetta-di-poltrone.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and an advisor to the Ministry of Culture and Environment. In 1994 he was briefly accused and incarcerated for defrauding collectors by validating and selling false artworks.&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/07/08/critico-arte-professore-in-cella-per.html&lt;/ref&gt; The case was subsequently thrown out of court for lack of evidence. Benincasa was eventually cleared of every wrongdoing by the [[Supreme Court of Italy]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id%3D239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804000431/http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id=239 |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benincasa has published numerous essays, articles and monographs on artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Mario Ceroli]], [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Joan Mirò]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Giorgio Morandi]]. He has also organized many international exhibitions, including a section of the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1982.

Benincasa is currently chief editor of the Italian edition of ''[[Cahiers d'Art]]''.

In [[genetics]], a '''chimera''' is a single [[cDNA]] sequence originating from two [[Transcription (genetics)|transcripts]]. It is usually considered to be a contaminant in transcript and [[expressed sequence tag]] '''(EST)''' databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Unneberg | first1 = P | last2 = Claverie | first2 = JM | last3 = Hoheisel | first3 = Jörg | title = Tentative Mapping of Transcription-Induced Interchromosomal Interaction using Chimeric EST and mRNA Data | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = e254 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17330142 | pmc = 1804257 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000254 | editor1-last = Hoheisel | editor1-first = Jörg }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that approximately 1% of all transcripts in the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]'s Unigene database contain a "chimeric sequence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.agilent.com/Library/applications/5989_0750_EST_final72.pdf |title=EST Assembly for the Creation of Oligonucleotide Probe Targets |author=Charlie Nelson |publisher=[[Agilent Technologies]] |accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods have been devised to detect them, such as the Ribosomal Database Project's CHECK_CHIMERA program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/24.1.82 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/1/82#tbl01 |last1=Maidak |first1=B. |title=The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) |journal=[[Nucleic Acids Research]]| volume =24 |issue= 1 |pages=82 |year=1996 |accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[protein engineering]], "chimeragenesis (forming chimeras between proteins that are encoded by homologous cDNAs)"&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Lajtha, Abel |author2=E.

'''Cholesterol''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chole-'' ([[bile]]) and ''stereos'' (solid), followed by the [[chemical]] [[suffix]] ''-ol'' for an [[alcohol]]) is an [[organic compound|organic]] [[molecule]]. It is a [[sterol]] (or [[chemical modification|modified]] [[steroid]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Cholesterol|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[lipid]] molecule, and is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by all animal [[Cell (biology)#Eukaryotic cells|cells]], because it is an essential structural component of all [[animal]] [[cell membrane]]s.

In addition to its importance for animal cell structure, cholesterol also serves as a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] for the biosynthesis of [[steroid hormone]]s, [[bile acid]]&lt;ref name="Hanukoglu_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = Steroidogenic enzymes: structure, function, and role in regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis | journal = J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 779–804 | date = Dec 1992 | pmid = 22217824 | doi = 10.1016/0960-0760(92)90307-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vitamin D]]. Cholesterol is the principal [[sterol]] synthesized by all animals. In [[vertebrate]]s, [[liver|hepatic]] cells typically produce the greatest amounts. It is absent among [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), although there are some exceptions, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which require cholesterol for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razin S, Tully JG | title = Cholesterol Requirement of Mycoplasmas | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–310 | date = May 1970 | pmid = 4911537 | pmc = 247552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Poulletier de la Salle]] first identified cholesterol in solid form in [[gallstone]]s in 1769. However, it was not until 1815 that chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] named the compound "cholesterine".&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul (1816) "Recherches chimiques sur les corps gras, et particulièrement sur leurs combinaisons avec les alcalis. Sixième mémoire. Examen des graisses d'homme, de mouton, de boeuf, de jaguar et d'oie" (Chemical researches on fatty substances, and particularly on their combinations o filippos ine kapios with alkalis. Sixth memoir. Study of human, sheep, beef, jaguar and goose fat), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''2''' : 339–372. From [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHCz1nhhYL8C&amp;pg=PA346#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 346] : "Je nommerai ''cholesterine'', de χολη, bile, et στερεος, solide, la substance cristallisée des calculs biliares humains, ... " (I will name ''cholesterine'' — from χολη (bile) and στερεος (solid) — the crystalized substance from human gallstones ... )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olson RE | title = Discovery of the lipoproteins, their role in fat transport and their significance as risk factors | journal = J. Nutr. | volume = 128 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 439S–443S | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9478044 | doi = 10.1093/jn/128.2.439S| url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9478044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life, each cell is capable of synthesizing it by way of a complex 37-step process, beginning with the [[mevalonate pathway]] and ending with a 19-step conversion of [[lanosterol]] to cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  Furthermore, it can be absorbed directly from animal-based foods.

A human male weighing 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000&amp;nbsp;mg) per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes. Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name="cdc-calories"&gt;{{cite web | title = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey | publisher = United States Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/calories.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2012-01-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ingested cholesterol is [[esterified]], and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Lecerf JM, de Lorgeril M | title = Dietary cholesterol: from physiology to cardiovascular risk | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–14 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21385506 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114511000237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various [[lipoprotein]]s (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubois C, Armand M, Mekki N, Portugal H, Pauli AM, Bernard PM, Lafont H, Lairon D | title = Effects of increasing amounts of dietary cholesterol on postprandial lipemia and lipoproteins in human subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 35 | issue = 1994 | pages = 1993–2007 | date = 1994 | pmid = 7868978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to recognize, however, that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the measurement methods used. Traditional, cheaper methods do not reflect (a) which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules, nor (b) which cells are ingesting, burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Cholesterol is [[Enterohepatic circulation|recycled]] in the body. The [[liver]] excretes it in a non-esterified form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically, about 95% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the [[small intestine]] back into the bloodstream.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts.&lt;ref name="Plant cholesterol"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | last1 = Behrman | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Gopalan | first2 = Venkat | name-list-format = vanc | title=Cholesterol and Plants | editor-first= William M. | editor-last = Scovell | volume = 82 | number = 12 | year = 2005 | pages = 1791 | doi = 10.1021/ed082p1791|bibcode=2005JChEd..82.1791B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants manufacture [[phytosterol]]s (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption.&lt;ref name="John_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = John S, Sorokin AV, Thompson PD | title = Phytosterols and vascular disease | journal = Curr. Opin. Lipidol. | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–40 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17218830 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e328011e9e3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the [[GI tract]], an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant [[sterols]] and [[Stanol ester|stanols]], ranges between ~200–300&amp;nbsp;mg/day depending on eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jesch ED, Carr TP |title=Food Ingredients That Inhibit Cholesterol Absorption |journal=Prev Nutr Food Sci |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=67–80 |year=2017 |pmid=28702423 |pmc=5503415 |doi=10.3746/pnf.2017.22.2.67 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700&amp;nbsp;mg/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agren JJ, Tvrzicka E, Nenonen MT, Helve T, Hänninen O | title = Divergent changes in serum sterols during a strict uncooked vegan diet in patients with rheumatoid arthritis | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–9 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11242480 | doi = 10.1079/BJN2000234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
Cholesterol, given that it composes about 30% of all animal cell membranes, is required to build and maintain [[Cell membrane|membranes]] and modulates [[membrane fluidity]] over the range of physiological temperatures. The [[hydroxyl]] group on cholesterol interacts with the [[Polar molecules|polar]] heads of the [[lipid bilayer|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s and [[sphingolipid]]s, while the bulky [[steroid]] and the [[hydrocarbon]] chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the [[Polar molecules#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar]] [[Fatty acid|fatty-acid chain]] of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-4646-4"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sadava D, Hillis DM, Heller HC, Berenbaum MR | title = Life: The Science of Biology 9th Edition | publisher = Freeman | location = San Francisco | year = 2011 | pages = 105–114 | isbn = 978-1-4292-4646-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.

The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a ''trans'' conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar.&lt;ref name="Ohvo-Rekilä_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohvo-Rekilä H, Ramstedt B, Leppimäki P, Slotte JP | title = Cholesterol interactions with phospholipids in membranes | journal = Prog. Lipid Res. | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–97 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11694269 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(01)00020-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes,&lt;ref name="Yeagle_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeagle PL | title = Modulation of membrane function by cholesterol | journal = Biochimie | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 1303–10 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1664240 | doi = 10.1016/0300-9084(91)90093-G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hydrogen]] ions, and [[sodium]] ions.&lt;ref name="Haines_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = [[Thomas H. Haines|Haines TH]] | title = Do sterols reduce proton and sodium leaks through lipid bilayers? | journal = Prog. Lipid Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–324 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11412894 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(01)00009-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the cell membrane, cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated [[caveolae]] and [[clathrin]]-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent [[endocytosis]]. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using [[methyl beta cyclodextrin]] (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of [[lipid raft]]s in the [[plasma membrane]], which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules.&lt;ref name="Incardona_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Incardona JP, Eaton S | title = Cholesterol in signal transduction | journal = Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–203 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10712926 | doi = 10.1016/S0955-0674(99)00076-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a [[myelin]] sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of [[Schwann cell]] membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-5056-3"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pawlina W, Ross MW | title = Histology: a text and atlas: with correlated cell and molecular biology | edition = | publisher = Lippincott Wiliams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = 230 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-7817-5056-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demyelination]] (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed to be part of the basis for [[multiple sclerosis]].

Within cells, cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways. For example, it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of [[vitamin D]] and all [[steroid hormones]], including the [[adrenal gland]] hormones [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]], as well as the sex hormones [[progesterone]], [[estrogen]]s, and [[testosterone]], and their derivatives.&lt;ref name="Hanukoglu_1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne AH, Hales DB | title = Overview of steroidogenic enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to active steroid hormones | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 947–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15583024 | doi = 10.1210/er.2003-0030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liver excretes cholesterol into [[bile|biliary]] fluids, which is then stored in the [[gallbladder]]. Bile contains [[Bile acid|bile salts]], which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fat-soluble vitamins, [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/liver/bile.html|title=Secretion of Bile and the Role of Bile Acids In Digestion|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
All animal cells manufacture cholesterol, for both membrane structure and other uses, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the [[liver]] and the [[intestines]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-its-made-cholesterol-production-in-your-body|title=How it’s made: Cholesterol production in your body  - Harvard Health|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|work=Harvard Health|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; other sites of higher synthesis rates include [[adrenal gland]]s, and [[reproductive organ]]s.

Synthesis within the body starts with the [[mevalonate pathway]] where two molecules of [[acetyl CoA]] condense to form [[acetoacetyl-CoA]]. This is followed by a second condensation between [[acetyl CoA]] and [[acetoacetyl-CoA]] to form [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA]] ([[HMG-CoA]]).&lt;ref name="Mehta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/09/biosynthesis-and-regulation-of-cholesterol-animation/|title=Biosynthesis and Regulation of Cholesterol (with Animation)|website=PharmaXChange.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Condensation of Acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

This molecule is then reduced to [[mevalonate]] by the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Production of [[mevalonate]] is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for [[statin]]s (a class of cholesterol lowering drugs).

[[File:Melavonic Acid Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
Mevalonate is finally converted to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

[[File:Melavonate pathway to IPP.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]] through the action of geranyl transferase.

[[File:Cation formation from DMAPP.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
[[File:Formation of Farnasyl pyrophosphate.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form [[squalene]] by the action of [[squalene synthase]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name="Mehta" /&gt; 
[[File:Squalene Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
[[File:Squalene Synthesis 2.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

[[Oxidosqualene cyclase]] then cyclizes squalene to form [[lanosterol]]. Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol through a 19-step process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Berg J |title = Biochemistry | year = 2002 | publisher = WH Freeman | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7167-3051-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-2009-4"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rhodes CM, Stryer L, Tasker R | title = Biochemistry | edition = 4th | publisher = W.H.

===Regulation of cholesterol synthesis===
Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of [[intracellular]] cholesterol in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[protein]] [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP]] (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2).&lt;ref name="Espenshade_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Espenshade PJ, Hughes AL | title = Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 401–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17666007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: [[SREBP cleavage-activating protein|SCAP]] (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and [[INSIG-1]]. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.

The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, and acts as a [[transcription factor]] to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]) receptor and [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown MS, Goldstein JL | title = The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–40 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9150132 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. [[Michael S. Brown]] and Dr. [[Joseph L. Goldstein]] in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.

Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the [[proteosome]]. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein [[kinase]]. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tymoczko | first1 = John L. | last2 = Berg | first2 = Tymoczko | last3 = Stryer | first3 = Lubert | last4 = Berg | first4 = Jeremy Mark | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry | edition = | publisher = W.H.

===Plasma transport and regulation of absorption===
{{See also|Blood lipids}}

[[File:MetabolismoLipidiE.png|thumb|Lipid logistics: transport of triglycerides and cholesterol in organisms in form of lipoproteins as chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, IDL, HDL.]]
As an isolated molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in [[water]]; it dissolves into the (water-based) bloodstream only at exceedingly small concentrations. Instead, cholesterol is transported within [[lipoprotein]]s, complex discoidal particles with exterior [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; i.e. transport via [[emulsification]]. [[Triglyceride]]s and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are [[chylomicron]]s, [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), and [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some is carried as its native "free" alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex [[apolipoproteins]], typically 80–100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. Lipoprotein particles thus include a molecular addresses which play key roles in distribution and delivery of fats around the body in the water outside cells.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Chylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport molecules, contain [[apolipoprotein B-48]], [[apolipoprotein C]], and [[apolipoprotein E]] (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27277824|year=2016|author1=Mahley|first1=R. W.|title=Apolipoprotein E: From cardiovascular disease to neurodegenerative disorders|journal=Journal of Molecular Medicine|volume=94|issue=7|pages=739–46|doi=10.1007/s00109-016-1427-y|pmc=4921111}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver.

VLDL molecules are produced by the liver from [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain [[apolipoprotein B100]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] in their shells, and are degraded by [[lipoprotein lipase]] on the blood vessel wall to IDL.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Blood vessels cleave and absorb [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] from IDL molecules, increasing the concentration of cholesterol. IDL molecules are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by [[HTGL]] and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become LDL molecules, with the highest concentration of cholesterol within them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of [[apolipoprotein B100]], recognized by [[LDL receptor]]s in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of [[apolipoprotein B100]], many LDL receptors concentrate in [[clathrin]]-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via [[endocytosis]]. These vesicles then fuse with a [[lysosome]], where the [[Lysosomal lipase|lysosomal acid lipase]] enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by [[SREBP]], the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol ''de novo'', according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

When this process becomes unregulated, LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by [[macrophages]], which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to [[atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness).&lt;ref name="Weingärtner_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weingärtner O, Pinsdorf T, Rogacev KS, Blömer L, Grenner Y, Gräber S, Ulrich C, Girndt M, Böhm M, Fliser D, Laufs U, Lütjohann D, Heine GH | title = The relationships of markers of cholesterol homeostasis with carotid intima-media thickness | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13467 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20976107 | pmc = 2956704 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013467 | editor1-last = Federici | editor1-first = Massimo |bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513467W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a [[lipoprotein]]) with "bad" cholesterol.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6"/&gt;

===Metabolism, recycling and excretion===
Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives called [[oxysterol]]s. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Kandutsch_1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kandutsch AA, Chen HW, Heiniger HJ | title = Biological activity of some oxygenated sterols | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4355 | pages = 498–501 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 663671 | doi = 10.1126/science.663671 |bibcode = 1978Sci...201..498K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding became known as the “oxysterol hypothesis”.

In biochemical experiments radiolabelled forms of cholesterol, such as tritiated-cholesterol are used.

Cholesterol binds to and affects the gating of a number of [[ion channel]]s such as the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]], [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], and the [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]].&lt;ref name="LevitanSingh2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levitan I, Singh DK, Rosenhouse-Dantsker A | title = Cholesterol binding to ion channels | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 65 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24616704 | pmc = 3935357 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholesterol also activates the [[estrogen-related receptor alpha]] (ERRα), and may be the [[endogenous]] [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] for the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].&lt;ref name="WeiSchwaid2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei W, Schwaid AG, Wang X, Wang X, Chen S, Chu Q, Saghatelian A, Wan Y | title = Ligand Activation of ERRα by Cholesterol Mediates Statin and Bisphosphonate Effects | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–91 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26777690 | pmc = 4785078 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nuclear Receptors in Development and Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvupDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|date=17 May 2017|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-802196-5|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be explained by the fact that cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body.&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017" /&gt; Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of [[statin]]s and [[bisphosphonate]]s on [[bone]], [[muscle]], and [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="WeiSchwaid2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017" /&gt; On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol.&lt;ref name="WeiSchwaid2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017" /&gt;

===Hypercholesterolemia===
{{Main|hypercholesterolemia|lipid hypothesis}}
[[File:ColesterolemiaMortalitaE.png|thumb|Cholesterolemia and mortality for men and women &lt;50 years and &gt;60 years]]
According to the [[lipid hypothesis]], since cholesterol (like all fat molecules) is transported around the body (in the [[Extracellular fluid|water outside cells]]) inside [[lipoprotein]] particles, elevated cholesterol concentrations ([[hypercholesterolemia]]) potentially offer a lower cost way to estimate concentrations of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] particles; possibly even low concentrations of functional [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] particles, both variations strongly associated with [[cardiovascular disease]] because LDL particles promote [[atheroma]] development in arteries ([[atherosclerosis]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

This atherosclerotic disease process, over decades, leads to [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[stroke]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles,&lt;ref name="Brunzell_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunzell JD, Davidson M, Furberg CD, Goldberg RB, Howard BV, Stein JH, Witztum JL | title = Lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk: consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 811–22 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18375431 | doi = 10.2337/dc08-9018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LDL particles are often termed "bad cholesterol" because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as "good cholesterol". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body build, [[medication]]s, food choices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol-and-diet/mediterranean-diet Department of Health (UK), NHS Choices, "''More evidence for Mediterranean diet''". 8 March 2011.] Access date: Nov 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and other factors.&lt;ref name="Durrington_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durrington P | title = Dyslipidaemia | journal = Lancet | volume = 362 | issue = 9385 | pages = 717–31 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12957096 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially "small dense LDL" (sdLDL) particles, are associated with [[atheroma]] formation in the walls of [[artery|arteries]], a condition known as [[atherosclerosis]], which is the principal cause of [[coronary heart disease]] and other forms of [[cardiovascular disease]]. In contrast, HDL particles (especially large HDL) have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma. Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression. A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900,000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Still, because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people.&lt;ref name="Lewington_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewington S, Whitlock G, Clarke R, Sherliker P, Emberson J, Halsey J, Qizilbash N, Peto R, Collins R | title = Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9602 | pages = 1829–39 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18061058 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61778-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates would still be high. Recently, a ''post hoc'' analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of "good cholesterol".&lt;ref name="van_der_Steeg_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Steeg WA, Holme I, Boekholdt SM, Larsen ML, Lindahl C, Stroes ES, Tikkanen MJ, Wareham NJ, Faergeman O, Olsson AG, Pedersen TR, Khaw KT, Kastelein JJ | title = High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein particle size, and apolipoprotein A-I: significance for cardiovascular risk: the IDEAL and EPIC-Norfolk studies | journal = J.

The 1987 report of [[National Cholesterol Education Program]], Adult Treatment Panels suggests the total blood cholesterol level should be: &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/dL normal blood cholesterol, 200–239&amp;nbsp;mg/dL borderline-high, &gt; 240&amp;nbsp;mg/dL high cholesterol.&lt;ref name="pmid3422148"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults.

However, as today's testing methods determine LDL ("bad") and HDL ("good") cholesterol separately, this simplistic view has become somewhat outdated. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 130&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (2.6 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]/L),&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011020231058/http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about_diff.html |archive-date=20 October 2001 |url=http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about.jsp |dead-url=yes |title=About cholesterol |publisher=American Heart Association |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a newer upper limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (1.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/L) can be considered in higher-risk individuals based on some of the above-mentioned trials. A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier.

Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a [[Low-density lipoprotein#Estimation of LDL particles via cholesterol content|variant]]): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.&lt;ref name="Warnick_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L | title = Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints | journal = Clin.

Given the well-recognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes.&lt;ref name="Wang_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang TY, Newby LK, Chen AY, Mulgund J, Roe MT, Sonel AF, Bhatt DL, [[Elizabeth DeLong|DeLong ER]], Ohman EM, Gibler WB, Peterson ED | title = Hypercholesterolemia paradox in relation to mortality in acute coronary syndrome | journal = Clin Cardiol | volume = 32 | issue = 9 | pages = E22–8 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19645040 | doi = 10.1002/clc.20518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Framingham Heart Study]], in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1&amp;nbsp;mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels.

Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed ''[[hypocholesterolemia]]''. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[cancer]], and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness.&lt;ref name="Lewington_2007" /&gt; A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]], which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels.

A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to determine a [[lipid profile|lipoprotein profile]]. This measures total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, HDL ("good") cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L or more (200+&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL ("good") cholesterol less than 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]] (or use of [[anti-hypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive medication]]), low HDL level, family history of [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) and [[hypercholesterolemia]], and [[tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]].&lt;ref name="urlATP III Update 2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |title=Implications of Recent Clinical Trials for the ATP III Guidelines |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lungs and Blood Institute |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202053506/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |archivedate=2 February 2014 |quote= |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cholesteric liquid crystals==
Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the [[liquid crystal]]line "cholesteric phase". The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Liquid crystal|nematic phase]], and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in [[liquid-crystal display]] [[thermometer]]s and in temperature-sensitive paints.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Stereoisomers==
Cholesterol has 256 [[stereoisomer]]s that arise from its 8 stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers are of biochemical significance (''nat''-cholesterol and ''ent''-cholesterol, for ''natural'' and ''enantiomer'', respectively),&lt;ref name="Westover_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westover EJ, Covey DF, Brockman HL, Brown RE, Pike LJ | title = Cholesterol depletion results in site-specific increases in epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation due to membrane level effects.

In [[ecology]], '''climax community''', or '''climatic climax community''', is a historic term for a biological [[Community (ecology)|community]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]] which, through the process of [[ecological succession]]  in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a [[steady state]]. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area.  The term is sometimes also applied in [[soil]] development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a "steady state" is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.

The idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with [[Frederic Clements]] in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry Cowles]] in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term "climax" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, Henry Chandler. 1899. The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan. Botanical Gazette 27(2): 95-117; 27(3): 167-202; 27(4): 281-308; 27(5): 361-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frederic Clements' use of "climax"== 
Clements described the successional development of an ecological communities comparable to the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] development of individual [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1916. Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation. Washington D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Joel B. 1992. An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a "[[superorganism]]" and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist [[Arthur Tansley]] developed this idea with the "polyclimax"—multiple steady-state end-points, determined by [[edaphic]] factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable, because by definition climax [[vegetation]] is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. [[Henry Gleason]]'s early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation, were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both [[theoretical ecology]] and in vegetation management.  Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, [[plagioclimax]] and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.

Though the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community—of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions—as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there, when those conditions occur. But much of Clements's work was devoted to characterizing what happens when those ideal conditions do not occur. In those circumstances, vegetation other than the ideal climax will often occur instead. But those different kinds of vegetation can still be described as deviations from the climax ideal. Therefore, Clements developed a very large vocabulary of theoretical terms describing the various possible causes of vegetation, and various non-climax states vegetation adopts as a consequence. His method of dealing with ecological complexity was to define an ideal form of vegetation—the climax community—and describe other forms of vegetation as deviations from that ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Christopher. 2007. Method and Metaphysics in Clements’s and Gleason’s Ecological Explanations. Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38(1): 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing usage of "climax"==
Despite the overall abandonment of climax theory, during the 1990s use of climax concepts again became more popular among some [[theoretical ecologist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Roughgarden, Jonathan, Robert M. May and Simon A. Levin, editors. 1989. Perspectives in Ecological Theory. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors and nature-enthusiasts continue to use the term "climax" in a diluted form to refer to what might otherwise be called mature or [[old growth|old-growth]] communities. The term "climax" has also been adopted as description for a late successional stage for marine macroinvertebrate communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg R., S. Agrenius, B. Hellman, H. C. Nilsson, and K. Norling. 2002. Recovery of marine benthic habitats and fauna in a Swedish fjord following improved oxygen conditions. Marine Ecology Progress Series 234: 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some contemporary ecologists still use the term "disclimax" to describe an [[ecosystem]] dominated by [[invasive species]] that competitively prevent the re-introduction of once native species. This concept borrows from Clement's earliest interpretation of climax as referring to an ecosystem that is resistant to colonization by outside species. The term disclimax was used in-context by Clements (1936), and despite being an [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] phenomenon which prevents the facilitation and succession to a true climax community, it is one of the only examples of climax that can be observed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1936. Nature and Structure of the Climax. Journal of Ecology. Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 252-284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. 1984. Prairie and plains disclimax and disappearing butterflies, in the central United States. Atala. Vol. 10-12, pp. 20-30&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computable topology''' is a discipline in mathematics that studies the topological and algebraic structure of [[computation]]. Computable topology is not to be confused with algorithmic or ''[[computational topology]]'', which studies the application of computation to topology.

==Topology of lambda calculus==

As shown by [[Alan Turing]] and [[Alonzo Church]], the [[lambda-calculus|λ-calculus]] is strong enough to describe all mechanically computable functions (see [[Church–Turing thesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Church 1934:90 footnote in Davis 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1952:149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barendregt, H.P., The Lambda Calculus Syntax and Semantics. North-Holland Publishing Company. 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Lambda-calculus is thus effectively a programming language, from which other languages can be built. For this reason when considering the [[topology]] of computation it is common to focus on the topology of λ-calculus. Note that this is not necessarily a complete description of the topology of computation, since functions which are equivalent in the Church-Turing sense may still have different topologies.

The [[topology]] of λ-calculus is the [[#Scott topology|Scott topology]], and when restricted to [[continuous function]]s the type free λ-calculus amounts to a [[topological space]] reliant on the [[tree topology]]. Both the Scott and Tree topologies exhibit continuity with respect to the [[binary operators]] of application ( f ''applied to'' a = fa ) and abstraction ((λx.t(x))a = t(a)) with a modular equivalence relation based on a [[congruence relation|congruency]]. The λ-algebra describing the algebraic structure of the lambda-calculus is found to be an extension of the [[combinatory algebra]], with an element introduced to accommodate abstraction.

Type free [[λ-calculus]] treats functions as rules and does not differentiate functions and the objects which they are applied to, meaning λ-calculus is [[data type|type]] free. A by-product of type free λ-calculus is an [[effective method|effective computability]] equivalent to [[Μ-recursive_function|general recursion]] and [[Turing machine]]s.&lt;ref name="Barendregt"&gt;Barendregt, H.P., The Lambda Calculus Syntax and Semantics. North-Holland Publishing Company. 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The set of  λ-terms can be considered a functional topology in which a function space can be [[embedding|embedded]], meaning λ mappings within the space X are such that λ:X → X.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScottModels"&gt;D. S. Scott. Models for the λ-calculus. Informally distributed, 1969. Notes, December 1969, Oxford Univ.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced November 1969, [[Dana Scott]]'s untyped set theoretic model constructed a proper topology for any λ-calculus model whose function space is limited to continuous functions.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScottModels" /&gt; The result of a [[Scott continuous]] λ-calculus topology is a function space built upon a programming semantic allowing fixed point combinatorics, such as the [[Fixed-point combinator#Y combinator|Y combinator]], and data types.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, M.J.C., The Denotational Description of Programming Languages. Springer Verlag, Berlin. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D. S. and Strachey, C. Toward a Mathematical Semantics for Computer Languages, Proc. Symp. on Computers and Automata, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, 21, pp. 19 46. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, λ-calculus was equipped to define any sequential computation and could be easily adapted to parallel computations.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berry, Sequential algorithms on concrete data structures, Theoretical Computer Science 20, 265 321 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The reducibility of all computations to λ-calculus allows these λ-topological properties to become adopted by all programming languages.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;

==Computational algebra from λ-calculus algebra==
Based on the operators within [[lambda calculus]], application and abstraction, it is possible to develop an algebra whose group structure uses application and abstraction as binary operators. Application is defined as an operation between [[lambda term]]s producing a λ-term, e.g.  the application of λ onto the lambda term ''a'' produces the lambda term ''λa''. Abstraction incorporates undefined variables by denoting λx.t(x) as the function assigning the variable ''a'' to the lambda term with value ''t(a)'' via the operation ((λ x.t(x))a = t(a)). Lastly, an [[equivalence relation]] emerges which identifies λ-terms modulo convertible terms, an example being [[beta normal form]].

==Scott topology==

The Scott topology is essential in understanding the topological structure of computation as expressed through the λ-calculus. Scott found that after constructing a function space using λ-calculus one obtains a [[Kolmogorov space]], a &lt;math&gt;T_o&lt;/math&gt; topological space which exhibits [[pointwise convergence]], in short the [[product topology]].&lt;ref&gt;D. S. Scott. “Continuous Lattices.” Oxford University Computing Laboratory August, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the ability of self homeomorphism as well as the ability to embed every space into such a space, denoted [[Scott continuous]], as previously described which allows Scott's topology to be applicable to logic and recursive function theory. Scott approaches his derivation using a [[complete lattice]], resulting in a topology dependent on the lattice structure. It is possible to generalise Scott's theory with the use of [[complete partial order]]s. For this reason a more general understanding of the computational topology is provided through complete partial orders. We will re-iterate to familiarize ourselves with the notation to be used during the discussion of Scott topology.

Complete partial orders are defined as follows:

First, given the [[partially ordered set]] D=(D,≤), a nonempty subset ''X'' ⊆ ''D'' is ''directed'' if ∀ ''x,y'' ∈ ''X'' ∃ ''z'' ∈ ''X'' where ''x''≤ ''z'' &amp; ''y'' ≤ ''z''.

''D'' is a [[complete partial order]] (cpo) if:

::&amp;middot; Every directed X ⊆D has a [[supremum]], and:

::∃ ''bottom'' element ⊥ ∈ ''D'' such that ∀ ''x'' ∈ ''D'' ⊥ ≤ ''x''.

We are now able to define the '''Scott topology''' over a cpo (D, ≤ ).

''O'' ⊆ ''D'' is ''open'' if:

::# for x ∈ O, and x ≤ y, then y ∈ O, i.e. O is an [[upper set]].
::# for a directed set X ⊆ D, and [[supremum]](X) ∈ O, then X ∩ O ≠ ∅.

Using the Scott topological definition of open it is apparent that all topological properties are met.

::&amp;middot;∅ and D, i.e. the empty set and whole space, are open.

::&amp;middot;Arbitrary unions of open sets are open:
:::: ''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is open where i ∈ I, I being the index set. We define U = ∪{ &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; ; i ∈ I}. Take ''b'' as an element of the upper set of U, therefore a ≤ ''b''  for some ''a'' ∈ U It must be that ''a'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; for some i, likewise  ''b'' ∈ upset(&lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt;). U must therefore be upper as well since &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; ∈ U.

::::Likewise, if D is a directed set with a supremum in U, then by assumption sup(D) ∈ &lt;math&gt;U_i &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;U_i &lt;/math&gt;is open. Thus there is a ''b'' ∈ D where b ∈ &lt;math&gt;U_{i} \cap D \subseteq U \cap D&lt;/math&gt;. The union of open sets &lt;math&gt; U_i &lt;/math&gt;is therefore open.

::&amp;middot;Open sets under intersection are open:
::::''Proof'': Given two open sets, ''U'' and ''V'', we define ''W'' = ''U''∩''V''. If ''W'' = ∅ then ''W'' is open. If non-empty say ''b'' ∈ upset(W) (the upper set of W), then for some ''a'' ∈ ''W'', ''a'' ≤ ''b''. Since ''a'' ∈ ''U''∩''V'', and ''b'' an element of the upper set of both ''U'' and ''V'', then ''b'' ∈ ''W''.

::::Finally, if ''D'' is a directed set with a supremum in ''W'', then by assumption sup(''D'') ∈ &lt;math&gt;U \cap V&lt;/math&gt;. So there is ''a'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;U \cap D&lt;/math&gt; and ''b'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;V \cap D&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''D'' is directed there is ''c'' ∈ ''D'' with &lt;math&gt;a \le c, b\le c&lt;/math&gt;; and since ''U'' and ''V'' are upper sets, ''c'' ∈ &lt;math&gt;U \cap V&lt;/math&gt; as well.  

Though not shown here, it is the case that the map &lt;math&gt;f: D \rightarrow D^{'}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if  ''f''(sup(''X'')) = sup(''f''(''X'')) for all directed ''X''⊆''D'', where ''f''(''X'') = {''f''(''x'') | ''x'' ∈ ''X''}  and the second supremum in &lt;math&gt;D^{'}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt;

Before we begin explaining that application as common to λ-calculus is continuous within the Scott topology we require a certain understanding of the behavior of supremums over continuous functions as well as the conditions necessary for the product of spaces to be continuous namely

:# With &lt;math&gt;{f_i}_i \subseteq [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt; be a directed family of maps, then &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \cup_{i}f_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; if well defined and continuous.
:# If F &lt;math&gt;\subseteq [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt; is directed and cpo and &lt;math&gt; [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt; a cpo where sup({''f''(''x'') | ''f'' ∈ ''F''}).

We now show the continuity of ''application''. Using the definition of application as follows:

:::Ap: &lt;math&gt;[D\rightarrow D^{'}] \times D \rightarrow D^{'}&lt;/math&gt; where ''Ap''(''f'',''x'') = ''f''(''x'').

Ap is continuous with respect to the Scott topology on the product (&lt;math&gt; [D \rightarrow D^{'}] \times D \rightarrow D^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) :

::''Proof'': λx.f(x) =  f is continuous. Let h =  λ f.f(x). For directed F&lt;math&gt;\subseteq [D \rightarrow D^{'}]&lt;/math&gt;

:: ''h''(sup(''F'')) = sup(''F'')(''x'')

:::: = sup( {''f''(''x'') | ''f'' ∈ ''F''} )

:::: = sup( {''h''(''f'') | ''f'' ∈ ''F''} )

:::: = sup( ''h''(''F'') )

::By definition of Scott continuity ''h'' has been shown continuous. All that is now required to prove is that ''application'' is continuous when it's separate arguments are continuous, i.e. &lt;math&gt;[D \rightarrow D^{'}] &lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;D \rightarrow D^{'} &lt;/math&gt;are continuous, in our case ''f'' and ''h''.

::Now abstracting our argument to show &lt;math&gt;f:D \times  D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g = \lambda x.f(x,x_0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d=\lambda x^{'}.f(x_0,x^{'})&lt;/math&gt; as the arguments for ''D'' and &lt;math&gt;D^{'}&lt;/math&gt; respectively, then for a directed X ⊆ D

:: &lt;math&gt; g(\sup(X)) = f(\sup(X), x_0^{'}))&lt;/math&gt;

:::: = f( sup( (x,&lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) | x ∈ X} ))

:::: (since ''f'' is continuous and {(x,&lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) | x ∈ X}) is directed):

:::: = sup( {f(x,&lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{'}&lt;/math&gt;) | x ∈ X} )

:::: = sup(g(X))

::g is therefore continuous. The same process can be taken to show d is continuous.
::It has now been shown application is continuous under the Scott topology.

In order to demonstrate the Scott topology is a suitable fit for λ-calculus it is necessary to prove ''abstraction'' remains continuous over the Scott topology. Once completed it will have been shown that the mathematical foundation of λ-calculus is a well defined and suitable candidate functional paradigm for the Scott topology.

With &lt;math&gt;f \in [D \times D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}]&lt;/math&gt; we define &lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt; (x) =λ y ∈ &lt;math&gt;D^{'}&lt;/math&gt;f(x,y)We will show:

:(i) &lt;math&gt;\check{f} &lt;/math&gt; is continuous, meaning &lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;[D \rightarrow [D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}] &lt;/math&gt;

:(ii) λ &lt;math&gt; f.\check{f}: [D \times D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}]\rightarrow [D\rightarrow [D^{'}\rightarrow D^{''}]&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

::''Proof'' (i): Let X ⊆ D be directed, then

::&lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt;(sup(X)) = λ y.f( sup(X),y )

:::: = λ y.&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x \isin X}&lt;/math&gt;( f(x,y) )

:::: = &lt;math&gt;\sup_{x \isin X}&lt;/math&gt;( λy.f(x,y) )

:::: = sup(&lt;math&gt;\check{f}&lt;/math&gt;(X))

::''Proof'' (ii): Defining L = λ &lt;math&gt; f.\check{f} &lt;/math&gt; then for F &lt;math&gt; \subseteq [D \times D^{'} \rightarrow D^{''}]&lt;/math&gt; directed

::L(sup(F)) = λ x λ y. (sup(F))(x,y))

:::: = λ x λ y. &lt;math&gt;\sup_{y \isin F}&lt;/math&gt;f(x,y)

:::: = &lt;math&gt;\sup_{y \isin F} &lt;/math&gt;λx λy.f(x,y)

:::: = sup(L(F))

It has not been demonstrated how and why the λ-calculus defines the Scott topology.

==Böhm trees and computational topology==

[[Böhm trees]], easily represented graphically, express the computational behavior of a [[lambda term]]. It is possible to predict the functionality of a given lambda expression from reference to its correlating Böhm tree.&lt;ref name="Barendregt" /&gt; Böhm trees can be seen somewhat analogous to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where the Böhm tree of a given set is similar to the continued fraction of a real number, and what is more, the Böhm tree corresponding to a sequence in [[Canonical normal form|normal form]] is finite, similar to the rational subset of the Reals.

Böhm trees are defined by a mapping of elements within a sequence of numbers with ordering (≤, lh) and a binary operator * to a set of symbols. The Böhm tree is then a relation among a set of symbols through a partial mapping ψ.

Informally Böhm trees may be conceptualized as follows:

:Given: Σ = &lt;math&gt;\perp \cup &lt;/math&gt; { λ x_{1} &lt;math&gt;\cdots &lt;/math&gt;x_{n} . y | n ∈ &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{N}, x_{1} ... x_{n}&lt;/math&gt;y are variables and denoting BT(M) as the Böhm tree for a lambda term M we then have:

:BT(M) = ⊥  if M is unsolvable (therefore a single node)
&lt;poem&gt;	
     BT(M) = λ&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;.y
                  /&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\               
     BT(&lt;math&gt; M_{1} )&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;BT(&lt;math&gt; M_{m}&lt;/math&gt; ) ; if M is solvable
&lt;/poem&gt;	
More formally:

Σ is defined as a set of symbols. The Böhm tree of a λ term M, denoted BT(M), is the Σ labelled tree defined as follows:

::If ''M'' is unsolvable:

:: &lt;math&gt; BT(M)(\langle\ \rangle) = \perp,&lt;/math&gt;

::BT(M)(&lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle *  \alpha&lt;/math&gt;) is unsolvable &lt;math&gt;\forall k, \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

If M is solvable, where M = λ x_{1}&lt;math&gt; \cdots x_{n}.y M_{0} \cdots M_{m-1}&lt;/math&gt;:

::BT(M)(&lt; &gt;) = λ x_{1} &lt;math&gt;\cdots x_{n}.y&lt;/math&gt;

::BT(M)(&lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle *  \alpha&lt;/math&gt;) = BT(M_k)(&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and k &lt; m

:::::= undefined  &lt;math&gt;\forall  \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and k ≥ m

We may now move on to show that Böhm trees act as suitable mappings from the tree topology to the scott topology. Allowing one to see computational constructs, be it within the Scott or tree topology, as Böhm tree formations.

===Böhm tree and tree topology===

It is found that [[Böhm tree]]'s allow for a [[continuous map]]ping from the tree topology to the Scott topology. More specifically:

We begin with the cpo B = (B,⊆) on the Scott topology, with ordering of Böhm tree's denoted M⊆ N, meaning M, N are trees and M results from N. The [[tree topology]] on the set Ɣ is the smallest set allowing for a continuous map

::BT:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma \rightarrow &lt;/math&gt;''B''.

An equivalent definition would be to say the open sets of Ɣ are the image of the inverse Böhm tree &lt;math&gt; BT^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (O) where O is Scott open in ''B''.

The applicability of the Bömh trees and the tree topology has many interesting consequences to λ-terms expressed topologically:

:Normal forms are found to exist as isolated points.

:Unsolvable λ-terms are compactification points.

:Application and abstraction, similar to the Scott topology, are continuous on the tree topology.

==Algebraic structure of computation==

New methods of interpretation of the λ-calculus are not only interesting in themselves but allow new modes of thought concerning the behaviors of computer science. The binary operator within the λ-algebra  A is application. Application is denoted &amp;middot; and is said to give structure &lt;math&gt;A=(X, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[combinatory algebra]] allows for the application operator and acts as a useful starting point but remains insufficient for the λ-calculus in being unable to express abstraction. The λ algebra becomes a combinatory algebra M combined with a syntactic operator λ* that transforms a term ''B(x,y)'', with constants in ''M'', into C(&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;)≡ λ* x.B(x,&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;). It is also possible to define an [[Algebraic extension|extension]] model to circumvent the need of the λ* operator by allowing ∀x   (fx =gx) &amp;rArr; f =g . The construction of the λ-algebra through the introduction of an abstraction operator proceeds as follows:

We must construct an algebra which allows for solutions to equations such as axy = xyy  such that a = λ xy.xyy there is need for the combinatory algebra. Relevant attributes of the combinatory algebra are:

Within combinatory algebra there exists ''applicative structures''. An applicative structure W is a combinatory algebra provided:
::&amp;middot;W is non-trival, meaning W has [[cardinality]] &gt; 1
::&amp;middot;W exhibits combinatory completeness (see [[combinatory logic|completeness of the S-K basis]]). More specifically: for every term A ∈ the set of terms of W, and &lt;math&gt; x_1, ... , x_n &lt;/math&gt; with the free variables of A within &lt;math&gt;{x_1, ... ,x_n}&lt;/math&gt; then:
::: &lt;math&gt; \exists f  \forall x_1 \cdot \cdot \cdot x_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; fx_1 \cdot \cdot \cdot x_n = A &lt;/math&gt;

The combinatory algebra is:
*Never commutative
*Not associative.
*Never finite.
*Never recursive.

Combinatory algebras remain unable to act as the algebraic structure for λ-calculus, the lack of recursion being a major disadvantage. However the existence of an applicative term &lt;math&gt;A(x, \vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;) provides a good starting point to build a λ-calculus algebra. What is needed is the introduction of a [[lambda term]], i.e. include λx.A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;).

We begin by exploiting the fact that within a combinatory algebra M, with A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;) within the set of terms, then:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall \vec{y}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\exists b&lt;/math&gt; s.t. bx = A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;).
We then require b have a dependence on &lt;math&gt; \vec{y}&lt;/math&gt; resulting in:
:::&lt;math&gt;\forall x&lt;/math&gt; B(&lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;)x = A(x, &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;).
B(&lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;) becomes equivalent to a λ term, and is therefore suitably defined as follows:  B(&lt;math&gt;\vec{y}) \equiv&lt;/math&gt; λ*.

A ''pre-λ-algebra'' (pλA) can now be defined.
::pλA is an applicative structure W = (X,&amp;middot;) such that for each term A within the set of terms within W and for every x there is a term λ*x.A ∈ T(W) (T(W) ≡ the terms of W) where (the set of free variables of λ*x.A) = (the set of free variables of A) - {x}. W must also demonstrate:
::&lt;math&gt;(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; (λ*x.A)x = A
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{1}&lt;/math&gt;λ*x.A≡ λ*x.A[x:=y] provided y is not a free variable of A
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{2}&lt;/math&gt;(λ*x.A)[y:=z]≡λ*x.A[x:=y] provided y,z ≠ x and z is not a free variable of A

Before defining the full λ-algebra we must introduce the following definition for the set of λ-terms within W denoted &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt; with the following requirements:
::a ∈ W &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow c_{a} \isin \Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt;
::x ∈ &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt; for x ∈ (&lt;math&gt; v_0, v_1, ... &lt;/math&gt;)
::M,N ∈ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W) \Rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; (MN) ∈ &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(W) &lt;/math&gt;
::M ∈ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W) \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (λx.M) ∈ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)&lt;/math&gt;

A mapping from the terms within &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)&lt;/math&gt; to all λ terms within W, denoted '''*''' : &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)\rightarrow \Tau(W) &lt;/math&gt;, can then be designed as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;v_{i}^{*} = w_i, c_{a}^{*} = c_a &lt;/math&gt;
::(MN)* = M* N*
::(λx.M)* = λ* x*.M*

We now define ''λ''(M) to denote the extension after evaluating the terms within &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(W)&lt;/math&gt;. 
::λx.(λy.yx)&lt;math&gt;c_a&lt;/math&gt; = λx.&lt;math&gt;c_a&lt;/math&gt;x in ''λ''(W).

Finally we obtain the full ''λ-algebra'' through the following definition:
::(1) A λ-algebra is a pλA W such that for M,N ∈ Ɣ(W):
:::''λ''(W) [[turnstile (symbol)|⊢]] M = N &amp;rArr; W ⊨ M = N.

Though arduous, the foundation has been set for a proper algebraic framework for which the λ-calculus, and therefore computation, may be investigated in a [[group theory|group theoretic]] manner.

In [[computer science]], a '''computation history''' is a sequence of steps taken by an [[abstract machine]] in the process of computing its result.  Computation histories are frequently used in [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] about the capabilities of certain machines, and particularly about the [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of various [[formal languages]].

Formally, a computation history is a (normally [[Finite set|finite]]) sequence of '''configurations''' of a formal [[automaton]].  Each configuration fully describes the status of the machine at a particular point.  To be valid, certain conditions must hold:
* the first configuration must be a valid initial configuration of the automaton and
* each transition between adjacent configurations must be valid according to the transition rules of the automaton.
In addition, to be '''complete''', a computation history must be finite and
* the final configuration must be a valid terminal configuration of the automaton.
The definitions of "valid initial configuration", "valid transition", and "valid terminal configuration" vary for different kinds of formal machines.

A [[deterministic]] automaton has exactly one computation history for a given initial configuration, though the history may be infinite and therefore incomplete.

== Finite State Machines ==
For a [[finite state machine]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, a configuration is simply
the current state of the machine, together with the remaining input.  The first configuration must be the initial state of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and the complete input.  A transition from a configuration &lt;math&gt;(S,I)&lt;/math&gt; to
a configuration &lt;math&gt;(T,J)&lt;/math&gt; is allowed if &lt;math&gt;I=aJ&lt;/math&gt; for
some input symbol &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has a transition from
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  The final
configuration must have the empty string &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; as its remaining
input;  whether &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; has accepted or rejected the input depends
on whether the final state is an accepting state. &lt;ref name="MumfordJain2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christine L. Mumford|author2=Lakhmi C. Jain|title=Computational Intelligence: Collaboration, Fusion and Emergence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eECU8WrC99wC&amp;pg=PA337|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-01798-8|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turing Machines ==

Computation histories are more commonly used in reference to [[Turing machines]].  The configuration of a single-tape Turing machine consists of the contents of the tape, the position of the read/write head on the tape, and the current state of the associated state machine;  this is usually written

&lt;math&gt;...0011010101q00110101010...&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the current state of the machine, represented in some
way that's distinguishable from the tape language, and where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is
positioned immediately before the position of the read/write head.

Consider a Turing machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  The first
configuration must be &lt;math&gt;q_0 w_0 w_1 ...&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;
is the initial state of the Turing machine.  The machine's state in the final
configuration must be either &lt;math&gt;q_a&lt;/math&gt; (the accept state) or &lt;math&gt;q_r&lt;/math&gt;
(the reject state).  A configuration &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a valid successor
to configuration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; if there's a transition from the state in
&lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to the state in &lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; which manipulates the
tape and moves the read/write head in a way that produces the result in
&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Blass2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andreas Blass|title=Fields of Logic and Computation: Essays Dedicated to Yuri Gurevich on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqIRT51n74YC&amp;pg=PA468|accessdate=25 March 2012|date=22 October 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15024-1|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decidability results ===

Computation histories can be used to show that certain problems for
[[pushdown automata]] are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].  This is because the language of
non-accepting computation histories of a Turing machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;
on input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a [[context-free language]] recognizable by a
non-deterministic pushdown automaton.

We encode a Turing computation history &lt;math&gt;c_0,c_1,...,c_n&lt;/math&gt; as the
string &lt;math&gt;C_0 \# C^r_1 \# C_2 \# C^r_3 \# ... \# C_n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt;
is the encoding of configuration &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, as discussed above, and where
every other configuration is written in reverse.  Before reading a particular
configuration, the pushdown automaton makes a non-deterministic choice
to either ignore the configuration or read it completely onto the stack.

* If the pushdown automaton decides to ignore the configuration, it simply reads and discards it completely and makes the same choice for the next one.
* If it decides to process the configuration, it pushes it completely onto the stack, then verifies that the next configuration is a valid successor according to the rules of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  Since successive configurations are always written in opposite orders, this can be done by, for each tape symbol in the new configuration, popping off a symbol from the stack and checking if they're the same.  Where they disagree, it must be accountable for by a valid transition of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.  If, at any point, the automaton decides that the transition is invalid, it immediately enters a special accept state which ignores the rest of the input and accepts at the end.

In addition, the automaton verifies that the first configuration is the correct
initial configuration (if not, it accepts) and that the state of the final
configuration of the history is the accept state (if not, it accepts).  Since
a non-deterministic automaton accepts if there's any valid way for it to accept,
the automaton described here will discover if the history is not a valid
accepting history and will accept if so, and reject if not. &lt;ref name="Blum1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lenore Blum|title=Complexity and real computation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxtrVqUP-AwC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=25 March 2012|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-98281-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This same trick cannot be used to recognize ''accepting'' computation histories
with an NPDA, since non-determinism could be used to skip past a test that would
otherwise fail.  A linear-bounded Turing machine is sufficient to recognize
accepting computation histories.

This result allows us to prove that &lt;math&gt;ALL_{PDA}&lt;/math&gt;, the language
of pushdown automata which accept all input, is undecidable.  Suppose
we have a decider for it, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.  For any Turing machine
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and input &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, we can form the pushdown automaton
&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which accepts non-accepting computation histories for that
machine.  &lt;math&gt;D(P)&lt;/math&gt; will accept if and only if there are no
accepting computation histories for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;; this
would allow us to decide &lt;math&gt;A_{TM}&lt;/math&gt;, which we know to be undecidable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26306">A '''cost estimate''' is the approximation of the cost of a program, [[project]], or operation. The cost estimate is the product of the cost estimating process. The cost estimate has a single total value and may have identifiable component values. A problem with a [[cost overrun]] can be avoided with a credible, reliable, and accurate cost estimate. A cost estimator is the professional who prepares cost estimates. There are different types of cost estimators, whose title may be preceded by a modifier, such as [[building estimator]], or electrical estimator, or chief estimator. Other professionals such as [[quantity surveyor]]s and [[cost engineering|cost engineers]] may also prepare cost estimates or contribute to cost estimates. In the US, according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], there were 185,400 cost estimators in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2012-13 Edition, Cost Estimators, on the Internet at http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/cost-estimators.htm (visited October 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; There are around 75,000 professional quantity surveyors working in the UK.

==Overview==
The U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) defines a cost estimate as "the summation of individual cost elements, using established methods and valid data, to estimate the future costs of a program, based on what is known today". The GAO reports that "realistic cost estimating was imperative when making wise decisions in acquiring new systems."&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Accountabity Office, ''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', March 2009, Preface pg i&lt;/ref&gt; A cost estimate is often needed to support evaluations of project feasibility or funding requirements in support of planning. A cost estimate is often used to establish a [[budget]] as the cost constraint for a project or operation.

In [[project management]], [[project cost management]] is a major functional division. Cost estimating is one of three activities performed in project cost management.&lt;ref&gt;''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) Third Edition, An American National Standard, ANSI/PMI 99-001-2004'', Project Management Institute, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1-930699-45-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cost engineering]], cost estimation is a basic activity. A cost engineering reference book has chapters on capital investment cost estimation and operating cost estimation. The fixed capital investment provides the physical facilities. The working capital investment is a revolving fund to keep the facilities operating.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, ''Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

In system, product, or facility acquisition planning, a cost estimate is used to evaluate the required funding and to compare with bids or tenders.

In construction contracting, a cost estimate is usually prepared to submit a [[construction bidding|bid]] or tender to compete for a contract award.

In facility maintenance and operation, cost estimates are used to establish funding or budgets.

In an attempt to manage liability risk, some firms avoid the use of the word estimate and instead refer to the estimate as an "Opinion of Probable Cost."&lt;ref&gt;International Federation of Consulting Engineers, ''Risk Management Manual'', 1997, Pg 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost estimate types==
Various projects and operations have distinct types of cost estimating, which vary in their composition and preparation methods. Some of the major areas include:
*Construction cost        (i) detailed construction estimate    (ii) abstract construction estimate
*[[Manufacturing cost]]
*[[Cost estimation in software engineering|Software development cost]]
*Aerospace mission cost
*Resource exploration cost
*Facility operation cost
*Facility maintenance and repair cost
*Facility rehabilitation and renewal cost
*Facility retirement cost

==Cost estimate classifications==
Common cost estimate classifications historically used are
*Order of magnitude
*Preliminary
*Definitive
*Financial 
These correspond to modern published classes 5, 3, and 1, respectively. The U.S. Department of Energy and many others use a system of five classes of estimates:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Estimate class !! Name !! Purpose !! Project definition level
|-
| Class 5 || Order of magnitude || Screening or feasibility || 0% to 2%
|-
| Class 4 || Intermediate || Concept study or feasibility || 1% to 15%
|-
| Class 3 || Preliminary || Budget, authorization, or control || 10% to 40%
|-
| Class 2 || Substantive || Control or bid/tender || 30% to 70%
|-

Methods used to prepare the estimates range from [[stochastic]] or judgment at early definition to deterministic at later definition. Some estimates use mixed methods.&lt;ref&gt;''Cost Estimating Guide for Program and Project Management'', U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Management, Budget and Evaluation, DOE G 430.1-1X, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimate quality==
{{Over-quotation|date=December 2015}}
Estimate quality refers to the delineation of quality requirements for the estimate. These requirements are set out in accordance with formal [[quality assurance]] standards. There may also be other expectations for the estimate which are not specific requirements, but may affect the perceived quality of the estimate. Published quality requirements generally have to do with credibility, accuracy, confidence level, precision, risk, reliability, and validity of the estimate, as well as thoroughness, uniformity, consistency, verification, and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountability Office, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Provoc - Glossary of Common Project Control Terms," The Association of Cost Engineers (ACostE), http://www.acoste.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garold D. Oberlender and Steven M. Trost, "Predicting Accuracy of Early Cost Estimates Based on Estimate Quality", Journal of Construction Engineering and Management / Volume 127/ Issue 3/ TECHNICAL PAPERS, American Society of Civil Engineers, Abstract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Number or The Result; Reliability, Accuracy, Precision, Confidence, or What?" Cost Engineering Vol. 37/No.1 January 1995, AACE International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The result of bidding without good estimates is certain: jobs that end up with less profit, no profit, or a loss. The bidder ultimately will go out of business; the only question is how long will it take.”&lt;ref&gt;Dan G. Brock, "Good estimating can keep you from going out of business," Roads &amp; Streets, March, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ConeOfUncertainty.png|thumb|400px]]Since a cost estimate is the approximation of the cost of a project or operation, then estimate accuracy is a measure of how closely the estimate is able to predict the actual expenditures for the project or operation. This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific scope and conditions, and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, the estimate was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess the estimate accuracy. Predictions of the estimate accuracy may accompany the estimate. Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with the point estimate with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range.&lt;ref&gt;Larry R. Dysert CCC, "Is ‘Estimate Accuracy’ an Oxymoron?," AACE International Transactions, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  An example for a definitive estimate might be that the estimate has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range. The accuracy of an early estimate relates to the estimate quality. Factors affecting the quality of the estimate include the people who prepared the estimate, how the estimate was prepared, and what was known about the project.&lt;ref&gt;Garold D. Oberlender and Steven M. Trost, “Predicting Accuracy of Early Cost Estimates Based on Estimate Quality”, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management / Volume 127/ Issue 3/ TECHNICAL PAPERS, American Society of Civil Engineers, Abstract&lt;/ref&gt; For the same project, the range of uncertainty about the total estimate decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty diagram.

High-quality cost estimates can be produced by following a rigor of 12 steps&lt;ref&gt;GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Twelve Steps of a High-Quality Cost Estimating Process, on the Internet at http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/GAO%2012-Step%20Estimating%20Process.pdf (visited 12/13/2012)&lt;/ref&gt; outlined by the U.S. GAO. Detailed documentation is recommended to accompany the estimate. “The documentation addresses the purpose of the estimate, the program background and system description, its schedule, the scope of the estimate (in terms of time and what is and is not included), the ground rules and assumptions, all data sources, estimating methodology and rationale, the results of the risk analysis, and a conclusion about whether the cost estimate is reasonable. Therefore, a good cost estimate—while taking the form of a single number—is supported by detailed documentation that describes how it was derived and how the expected funding will be spent in order to achieve a given objective.”&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountability Office, March 2009, Pg 47&lt;/ref&gt; This documentation is often titled Basis of Estimate (or BOE). Additional documentation may accompany the estimate, including quantity takeoff documentation and supporting calculations, quotes, etc.

Although the pursuit of cost estimate accuracy should always be encouraged, a study in 2002 found that the estimates used to determine whether important infrastructure should be built were "highly and systematically misleading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flyvbjerg | first1 = Bent | year = 2002 | title = Underestimating Costs in Public Works Projects: Error or Lie? | url = | journal = Journal of American Planning Association | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 279–295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contingency==
A contingency may be included in an estimate to provide for unknown costs which are indicated as likely to occur by experience, but are not identifiable. When using an estimate which has no contingency to set a budget or to set aside funding, a contingency is often added to improve the probability that the budget or funding will be adequate to complete the project. Being unable to complete a project risks public ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;Luke,''The Bible'', Luke 14:28, numerous publishers&lt;/ref&gt; See [[cost contingency]] for more information. The estimate or budget contingency is not intended to compensate for poor estimate quality, and is not intended to fund design growth, owner changes, or anything else unrelated to delivering the scope as defined in the estimate documentation. Generally more contingency is needed for earlier estimates due to the higher uncertainty of estimate accuracy.18

==Cost estimating methods and best practices==
Estimating methods may vary by type and class of estimate. The method used for most definitive estimates is to fully define and understand the scope, take off or quantify the scope, and apply costing to the scope, which can then be summed to a total cost. Proper documentation and review are also important. Pricing transforms the cost estimate into what the firm wishes to charge for the scope. Early estimates may employ various means of cost modeling. The basic characteristics of effective estimating include: clear identification of task, broad participation in preparing estimates, availability of valid data, standardized structure for the estimate, provision for program uncertainties, recognition of inflation, recognition of excluded costs, independent review of estimates, and revision of estimates for significant program changes.&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountability Office, March 2009, Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; Application of [[best practices]] helps ensure a high-quality estimate. “Certain best practices should be followed if accurate and credible cost estimates are to be developed. These best practices represent an overall process of established, repeatable methods that result in high-quality cost estimates that are comprehensive and accurate and that can be easily and clearly traced, replicated, and updated.”&lt;ref&gt;''GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, Best Practices for Developing and Managing Capital Program Costs, GAO-09-3SP'', United States Government Accountabity Office, March 2009, Pg 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools that may be part of costs estimation are cost indexes.  These factors promote time adjustment of capital costs, following changes in technology, availability of materials and labor, and inflation.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, K. K., 2005. Project and Cost Engineers' Handbook. 4th ed. s.l.:Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inherent unavailability of up-to-date cost literature, several inflation or cost indexes are available.&lt;ref&gt;Silla, H., 2003. Chemical Process Engineering: Design and Economics. s.l.:Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction cost estimates===
Estimates for the cost of facility construction are a major part of the cost estimate domain. A construction [[general contractor]] or [[subcontractor]] must normally prepare definitive cost estimates to prepare bids in the [[construction bidding]] process to compete for award of the contract. Although many estimators participate in the bidding and [[procurement]] processes, those are not a necessary function of cost estimate preparation. Earlier estimates are prepared by differing methods by estimators and others to support the planning process and to compare with bids. One way to make those estimates is by determining the resources needed (e.g., the amount of construction material quantities that are required) and then multiplying the estimated construction material quantities by the corresponding unit cost. One advantage of making estimates in this way is that it allows for the segregation of quantities and costs. This way they can be updated separately as new information becomes available. They can also be tracked separately allowing decision makers to make better decisions about the project during its conceptual phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = García de Soto | first1 = B. | last2 = Adey | first2 = B. T. | last3 = Fernando | first3 = D. | year = 2014 | title = A process for the development and evaluation of preliminary construction material quantity estimation models using backward-elimination-regression and neural networks | url = | journal = Journal of Cost Analysis and Parametrics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 180–218 | doi = 10.1080/1941658X.2014.984880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definitive Estimates (Class 1)====
[[File:Old handwritten estimate.png|thumb|400px|A handwritten spreadsheet.]]
A definitive estimate is prepared from fully designed plans and specifications (or nearly so), preferably what are called contract documents (CD). The contract documents also establish the Scope of Work (SOW). The standard method is to review and understand the design package and take off (or perform a quantity survey of) the project scope by itemizing it into [[line items]] with measured quantities. RSMeans refers to this as, "Scope out the project," and, "Quantify."&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Waier, PE, et al, ''RSMeans Building Construction Cost Data 70th Annual Edition'', RSMeans a division of Reed Construction Data, {{ISBN|978-1-936335-29-9}}, Pg vii&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions or areas of practice define the itemization and measuration in certain terms, such as [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors|RICS]] and may have specific rules for development of a [[Bill of quantities]], or BOQ. The ASPE proposes a best practice standard method for the quantity survey. This includes using the [[Construction Specifications Institute]] Uniform Numbering System ([[MasterFormat]]) to ensure that all work is accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 91-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Then costs are applied to the quantified line items. This may be called costing or pricing. In estimating for contracting, the cost is what something costs you to build, and price is what you charge another party for building it. RSMeans refers to this as, "Price the quantities."&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Waier, PE, et al, ''RSMeans Building Construction Cost Data 70th Annual Edition'', RSMeans a division of Reed Construction Data, {{ISBN|978-1-936335-29-9}}, Pg vii&lt;/ref&gt; ASPE recommends the "quantity times material and labor costs format"&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 91&lt;/ref&gt; for the compilation of the estimate. This format is illustrated in the handwritten spreadsheet sample. For labor, the estimator should, "Determine basic production rates and multiply them by the units of work to determine total hours for the work."&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 95&lt;/ref&gt; and then multiply the hours by the per hour average labor cost.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 96&lt;/ref&gt; Labor burdens, material costs, construction equipment costs, and, if applicable, subcontractor costs are also extended on the estimate detail form.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 96-98&lt;/ref&gt; Other costs and pricing are added, such as [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], sales or use taxes, payment and performance bonds, [[Cost escalation|escalation]], and [[Cost contingency|contingency]].&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Estimating Practice Sixth Edition,'' American Society of Professional Estimators, Bni Publications, Inc, 2004, {{ISBN|1557014817}}, Pg 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs which are applied to the line-item quantities may come from a cost book (either internal or external) or [[cost database]]. For construction contractors or construction managers it is important to track and compile past data of trends, completed projects, production factors, equipment changes, and various labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;J. David Nardon, Bridge and Structure Estimating'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RGS Labor Norms.png|thumb|400px|Sample labor norms]]The labor requirements are often the most variable and are a primary focus of construction cost estimators. The labor hours required to construct each installation item are calculated by using a man-hour rate times the take-off quantity (a similar method is to divide the take-off quantity by the production rate). Many estimators use a man-hour norm reference for standard man-hours and apply an adjustment factor for project or task conditions, location, methods, equipment, labor skill, etc. to adjust for the anticipated effect on labor.

Direct costs are itemized for all necessary parts of the project. [[Indirect costs|Direct costs]] are all of the costs which can be attributed directly to the project. Direct costs include costs for general requirements (Division 1 of MasterFormat), which includes such items as [[project management]] and coordination, [[quality control]], temporary facilities and controls, cleaning and [[waste management]].&lt;ref&gt;MasterFormat Numbers &amp; Titles, April 2012,'' The Construction Specifications Institute and Construction Specifications Canada, Pg 8-14&lt;/ref&gt; Direct costs may also include the costs of project planning, investigation, studies, and design; land or right of way acquisition, and other non-construction costs. Usually, a subtotal of total direct costs is provided in the estimate.

Provisions are made for [[Indirect costs]] in addition to the direct costs. Indirect costs include [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], sales or use taxes, payment and [[performance bond]]s, [[Cost escalation|escalation]], and [[Cost contingency|contingency]]. Profit is cost to the buyer, but is not a cost to the provider, rather a projection of anticipated income.

A well documented cost estimate includes a Basis of Estimate (BOE), which describes the scope basis, pricing basis, methods, assumptions, inclusions, and exclusions.

====Order-of-Magnitude Estimates (Class 5)====
An [[order of magnitude|order-of-magnitude]] estimate is prepared when little or no design information is available for the project. It is called order of magnitude because that may be all that can be determined at an early stage. In other words, perhaps we can only determine that it is of a 10,000,000 magnitude as opposed to a 1,000,000 magnitude. Various techniques are employed for these estimates, including experience and judgment, historical values and charts, rules of thumb, and simple mathematical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, ''Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983, Page 324&lt;/ref&gt; Factor estimating is one of the more popular methods. This involves taking the known cost of a similar facility and factoring the cost for size,&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Jelen, James H. Black, ''Cost and Optimization Engineering, Third Edition'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1983, Page 333&lt;/ref&gt; place, and time. Cost modeling is another common technique. In cost modeling the estimator models the various parameters of the facility and applies costs to the derived scope.

Building estimators or architects may use the [[Uniformat]] system of breaking down the building into functional systems or assemblies during the schematic design (SD) phase of planning and design.&lt;ref&gt;"Uniformat," Construction Specifications Institute, http://www.csinet.org/uniformat&lt;/ref&gt; The RSMeans Square Foot Costs book organizes building costs according to the 7 divisions of the UNIFORMAT II classification system.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Phelan, AIA, et al, ''RSMeans Square Foot Costs'', RSMeans a division of Reed Construction Data, {{ISBN|978-1-936335-74-9}}, Pg v&lt;/ref&gt; The 7 divisions are:
*A Substructure
*B Shell
*C Interiors
*D Services
*E Equipment &amp; Furnishings
*F Special Construction
*G Building Site Work

=Background=
In 1998, Braschi left the Catholic Church for the  [[Catholic Apostolic Charismatic Church of Jesus the King]] and became bishop of it.&lt;ref name=Vatican85 /&gt; On June 29, 2002, on a boat on the [[Danube River]], Austria,&lt;ref name=Vatican85 /&gt; Braschi ordained seven Catholic women, called the [[Danube Seven]], to the priesthood: Christine Mayr-Lumetzberger, Adelinde Roitinger, Gisela Forster, Iris Müller, Ida Raming, Pia Brunner and Dagmar Braun Celeste (who called herself Angela White).&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The Bishop of Linz and of the Austrian Episcopal Conference intervened, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On July 10, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith warned the eight persons that they would be excommunicated on July 22 if they did not repent.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On August 5, the Congregation issued a decree of excommunication of the eight persons.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The excommunicated people then published letters and granted interviews about the ordinations, explaining how it was valid, that the Catholic Church ought to allow women to be ordained, and how they had celebrated the sacraments.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On August 14 and September 27, the people requested the Congregation to revoke the excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The latter request made reference to canons regarding recourse against administrative decrees in the [[Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P6Y.HTM Vatican.Va: Code of Canon Law 1732-1739]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On October 21, the Congregation replied that it would look into the matter.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt;

=Contents=
The decree explains the excommunicated party's background, then the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's response to the party's request for the revocation of their excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The response was prepared by fifteen members of the Congregation: Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger, Alfonso López Trujillo, Ignace Moussa I. Daoud, Giovanni Battista Re, Francis Arinze, Jozef Tomko, Achille Silvestrini, Jorge Medina Estévez, James Francis Stafford, Zenon Grocholewski, Walter Kasper, Crescenzio Sepe, Mario Francesco Pompedda and Bishops Tarcisio Bertone, SDB, and Rino Fisichella.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The fifteen members met multiple times to discuss the matter, and ultimately came to a "collegial decision" to not revoke the excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The Congregation listed the reasons for why this was the case: the excommunication was not a [[latae sententiae]] penalty, but a [[ferendae sententiae]] penalty, as per Canons 1314, 1319, and 1347; the excommunication was issued by the [[Pope]] through the Congregation, as per Canon 360; the offense was grave and evident; the women, by choosing to be ordained by a schismatic, became schismatics themselves; the women rejected the [[magisterium]] of the Pope and the dogma on ordination that he definitively proposed in ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]''; the women, by inciting other Catholics to schism, were justly punished so as to protect the faith, communion and unity of the church and guide the consciences of the faithful; and the excommunication was intended to provoke the six persons to [[repentance]].&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt;

The word "'''ericoid'''" is used in modern biological terminology for its literal meanings and for extensions. Etymologically the word is derived from two [[Greek language|Greek]] roots via Latin adaptations.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the [[Ancient Greek]] name for plants now known in English as "heather" was "'''''ἐρείκη'''''", believed to be Latinised by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] as "Erica".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gledhill |first=David |title=The Names of Plants |year=2008 |page=156 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86645-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linnaeus]], who predominantly wrote in Latin, used ''[[Erica]]'' as the name of the genus which still is known as such.

However, when Linnaeus named an organism, using a specific epithet that described it as being like some particular thing, he commonly did so by appending the suffix "'''''&amp;mdash;οειδης'''''". That was a contraction of "'''''&amp;mdash;ο + ειδος'''''", denoting a likeness of form. In its Latinised form it became: "''&amp;mdash;oides''".&lt;ref name="isbn0-398-06179-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaeger, Edmund Carroll |title=A source-book of biological names and terms |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1959 |pages= |isbn=0-398-06179-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the entry 9413 ''Stilbe ericoides'' according to Wappler's ''Index Plantarum'' to Linnaeus' "''Species Plantarum''".&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Index Plantarum quae continentur in Linnaeani Systematis. Printed Christian Friedrich Wappler, Vienna 1785&lt;/ref&gt; Further derivations emerged at need or convenience, such as "''&amp;mdash;oidea''".

Accordingly, '''ericoid''' could have more than one meaning and it has been misapplied from time to time in the literature. For example, sometimes a writer uses it where the correct word would be "ericaceous", meaning a member of, or related to, the family [[Ericaceae]]. More precisely ericoid means "resembling an Erica" in some relevant way.&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon;'' A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent''; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the commonest use is in reference to a plant's habit, in particular its leaves. The term is not precise, but "ericoid leaves" is a convenient way to describe small, tough ([[sclerophyll]]ous) leaves like those of heather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Collocott, T. C. (ed.) | title = Chambers Dictionary of science and technology | publisher = W. and R. Chambers | location = Edinburgh | year = 1974 | isbn = 0550132023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to a plant, ericoid generally means that apart from its sclerophyllous leaves, it has short internodes so that the leaves more or less cover the usually slender [[branch]]lets.

'''European Pathway to Zero Waste''' is an EU demonstration project part funded by [[The LIFE Programme]] (LIFE+), the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and is a partnership between the [[Environment Agency]] and [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] (WRAP). The project has been set up to investigate practical ways to achieve zero waste to landfill in the South East of England. It will share the results with colleagues both in the UK and in relevant EU Member States. Zero waste in this context is an approach to supporting the sustainable use of resources by business to benefit both the economy and the environment. It concentrates on reducing, re-using, recycling and recovering energy from waste. The project will run to March 2013.

[[File:Pairwise coevolution.svg|right|thumb|'''Pairwise coevolution'''
When [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] received an [[Angraecum sesquipedale|orchid]] from [[Madagascar]] whose [[nectary]] was one and a half feet long, he surmised that there must be a [[pollinator]] [[moth]] with a [[proboscis]] long enough to reach the nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kritsky | first1 = G | year = 1991 | title = Darwin's Madagascan Hawk Moth prediction | url = | journal = American Entomologist | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 206–209 | doi=10.1093/ae/37.4.206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its attempt to get the nectar, the moth would have [[pollen]] rubbed onto its head, and the next orchid visited would then be pollinated. In 1903, such a moth was discovered: ''[[Xanthopan morganii]]''. This was an example of an evolutionary [[prediction]]. However, because species coevolve within large networks of multispecies ecological interactions, this example of [[pairwise coevolution]] is more the exception than the rule.]]
'''Evolving digital ecological networks''' are webs of interacting, [[self-replication|self-replicating]], and [[evolution|evolving]] [[computer program]]s (i.e., [[digital organism]]s) that experience the same major [[ecology|ecological interactions]] as [[biological organism]]s (e.g., [[Competition (biology)|competition]], [[predation]], [[parasitism]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]). Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological [[Biological network|networks]] can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism [[phenotype]]s. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of [[Boolean logic|logical computations]] (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed [[behavior (biology)|behaviors]] that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logic-defined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within [[evolutionary ecology]] (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved).

==Overview==
In nature, species do not evolve in isolation but in large networks of interacting species. One of the main goals in evolutionary ecology is to disentangle the evolutionary mechanisms that shape and are shaped by [[Biological interaction|patterns of interaction]] between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Post DM, Palkovacs EP | title = Eco-evolutionary feedbacks in community and ecosystem ecology: interactions between the ecological theatre and the evolutionary play | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The concept of diffuse coevolution, where adaptation is in response to a suite of biotic interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janzen DH | year = 1990 | title = When is it coevolution? | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 611–612 | doi=10.2307/2408229}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first step towards a framework unifying relevant theories in community ecology and coevolution. Understanding how individual interactions within networks influence coevolution, and conversely how coevolution influences the overall structure of networks, requires an appreciation for how pair-wise interactions change due to their broader community contexts as well as how this community context shapes selective pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox LR | year = 1988 | title = Diffuse coevolution within complex communities | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 906–907 | doi=10.2307/1941243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Thompson JN | date = 1994 | title = The coevolutionary process | publisher = University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, research is now focusing on how reciprocal selection influences and is embedded within the structure of multispecies interactive webs, not only on particular species in isolation.&lt;ref name=webOfLife/&gt;

Coevolution in a community context can be addressed [[theoretical ecology|theoretically]] via [[mathematical model]]ing and simulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoder JB, Nuismer SL | title = When does coevolution promote diversification? | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 176 | issue = 6 | pages = 802–17 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20950142 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1086/657048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilman RT, Nuismer SL, Jhwueng DC | title = Coevolution in multidimensional trait space favours escape from parasites and pathogens | journal = Nature | volume = 483 | issue = 7389 | pages = 328–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22388815 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nature10853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by looking at ancient footprints of [[evolutionary history of life|evolutionary history]] via ecological patterns that persist and are observable today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rezende EL, Lavabre JE, Guimarães PR, Jordano P, Bascompte J | title = Non-random coextinctions in phylogenetically structured mutualistic networks | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7156 | pages = 925–8 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17713534 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nature05956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gómez JM, Verdú M, Perfectti F | title = Ecological interactions are evolutionarily conserved across the entire tree of life | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7300 | pages = 918–21 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20520609 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nature09113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by performing laboratory experiments with [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="Bohannan BJM 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bohannan BJ, Lenski RE | year = 2000 | title = Linking genetic change to community evolution: insights from studies of bacteria and bacteriophage | url = | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 362–377 | doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00161.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the long time scales involved and the substantial effort that is necessary to isolate and quantify samples, the latter approach of testing biological evolution in the lab has been successful over the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenski RE, Travisano M | title = Dynamics of adaptation and diversification: a 10,000-generation experiment with bacterial populations | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 15 | pages = 6808–14 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 8041701 | pmc = 44287 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studying the evolution of interspecific interactions, which involves dealing with more complex webs of multiple interacting species, has proven to be a much more difficult challenge. A meta-analysis of [[bacteriophage|host-phage]] interaction networks, carried out by Weitz and his team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores CO, Meyer JR, Valverde S, Farr L, Weitz JS | title = Statistical structure of host-phage interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 28 | pages = E288-97 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21709225 | pmc = 3136311 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101595108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a striking statistical structure to the patterns of infection and resistance across a wide variety of environments and methods from which the hosts and phage were obtained. However, the ecological mechanisms and evolutionary processes responsible have yet to be unraveled.

Digital ecological networks enable the direct, comprehensive, and real time observation of evolving ecological interactions between antagonistic and/or mutualistic digital organisms that are difficult to study in nature. Research using self-replicating computer programs can help us understand how coevolution shapes the emergence and diversification of coevolving species interaction networks and, in turn, how changes in the overall structure of the web (e.g., through extinction of taxa or the introduction of invasive species) affect the evolution of a given species. Studying the evolution of species interaction networks in these artificial evolving systems also contributes to the development of the field, while overcoming limitations evolutionary biologists may face. For example, laboratory studies have shown that historical contingency can enable or impede the outcome of the interactions between bacteria and phage, depending on the order in which mutations occur: the phage often, but not always, evolve the ability to infect a novel host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer JR, Dobias DT, Weitz JS, Barrick JE, Quick RT, Lenski RE | title = Repeatability and contingency in the evolution of a key innovation in phage lambda | journal = Science | volume = 335 | issue = 6067 | pages = 428–32 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22282803 | pmc = 3306806 | doi = 10.1126/science.1214449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in order to obtain [[statistical power]] for predicting such outcomes of the coevolutionary process, experiments require a high level of replication. This [[stochastic]] nature of the evolutionary process was exemplified by Stephen Jay Gould's inquiry ("''What would happen if the tape of the history of life were rewound and replayed?''"&lt;ref&gt;Gould SJ (1990) Wonderful life: the Burgess Shale and the nature of history. W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;) Because of their ease in scalability and [[Replication (statistics)|replication]], evolving digital ecological networks open the door to experiments that incorporate this approach of ''replaying the tape of life''. Such experiments allow researchers to quantify the role of historical contingency and repeatability in network evolution, enabling predictions about the architecture and dynamics of large networks of interacting species.

The inclusion of ecological interactions in digital systems enables new research avenues: investigations using self-replicating computer programs complement laboratory efforts by broadening the breadth of viable experiments focused on the emergence and diversification of coevolving interactions in complex communities. This cross-disciplinary research program provides fertile grounds for new collaborations between computer scientists and evolutionary biologists.

==History==

===Coreworld===

The field of digital life was inspired by the rampant [[computer virus]]es of the 1980s. These viruses were self-replicating computer programs that spread from one computer to another, but they did not evolve. [[Steen Rasmussen]] was the first to include the possibility of mutation in self-replicating computer programs by extending the once-popular [[Core War]] game, where programs competed in a digital battle ground for the computer's resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rasmussen S, Knudsen C, Feldberg R, Hindsholm M | year = 1990 | title = The coreworld: emergence and evolution of cooperative structures in a computational chemistry | doi = 10.1016/0167-2789(90)90070-6 | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 111–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rasmussen observed some interesting evolution, mutations in this early [[genetic programming]] language produced many unstable organisms, thus prohibiting scientific experiments. Just one year later, [[Thomas S. Ray]] developed an alternative system, [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]], and performed the first successful experiments with evolving populations of self-replicating computer programs.&lt;ref name=Tierra&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ray TS | year = 1992 | chapter = An approach to the synthesis of life. | veditors = Langton CG, Taylor C, Farmer JD, Rasmussen S | title = Proceedings of Artificial Life | volume = II | pages = 371-408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tierra===

Thomas S. Ray created a genetic language similar to earlier digital systems, but added several key features that made it more suitable for evolution in his [[artificial life]] system, Tierra. Primarily, he prevented instructions from writing beyond the ''privately'' allocated [[computer memory|memory space]], thus limiting the potential for organisms writing over others.&lt;ref name=Tierra /&gt; The only [[evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] in Tierra was for rapid self-replication. Over the course of evolution, this pressure led to shorter and shorter genomes, reducing the time spent copying instructions during replication. Some individuals even started executing the replication [[source code|code]] in other organisms, allowing those [[cheating (biology)|"cheaters"]], which were originally referred to as parasites in Ray's work, to further shrink their genetic programs. This form of cheating was the first evolved ecological interaction between organisms in artificial life software. Ray's cheaters pre-dated the formal study of evolving ecological interactions using Tierra-like digital evolution platforms by 20 years.

===Avida===

In 1993, [[Chris Adami|Christoph Adami]], [[Charles Ofria]], and C. Titus Brown created the artificial life platform [[Avida]]&lt;ref name=Avida&gt;[http://avida.devosoft.org/download/ Avida download page] ([https://www.webcitation.org/68kLnHVkF WebCite archive])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilke /&gt; at [[Caltech|the California Institute of Technology]]. They added the ability for digital organisms to obtain bonus [[instruction cycle|CPU cycles]] for performing computational tasks, like adding two numbers together. In Avida, researchers can define the available tasks and set the consequences for organisms upon successful calculation.&lt;ref name=wilke&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ofria C, Wilke CO | title = Avida: a software platform for research in computational evolutionary biology | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–229 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15107231 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1162/106454604773563612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When organisms are rewarded with additional CPU cycles, their replication rate increases. Since Avida was designed specifically as a scientific tool, it allows users to collect a comprehensive suite of data about evolving populations. Due to its flexibility and data tracking abilities, Avida has become the most widely used digital system for studying evolution. The Devolab&lt;ref name=Devolab&gt;[http://devolab.msu.edu/ Devolab]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[BEACON Center]] currently continues development of Avida.

[[File:Self-replication.ogv|thumb| 500px|'''Self-replication of a digital organism.'''
The circular genome of a digital organism, on the left, consists of a set of instructions (represented here as letters). Some of these instructions are involved in the copy process and others in completing computational tasks. The experimenter determines the probability of mutations. Copy mutations occur when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced by a random instruction in the forming offspring's genome (as can be seen in the offspring, on the right). Other types of mutations, such as [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]] are also implemented. Initially, all three of the parent's hardware ''[[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]'' are in the same location, at the instruction represented here by ''r''. As execution begins, the instruction pointer (indicated by an ''i'') advances. The first few instructions allocate space for the [[offspring]], and then move the write-head pointer (indicated by a ''w'') into that space. The flow pointer (indicated by an ''f'') is used to move the other pointers to genetically specified locations. The remainder of the process of self replication is carried out by a set of instructions at the end of the genome, commonly referred to as the copy-loop. When execution reaches the copy-loop, the flow pointer is used to keep the flow of execution inside of a loop that advances the read and write heads and copies instructions from the parent genome (read-head) to the offspring genome (write-head). Arcs inside the circular genome represent the [[control flow|execution flow]], showing most of the [[instruction cycle|CPU cycles]] being used during the copying process. After genome replication is complete, the parent organism divides off its offspring, which must now fend for itself within the Avida world. This animation was generated using [[Avida|Avida-ED]], which is available under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].&lt;ref name=Avida/&gt;]]

==Implementation==

===Digital organisms===

Digital organisms in Avida are self-replicating computer programs with a genome composed of assembly-like instructions. The genetic programming language in Avida contains instructions for manipulating values in [[processor register|registers]] and [[stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] as well as for [[control flow]] and mathematical operations. Each digital organism contains [[virtual machine|virtual hardware]] on which its genome is executed. To reproduce, digital organisms must copy their genome instruction by instruction into a new region of [[computer memory|memory]] through a potentially [[Noisy channel coding theorem|noisy channel]] that may lead to errors (i.e., [[mutation]]s). While most mutations are detrimental, [[mutant]]s will occasionally have higher fitness than their parents, thereby providing the basis for [[natural selection]] with all of the necessary components for [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]]. Digital organisms can acquire random [[Boolean algebra|binary numbers]] from the environment and are able to manipulate them using their genetic instructions, including the logic instruction ''[[NAND logic|NAND]]''. With only this instruction, digital organisms can compute any other task by stringing together various operations because NAND is a universal logic function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenski RE, Ofria C, Collier TC, Adami C | title = Genome complexity, robustness and genetic interactions in digital organisms | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6745 | pages = 661–4 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10458160 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/23245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the output of processing random numbers from the environment corresponds to the result of a particular [[Boolean algebra|logic task]], then that task is incorporated into the set of tasks the organism performs, which in turn, defines part of its [[phenotype]].

===Digital interactions===

Interactions between digital organisms occur through phenotypic matching, which, in the case of task-based phenotypes, results from the performance of overlapping logic functions. Different mechanisms for mapping phenotypic matching to interactions can be implemented, depending on the antagonistic or mutualistic nature of the interaction.

[[Image:Logical computations, i.e. tasks, partially define phenotypes, and phenotypic matching leads to ecological interactions.svg|500px|thumb|'''Logical computations, i.e. tasks, partially define phenotypes, and phenotypic matching leads to ecological interactions'''
Digital organisms process [[Binary numeral system|binary numbers]] taken from the environment using the instructions that constitute their [[genome]]s. When the output of processing those numbers equals the result of applying a [[Boolean algebra|logic function]], the digital organism is said to have performed that task. The combination of tasks performed by a digital organism partially defines its phenotype. The center of the figure depicts the output of applying eight [[Truth table|logical operators]] (tasks) on the two input numbers above. On the left and right, five hypothetical [[Host (biology)|host]] (green) and [[Parasitism|parasite]] (red) phenotypes are represented as columns (on the top) and as circles (below). On the top, each column depicts a phenotype and each row represents a task. Tasks performed by each phenotype are filled. In the lower part, the interaction networks between hosts and parasites are illustrated, which result from phenotypic matching: a parasite infects a host (indicated by a line) if it performs at least one task that is also performed by the host. Inset numbers indicate the identity of phenotypes represented on the top. Arrows represent the temporal direction of the [[coevolution|coevolutionary process]]: from the earliest phenotype to the most recent one. The order of tasks (from top to bottom) indicates the time needed for a digital organism to perform that task over the course of the evolutionary trajectory. Depending on the pattern of tasks performed by the digital organisms, a [[modularity|modular]] (left) or [[nestedness|nested]] (right) interaction network can emerge.]]

====Host-parasite interactions====

In [[parasitism|host-parasite interactions]], the parasite organisms benefits at the expense of the host organisms. Parasites in Avida are implemented just like other self-replicating digital organisms, but they live inside [[host (biology)|hosts]] and execute parasitic [[thread (computing)|threads]] using CPU cycles stolen from their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Zaman, L., Devangam, S, Ofria, C. (2011). Rapid host-parasite coevolution drives the production and maintenance of diversity in digital organisms. Proceedings of the 13th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (GECCO), 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Because parasites impose a cost (lost CPU cycles) on hosts, there is selection for resistance, and when resistance starts to spread in a population, there is selective pressure for parasites to infect those new resistant hosts. [[infectious disease|Infection]] occurs when both the parasite and host perform at least one overlapping task. Thus a host is resistant to a particular parasite if they do not share any tasks. This mechanism of infection mimics the inverse-gene-for-gene model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenton A, Antonovics J, Brockhurst MA | title = Inverse-gene-for-gene infection genetics and coevolutionary dynamics | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | pages = E230-42 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19852618 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1086/645087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which infection only occurs if a host susceptibility gene (the presence of a logic task) is matched by a parasite virulence gene (a parasite performing the same task). Additional infection mechanisms, such as the matching allele and [[Gene-for-gene relationship|gene-for-gene]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agrawal A, Lively CM | year = 2002 | title = Infection genetics: gene-for-gene versus matching-alleles models an all points in between | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology Research | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 79–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be implemented.

In traditional infection genetic models, host resistance and pathogen infectivity have associated costs. These costs are an important part of theory about why defense genes do not always fix rapidly within populations.&lt;ref name="Bohannan BJM 2000"/&gt; Costs are also present in digital host-parasite interactions: performing more or more complex tasks implies larger genomes and hence slower reproduction. Tasks may also allow organisms access to resources present in the abiotic environment, and the environment can be carefully manipulated to control the relative costs or benefits of resistance.

By keeping track of task-based phenotypes as well as tracking information about successful infections in the [[community (ecology)|community]], researchers are able to perfectly reconstruct the interaction networks of digital coevolving hosts and parasites. The structure of these networks is a result of the interplay between ecological processes, mainly host abundance, and coevolutionary dynamics, which lead to changes in host specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poulin R | title = Network analysis shining light on parasite ecology and diversity | journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 492–8 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20561821 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2010.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avida host-parasite coevolution web.ogv|thumb| 500px|'''Evolving host-parasite webs.'''
Starting from a host phenotype (green node) and a parasite phenotype (red node), a complex network of interactions (arrows) between hosts and parasites emerges from the coevolutionary process. Nodes representing new host and parasite phenotypes appear and disappear over evolutionary time. The abundance of individuals expressing each phenotype changes continuously (indicated by node size) altering interaction patterns, and thus influencing subsequent coevolutionary dynamics. Interactions between a host phenotype and a parasite phenotype are depicted as arrows pointing in opposite directions: the thickness of red arrows indicates the fraction of [[infectious disease|infections]] that a particular parasite is responsible for inflicting on the indicated host phenotype, while the thickness of the green arrows indicates the fraction of all of the hosts a particular parasite phenotype infects that is accounted for by the indicated host phenotype. Often asymmetry between the thicknesses of arrow-pairs leads to red arrows dominating the picture. At these times, most parasite phenotypes are infecting only a small fraction of hosts expressing a given phenotype. Instead, the majority of those hosts are being infected by parasites with other phenotypes.

====Mutualistic interactions====

Interactions in which both species obtain mutual benefit, such as those between flowering plants and pollinators, and birds and fleshy fruits, can be implemented in evolving digital experiments by following the same task matching approach used for host-parasite interactions, but using free-living organisms instead of parasitic threads. For example, one way to set up a plant-pollinator type of interaction is to use an environment containing two mutually exclusive resources: one designated for "plant" organisms and one for "pollinator" organisms. Similar to parasites attempting infection, if tasks overlap between a pollinator and a plant it visits, pollination is successful and both organisms obtain extra CPU cycles. Thus, these digital organisms obtain mutual benefit when they perform at least one common task, and more common tasks lead to larger mutual benefits. While this is one specific way to enable mutualistic interactions, many others are possible in Avida. Interactions that begin as parasitic may even evolve to be mutualistic under the right conditions. In most cases, coevolution will result in concurrent interactions between multiple phenotypes. Thus, observed networks of mutualistic interactions can inform our understanding about the outcomes and processes of coevolution in complex communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guimarães PR, Jordano P, Thompson JN | title = Evolution and coevolution in mutualistic networks | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 877–85 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21749596 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01649.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Predator-prey interactions====

While [[host-parasite coevolution|host-parasite]] and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] interactions are determined by task-based phenotypes, [[predation|predator-prey]] interactions are determined by behavior. Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey. [[natural selection|Selection]] favors behavioral strategies in prey that enable them to avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic predator-prey interaction networks in which selective forces are constantly changing as a consequence of the emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using [[spatial ecology|spatially structured populations]]. On the other hand, host-parasite and mutualistic coevolution are often done in well-mixed environments, though the choice of the environment is at the discretion of the experimenter.

==Research directions==
{{essay|section|date=October 2014}}
Understanding how [[biodiversity]] is organized in [[ecosystem|natural ecosystems]] requires going beyond the study of pairs of interacting species. Using digital organisms, one can find generalities about the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping the web of interactions among species, as well as the coevolutionary processes embedded within these networks. By tracing the evolution of digital communities and their ecological networks, researchers obtain perfect ''[[fossil|fossil records]]'' of how the number and patterns of links among interacting phenotypes evolved.

The stability-diversity debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCann KS | title = The diversity-stability debate | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | issue = 6783 | pages = 228–33 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10821283 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/35012234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-standing debate about whether more diverse ecological networks are also more stable. Until recently, this debate has focused on one component of biodiversity: species diversity. However, newer research has begun dealing with another component of biodiversity: diversity in species interactions. Mathematical models show that a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics and that the loss of one interaction type may critically destabilize ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mougi A, Kondoh M | title = Diversity of interaction types and ecological community stability | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6092 | pages = 349–51 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22822151 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1220529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies with digital organisms can shed light on this debate from an empirical perspective because the types of interactions included can be manipulated and the stability of the resulting evolving digital ecological network can be measured.

Equally addressable using evolving digital ecological networks are many of the open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities. For example, do [[coevolution|coevolutionary dynamics]] change as communities become richer? Is there any limit to their richness? Is the evolution of interactions between multispecies networks [[contingency (philosophy)|historically contingent]]? Why do some ecological scenarios lead to predictable network structures and others do not?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thébault E, Fontaine C | title = Stability of ecological communities and the architecture of mutualistic and trophic networks | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5993 | pages = 853–6 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20705861 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1188321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Do [[adaptationism#Genetic constraints|genetic constraints]] play a large role in the evolution of ecological networks? These are only a few of many open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities.

These and many related questions require researchers to look across the [[evolutionary history of life|evolutionary history]] of ecological network formation. For natural systems, those data are very difficult to collect. With digital organisms, watching both the coevolutionary process and ecological network formation is possible in real time. Data on the abundance of interacting phenotypes are recorded without error, hence the evolutionary implications of ecological processes can be explored in-depth.

The study of self-replicating and evolving computer programs offers a tantalizing glimpse into the evolution of interactions among organisms that do not share any ancestry with biochemical life of Earth. This comes with potential caveats in translating predictions of evolving digital networks to biological ones because mechanistic details differ substantially between interacting digital organisms and interacting biological organisms. Nevertheless, these digital networks contain the necessary components for ongoing coevolutionary dynamics in large webs of interacting organisms. In spite of the differences between biological and digital evolution, the study of evolving digital ecological networks can lead to a more predictive understanding of natural dynamics. Because the general operational processes (e.g., Darwinian evolution, mutualism, parasitism) do not differ, studies utilizing digital networks can uncover rules operating on and within ecological networks. Together with microbial experiments, they create opportunities for furthering the understanding of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes among interacting species.

'''Fisher's geometric model''' ('''FGM''') is an [[evolution]]ary model of the [[effect size]]s and effect on [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of spontaneous [[mutations]]&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Ronald|title=[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]|year=1930|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by [[Ronald Fisher]] to explain the distribution of effects of mutations that could contribute to [[adaptation (biology)|adaptative]] evolution.&lt;ref name=brief-history&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Allen|title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2005|volume=6|pages=119–127|doi=10.1038/nrg1523|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v6/n2/full/nrg1523.html|pmid=15716908|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptualization==
Sometimes referred to as the Fisher-Orr model, Fisher's model addresses the problem of adaptation (and, to some extent, [[complexity]]), and continues to be a point of reference in contemporary research on the genetic and evolutionary consequences of [[pleiotropy]].&lt;ref name=Gunter&gt;{{citation |first1=Günter P. |last1=Wagner |first2=Jianzhi |last2=Zhang |title=The pleiotropic structure of the genotype–phenotype map: the evolvability of complex organisms |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |issue=12 |pages=204–213 |date=March 2011 |doi=10.1038/nrg2949 |url=http://www.umich.edu/~zhanglab/publications/2011/Wagner_2011_NRG_12_204.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model has two forms, a geometric formalism, and a [[microscope]] analogy.  A microscope which has many knobs to adjust the lenses to obtain a sharp image has little chance of obtaining an optimally functioning image by randomly turning the knobs. The chances of a clear image are not so bad if the number of knobs is low, but the chances will decrease dramatically if the number of adjustable [[parameter]]s (knobs) is larger than two or three. Fisher introduced a geometric metaphor, which eventually became known as Fisher's geometric model.&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt;

In his model, Fisher argues that the functioning of the microscope is analogous to the fitness of an organism. The performance of the microscope depends on the state of various knobs that can be manipulated, corresponding to distances and orientations of various lenses, whereas the fitness of an organism depends on the state of various [[phenotype|phenotypic]] character such as body size and [[beak]] length and depth. The increase in the fitness of an organism by random changes is then analogous to the attempt to improve the performance of a microscope through randomly changing the positions of the knobs on the microscope.

The analogy between the microscope and an evolving organism can be formalized by representing the phenotype of an organism as a point in a [[Clustering high-dimensional data|high-dimensional data space]], where the dimensions of that space correspond to the [[trait (biological)|trait]]s of the organism. The more independent dimensions of variation the phenotype has, the more difficult is improvement resulting from random changes. If there are many different ways to change a phenotype it becomes very unlikely that a random change affects the right combination of traits in the right way to improve fitness. Fisher noted that the smaller the effect, the higher the chance that a change is beneficial. At one extreme, changes with infinitesimally small effect have a 50% chance of improving fitness. This argument led to the widely held position that evolution proceeds by small mutations.

Furthermore, Orr discovered that both the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation and the fitness gain that is conferred by the fixation of the beneficial mutation decrease with organismal complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Orr |first=H. A. |title=Adaptation and the cost of complexity |journal=Evolution |volume=54 |pages=13–20 |year=2000 |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdffiles/adaptation_orr.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the predicted rate of adaptation decreases quickly with the rise in organismal complexity, a theoretical finding known as the ‘cost of complexity’.

The '''Furuta pendulum''', or rotational inverted pendulum, consists of a driven arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and a [[pendulum]] attached to that arm which is free to rotate in the vertical plane.  It was invented in 1992 at [http://www.titech.ac.jp/ Tokyo Institute of Technology] by Katsuhisa Furuta&lt;ref&gt;Furuta, K., Yamakita, M. and Kobayashi, S. (1992) “Swing-up control of inverted pendulum using pseudo-state feedback”, Journal of Systems and Control Engineering, 206(6), 263-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xuetal2001"&gt;Xu, Y., Iwase, M. and Furuta, K.

It is an example of a complex nonlinear oscillator of interest in [[Control Systems Engineering|control system theory]].  The pendulum is [[Underactuation|underactuated]] and extremely [[Nonlinear|non-linear]] due to the gravitational forces and the coupling arising from the [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] and [[Centripetal force|centripetal]] forces.

==Equations of motion==
Despite the great deal of attention the system has received, very few publications successfully derive (or use) the full dynamics.  Many authors&lt;ref name="Furutaetal2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fantoni"/&gt; have only considered the rotational inertia of the pendulum for a single principal axis (or neglected it altogether&lt;ref name="Egeland"/&gt;).  In other words, the inertia tensor only has a single non-zero element (or none), and the remaining two diagonal terms are zero. It is possible to find a pendulum system where the moment of inertia in one of the three principal axes is approximately zero, but not two.

A few authors&lt;ref name="Xuetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iwaseetal2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akessonetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirata, H., Haga, K., Anabuki, M., Ouchi, S. and Ratiroch-Anant, P.

Both papers used a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian formulation]] but each contained minor errors (presumably typographical).

The equations of motion presented here are an extract from a [http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jcse/2011/528341.pdf paper]&lt;ref name="Cazzolatoetal2011"&gt;Cazzolato, B.S and Prime, Z (2011) "On the Dynamics of the Furuta Pendulum", Journal of Control Science and Engineering,
Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 528341, 8 pages. http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jcse/2011/528341.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on the Furuta pendulum dynamics derived at the [[University of Adelaide]].

===Definitions===

[[Image:Furuta pendulum.jpg|thumb|450px| Fig. 1: Schematic of the single rotary inverted pendulum system.]]

Consider the rotational inverted pendulum mounted to a DC motor as shown in Fig. 1.  The DC motor is used to apply a torque &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; to Arm 1.  The link between Arm 1 and Arm 2 is not actuated but free to rotate.  The two arms have lengths  &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;.  The arms have masses  &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; which are located at &lt;math&gt;l_1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;l_2&lt;/math&gt;  respectively, which are the lengths from the point of rotation of the arm to its center of mass.  The arms have inertia tensors  &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_2&lt;/math&gt; (about the centre of mass of the arm).  Each rotational joint is viscously damped with damping coefficients  &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; is the damping provided by the motor bearings and  &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; is the damping arising from the pin coupling between Arm 1 and Arm 2.

A right hand coordinate system has been used to define the inputs, states and the Cartesian coordinate systems 1 and 2.  The coordinate axes of Arm 1 and Arm 2 are the principal axes such that the inertia tensors are diagonal.

The angular rotation of Arm 1, &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt;, is measured in the horizontal plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above) is positive.  The angular rotation of Arm 2, &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;, is measured in the vertical plane where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive.  When the Arm is hanging down in the stable equilibrium position &lt;math&gt;\theta_2=0&lt;/math&gt; .

The torque the servo-motor applies to Arm 1, &lt;math&gt;\tau_1&lt;/math&gt;, is positive in a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from above).  A disturbance torque,  &lt;math&gt;\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, is experienced by Arm 2, where a counter-clockwise direction (when viewed from the front) is positive.

===Assumptions===
Before deriving the dynamics of the system a number of assumptions must be made.  These are:
*The motor shaft and Arm 1 are assumed to be rigidly coupled and infinitely stiff.
*Arm 2 is assumed to be infinitely stiff.
*The coordinate axes of Arm1 and Arm 2 are the principal axes such that the inertia tensors are diagonal.
*The motor rotor inertia is assumed to be negligible.  However, this term may be easily added to the moment of inertia of Arm 1.
*Only viscous damping is considered.  All other forms of damping (such as Coulomb) have been neglected, however it is a simple exercise to add this to the final governing DE.

===Non-linear Equations of Motion===

===Simplifications===
Most Furuta pendulums tend to have long slender arms, such that the moment of
inertia along the axis of the arms is negligible. In addition, most arms have
rotational symmetry such that the moments of inertia in two of the principal axes
are equal. Thus, the inertia tensors may be approximated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_1 = diag[J_{1xx},J_{1yy},J_{1zz}] = diag[0,J_{1},J_{1}]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}_2 = diag[J_{2xx},J_{2yy},J_{2zz}] = diag[0,J_{2},J_{2}]&lt;/math&gt;

Further simplifications are obtained by making the following substitutions. The
total moment of inertia of Arm 1 about the pivot point (using the parallel axis
theorem) is &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_1} = J_1 +m_1l_1^2&lt;/math&gt;. The total moment of inertia of Arm 2 about its pivot
point is &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_2} = J_2 +m_2l_2^2&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, define the total moment of inertia the motor
rotor experiences when the pendulum (Arm 2) is in its equilibrium position
(hanging vertically down), &lt;math&gt;\hat{J_0} = \hat{J}_1 +m_2L_1^2 =  J_1 +m_1l_1^2 + m_2L_1^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting the previous definitions into the governing DEs gives the more
compact form

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 \left(\hat{J_0} + \hat{J_2}\sin^2(\theta_2) \right) 
+ \ddot{\theta}_2 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2) 
- m_2 L_1 l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \dot{\theta}_2^2 
+\dot{\theta}_1 \dot{\theta}_2 \sin(2 \theta_2)\hat{J_2} 
+b_1 \dot{\theta}_1
= \tau_1&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\theta}_1 m_2 L_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2)

- 1/2 \dot{\theta}_1^2 \sin(2 \theta_2) \hat{J_2}

'''Hans Jonas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|oʊ|n|æ|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈjoːnas|lang}}; 10 May 1903&amp;nbsp;– 5 February 1993) was a [[Germany|German]]-born American Jewish philosopher, from 1955 to 1976 the Alvin Johnson Professor of Philosophy at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Hans Jonas' birth house in Moenchengladbach.JPG|thumb|Birth house of Hans Jonas in Mönchengladbach.]]
[[Image:Moenchengladbach Stolpersteine Mozartstrasse.jpg|thumb|In front of the house, two [[Stolpersteine]] were installed in 2008. The left one commemorates the philosopher's mother Rosa Jonas, murdered in Auschwitz in 1942.]]

Jonas was born in [[Mönchengladbach]], on 10 May 1903. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]], and finally earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1928 from the [[University of Marburg]]&lt;ref name="W"&gt;H. Jonas, "''Wissenschaft'' as Personal Experience," ''The Hastings Center report'' 32:4 (Jul–Aug 2002), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; with a thesis on [[Gnosticism]] entitled ''Der Begriff der Gnosis'' (''The Concept of [[Gnosis]]'') and directed by [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Wellistony C. Viana, ''Das Prinzip Verantwortung von Hans Jonas aus der Perspektive des objektiven Idealismus der Intersubjektivität von Vittorio Hösle'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2010, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; During his study years his academic advisors included [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Rudolf Bultmann]].&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; In Marburg he met [[Hannah Arendt]], who was also pursuing her PhD there, and the two of them were to remain friends for the rest of their lives.

Heidegger joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933, which may have disturbed Jonas, as he was Jewish and an active [[Zionist]].  Certainly, in 1964 Jonas would repudiate his mentor Heidegger, for his affiliation with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/06/nyregion/hans-jonas-influential-philosopher-is-dead-at-89.html Hans Jonas, Influential Philosopher, Is Dead at 89], [[The New York Times]], Eric Pace, 6 February 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
He left Germany for [[England]] in 1933, and from England he moved to Palestine in 1934. There he met [[Lore Weiner]], to whom he became betrothed. In 1940 he returned to Europe to join the [[British Army]] which had been arranging a special brigade for German Jews wanting to fight against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (See ''[[Jewish Brigade|The Jewish Brigade]]''). He was sent to [[Italy]], and in the last phase of the war moved into Germany. Thus, he kept his promise that he would return only as a soldier in the victorious army. In this time he wrote several letters to Lore about philosophy, in particular philosophy of biology, that would form the basis of his later publications on the subject. They finally married in 1943.

Immediately after the war he returned to Mönchengladbach to search for his mother but found that she had been sent to the gas chambers in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Having heard this, he refused to live in Germany again. He returned to Palestine and took part in Israel's [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war of independence]] in 1948. Jonas taught briefly at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] before moving to North America. In 1950 he left for [[Canada]], teaching at [[Carleton University]]. From there he moved in 1955 to [[New York City]], where he was to live for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the Hastings Center and Professor of Philosophy at [[New School for Social Research]] from 1955 to 1976 (where he was Alvin Johnson Professor). From 1982 to 1983 Jonas held the [[Eric Voegelin]] Visiting Professorship at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rEu61KIK6FYC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=voegelin+hans+jonas&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zU6iNo95S3&amp;sig=URhgwghOXKgP8Hbo0pK0H5LAo-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA168,M1 ''The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin: Selected Correspondence, 1950-1984''], University of Missouri Press, 2007, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York, on 5 February 1993, aged 89.&lt;ref&gt;

==Works==

Jonas's writings were very influential in different spheres. For example, ''The Gnostic Religion'', based on his early research on the Gnosis and first published in 1958, was for many years the standard work in English on the subject of [[Gnosticism]]. ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' ([[German language|German]] 1979, [[English language|English]] 1984) centers on social and ethical problems created by [[technology]]. Jonas insists that human survival depends on our efforts to care for our planet and its future. He formulated a new and distinctive supreme principle of morality: "Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life".

While ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' has been credited with catalyzing the environmental movement in Germany, his work ''The Phenomenon of Life'' (1966) forms the philosophical undergirding of one major school of [[bioethics]] in America. [[Murray Bookchin]] and [[Leon Kass]] both referred to Hans Jonas's work as major, or primary, inspiration. Heavily influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]], ''The Phenomenon of Life'' attempts to synthesize the philosophy of matter with the philosophy of mind, producing a rich existential understanding of biology, which ultimately argues for a simultaneously material and moral human nature.

His writing on the history of [[Gnosticism]] revisits terrain covered by earlier standard works on the subject such as [[Ernesto Buonaiuti]]'s ''Lo gnosticismo: storia di antiche lotte religiose'' (1907), interpreting the religion from an [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophical viewpoint. He was one of the first philosophers to concern himself with ethical questions in biological science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Modified Stave Notation (MSN)''' is an alternative way of notating music that was developed in the [[UK]] where it is widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/leisureculture/music/readingmusic/Pages/modstave.aspx Modified Stave Notation - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; MSN is intended to be used by people who cannot easily read ordinary musical [[Staff (music)|stave notation]] (or staff notation&lt;ref&gt;''Staff'' is more common in [[American English]], ''stave'' in [[British English]]. The plural is ''staves'' in either case; ''stave'' is, in fact, a [[back-formation]] from ''staves''. (Pam Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, p. 514.)&lt;/ref&gt;), even if it is enlarged, or for some people reduced in size. Such users include those with [[visual impairment]]s and those who are [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]].

== History of Modified Stave Notation ==

In the 1990s the then [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]], negotiated with the [[Music Publishers Association (UK)|Music Publishers' Association]] an agreement to permit partially sighted people to enlarge music, providing only one copy was made and the enlarged music was not re-sold. For each item enlarged, permission was needed from the work's publisher who would then supply a yellow sticker with "MPA approved '''large print''' music copy RNIB" written over a five line stave. It was noted, however, at this time that enlargement produced new problems, notably with the extra space between symbols and the production of either unwieldy large and flimsy [[Sheet music|sheets]] or scores requiring more page turns and not necessarily in convenient places. So examples of music in which all signs equally enlarged but compacted horizontally were created.&lt;ref&gt;Ockelford, A. (1994) "Music in large print" Royal National Institute for the Blind and The Music Publishers' Association Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s some music publishers started producing music in [[Large-print|large print]] fonts, taking layouts used widely for children's beginner tutor books and extending these to short [[Musical repertoire|repertoire pieces]], particularly for [[keyboard instrument]]s. The National Music and Disability Information Service&lt;ref&gt;National Music and Disability Information Service 1982 to 1998, based at Dartington Hall. This service was then taken under the umbrella of Soundsense, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. [http://www.soundsense.org/ Sound sense]&lt;/ref&gt; kept a resource paper "RP14 Information on Music for People with Partial Sight" which listed some of these publishers.

With the advent of sophisticated [[Scorewriter|music notation software]], such as MuseScore,&lt;ref&gt;[https://musescore.org/en/tutorials/modified-stave-notation musescore.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the production of MSN became easier, with the ability to save preferred settings of each user. The Royal National Institute of Blind People is the largest formal producer of MSN in the world, with a production team based in [[Ivybridge]], [[Devon]]. MSN has become an accepted standard for public examinations in England and Wales, for [[GCSE]] and [[A level]] music and music technology papers, under general special arrangements authorised by the [[Joint Council for Qualifications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcq.org.uk/ Joint Council for Qualifications]&lt;/ref&gt; and worldwide for sight reading tests for grade examination boards such as the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-booking/special-needs/guidelines-for-candidates-with-dyslexia-dyspraxia-or-other-learning-difficulties/ Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trinity College London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinitycollege.co.uk/site/?id=1315 Trinity College London]&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates requiring Modified Print copies of the [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] may ask for MSN scores, sometimes in a standard format, sometimes tailor made to match a submitted example.

== Standards for Modified Stave Notation ==

Formalising standards for MSN in the UK involved:
* discussion amongst producers 
* experiments with users and
* examination with software producers of the variables within packages. 
The work was underpinned by links with [[RNIB| RNIB's]] general print guidelines for making information accessible for blind and partially sighted people, "See it Right".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/accessibleinformation/pages/see_it_right.aspx See It Right - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; Reading music notation is more complex than reading prose involving complex [[Eye movement in music reading|eye movements]]. Not only are there many symbols of different shapes and sizes, but the signs are placed in [[vertical direction|vertical]] as well as [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] dimensions, some having effect for lines of music whilst others just apply to single features. Often the reader needs to read "in time" rather than at his or her own speed, alongside the execution of complex physical skills to render the symbols into sound via an [[musical instrument|instrument]]. Usually music is placed further away than ordinary print, allowing for an instrument to be placed between player and the printed music. There may also be the need to see a [[musical director]] in the middle distance. With [[E-book reader|eReading devices]] it is easy to obtain ordinary print consistently in one's preferred font size and type face. However, stave notation comes in all kinds of densities, type faces and relative symbols size. Modified Stave Notation can enable users to have consistent size and layout.

== Guidelines for Modified Stave Notation ==

Guidelines for the production of Modified Stave Notation are published by the UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)]&lt;/ref&gt;  in document "G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org/members-area/guidance-documents/#G009 G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentals of producing Modified Stave Notation are: 
* clear printing of symbols with no overlapping of different signs
* evening out the symbol size and density
* reducing redundant space
* placing symbols used around the stave at a consistent distance from the lines and the notes to which they refer (so once one is located, the reader can reasonably expect to find them in the same place later in the piece), and, 
* describe in words in a preface the location of sporadic or unusual symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, S-A. (2004) "Modified Stave Notation - An Approach to Making Stave Notation More Accessible to Users Who Are Partially Sighted" in K.Miesenberger et al. [Eds.] ICCHP 2004, LNCS 3118, pp. 236-239 Springer-Verlag: Berlin and Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other factors assisting accessibility ==

In addition to the alteration of stave notation layout in MSN, other factors affecting [[accessibility]] include binding, colour of background paper (as stave notation is conventionally in black ink) and lighting. The use of multimedia can also increase accessibility. For example, the music seen can also be heard electronically with a variety of levels of "interpretation" from just the pitch and note lengths, to full nuance and stylistic detail. Lastly, analysis and development of reading and memorisation techniques, pertinent to the user's requirements, may aid fluency.

== General principles of clear print used in Modified Stave Notation ==

Some principles from RNIB's guidelines 'See It Right' are transferred directly to stave notation in MSN. The staves and note stem thickness correspond to a thickness of letters in 16 [[Point (typography)|point]] typefaces. Spaces between systems&lt;ref&gt;The distance between the sets of music lines (2 for piano music, usually, or 3 for voice and piano, for example)&lt;/ref&gt; and between staves within a system are sufficiently large, although more use is made of left and right margins. Text is [[sans-serif|sans serif]],&lt;ref&gt;That is, without the "curly" edges to letters common in fonts such as Times New Roman&lt;/ref&gt; semi-bold or bold.

== Other modification in Modified Stave Notation ==

Numerals are used in music for all kinds of purposes: in MSN page numbers are distinguished from bar numbers, by being placed in circles, for example. In MSN the use of full size numerals for fingering rather than subscript size is a particular feature. Fingering numbers are also often place in a horizontal line rather than dipping up and down to follow the contour of the [[melody]], enabling a user to memorise the melody and then just follow the fingering numbers.

The need for text to follow easily from column to column, page to page, is especially important in MSN where page turns need to occur where possible at a place where there are bars or at least at suitable musical breaks. Many users of modified print materials read them with additional technological help, such as a closed circuit television screen: for this, the pages need to be able to lie flat. Much music is written in portrait format,&lt;ref&gt;Portrait format is that in which the longer sides of a sheet of paper is at the sides, whereas landscape format is where the longer sides of the paper are at the top and bottom&lt;/ref&gt; whereas landscape is preferred for MSN to reduce the number of times the reader has to track back to the beginning of a new system.

MSN using music notation software enables dyslexic and partially sighted people who struggle to use the huge variety of formats of stave notation to have their music produced in a consistent layout, according to certain conventions, allowing more fluent use.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, E. (2011) "Behind bars: The Definitive Guide to Music Notation" London: Faber Music&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neoclassicism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέος ''nèos'', "new" and [[Latin]] ''classicus'', "of the highest rank")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=neo-classical| title=Etymology of the English word "neo-classical"| accessdate=2016-05-09| publisher=myetymology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to Western [[Cultural movement|movements]] in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[classical antiquity]]. Neoclassicism was born largely thanks to the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], at the time of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their [[Grand Tour]] and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1189&amp;dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCl9eT0cLVAhVLDcAKHSy7B1cQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/978 The road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt; The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.

European Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each "neo"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765–1830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The "Rococo" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, "corrected" and "restored" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.

==History==
Neoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book |title = Neoclassicism A&amp;I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher =  Phaidon Press|year = 1997 | pages = | isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], demonstrates this especially well.&lt;ref&gt;A recurring theme in Clark: 19-23, 58-62, 69, 97-98 (on Ingres); Honour, 187-190; Novotny, 86-87&lt;/ref&gt; The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.&lt;ref name=Lingo&gt;{{cite book |title = François Duquesnoy and the Greek ideal| last=Lingo| first=Estelle Cecile| publisher = Yale University Press; First Edition|year = 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wlq67ikF0OEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Winckelmann+Neoclassicism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zGxFT-GiPMHWiAKY_dypDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Winckelmann%20Neoclassicism&amp;f=false 161]| isbn=978-0-300-12483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Savannah: fine &amp; decorative arts, 1800-1840| last=Talbott | first=Page| publisher = University of Georgia Press |year = 1995| pages = 6| isbn=978-0-8203-1793-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|left|250|Johann Joachim Winckelmann, often called "the father of archaeology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Culture and values: a survey of the humanities| last=Cunningham, Reich| first= Lawrence S., John J. | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition|year = 2009| pages = 104 | isbn=978-0-495-56877-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' ("History of Ancient Art", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at "noble simplicity and calm grandeur",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find "not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: "The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes from the first pages of "Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Neoclassicism" in each art implies a particular canon of a "classical" model.

In English, the term "Neoclassicism" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and "Neoclassicism" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Neoclassical" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as "the true style", "reformed" and "revival"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 11, 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.

Neoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much "Neoclassical" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally the winning side.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 43-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting and printmaking==
[[File:(20) Flaxman Ilias 1795, Zeichnung 1793, 194 x 338 mm.jpg|thumb|Print of a drawing by [[John Flaxman]] of a scene in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', 1795]]

It is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as "insipid" and "almost entirely uninteresting to us"—some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)&lt;/ref&gt; by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as "the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once "fired the artistic youth of Europe" but are now "neglected",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 14&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having "an unctuous softness and tediousness" by [[Fritz Novotny]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. 
[[File:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784]]

The work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of "noble simplicity and calm grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' ("Imaginary Prisons") whose "oppressive cyclopean architecture" conveys "dreams of fear and frustration".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the "Gothic" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.

Neoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt;

David's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Canova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|thumb|260px|''Hebe'' by [[Canova]] (1800–05), in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
If Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them, although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the "classical period" beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter's personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378–379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 379-384&lt;/ref&gt; All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.

An early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 384-385&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 388-389&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive "character heads" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 390-392&lt;/ref&gt; Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.

Since prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,&lt;ref&gt;Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].

==Architecture and the decorative arts==

Neoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.

A second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the "Louis XVI style", and the second in the styles called "Directoire" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}

In the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built "[[United States Capitol|capitol]]" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and "black basaltes" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.

Indoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,&lt;ref name="Gontar"&gt;Gontar&lt;/ref&gt; with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most "Roman" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Camaïeu|en camaïeu]]'' ("like cameos"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of "Pompeiian red" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Goût grec]]'' ("Greek style"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the "Louis XVI" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 110–111, 110 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Château de Malmaison - Appartement de Joséphine 003.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]

From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Gontar"/&gt; the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171–184, 171 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and "Louis Seize", or Louis XVI, in France.

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

Gothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, "romantic" appearance.

==Neoclassical gardens==
In England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of [[Alexander Pope]]. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are [[Chiswick House]], [[Stowe House]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Turner|title=British gardens: history, philosophy and design, Chapter 6 Neoclassical gardens and landscapes 1730-1800|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415518789|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassicism and fashion==
[[File:Thérésa Cabarrus.JPG|thumb|Revolutionary socialite [[Thérésa Tallien]]]]
[[File:5th Duke of Bedford.png|thumb|[[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] in a [[Bedford Crop]]]]
In fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women's dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette Récamier]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], [[Thérésa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: "''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''" ("One could not be more sumptuously undressed"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.

Neoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien Régime]]. Even when David designed a new French "national costume" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.

The trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.

Classically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French "à la Titus" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 243&lt;/ref&gt; and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later "Neoclassicisms"==
[[File:NatGal.jpg|thumb|The West building (1941) of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, with the East Building (1978) and the [[United States Capitol]] visible behind and to the left]]
{{Classicism}}
In American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.

Conservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as "reactionary", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked "progressive". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts Décoratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann|É.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis Süe|Süe]] &amp; [[André Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].

There was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)

This literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.

===In music===
[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music | Classical]] and [[baroque music | Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music | Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed "classical" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]]. 

The 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino | Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound the Neoclassicists aspired to. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.

=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]
In 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&amp;brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]

With the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.

Neoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including "exported" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.

===Architecture in the 21st century===
{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}
[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]

After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] – ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.

In Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].

An '''oil dispersant''' is a mixture of [[emulsifier]]s and [[solvent]]s that helps break oil into small droplets following an [[oil spill]]. Small droplets are easier to [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] throughout a water volume, and small droplets may be more readily [[biodegrade]]d by [[microbes]] in the water. Dispersant use involves a trade-off between exposing [[coastal ecology|coastal life]] to surface oil and exposing aquatic life to dispersed oil. While submerging the oil with dispersant may lessen exposure to [[marine life]] on the surface, it increases exposure for animals dwelling underwater, who may be harmed by [[toxicity]] of both dispersed oil and dispersant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treating oil spills with chemical dispersants: Is the cure worse than the ailment?|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130705212219.htm|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispersants EPA.gov|url=http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispersants|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/dispersants.html|work=Center for Biological Diversity|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although dispersant reduces the amount of oil that lands ashore, it may allow faster, deeper penetration of oil into coastal terrain, where it is not easily biodegraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: Dispersants Can Move Hydrocarbons Faster and Deeper into Gulf Sand|url=http://gulfresearchinitiative.org/study-dispersants-can-move-hydrocarbons-faster-and-deeper-into-gulf-sand/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Torrey Canyon oil spill}}
In 1967, the supertanker ''[[Torrey Canyon oil spill|Torrey Canyon]]'' leaked oil onto the English coastline.&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;  [[Alkylphenol]] [[surfactant]]s were primarily used to break up the oil, but proved very toxic in the marine environment; all types of marine life were killed. This led to a reformulation of dispersants to be more environmentally sensitive. After the ''Torrey Canyon'' spill, new boat-spraying systems were developed.&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt; Later reformulations allowed more dispersant to be contained (at a higher concentration) to be [[aerosolize]]d.

==={{anchor|Exxon Valdez}}''Exxon Valdez''===
{{Main article|Exxon Valdez oil spill}}
Alaska had fewer than 4,000 gallons of dispersants available at the time of the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill, and no aircraft with which to dispense them. The dispersants introduced were relatively ineffective due to insufficient wave action to mix the oil and water, and their use was shortly abandoned.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;EPA: Learning Center: Exxon Valdez.  http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/learning/exxon.htm accessed 5/23/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[David Kirby (journalist)|David Kirby]] for [[TakePart]] found that the main component of the [[Corexit|Corexit 9527]] formulation used during Exxon Valdez cleanup, [[2-butoxyethanol]], was identified as "one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 ''Exxon Valdez'' spill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corexit: An Oil Spill Solution Worse Than the Problem?|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/04/17/corexit-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill|work=TakePart|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an estimated 1.84 million gallons of [[Corexit]] was used in an attempt to reduce the amount of surface oil and mitigate the damage to coastal habitat.

[[Maritime New Zealand]] used the oil dispersant [[Corexit|Corexit 9500]] to help in the cleanup process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5767822/Dispersants-worse-than-oil&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersant was applied for only a week, after results proved inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Science-Stories/Where-Land-Meets-Sea/Cleaning-up-the-oil-spill&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

==={{anchor|Overview}}Overview===
Surfactants reduce oil-water [[interfacial tension]], which helps waves break oil into small droplets. A mixture of oil and water is normally unstable, but can be stabilized with the addition of surfactants; these surfactants can prevent coalescence of dispersed oil droplets. The effectiveness of the dispersant depends on the weathering of the oil, sea energy (waves), salinity of the water, temperature and the type of oil.&lt;ref name=Fingas&gt;{{cite book|last=Fingas|first=Merv|title=The Basics of Oil Spill Cleanup|year=2001|publisher=Lewis Publishers|isbn=1-56670-537-1|pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersion is unlikely to occur if the oil spreads into a thin layer, because the dispersant requires a particular thickness to work; otherwise, the dispersant will interact with both the water and the oil. More dispersant may be required if the sea energy is low. The salinity of the water is more important for ionic-surfactant dispersants, as salt [[Electric-field screening|screens]] electrostatic interactions between molecules. The [[viscosity]] of the oil is another important factor; viscosity can retard dispersant migration to the oil-water interface and also increase the energy required to shear a drop from the slick. Viscosities below 2,000 centi[[Poise (unit)|poise]] are optimal for dispersants. If the viscosity is above 10,000 centipoise, no dispersion is possible.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.)|title=Using Oil Spill Dispersants on the Sea|year=1989|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements===
There are five requirements for surfactants to successfully disperse oil:&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; 
*Dispersant must be on the oil's surface in the proper concentration
*Dispersant must penetrate (mix with) the oil
* Surfactant molecules must orient at the oil-water interface (hydrophobic in oil and [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] in water)
* Oil-water interfacial tension must be lowered (so the oil can be broken up).
* Energy must be applied to the mix (for example, by waves)

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of a dispersant may be analyzed with the following equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandrasekar|first1=Subhashini|last2=Sorial|first2=George|last3=Weaver|first3=James|title=Dispersant effectiveness on oil spills – impact of salinity|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |date=2006|volume=63|pages=1418–1430|doi=10.1016/j.icesjms.2006.04.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Area refers to the area under the absorbance/wavelength curve, which is determined using the trapezoidal rule. The absorbances are measured at 340, 370, and 400&amp;nbsp;nm.

Area = 30(Abs&lt;sub&gt;340&lt;/sub&gt; + Abs&lt;sub&gt;370&lt;/sub&gt;)/2 + 30(Abs&lt;sub&gt;340&lt;/sub&gt; + Abs&lt;sub&gt;400&lt;/sub&gt;)/2           (1)

The dispersant effectiveness may then be calculated using the equation below.

Effectiveness (%) = Total oil dispersed x 100/(ρ&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt;)

* ρ&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt; = density of the test oil (g/L)
* V&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt; = volume of oil added to test flask (L)
* Total oil dispersed = mass of oil x 120mL/30mL
* Mass of oil = concentration oil x V&lt;sub&gt;DCM&lt;/sub&gt;
* V&lt;sub&gt;DCM&lt;/sub&gt; = final volume of DCM-extract of water sample (0.020 L)
* Concentration of oil = area determined by Equation (1) / slope of calibration curve

==={{anchor|Dispersion Models}}Dispersion models===
Developing well-constructed models (accounting for variables such as oil type, salinity and surfactant) are necessary to select the appropriate dispersant in a given situation. Two models exist which integrate the use of dispersants: Mackay's model and Johansen's model.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"&gt;National Research Council Committee on Effectiveness of Oil Spill Dispersants: Using Oil Dispersants on the Sea, National Academy Press, 1989 pp 63-75&lt;/ref&gt; There are several parameters which must be considered when creating a dispersion model, including oil-slick thickness, [[advection]], resurfacing and wave action.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt; A general problem in modeling dispersants is that they change several of these parameters; surfactants lower the thickness of the film, increase the amount of diffusion into the water column and increase the amount of breakup caused by wave action. This causes the oil slick's behavior to be more dominated by vertical diffusion than horizontal advection.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

One equation for the modeling of oil spills is:&lt;ref name= "Tkalich"&gt;Tkalich,P Xiaobo,C Accurate Simulation of Oil Slicks, Tropical marine science institute, Presented 2001 International Oil Spill Conference pp 1133-1135 http://www.ioscproceedings.org/doi/pdf/10.7901/2169-3358-2001-2-1133&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial h}{\partial t} + \vec \nabla \left(h \left( \vec {U} + \frac {\vec \tau }{f} \right) \right) - \vec \nabla (E \vec \nabla h) = R &lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''h'' is the oil-slick thickness
* &lt;math&gt;\vec {U}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of ocean currents in the mixing layer of the water column (where oil and water mix together)
* &lt;math&gt;\vec \tau&lt;/math&gt; is the wind-driven shear stress
* ''f'' is the oil-water friction coefficient
* ''E'' is the relative difference in densities between the oil and water
* ''R'' is the rate of spill propagation

Mackay's model predicts an increasing dispersion rate, as the slick becomes thinner in one dimension. The model predicts that thin slicks will disperse faster than thick slicks for several reasons. Thin slicks are less effective at dampening waves and other sources of turbidity. Additionally, droplets formed upon dispersion are expected to be smaller in a thin slick and thus easier to disperse in water.
The model also includes:&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

* An expression for the diameter of the oil drop
* Temperature dependence of oil movement
* An expression for the resurfacing of oil
* Calibrations based on data from experimental spills

The model is lacking in several areas: it does not account for evaporation, the topography of the ocean floor or the geography of the spill zone.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

Johansen's model is more complex than Mackay's model. It considers particles to be in one of three states: at the surface, [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrained]] in the water column or evaporated. The empirically based model uses probabilistic variables to determine where the dispersant will move and where it will go after it breaks up oil slicks. The drift of each particle is determined by the state of that particle; this means that a particle in the vapor state will travel much further than a particle on the surface (or under the surface) of the ocean.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt; This model improves on Mackay's model in several key areas, including terms for:&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

* Probability of entrainment – depends on wind
* Probability of resurfacing – depends on density, droplet size, time submerged and wind
* Probability of evaporation – matched with empirical data

Oil dispersants are modeled by Johansen using a different set of entrainment and resurfacing parameters for treated versus untreated oil. This allows areas of the oil slick to be modeled differently, to better understand how oil spreads along the water's surface.

=={{anchor|Surfactants}}Surfactants==
{{Main article|Surfactants}}
Surfactants are classified into four main types, each with different properties and applications: [[anion]]ic, cationic, nonionic and [[zwitterion]]ic (or amphoteric). Anionic surfactants are compounds that contain an anionic polar group. Examples of anionic surfactants include [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] and [[dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate]].&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt; Included in this class of surfactants are sodium alkylcarboxylates (soaps).&lt;ref name="Butt"&gt;Butt, Hans-Jürgen.  Graf, Karlheinz. Kappl, Michael.  "Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces".  2nd Edition.  WILEY-VCH. pp 265-299. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cationic surfactats are similar in nature to anionic surfactants, except the surfactant molecules carry a positive charge at the hydrophilic portion. Many of these compounds are [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium salts]], as well as [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB).&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; Non-ionic surfactants are non-charged and together with anionic surfactants make up the majority of oil-dispersant formulations.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt; The hydrophilic portion of the surfactant contains polar [[functional groups]], such as -OH or -NH.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; Zwitterionic surfactants are the most expensive, and are used for specific applications.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; These compounds have both positively and negatively charged components. An example of a zwitterionic compound is [[phosphatidylcholine]], which as a lipid is largely insoluble in water.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt;

==={{anchor|HLB Values}}HLB values===
Surfactant behavior is highly dependent on the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB) value. The HLB is a coding scale from 0 to 20 for non-[[ion]]ic surfactants, and takes into account the chemical structure of the surfactant molecule. A zero value corresponds to the most [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and a value of 20 is the most hydrophilic for a non-ionic surfactant.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=John R.|title=Oil Spill Dispersants: Mechanisms of Action and Laboratory Tests|year=1992|publisher= C K Smoley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-87371-946-8|pages=9–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, compounds with an HLB between one and four will not mix with water. Compounds with an HLB value above 13 will form a clear solution in water.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al."&gt;Using Oil Spill Dispersants.  National Academy Press.  pp 29-32 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Oil dispersants usually have HLB values from 8–18.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt;

Two formulations of different dispersing agents for oil spills, Dispersit and Omni-Clean, are shown below. A key difference between the two is that Omni-Clean uses ionic surfactants and Dispersit uses entirely non-ionic surfactants. Omni-Clean was formulated for little or no toxicity toward the environment. Dispersit, however, was designed as a competitor with Corexit. Dispersit contains non-ionic surfactants, which permit both primarily oil-soluble and primarily water-soluble surfactants. The partitioning of surfactants between the phases allows for effective dispersion.

=={{anchor|Degradation and Toxicity}}Degradation and toxicity==
Both the degradation and the toxicity of dispersants depend on the chemicals chosen within the formulation. Compounds which interact too harshly with oil dispersants should be tested to ensure that they meet three criteria:&lt;ref name=Mulkins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulkins-Phillips|first=G. J.|author2=Stewart, J.E.|title=Effect of Four Dispersants on Biodegradation and Growth of Bacteria on Crude Oil|journal=Applied Microbiology|date=October 1974|volume=28|pages=547–552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They should be biodegradable.
* In the presence of oil, they must not be preferentially utilized as a carbon source.
* They must be nontoxic to indigenous bacteria.

Dispersants can be delivered in aerosolized form by an aircraft or boat. Sufficient dispersant with droplets in the proper size are necessary; this can be achieved with an appropriate pumping rate. Droplets larger than 1,000&amp;nbsp;µm are preferred, to ensure they are not blown away by the wind. The ratio of dispersant to oil is typically 1:20.&lt;ref name=Fingas /&gt;

'''''Op. cit.''''' is an abbreviation of the [[Latin phrase]] ''{{lang|la|opus citatum}}'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th"&gt;{{Chicago 16th |pp=670 |at=14.31 |title=‘''Op. cit.''’ and ‘''loc. cit.''’ |accessdate=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "the work cited".&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt;

==Overview==
The abbreviation is used in an [[endnote]] or [[footnote]] to refer the reader to a previously cited work, standing in for repetition of the full title of the work.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; ''Op. cit.'' thus refers the reader to the [[bibliography]], where the full citation of the work can be found, or to a full citation given in a previous footnote. ''Op. cit.'' should never therefore be used on its own, which would be meaningless, but most often with the author's surname,&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; or another brief clue as to which work is referred to. For example, given a work called ''The World of Salamanders'' (1999) by Jane Q. Smith, the style would typically be "Smith ''op. cit.''", usually followed by a page number, to refer the reader to a previous full citation of this work (or with further clarification such as "Smith 1999, ''op. cit.''" or "Smith, ''World of Salamanders'', ''op. cit.''", if two sources by that author are cited).  Given names or initials are not needed unless the work cites two authors with the same surname, as the whole purpose of using ''op. cit.'' is economy of text.  For works without an individually named author, the title can be used, e.g. "''CIA World Fact Book'', ''op. cit.''"  As usual with foreign words and phrases, ''op. cit.'' is typically given in italics.  The variant ''[[Loc. cit.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin phrase ''loco citato'' meaning "in the place cited",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; has been used for the same purpose but also indicating the same page not simply the same work; it is now rarely used or recognized.

The ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 16th edition, claims that ''op. cit.'' and ''loc. cit.'' are "rightly falling into disuse", and "instead uses the short-title form",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; e.g. the form ''World of Salamanders'', to use the example above.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 2"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.28: Short form for titles", pp.&amp;nbsp;668&amp;ndash;669.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various different styles call for other alternatives, such as a reference to the author's surname and publication year, e.g. "Smith 1999".&lt;!--Is this MLA style? A citation for it needs to be added from a major style guide, common as it may be.--&gt;

''Op. cit'' is contrasted with ''[[ibid.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin adverb ''ibidem'', meaning "in the same place; in that very place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |author=Marchant and Charles, eds. |edition=260th |chapter=ibidem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 3"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.29: ‘''Ibid.''’", p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers the reader to the title of the work in the preceding footnote. The easily confused ''[[idem]]'' (sometimes abbreviated ''id.''), the Latin definitive pronoun meaning "the same"&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.30: ‘''Idem''’", pp.&amp;nbsp;669&amp;ndash;630.&lt;/ref&gt; is also used on occasion (especially in legal writing) within footnotes, and is a stand-in for the last-cited author, rather than title.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4" /&gt; The Latin adverb ''[[supra (grammar)|supra]]'', meaning "above" means simply "see above" and can therefore be somewhat imprecise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20806">A '''plot twist''' is a [[literary technique]] that introduces a radical change in the direction or expected outcome of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] in a work of fiction.&lt;ref name="SingletonConrad2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Stuart Singleton|author2=James A.

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a "[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early examples==
An early example of the romance genre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.&lt;ref name="Baldick2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and marries his mother in ignorance, learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.&lt;ref&gt;John MacFarlane, "Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis." ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marzolph&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he didn't survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled "[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].&lt;!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--&gt; In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''. The TV series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' and manga (twice made into a movie) ''[[Old Boy (manga)|Old Boy]]'' uses similar twists.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&amp;pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
''[[Peripeteia]]'' is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.&lt;ref name="PayneBarbera2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&amp;pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''deus ex machina'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode "[[Time Enough at Last]]" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===Deus ex machina===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning "god out of the machine." It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.&lt;ref name="Shipley1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the "deus ex machina" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. In its modern, figurative sense, the "deus ex machina" brings about an ending to a narrative through unexpected (generally happy) resolution to what appears to be a problem that cannot be overcome (see [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[History of the World, Part I]]''). This device is often used to end a bleak story on a more positive note.

===Poetic justice===
[[Poetic justice]] is a literary device in which [[virtue]] is ultimately rewarded or [[vice]] punished in such a way that the reward or punishment has a logical connection to the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA439|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=439|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern literature, this device is often used to create an [[Irony|ironic]] twist of fate in which the villain gets caught up in his/her own trap. For example, in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', Prince Rabadash climbs upon a mounting block during the battle in Archenland. Upon jumping down while shouting "The bolt of [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]] falls from above," his [[hauberk]] catches on a hook and leaves him hanging there, humiliated and trapped. Another example of poetic justice can be found in [[John Boyne]]'s ''[[The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas]]'', in which a [[concentration camp]] commander's son is mistakenly caught up with inmates rounded up for gassing, or in [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s picture book, ''[[The Sweetest Fig]]'', where a cold-hearted dentist is cruel to his dog, and ends up getting his comeuppance.

===Chekhov's gun===
[[Chekhov's gun]] refers to a seemingly minor character or plot element introduced early in the narrative that suddenly acquires great importance to the narrative. One example of this is the beggar woman in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]''. At the end of the musical, she is revealed to be the main character's wife.&lt;ref name="BergmanLambert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gregory Bergman|author2=Josh Lambert|title=Geektionary: From Anime to Zettabyte, An A to Z Guide to All Things Geek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbYLQfZrUPcC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=18 December 2010|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-1188-2|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar mechanism is the "plant", a preparatory device that repeats throughout the story. During the resolution, the true significance of the plant is revealed.

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.&lt;ref name="Asong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named "Bishop Aringarosa" draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" literally translates as "pink herring"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel [[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]] (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins.

===In medias res===
''[[In medias res]]'' ([[Latin]] for "into the middle of things") is a literary technique in which narrative proceeds from the middle of the story rather than its beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tim Clifford|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information such as characterization, setting, and motive is revealed through a series of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s. This technique creates a twist when the cause for the inciting incident is not revealed until the climax. This technique is used within the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' in which the opening scenes show one of the main characters drowning and the other being imprisoned. Subsequent scenes reveal the events leading up to these situations through a series of flashbacks. In ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', a similar beginning proves to be a flashforward as it is the linear conclusion of the events that then follow; this is not apparent until the end. ''In medias res'' is often used to provide a [[narrative hook]].

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.&lt;ref name="Steiff2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.&lt;ref name="Philips2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&amp;pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a "twist ending". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]] and the [[Merrily_We_Roll_Along_(play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

'''Pre-service teacher education''' is the education and training provided to [[student teacher]]s before they have undertaken any teaching.

== Requirements for acceptance to pre-service programs ==
Before entering into a pre-service education program, most students will have obtained a previous [[academic degree]], either a general or honours, in a subject of their choice, (''e.g.'' English, math, science, religion). The alternative to this is that students may work simultaneously on an undergraduate bachelor's degree and a pre-service education program. The latter route incorporates education courses throughout the program's 4 or 5 years, and culminates in a final year of specific pre-service training. Students who complete a bachelor's degree before returning to a university to complete the pre-service education program are in a ''consecutive'' pre-service program, while students who complete their pre-service training at the same time as their undergraduate degree are in a ''concurrent" program.&lt;ref name="van nuland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Nuland |first1=S. |title=Teacher education in Canada |journal=Journal of Education for Teaching |date=2011 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=409–421 |doi=10.1080/02607476.2011.611222}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Australia===
In Australia, pre-service teachers generally undergo an online course for qualification into pre-service teacher education. these courses are designed to enhance teachers' knowledge, skills and confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institution for Teaching and School Leadership. (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, a teaching qualification in further education (TQFE) is offered at many universities and can be used as a qualification in pre-service teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;University of Stirling, postgraduate teacher education. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, students are often required to take a test prior to acceptance into an accredited program, and/or upon graduation in order to earn certification.  Commonly, the [[praxis test|PRAXIS I or PRAXIS II]] are required for this purpose. Common topics include [[classroom management]], [[lesson plan]]s, and professional development. There are a number of places to study pre service teacher education in the US. The Michigan State University offers courses in elementary and secondary teacher preparation, as well as a master's degree in teaching and curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, R., &amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto. Michigan State University, Department of Teacher Education. (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundational thinking on pre-service education programs ==
The practical nature of pre-service education training programs aligns with American philosopher [[John Dewey]]'s theory of experience.  In his book [[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]] Dewey prescribes that learning must be based upon the actual life experiences of an individual that are interactive, experimental, and purposive in nature. [[Donald Schön|Donald Schon]] expanded upon Dewey's model by focusing further upon the importance of [[reflective practice]] in the learning process.  Schon was a proponent of using reflection in teacher education and other professions to guide learning through reflection on past experiences to guide future learning and practice, as evidenced in his 1996 work, Educating the reflective practitioner: Toward a new design for teaching and learning in the professions.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. (1996). ''Educating the reflective practitioner: Toward a new design for teaching and learning in the professions''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major foci of pre-service teacher education program ==

Provincial and state territories across North America vary greatly in population, language, demographics, geography and other social factors. As such the universities and colleges that offer pre-service education recognize unique factors about the student populations they serve, and in response have created unique programs to meet those needs.&lt;ref name="van nuland" /&gt; That being said, there are two major components that are common to pre-service education programs.

=== Practicum ===
A major focus in the pre-service education program is the practicum - the pre-service teacher is placed within a school setting (either elementary, or senior) and shadows an experienced teacher. All faculties of education in Canada include a practicum component in their pre-service programs.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, M., &amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pre-service teacher will be given opportunities to develop skills through observing their associate teacher, creating lesson plans, teaching lessons and experiential learning about classroom management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=J. M. |last2=Wright |first2=S.

=== Course work ===
To complement the practicum, pre-service programs offer academic based courses, designed to expose teacher candidates to collaborative inquiry, current research, educational philosophy, theory, pedagogy and practical resources to provide a foundation for their work as educators.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, M., &amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the experience gained through the practicum prepare the next generation of teachers for the challenges of the classroom.

== Pre-service graduate challenges ==
After completing a pre-service program, a graduate must apply for certification to be hired by a public school board. This is granted by a provincial or state governing authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario College of Teachers. (2014) Becoming a Teacher: Requirements. Retrieved from http://www.oct.ca/becoming-a-teacher/requirements&lt;/ref&gt; Not all pre-service programs are designed the same and a certificate obtained in one country may not be recognized in another.&lt;ref&gt;Ontario College of Teachers. (2014) Becoming a Teacher: Requirements. Retrieved from http://www.oct.ca/becoming-a-teacher/requirements&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the US, state-to-state reciprocity is limited.  In Canada jurisdictional requirements for teacher education differs provincially,&lt;ref name="van nuland" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ontario College of Teachers. (2014) Becoming a Teacher: Requirements. Retrieved from http://www.oct.ca/becoming-a-teacher/requirements&lt;/ref&gt; and each province has a designated authority responsible for the evaluation, certification and provision of teacher qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resource.educationcanada.com/certification.html|title=Teaching Jobs in Canada|publisher=EducationCanada.com|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is significantly more challenging to receive certification in a state or province other than that in which the teacher attended their pre-service program.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, K., Evans, M., Gambhir, M.,&amp; Gaskell, J. (2008). Characterizing initial teacher education in Canada: Themes and issues. Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it difficult for pre-service graduates to find employment outside of the state or province in which they received their training.

'''Rampart craters''' are a specific type of [[impact crater]] which are accompanied by distinctive [[fluid]]ized [[ejecta]] features found mainly on [[Mars]]. There is one example known on Earth, the [[Nördlinger Ries]] impact structure in Germany.&lt;ref name="SturmEtAl2013"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/41/5/531.abstract | title=The Ries impact, a double-layer rampart crater on Earth | first=Sebastian | last=Sturm | first2=Gerwin | last2=Wulf | first3=Dietmar | last3=Jung | first4=Thomas | last4=Kenkmann | journal=Geology | year=2013 | volume=41 | pages=531–534 | doi=10.1130/G33934.1| bibcode=2013Geo....41..531S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rampart crater displays an ejecta with a low ridge along its edge.  Usually, rampart craters show a lobate outer margin, as if material moved along the surface, rather than flying up and down in a ballistic trajectory.  The flows sometimes are diverted around small obstacles, instead of falling on them.  The ejecta look as if they move as a mudflow.  Some of the shapes of Rampart craters can be duplicated by shooting projectiles into mud.  Although rampart craters can be found all over Mars, the smaller ones are only found in the high latitudes where ice is predicted to be close to the surface.  It seems that the impact has to be powerful enough to penetrate to the level of the subsurface ice.  Since ice is thought to be close to the surface in latitudes far from the equator, it does not take too strong of an impact to reach the ice level.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H. Kieffer|title=Mars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoDvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on images from the [[Viking program]] in the 1970s, it is generally accepted that rampart craters are evidence of ice or liquid water beneath the surface of Mars. The impact melts or boils the water in the subsurface producing a distinctive pattern of material surrounding the crater.

Ryan Schwegman described double layered ejecta (DLE) craters as showing two distinct layers of ejecta that appear to have been put in place as a mobile, ground-hugging flow. His measurements  suggest that ejecta mobility (the distance ejecta travels from the crater rim) typically goes up with increasing latitude and may reflect ice concentration.  That is the higher the latitude, the greater the ice content.  The  lobateness (curved shape of the perimeter of ejecta) usually goes down with increasing latitude. Furthermore, DLEs on sedimentary ground seem to display higher ejecta mobility than those on volcanic surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Schwegman, R.  2015.  MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOMETRY OF DOUBLE LAYERED EJECTA CRATERS ON MARS.  The School of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies The University of Western Ontario London, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed discussion of various kinds of Martian craters, including double-layer ejecta craters (rampart craters) can be found in a 2014 paper by David Weiss and James Head &lt;ref&gt;Weiss, D., J. Head.  2014.  Ejecta mobility of layered ejecta craters on Mars:  Assessing the influence of snow and ice deposits.  Icarus:  233, 131–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single-layered ejecta craters==
[[File:Singlelayeredejectabo5.jpg|thumb|Rampart crater of the single-layered ejecta type. Arrows indicate the outer edge, called the rampart.]]
[[Image:Wikipunsk.jpg|thumb|left|Punsk Crater, as seen by CTX  camera (on [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]).]]

Single-layered ejecta craters are one type of rampart crater.  They have one ejecta lobe that extends 1 to 1.5 crater radii from the rim of the crater.  They have an average diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;km.  Although present at all latitudes, they are most common near the equator.  There average size increases the more distant from the equator.  It has been suggested that these types of craters are produced by impact into icy ground.  Specifically, it is an impact that does not go entirely through the icy layer.  The increase in size away from the equator is explained by a possible greater thickness in the icy layer away from the equator.&lt;ref&gt;Head, J., D. Weiss.   2017.  Evidence for stabilization of the ice-cemented crysphere in earlier martian history:  Implications for the current abundance of groundwater at depth on Mars.  Icarus:  288, 120–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double and multiple layered ejecta craters==
[[File:Ejectalayercratersfinal.jpg|thumb|Single-layer ejecta craters only penetrate into the icy upper layer, as shown on the left.  Multiple-layer ejecta craters go all the way through the icy layer and somewhat into the lower, ice-free layer (right).]]

Another type of rampart crater is called a double-layered ejecta (DLE) crater.  It displays two lobes of ejecta.  Related to these are (MLE) craters that have more than 2 or more layers of ejecta.   They are larger than single layered ejecta craters, having an average diameter of 22&amp;nbsp;km.  Their ejecta are about 2.2 radii from the crater rim. They are more concentrated near the equator (mostly between 40 degrees from the equator).  
[[File:Multiplelobecrater.jpg|thumb|left|Steinheim Crater which shows  more than one layer of ejecta. These are called double-layered ejecta craters.]]

Evidence leads researchers to believe that they result from an impact that goes through an icy layer and into a rocky layer.  There may be more of them closer to the equator because the icy layer is not as thick there; hence more impacts will penetrate all the way through the icy layer and into the rocky layer.  They are larger at all latitudes than single layer ejecta craters.  The icy layer has been called by different names:  cryosphere, permafrost, and ice-cemented cryosphere.

Researchers have analyzed the distribution of both of these craters to determine the thickness of an icy layer that may surround the total surface of Mars.  The depth of a crater has been found to be about one tenth of its diameter.  So by measuring the diameter, the depth can be easily found.   They mapped the position and size of all of these craters and then determined the maximum size of single-layered craters and the smallest size for multiple-layered craters  for each latitude.  Remember the single-layered ejecta crater does not penetrate the icy layer, but the multiple-layered does.  An average of those should give the thickness of the icy layer.  From such an analysis, they determined that the icy layer or cryosphere varies from about 1.3&amp;nbsp;km (equator) to 3.3&amp;nbsp;km (poles).  This represents a great deal of frozen water.  It would be equal to 200 meters of water spread over the entire planet, if one assumes 20% pore space.&lt;ref&gt;Head, J., D. Weiss.   2017.  Evidence for stabilization of the ice-cemented cryosphere in earlier martian history:  Implications for the current abundance of groundwater at depth on Mars.  Icarus:  288, 120–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phoenix lander confirmed the existence of large amounts of water ice in the northern regions of Mars.  This finding was predicted by theory and was measured from orbit by the Mars Odyssey instruments, so the idea that rampart crater size shows the depth to ice was confirmed by other space probes.  The image below from the Phoenix lander shows ice that was exposed by the descent engines.

==Pancake Craters==
[[File:Pancake48.8n.jpg|thumb|A pancake crater. Note the flat top and lack of a visible rampart.]]
In the Mariner and Viking mission a type of crater was found that was called a "Pancake Crater."  It is similar to a rampart crater, but does not have a rampart.  The ejecta is flat along its whole area, like a pancake.  Under higher resolutions it resembles a double-layer crater that has degraded.  These craters are found in the same latitudes as double-layer craters (40–65 degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Mouginis-Mark, P.  1979. Martian fluidized crater morphology: Variations with crater size, latitude, altitude, and target material.  Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth:  84,  8011–8022.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that they are just the inner layer of a double-layer crater in which the outer, thin layer has eroded.&lt;ref&gt;Costard, F.  1989.  The spatial distributions of volatiles in the Martian hydrolithosphere, EARTH, MOON, AND PLANETS:  45, 265–290.&lt;/ref&gt;  Craters classified as pancakes in Viking images, turned out to be double-layer craters when seen at higher resolutions by later spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, N.

[[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] was a controversial [[Governor of Buenos Aires Province]] during the [[Argentine Civil Wars]]. Deposed during the [[battle of Caseros]], he spent his later life in exile in [[Southampton]], [[England]], where he died on March 14, 1877. He was buried at the [[Southampton Old Cemetery]], and after a number of failed attempts he was repatriated to Argentina and taken to [[La Recoleta Cemetery]], his current grave location.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 108-122. ''Chapter Four:'' "The Repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas" By Jeffrey M. Shumway.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] was the [[Governor of Buenos Aires Province]] from 1829 to 1832 and 1835 to 1852. At the time the country fought many [[Argentine Civil Wars|civil wars]] between [[Federales (Argentina)|Federals]] and [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]], Rosas being a federal leader. He was ousted from power by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], governor of the [[Entre Ríos Province]], at the [[battle of Caseros]]. Defeated, he was rescued by a British warship and moved to [[Southampton]], where he stayed the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 108-111 ''(ibidem).''&lt;/ref&gt; He died on March 14, 1877, and he was buried at the [[Southampton Old Cemetery]]. Fearing pro-Rosas demonstrations, the Argentine government forbid any commemoration in his honour, and made instead a mass for the people that died during Rosas's government.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 113 ''(ibidem).''&lt;/ref&gt;

With Rosas out of the country, the Unitarians returned to Buenos Aires. They sought to erase or denigrate the legacy of Rosas, confiscated their {{specify}} property and charged him with [[high treason]]. [[Bartolomé Mitre]], who fought in Caseros, did so with the first histographic works of Argentina, with a high negative bias against Rosas and other ''[[caudillos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt; This historiographical perspective was soon confronted by the end of the 19th century by [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] scholars like [[Adolfo Saldías]] and [[Ernesto Quesada]], who described Rosas under a positive light.

==Repatriation projects==
[[File:Rosas memorial.JPG|thumb|180px|Rosas memorial in [[Southampton Old Cemetery]].]]
Anticipating the controversy, Rosas wrote in his will that "''once my country recognizes, along with its government, the justice owed me by my services''", then his body shall be returned to Argentina. Revisionism kept growing, specially in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1930s saw the establishment of the Pro-Repatriation of Rosas Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Revisionist authors got state recognition during the [[Revolution of '43]] (the United Kingdom was fighting [[World War II]] at that time) and lost it during the first presidencies of [[Juan Perón]], as Perón tried to avoid ideological disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Devoto, pp. 268-271&lt;/ref&gt; Perón was deposed in 1955 by the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'' military coup and sent to exile, and Peronism was proscribed. Perón became a supporter of revisionism in the 1960s, and helped Manuel de Anchorena in the renewed efforts of the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Perón returned from exile and became president in 1973. He appointed Anchorena ambassador in England, and instructed him to negotiate the repatriation of Rosas's body. Great Britain authorized it, and the Argentine Congress passed a resolution for this purpose. The repatriation was imminent, but the country began a period of turmoil: Perón died in 1974, his wife Isabel Perón could not keep the [[Dirty War]] under control (a conflict between left-wing guerrillas and right-wing anti-communist groups), and a new military coup, the [[National Reorganization Process]], deposed Isabel Perón. It is unknown if the repatriation was paused by the military or by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 115-116&lt;/ref&gt;

The military left in 1983, and [[Raúl Alfonsín]] became the new president. He did not take action to resume the repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final repatriation==

Alfonsín was followed by Peronist [[Carlos Menem]] in 1989, amid an economic crisis. Menem announced that the main task of his presidency would be the national reconciliation, the end of the dichotomies that once plagued the country. In the case of Rosas, he claimed that he wanted to be "the president of Rosas and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Sarmiento]]", of "Mitre and [[Facundo Quiroga|Quiroga]]". Both pairs were historical enemies, and Menem sought to end those conflicts. With those ideas in mind, Menem gave the final boost to the repatriation project. The body would be taken from the cemetery, placed in a new coffin in France, and them moved by plane to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

There were projects to place the coffin in the [[Buenos Aires Cathedral]], next to the one of [[José de San Martín]], but a 1982 papal regulation forbid to bury people in cathedrals except for popes, archbishops and cardinals. The committee attempted to bypass the regulation, to no avail. As a result, it was placed in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, pp. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

The body was received in France with the honours of a head of state: red carpet, full military honours and the flag at half staff. In Argentina, the newspaper ''[[La Nación]]'' (founded by Bartolomé Mitre) declared that it was not against the repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The huge procession took place on September 30, 1989, and had the presence of both descendants of Rosas and descendants of Rosas's enemies, who marched together in peace.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8646">[[Semiotics]] in popular music, or mesomusica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tagg|first=P|title=Musicology and the Semiotics of Popular Music|journal=Semiotica|year=1987|series=66-1/3|url=http://tagg.org/articles/xpdfs/semiota.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is different from semiotics in other musical forms, because [[pop music]] denotes a cultural object.&lt;ref name=Matusitz&gt;{{cite web|last=Matusitz|first=J|title=Semiotics of Music: Analysis of Chinese Rock and pop in the Post-Cultural Revolution Era|work=Conference Papers|publisher=International Communication Association|accessdate=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Matusitz, 2004). Popular music has many signs in itself because it has many components and uses, but it also appeals to the emotions of a generation. Music is the “logical expression” of feelings, a “symbolic form”.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;{{cite book|last=Langer|first=S.K.|title=Philosophy in a New Key: A Study of the Symbolism of Reason, Rite, and Art|year=1942|publisher=Pelican book|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos are an example of [[syntagm]], which interacting [[sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] form a meaningful whole.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=USA and Canada|isbn=978-0-415-36375-4|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music videos are also considered [[multimodal interaction|multimodal]] genres because one semiotic system is joined syntagmatically to another semiotic system, which results in a signified indexical meaning.&lt;ref name=Lemke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemke|first=J|title=Multimodal Genres and Transmedia Traversals: Social Semiotics and the Political Economy of the Sign|journal=Semiotica|year=2009|volume=173|issue=1-4|pages=283–297|doi=10.1515/SEMI.2009.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of music correlated with visuals can be described in terms of two basic mechanisms: temporal [[synchronicity]] and cross-modal [[Homology (sociology)|homology]].&lt;ref name=Eisenstein&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenstein|first=Sergi|title=The Film Sense|year=1943|publisher=Farber|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating the two modalities, sound and image, we can interpret it as a unified syntagm.&lt;ref name="Lemke"/&gt; Music videos are known to be visually secondary signified in combination with the [[semantic]] content of the lyrics.&lt;ref name=Bjornberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bjornberg|first=Alf|title=Structural Relationships in Music Video|journal=Popular Music|year=1994|volume=13|pages=51–74|doi=10.1017/S026114300000684X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotics in music videos is different from a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] analysis because we can uphold that semiotics searches for meaning by considering sign production and progress, while pragmatics searches for meaning by considering the intentions of semantics and the context it has evolved in.&lt;ref name=Chattah&gt;{{cite web|last=Chattah|first=J.R.|title=Semitoics, Pragmatics and Metaphor in Film Music Analysis|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04042006-140957/unrestricted/JuanChattah_Dissertation.pdf|work=(Doctoral Dissertation)|publisher=Electronic Theses, Florida State University|accessdate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are early critics of the importance of analyzing music videos as a semiotic system. [[Frederic Jameson]]'s definition of music videos is a schizophrenic string of isolated, discontinued signifiers, failing to link up into a coherent sequence, as a string without a center.&lt;ref name=Peeters&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peeters|first=H|title=The Semiotics of Music Videos: It Must be Written in the Stars|journal=Image and Narrative|year=2004|volume=8|issue=1760-678X|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/issue08/heidipeeters.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible editing==
Many semiotic analysts have examined music videos to decode messages that are being sent to viewers. Invisible editing, a semiotic term, that film editors use to almost decode the message for the audience using narrative actions. [[Daniel Chandler]]'s example from famous film editor, Ralph Rosenblum, "a man awakens suddenly in the middle of the night, bolts up in bed, stares ahead intensely, and twitches his nose. Then the film directs towards a room where two people are desperately fighting a billowing blaze"&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;(Chandler, pp.&amp;nbsp;166, 2007). Because of the actions of the actors, the audience is aware of the next scene before it is shown. An example of invisible editing in music videos would be in [[narrative]] style, which consist of a plot and storyline of events and characters&lt;ref name=Vernallis /&gt; [[Michael Jackson]]'s music video, ''Thriller'' is considered a narrative script, and it exceeds the song itself. In this case, the context of visual narrative semantically over-powers the meaning of the song itself. Many music videos use narrative style script, which is considered a more formal approach as the editing will add emphasis to the song's chorus, giving it a deeply ingrained musical [[archetype]].&lt;ref name="Bjornberg"/&gt; Music videos that aren't formally organized usually have no segmentation markings that flow with the lyrics, and contain [[abstract art|abstract]] images. ''Sledgehammer'', by [[Peter Gabriel]] is an example of formally unorganized music videos. In general, music videos contain visuals that either represent the potential [[connotative]] meaning of the lyrics or the visuals can represent a semiotic system of its own. Although many analysts explain the music video as being a narrative structure, there are many videos that defy narrative conventions.&lt;ref name=Vernallis&gt;{{cite book|last=Vernallis|first=Carol|title=Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context|year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intertextuality==
[[Intertextuality]], for media purposes, references other popular culture objects within their video, and then the audience creates their meaning of the video according to the intentional suggestion created with relationships between primary and secondary texts.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=James|title=Film and Television after DVD|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=NY|isbn=0-203-89429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, intertextuality is considered links within a context or medium that bind text to other text (Chandler, pp.&amp;nbsp;166, 2007&lt;ref name=Chandler /&gt; ). Many editors and directors use intertextuality in music videos because it combines different cultural [[codes]] taken from previous texts that are sensible for many audiences. Using intertextuality in music videos allow a viewer to identify with their [[theoretical]] framework of knowledge, and use it to define their identity. This approach can be used to gain popularity for referenced ideas, and influence consumers with a persuasive agenda. ''[[Material Girl]]'', by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is an example of using intertextuality because she is acting like [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend]].'' This is a direct cinematic reference which allows an active audience to draw conclusions to the meaning of the message.

==Intratextuality==
[[Intratextuality]] is a term that is derived from intertextuality, but is considered combining secondary references for marketing and promotional purposes. This type of technique is also called anchorage, found by [[Roland Barthes]]:&lt;ref name=Barthes&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=Image, Music, Text|year=1977|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|isbn=0-374-52136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; anchoring text to a context that changes the intentional meaning. An example of this would be, the music video, ''Right Now'', by [[Van Halen]]. The lyrics of the song ''Right Now'' suggest an entirely different meaning than the social empowering messages shown through the music video.

==Bricolage==
[[Bricolage]] is also an example of using many different texts within a context for promotional, marketing, or popularity value.&lt;ref name=Corona&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corona|first=V|title=Memory Monsters and Lady Gaga|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|year=2011|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00809.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5931.2011.00809.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Gaga]] uses cultural bricolage in her music videos by using fashion and previous memorable characteristics of former pop stars. Michael Jackson's ''Leave Me Alone'' is also a form of bricolage because it is a collage of already popular people and pop culture [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s combined to portray his own message.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">The '''sociology of Jewry''' involves the application of [[sociological theory]] and method to the study of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] and the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]]. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social patterns within Jewish groups and communities; [[American Jewry]], [[Israeli Jews]] and Jewish life in the [[diaspora]]. Sociological studies of the Jewish religion include religious membership, ritual and denominational patterns. Notable journals include ''[[Jewish Social Studies]]'', ''[[The Jewish Journal of Sociology]]'' and ''[[Contemporary Jewry]].

==Emergence of the discipline==

===Beginnings: 1930s-1950s===
Sociology of Jewry initially emerged in the United States in the 1930s beginning with the 1938 publication of ''Jewish Social Studies'', sponsored by the Conference of Jewish Relations. The Journal's mission was "to promote, by means of scientific research, a better understanding of the position of Jews in the modern world." And the later publication of ''The Jewish Journal of Sociology'' in 1958 was due to the "few opportunities... for publishing academic and scientific studies of the sociology of Jews."&lt;ref name=Heilman1982&gt;Heilman, Samuel C. "The sociology of American Jewry: The last ten years." ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 8, no. 1 (1982): 135-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and development: 1950s-present===
In 1955, sociologist [[Seymour Lipset]] noted that the discipline was underdeveloped, stating that there were far more "Jewish sociologists" than "sociologists of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, Seymour. "Jewish Sociologists and Sociologists of the Jews." ''Jewish Social Studies'' (1955): 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subfield began to grow in the late 1960s and 1970s. A professional organization was formed, namely the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ). In 1975, a new academic journal was founded as well, ''[[Contemporary Jewry]]''.

Contributing to this growth was the work of [[Marshall Sklare]], now considered one of the founding figures in the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack Nusan. "The Sociology of Jewry: Blueprints for the future from contemporary designs." ''Contemporary Jewry'' 4, no. 1 (1977): 24-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Sklare and [[Joseph Greenblum]]’s 1967 study of Jewish identity in “Lakeville” is considered one of the most notable works of its kind. The sociological study of intergroup relations and the theories proposed by [[Nathan Glazer]] and [[Daniel P. Moynihan]] is also thought to have contributed to the growth of the sociology of Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;Dashefsky, Arnold, Bernard Lazerwitz, and Ephraim Tabory. [http://www.booksfree.yolasite.com/resources/Free_Books/Handbook%20of%20the%20Sociology%20of%20Religion.pdf "A Journey of the" Straight Way" or the" Roundabout Path."] Handbook of the sociology of religion (2003): 240-261. Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formation of the ASSJ====
The idea for the formation of a professional organization for scholars specializing in the sociology of Jewry first surfaced in 1966; the concept was discussed by [[Werner J. Cahnman]] and [[Norman L. Friedman]] at an American Sociological Association (ASA) conference.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Norman L. "Conception and Birth of the Association for the Sociological Study of Jewry," ''Ethnic Forum'' 6 (1986): 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt; The association was informally launched by Norman Friedman and [[Bernard Lazerwitz]] in 1970; the event, titled "The Sociological Study of Jewry" took place at the ASA annual conference. Sociologists [[Solomon Poll]], [[Mervin Verbit]] and [[Arnold Dashevsky]] submitted a motion to establish a formal group; the motion was voted upon and accepted. The new group, the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ or ASSSJ) was launched and formally met the following year.

While the ASSJ and ''Contemporary Jewry'' are dominated by sociologists and sociological studies - all but one of the organization's presidents earned a doctorate in sociology, the other received a doctorate in psychology&lt;ref name=Blasi/&gt; - the focus has not been restricted to sociology alone. Studies involving other social sciences and history are included as well, and professionals from those disciplines have joined as members, contributors and honorees.&lt;ref name=waxmanassj/&gt;

==General theories==

===American Jewry===
According to sociologist [[Samuel Heilman]], there are three major theoretical approaches in studying the sociology of American Jewry in particular:
*''Uniqueness of Judaism'' and ''Particularism vs. Universalism'' - a popular theoretical approach towards understanding contemporary American Jewry has been the notion that more than anything else Judaism as a religion accounts for the social situation of U.S. Jews today.&lt;ref&gt;Sharot, Stephen. ''Judaism: A Sociology.'' Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The current social and political decisions of the Jewish community are rooted in the response to the inevitable conflict between Jewish religious values on one hand, and secular American life on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Liebman, Charles S. ''The Ambivalent American Jew: Politics, religion and family in American Jewish life.'' Jewish publication society of America, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Milton Himmelfarb]], focus less on the Jewish religion per se and focus on the tension produced by balancing the particularism of the Jewish tradition vs. the universalism of American modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton. ''The Jews of Modernity.'' New York, NY: Basic Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Marginal culture'' - in the 1940s and 1950s, some scholars, such as [[Milton M. Goldberg]], saw Jewish life in America as a successful "marginal culture," following the "[[marginal man theory]]" of [[Robert E. Park]] and [[Everett Stonequist]] popular at the time&lt;ref&gt;Bergmann, Werner, ed. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6W7oL3x1qAC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Error Without Trial: Psychological Research on Antisemitism].'' Vol. 2. Walter de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Community and organizations'' - a third approach stems from the work of political scientist [[Daniel J. Elazar]] and focuses and the underlying dynamics behind the decision making within Jewish community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Elazar, Daniel Judah. ''Community and polity: The organizational dynamics of American Jewry.'' Jewish Publication Society, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

While other theoretical approaches have been advanced they have not majorly impacted the discipline's research agenda.&lt;ref name=Heilman1982/&gt;

==Applied sociology==
[[Samuel Klausner]], a former president of the ASSJ, noted that the sociology of Jewry is more an applied social science than a theoretical one. For Klausner, theories developed in sociology may help explain any society, not just a Jewish one. The contribution of the sociology of Jewry therefore is the application of the science, such as its methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Klausner, Samuel Z. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=TLSKRqkGMToC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=sociology+of+Jewry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RGjjdeUVLR&amp;sig=wI1-V_RSkJ3tQNEAZMCv6qNfqeM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GuBsU4_fO86wyASMg4LACw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgK What is conceptually special about a sociology of Jewry]." ''Contemporary Anarchism''. Ed. Terry M. Perlin. Transaction Publishers. 1987. Accessed May 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, stress that the subfield is a part of general [[comparative sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Zenner, Walter P. "American jewry in the light of middleman minority theories." Contemporary Jewry 5, no. 1 (1980): 11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syllabi collections==

===1946 syllabus===
In 1946, [[Kurt H. Wolff]], a student of [[Karl Mannheim]], published “An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews” in ''[[Social Forces]]'', a notable sociology journal. Wolff's aim was to provide an aid to including material on Jews in courses on race relations, social disorganization, minorities, and/or introductory sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, Kurt H. "An Elementary Syllabus in the Sociology of the Jews." Social Forces (1946): 451-461.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff's syllabus focused on three topics:
*Demographic changes following the aftermath of [[World War II]] and the [[holocaust]]
*The "ethnic identifiability" of Jews
*[[Antisemitism]]

Later scholars have noted that Wolff's syllabus on the Sociology of Jewry sought to study external structures but ignored the internal dynamics of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007&gt;Burstein, Paul. "[http://www.overcominghateportal.org/uploads/5/4/1/5/5415260/sociology_of_jewry.pdf The Sociology of Jewry: Syllabi and Instructional Materials.]" ''ASA Resource Materials For Teaching''. American Sociological Association. Washington, DC. 2007. Accessed May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 ASA syllabi collection===
In 1992, Rabbi [[Jack Nusan Porter]] edited the first syllabus collection and curriculum guide on the Sociology of Jewry. The collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA). The collection included individual syllabi on the sociology of Jews from 34 colleges and universities. However, Porter found that many of the syllabi focused exclusively on Jewish life in America. And only 10 out of 34 syllabi were from sociology departments.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Jack N. 1998. The Sociology of Jewry: A Curriculum Guide. 2nd ed. Washington, DC: American Sociological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 ASA syllabi collection===
[[Paul Burstein]] of the [[University of Washington]] compiled an updated collection of syllabi on the sociology of Jewry. This collection was published by the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA) in 2007. In his work, Burstein focuses on the following themes:
*Comparative historical approach, examining changing and evolving patterns of Jewish life in the last few hundred years
*Jewish life in North America, though focusing mostly on the United States
*Jewish life in Israel
*The [[Holocaust]]

Burstein notes gaps in specific areas. For example, while Black-Jewish relations in the U.S. is covered in the syllabi, relations between Jews and other groups is not. Also, there are few areas covered outside of American and Israeli Jewry.&lt;ref name=Burstein2007/&gt;

'''Spatial association''' is the degree to which things are similarly arranged in space. Analysis of the distribution patterns of two phenomena is done by map overlay. If the distributions are similar, then the spatial association is strong, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spatial Association|url=http://www.gtav.asn.au/CMS200/files/cms_files/Spatialassociationactivities.pdf|publisher=Geography Teachers' Association of Victoria|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Geographic Information System]], the analysis can be done quantitatively. For example, a set of observations (as points or extracted from raster cells) at matching locations can be intersected and examined by [[regression analysis]].

Like [[spatial autocorrelation]], this can be a useful tool for spatial prediction. In spatial modeling, the concept of spatial association allows the use of covariates in a regression equation to predict the geographic field and thus produce a map.

'''Specific developmental disorders''' ('''SDD''') are disorders in which development is delayed in one specific area or areas,&lt;ref name = "Vyas"&gt;Ahuja Vyas: ''Textbook of Postgraduate Psychiatry'' (2 Vols.), 2nd ed. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and in which basically all other areas of development are not affected.&lt;ref name = "MedicineNet"&gt;http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11249&lt;/ref&gt; Specific developmental disorders are as opposed to [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s&lt;ref name = "MedicineNet" /&gt; that are characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including [[socialization]] and [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/pdd/pdd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICD-10 taxonomy==
The tenth revision of the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) has four categories of specific developmental disorder: specific developmental disorders of speech and language, specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills, specific developmental disorder of motor function, and mixed specific developmental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F80|title=ICD-10 Version:2010|author=|date=|website=apps.who.int|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM taxonomy==
In the third edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-III),&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Cantwell &amp; Lorian Baker: ''Developmental Speech and Language Disorders'', 1987, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; SDD was opposed to the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). There were two factors that were considered:

* The specificity of the impairment: in SDD there is one single domain that is affected, whereas in PDD multiple areas of functioning are affected.&lt;ref name = "Rutter"&gt;Sir Michael Rutter, Eric A. Taylor: ''Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'', 4th ed. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The nature of the impairment: development in SDD is delayed but not otherwise abnormal, whereas in PDD there are behavioral deviations that are not typical for any developmental stage.&lt;ref name = "Rutter" /&gt;
In the fourth edition of the DSM specific developmental disorders are no longer grouped together.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"&gt;Robert Jean Campbell, III: ''Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary'', 2003, page 184&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they are reclassified as communication disorders, learning disorders, and motor skills disorders.&lt;ref name = "Vyas" /&gt;

'''Temperance songs''' are those musical compositions that were sung and performed to promote the [[Temperance Movement]] from the 1840s to the 1920s.  It was a distinct [[genre]] of [[American music]]. In 1830 the US per capita consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] was 9.5 gallons yearly, almost four times the rate of consumption in 2008. In response, many [[List of Temperance organizations|temperance organizations]] formed over the next eighty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Songs of the Temperance Movement and Prohibition | publisher=Library of Congress | url = https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197382#item-article | accessdate = 2015-10-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temperance song lyrics were sung with already well-known songs of the period, for example, "[[Oh! Susanna]]". This [[Stephen Foster]] melody was used with lyrics in support of temperance and the title changed to “There’s A Good Time Coming,” in 1857, ten years after the publication of the [[s:Oh! Susanna|original lyrics of "Oh! Susanna"]].

== Development and genre history ==

[[File:Molly and the baby, Don't you know.ogg|thumb|A recording of "Molly and the Baby", a temperance song from 1916]]
A consistent [[Theme (arts)|theme]] within temperance songs of 19th and 20th century society was that drinking negatively impacted a stable [[family]] life and that it was at the center of much suffering. "Molly and the Baby Don't You Know" is about a father promising not to drink for the sake of his young child and [[suffering]] wife. Some temperance songs were intended to produce [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about the consequences of alcohol consumption. Themes including [[physical abuse|abuse]] were common, such as "The Drunkard's Child," by [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst|Mrs. Parkhurst]], 1870. In this song, a mother hears her child decry that her father's drinking and their poverty leads to her being ignored by her peers. An archived field-recording of this song, sung by John McCready, relates the song of a dying child of an [[alcoholic intoxication|alcoholic]]. The child fears he or she will not be allowed to enter [[heaven]].&lt;ref name=LIBC!&gt;{{cite web | title = Songs of the Temperance Movement and Prohibition | publisher=Library of Congress
| url = https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197382#item-article | accessdate = 2015-10-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Foster was considered to be the best-known of the Temperance songwriters.

=== Comrades, Fill No Glass for Me ===

Foster’s Temperance song, “Comrades, Fill No Glass for Me” (1855), is thought to be a narrative of his own drinking struggle. The melody to these lyrics are unknown:
''Oh, comrades, fill no glass for me,

''To drown my soul in liquid flame'',

''For if I drank, the toast should be''&lt;br&gt;
''To blighted fortune, health and fame.''&lt;br&gt;
''Yet, though I long to quell the strife,''&lt;br&gt;
''That passion holds against my life,''

&lt;!-- We cannot include all the lyrics of a song and certainly not several. Song lyrics belong in wikisource or as ogg files that can be referenced here.Note there is a wiki &lt;song&gt;&lt;song/&gt; which saves you from  using all those breaks
''Though boon companions ye may be,&lt;br&gt;
Oh! comrades, fill no glass for me.

I know a breast that once was light&lt;br&gt;
Whose patient sufferings need my care,&lt;br&gt;
I know a hearth that once was bright,&lt;br&gt;
But drooping hopes have gather’d there,&lt;br&gt;
Then while the tear-drops nightly steal&lt;br&gt;
From wounded hearts that I should heal,&lt;br&gt;
Though boon companions ye may be,&lt;br&gt;
Oh! comrades, fill no glass for me.

''When I was young I felt the tide Of aspirations undefiled,''&lt;br&gt;
''But manhood’s years have wronged the pride My parents centered on their child.''&lt;br&gt;
''Then, by a mother’s sacred tear,''&lt;br&gt;
''By all that memory should revere, Though boon companions ye may be'',&lt;br&gt;''

=== A License Party Trick (sung to the tune of Oh! Susanna) ===

::: There was a great election once, (We need not name the date,)
:::: Out in Ohio, and it lost Republicans the State.
::: That party runs the Government With still house revenue,
:::: And boasts much of its temperance, From its “high license” view.

: ''(chorus)''
::: Oh, high license,
:::: How is that for high?
::: You’ll make your party very sick and

Republicans are anxious, Sir, With two faced policy,&lt;br&gt;
To suit both rum and temperance,&lt;br&gt;
Just as the case may be;&lt;br&gt;
To hoodwink Prohibitionists, This is a cunning trick,&lt;br&gt;
But in the end, ‘twill hurt themselves,&lt;br&gt;
And make them very sick.

How can one trust such party, Sir, With plans so opposite,&lt;br&gt;
That offers either right or wrong, To all who vote for it?&lt;br&gt;
No wonder people in disgust&lt;br&gt;
Upon such morals frown; Like as Ohio, they will put&lt;br&gt;
Such double dealing down.

That party is the wrong one, Sir, To wear a temp’rance name&lt;br&gt;
Yet make high license fallacy&lt;br&gt;
Its highest moral aim!&lt;br&gt;
It cannot carry both at once,&lt;br&gt;
The church and the saloon, As other States will let it know,&lt;br&gt;
Besides Ohio, soon.

Of late, severe rebuke unto Republicans has come,&lt;br&gt;
And yet, deluded people trust The treachery of rum!&lt;br&gt;
They cling to party, though it be The known ally of drink!&lt;br&gt;
But with some more experience,&lt;br&gt; --&gt;

:::: They'll vote with us, we think.

This temperance song was sung to the tune of "Oh! Susanna", and was written in response to [[abolitionist]] and legislative developments of the times. In 1851, the state of [[Maine]] established statewide prohibition. Other states subsequently adopted similar [[legislation]]. "A License Party Trick" specifically refers to legislation passed in 1883 in [[Ohio]] when [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] lost the governorship and the majority in the state [[Ohio House of Representatives|House]] and [[Ohio Senate|senate]]. The ousted legislators and [[Charles Foster (Ohio politician)|Governor Charles Foster]]'s (no relation) attempt to tax and regulate alcohol sales resulted in the loss of support of temperance supporters. Voters found the politician's attempts at legislation as too [[liberalism|liberal]]. The legislative defeat was also attributed to the lack of support of [[Germans|German]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] [[voter]]s who believed the proposed [[liquor]] policies to be overly restrictive.

== Other songwriters ==
[[File:Temperance song hand book.jpg|thumb|350px|This is the songbook used at the Womens Temperance Organization from Wilkinsburg, PA]]
From the 1840s to 1920, the American Temperance Movement produced a large number of songs. Some of the more notable composers were Stephen Foster, [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst|Mrs. E.A. Parkhurst]], M. Evans, [[George Frederick Root|George F. Root]], and [[Henry Clay Work|Henry Work]]. Another specific example of a popular song of the times is "The Drunkard's Child," by Mrs. Parkhurst written in 1870. In the song a child complains to her mother that she is ignored by others because she is poor and her father drinks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The temperance songwriters tended to write songs sympathetic to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause. This is in contrast to Stephen Foster who wrote [[minstrel songs]]. This genre is seen as racist today, and his own family opposed the [[abolition of slavery]]. Foster differed from the other temperance [[composer]]s in that he also wrote [[drinking songs]]. Some [[historian]]s believe that Foster drank heavily.&lt;ref name=SAND/&gt;

[[James Lord Pierpont]], composer of “[[Jingle Bells]],” created temperance songs with the [[melody]] of this still  popular holiday tune.&lt;ref name=SAND/&gt;

== Songs of Temperance organizations ==
Some locally organized temperance organizations printed and published their own temperance songs, some of which were derived from hymns. For example, the [[Old 100th|doxology]] has been modified with the following lyrics:
::::Praise God from Whom all blessings flow,
:::Praise him who saves from deepest woe,
::::Praise him who leads the temperance host,
:::Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''trilithon''' (or ''trilith'') is a structure consisting of two large vertical stones (posts) supporting a third stone set horizontally across the top (lintel). It is commonly used in the context of [[megalithic]] monuments. The most famous trilithons are those of [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], those found in the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|Megalithic temples]] of [[Malta]], both of which are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, and the [[Osireion]] in Egypt.

The word ''trilithon'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "having three stones" (''τρι-/tri-'' 'three' + ''λίθος/lithos'' 'stone') and was first used by [[William Stukeley]].

The term also describes the groups of three stones in the [[Hunebed]] tombs of the [[Netherlands]] and the three massive stones forming part of the wall of the Roman Temple of Jupiter at [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]]. Far from [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], another famous trilithon is the [[Ha'amonga 'a Maui|Haʻamonga ʻa Maui]] in [[Tonga]], [[Polynesia]].

[[File:Trilithon of Baalbek 3.jpg|thumb|The 3 blocks known as trilithon in Temple of Jupiter Baal ("Heliopolitan Zeus") in Baalbek, Lebanon.]]
A group of three horizontally lying giant stones, which form part of the podium of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Temple of Jupiter (Roman Heliopolis)|Jupiter temple]] of [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]], are called a "Trilithon", although they do not fit the above definition. The location of the megalithic structures is atop of a hill in the region, known as Tel Baalbek. Numerous archaeological expeditions have gone to the site starting in the 19th century, primarily German and French groups, and research continued into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://gilgamesh42.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/moving-the-stones-of-baalbek-the-wonders-of-roman-engineering/|title = Moving the Stones of Baalbek–The Wonders of Roman Engineering|last = Adair|first = Aaron|website = Fleeing Nergal, Seeking Stars|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one of these stones is 19 metres long, 4.2 metres high, 3.6 metres thick and weighs around 800 tonnes.  The supporting stone layer beneath features a number of stones which weigh an estimated 350 tonnes and are 11 metres wide.&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 52"&gt;{{harvnb|Adam|1977|p = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[quarry]] nearby, [[Stone of the Pregnant Woman|two Roman building blocks]], which were intended for the same podium, surpass 1,000 tonnes. They have not been used since their extraction in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|pp=7–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal adaptive strategy theory''' ('''UAST''') is an evolutionary theory developed by [[J. Philip Grime]] in collaboration with Simon Pierce describing the general limits to [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] based on the [[trade-off]] that organisms face when the resources they gain from the environment are allocated between either growth, maintenance or regeneration – known as the universal three-way trade-off.

==General theory==
A universal three-way [[trade-off]] produces [[Plant strategies|adaptive strategies]] throughout the tree of life, with extreme strategies facilitating the survival of genes via: C (competitive), the survival of the individual using traits that maximize resource acquisition and resource control in consistently productive [[Ecological niche|niches]]; S (stress-tolerant), individual survival via maintenance of metabolic performance in variable and unproductive niches; or R ([[ruderal]]), rapid gene propagation via rapid completion of the lifecycle and regeneration in niches where events are frequently lethal to the individual.

It is impossible for an organism to evolve a survival strategy in which all resources are devoted exclusively to one of these investment paths, but relatively extreme strategies exist, with a range of intermediates. The system can be represented by a triangle, with the three extreme possibilities at its vertices. The different species may be located at some particular point inside this triangle, accommodating a certain percentage of each of the three strategies.

It is possible to use multivariate statistics to determine the main trends in [[Phenotypic trait|phenotypic variability]] in a range of organisms, which for various major animal groups (most prominently [[vertebrate]]s), has been shown to have three main endpoints consistent with UAST.

UAST is a key part of the twin-filter model describing how species with similar overall strategies but divergent sets of minor traits [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in ecological communities.

==C-S-R Triangle theory==
C-S-R Triangle theory is the application of UAST to [[plant biology]]. The three strategies are competitor, stress tolerator, and ruderal. These strategies each thrive best in a unique combination of either high or low intensities of [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]].

===Competitors===
Competitors are plant species that thrive in areas of low intensity stress and disturbance and excel in [[Competition (biology)|biological competition]]. These species are able to outcompete other plants by most efficiently tapping into available resources. Competitors do this through a combination of favorable characteristics, including rapid growth rate, high productivity (growth in height, lateral spread, and root mass), and high capacity for [[phenotypic plasticity]]. This last feature allows competitors to be highly flexible in morphology and adjust the allocation of resources throughout the various parts of the plant as needed over the course of the growing season.

===Stress tolerators===
Stress tolerators are plant species that live in areas of high intensity stress and low intensity disturbance. Species that have adapted this strategy generally have slow growth rates, long-lived leaves, high rates of nutrient retention, and low phenotypic plasticity. Stress tolerators respond to environmental stresses through physiological variability. These species are often found in stressful environments such as alpine or arid habitats, deep shade, nutrient deficient soils, and areas of extreme pH levels.

===Ruderals===
[[Ruderal species|Ruderals]] are plant species that prosper in situations of high intensity disturbance and low intensity stress. These species are fast-growing and rapidly complete their life cycles, and generally produce large amounts of seeds. Plants that have adapted this strategy are often found colonizing recently disturbed land, and are often [[Annual plant|annuals]].

==Relation to the R* theory==
Understanding the differences between the CSR theory  and its major alternative the [[R* rule|R* theory]] has been a major goal in [[community ecology]] for many years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craine|first1=Joseph|title=Reconciling plant strategy theories of Grime and Tilman|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jabot|title=general modelling framework for resource-ratio and CSR theories of plant community dynamics|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02024.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unlike the R* theory that predicts that competitive ability is determined by the ability to grow under low levels of resources, the CSR theory predicts that competitive ability is determined by [[relative growth rate]] and other size related traits. While some experiments supported the R* predictions, other supported the CSR predictions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The different predictions stem from different assumptions on the [[size-asymmetric competition|size asymmetry of the competition]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size symmetric (i.e. resource exploitation is proportional to individual biomass), the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric (i.e. large individuals exploit disproportional higher amounts of resources compared with smaller individuals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeMalach|title=Size asymmetry of resource competition and the structure of plant communities|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
