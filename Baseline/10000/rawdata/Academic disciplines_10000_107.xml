'''American urban history''' is the study of cities of the United States. [[Local history|Local historians]] have always written about their own cities. Starting in the 1920s, and led by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] at Harvard, professional historians began comparative analysis of what cities have in common, and started using theoretical models and scholarly biographies of specific cities.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2344 Online review by  Andrea Tuttle Kornbluh  1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States has also had a long history of hostility to the city, as characterized for example by Thomas Jefferson's [[History of agrarianism|agrarianism]] and the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, ''Americans Against the City: Anti-Urbanism in the Twentieth Century'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary Sies (2003) argues:
:At the start of the twenty-first century, North American urban history is flourishing. Compared to twenty-five years ago, the field has become more interdisciplinary and intellectually invigorating.  Scholars are publishing increasingly sophisticated efforts to understand how the city as space intersects the urbanization process, as well as studies that recognize the full complexity of experiences for different metropolitan cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Mary Corbin |last = Sies|title = North American Urban History: The Everyday Politics and Spatial Logics of Metropolitan Life|journal = Urban History Review/Revue d'histoire urbaine|volume = 32|number =1 |date =2003|pages = 28-42|url = http://www.erudit.org/revue/uhr/2003/v32/n1/1015740ar.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
American urban history is a branch of the [[history of the United States]] and of the broader field of [[Urban history]]. That field of history examines the historical development of cities and towns, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]] [[business history]], and even [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.

In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888–1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915–2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrence J. McDonald, "Theory and Practice in the 'New' History: Rereading Arthur Meier Schlesinger's The Rise of the City, 1878-1898," ''Reviews in American History'' (1992) 20#3 pp. 432-445 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703171 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Schlesinger and his students took a group approach to history, sharply downplaying the role of individuals. Handlin added a focus on groups defined by ethnicity (that is Germans, Irish, Jews, Italians Hispanics etc.) or by class (working class or middle class). The Harvard model was that the urban environment, including the interaction with other groups, shaped their history and group outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Zane L. Miller,  "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City." ''Reviews in American History'' 24.3 (1996) pp: 361-368. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v024/24.3miller.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New urban history ===
The "new urban history" was a short-lived movement that attracted a great deal of attention In the 1960s, then quickly disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds., ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; It used statistical methods and innovative computer techniques to analyze manuscript census data, person by person, focusing especially on the geographical and social mobility of random samples of residents. Numerous monographs appeared, but it proved frustrating to interpret the results. Historian [[Stephan Thernstrom]], the leading promoter of the new approach, soon disavowed it, saying it was neither new nor urban nor history.&lt;ref&gt;Eric H. Monkkonen, ''America Becomes Urban: The Development of U.S. Cities and Towns, 1780-1980'' (1988) pp 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall urban history grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, stimulated by the surge of interest in social history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L. Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1990s, however, the field has been aging and has had much less attraction to younger scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Bender|title=Intellect and Public Life: Essays on the Social History of Academic Intellectuals in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=240iKp_jVjoC&amp;pg=PR11|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=11|quote= urban history, a field marked by deep decline in historiographical significance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims for urban impact ===
Historian [[Richard Clement Wade|Richard Wade]] has summarized the claims that scholars have made for the importance of the city in American history. The cities were the focal points for the growth of the West, especially those along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The cities, especially Boston, were the seed beds of the American Revolution.  Rivalry between cities, such as between Baltimore and Philadelphia, or between Chicago and St. Louis, stimulated economic innovations and growth, especially regarding the railroads.  The cities sponsored [[entrepreneurship]], especially in terms of export and import markets, banking, finance, and the rise of the [[factory system]] after 1812.  The rapidly growing railroad system after 1840 was primarily oriented toward linking together the major cities, which in turn became centers of the wholesale trade.  The railroads allowed major cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, and San Francisco to dominate ever-larger [[hinterland]]s.

The failure of the South to develop an urban infrastructure significantly weakened it during the Civil War, especially as its border cities of Baltimore, Washington, Louisville, and St. Louis, refused to join the Confederacy.  The cities were fonts of innovation in democracy, especially in terms of building powerful political organizations and [[political machine|machines]]; they were also the main base for reformers of those machines.  They became the home base for important immigrant groups, especially the Irish and the Jews.  Cities were the strongholds of labor unions in the 19th and 20th centuries (although no longer so in the 21st century).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wade, "The City in History: Some American Perspectives," in Werner Z. Hirsch, ed., ''Urban Life and Form'' (1963) pp 59-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Zane Miller argues that urban history was rejuvenated in mid-20th century by the realization that the cultural importance of the city went far beyond art galleries and museums. Historians began to emphasize "the importance of individual choices in the past and made the advocacy of lifestyle choices a hallmark of American civilization."  It was the diversity of the city, and the support it provided for diverse lifestyles, that set it so dramatically apart from towns and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City."&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s there was increased emphasis on racial minorities, outcasts, and gays and lesbians, as well as studies of leisure activities and sports history.&lt;ref&gt;George Chauncey, ''Gay New York: Gender, urban culture, and the making of the gay male world, 1890-1940'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Riess, ''City games: The evolution of American urban society and the rise of sports'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectuals against the city===
As Morton White demonstrated in ''The Intellectual versus the City: from Thomas Jefferson to Frank Lloyd Wright'' (1962), the overwhelming consensus of American intellectuals has been hostile to the city. The main idea is the Romantic view that the unspoiled nature of rural America is morally superior  to the over civilized cities, which are the natural homes of sharpsters and criminals. American poets did not rhapsodize over the cities. On the contrary they portrayed the metropolis as The ugly scene of economic inequality, crime, drunkenness, prostitution and every variety of immorality. Urbanites were set to rhyme as crafty, overly competitive, artificial, and as having lost too much naturalness and goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Walker, "The Poet and the Rise of the City." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1962): 85-99. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889467 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial era and American Revolution ==
Historian [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] examined in depth five key cities: Boston (population 16,000 in 1760), Newport Rhode Island (population 7500), New York City (population 18,000), Philadelphia (population 23,000), and Charles Town (Charlestown, South Carolina), (population 8000). He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating the ideas of the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. Furthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people meeting welfare.  The cities were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive and corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure and to solve urban problems.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness-The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625-1742'' (1938) [https://www.questia.com/library/7916885/cities-in-the-wilderness-the-first-century-of-urban online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid.  Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as "sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest," public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to "democratic yearnings" for political power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955), pp 147, 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, "Cities in review,"  ''Common-Place'' (July 2003) 3#4 [http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/reviews/carp.shtml online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315142529/http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/reviews/carp.shtml |date=2015-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:View of New Archangel, 1837.tif|thumb|right|380px| The capital of the [[Russian-American Company]] at New Archangel (present day [[Sitka, Alaska]]) in 1837]]
Colonial powers established villages of a few hundred population as administrative centers, providing a governmental presence, as well has trading opportunities, and some transportation facilities. Representative examples include Spanish towns of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], [[San Antonio, Texas]], and [[Los Angeles, California]], French towns of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; Dutch towns of [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City), and the Russian town of [[Sitka, Alaska|New Archangel]] (now Sitka).  When their territory was absorbed into the United States, these towns expanded their administrative roles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Ernest Cooke, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the North American colonies'' (1993) 1: 113-154, 233-244.&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous historians have explored the roles of working-class men, including slaves, in the economy of the colonial cities,&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Work in the Cities of Colonial British North America," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#6 pp 1021-1032&lt;/ref&gt; and in the early Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Class and the History of Working People in the Early Republic." ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (2005) 25#4 pp: 527-535. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jer/summary/v025/25.4rockman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few cities in the entire South, and Charleston (Charles Town) and New Orleans were the most important before the Civil War. The colony of South Carolina was settled mainly by [[Planter (American South)|planters]] from the overpopulated [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar]] island colony of [[Barbados]], who brought large numbers of African slaves from that island.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Charleston grew as a port for the shipment of rice and later cotton, so did the community's cultural and social opportunities. The city had a large base of elite merchants and rich planters. The first theater building in America was built in Charleston in 1736, but was later replaced by the 19th-century Planter's Hotel where wealthy planters stayed during Charleston's horse-racing season (now the Dock Street Theatre, known as one of the oldest active theaters built for stage performance in the United States.  Benevolent societies were formed by several different ethnic groups: the South Carolina Society, founded by French [[Huguenot]]s in 1737; the German Friendly Society, founded in 1766; and the Hibernian Society, founded by Irish immigrants in 1801. The [[Charleston Library Society]] was established in 1748 by some wealthy Charlestonians who wished to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day. This group also helped establish the [[College of Charleston]] in 1770, the oldest college in South Carolina, the oldest municipal college in the United States, and the 13th oldest college in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Fraser, ''Charleston! Charleston!: The History of a Southern City'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1775 the largest city was Philadelphia at 40,000, followed by New York (25,000), Boston (16,000), Charleston (12,000), and Newport (11,000), along with Baltimore, Norfolk, and Providence, with 6000, 6000, and 4400 population. They too were all seaports and on any one day each hosted a large transient population of Sailors and visiting businessmen. On the eve of the Revolution, 95 percent of the American population lived outside the cities—much to the frustration of the British, who were able to capture the cities with their Royal Navy, but lacked the manpower to occupy and subdue the countryside. In explaining the importance of the cities in shaping the American Revolution, Benjamin Carp compares the important role of waterfront workers, taverns, churches, kinship networks, and local politics.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, ''Rebels Rising: Cities and the American Revolution'' (2007) [https://www.questia.com/library/120077070/rebels-rising-cities-and-the-american-revolution online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Gary B. Nash]] emphasizes the role of the working class, and their distrust of their betters, in northern ports. He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Nash, ''The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution'' (2nd ed. 1986) pp 240-47; the first edition of 1979 was entitled ''Urban Crucible: Social Change, Political Consciousness, and the Origins of the American Revolution)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GROWTH1850.JPG|thumb|350px|trends in economic growth, 1700–1850]]

== The new nation, 1783–1815 ==
The cities played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during the war itself, 1775-83. They lost their main role as oceanic ports, because of the blockade by the British Navy.  Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776-83, as well as Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston for briefer periods.  During the occupations cities were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. The British finally departed in 1783, they took out large numbers of wealthy merchants, resume their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.  The older cities finally restored their economic basis; growing cities included Salem, Massachusetts, (which opened a new trade with China), New London, Connecticut, and especially Baltimore, Maryland.  The Washington administration under the leadership of Secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton set up a national bank in 1791, and local banks began to flourish in all the cities. Merchant entrepreneurship flourished and was a powerful engine of prosperity in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. East, "The Business Entrepreneur in a Changing Colonial Economy, 1763-1795," ''Journal of Economic History''  (May, 1946), Vol. 6, Supplement pp. 16-27 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113072 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants and financiers of the cities were especially sensitive to the weakness of the old Confederation system; when it came time to ratify the much stronger new Constitution in 1788, all the nation's cities, North and South, voted in favor, while the rural districts were divided.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, "An Agenda for Urban History," in Herbert J. Bass, ed., ''The State of American History'' (1970) pp 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The national capital was at Philadelphia until 1800, when it was moved to Washington. Apart from the murderous Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793, which killed about 10 percent of the population, Philadelphia had a marvelous reputation as the "cleanest, best-governed, healthiest, and most elegant of American cities." Washington, built in a fever-ridden swamp with long hot miserable summers, was ranked far behind Philadelphia, although it did escape Yellow Fever.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Blaine Nye, ''The Cultural Life of the New Nation: 1776-1830'' (1960) pp 127-28&lt;/ref&gt;

World peace only lasted a decade, for in 1793 a two-decade-long war between Britain and France and their allies broke out.  As the leading neutral trading partner the United States did business with both sides. France resented it, and the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798-99 disrupted trade. Outraged at British impositions on American merchant ships, and sailors, the Jefferson and Madison administrations engaged in economic warfare with Britain [[Embargo of 1807|1807-1812]], and then [[War of 1812|full-scale warfare 1812 to 1815]]. The result was additional serious damage to the mercantile interests.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P. Nettles, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) remains the best economic overview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Allen Krout and Dixon Ryan Fox, ''The Completion of Independence, 1790–1830'' (1944) is a wide-ranging social history of the new nation; see pp 1-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all was gloomy in urban history, however. Although there was relatively little immigration from Europe,  the [[American frontier|rapid expansion of settlements]] to the West, and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, open up vast frontier lands. New Orleans and St. Louis joined the United States, and entirely new cities were opened in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Nashville and points west.  Historian Richard Wade has emphasized the importance of the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, but a very good river system in which everything flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1820, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, ''The urban frontier: pioneer life in early Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, and St. Louis'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of New York City (1784–1854)|New York]], with a population of 96,000 in 1810 surged far beyond its rivals, reaching a population of 1,080,000 in 1860, compared to 566,000 in Philadelphia, 212,000 in Baltimore, 178,000 in Boston (289,000 including the Boston suburbs), and 169,000 in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;George Rogers Taylor, ''The transportation revolution, 1815-1860'' (1951) pp 388-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Robert Albion identifies four aggressive moves by New York entrepreneurs and politicians that helped it jump to the top of American cities. It set up an auction system that efficiently and rapidly sold imported cargoes; it organized a regular transatlantic packet service to England; it built a large-scale coastwise trade, especially one that brought Southern cotton to New York for reexport to Europe; it sponsored the Erie Canal, which opened a large new market in upstate New York and the Old Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Albion, "New York Port and its disappointed rivals, 1815-1860." ''Journal of Business and Economic History'' (1931) 3: 602-629.&lt;/ref&gt; The main rivals, Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore, tried to compete with the Erie Canal by opening their own networks of canals and railroads; they never caught up.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Rubin, "Canal or railroad? Imitation and innovation in the response to the Erie canal in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1961): 1-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Roth, "The Growth of American Cities." ''Geographical Review'' (1918) 5#5 pp: 384-398. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/207468 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   Manufacturing was not a major factor in the growth of the largest cities at this point. Instead  factories were chiefly being built in towns and smaller cities, especially in New England, having waterfalls or fast rivers that were harnessed to generate the power, or were closer to coal supplies, as in Pennsylvania.

===National leadership===
America's financial, business and cultural leadership (that is, literature, the arts, and the media) were concentrated in the three or four largest cities. Political leadership was never concentrated. It was divided between Washington and the state capitals, and many states deliberately moved their state capital out of their largest city, including New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and California.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Montès, ''American Capitals: A Historical Geography'' (2014) &amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic and scientific leadership was weak in the United States until the late 19th century, when it began to be concentrated in universities. A few major research-oriented schools were in or close by the largest cities, such as Harvard (Boston),  Columbia (New York), Johns Hopkins (Baltimore) and Chicago. However,  most were located in smaller cities or large towns such as Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; Cornell in Ithaca, New York; Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor; University of Illinois in Urbana; University of Wisconsin in Madison;  University of California in Berkeley, and Stanford in the village of Stanford, California.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Meier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) pp 82-87, 212-16, 247-48&lt;/ref&gt;

{{U.S. cities in the Civil War}}

The cities played a major part in the Civil War, providing soldiers, money, training camps, supplies, and media support for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union war effort]].

In the North, discontent with the 1863 [[Conscription in the United States#Early drafts|draft]] law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the [[New York City draft riots]] of July 13 to July 16, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Barnet Schecter, ''The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/317749.html The New York City Draft Riots] ''In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City'', 1626–1863, by Leslie M. Harris&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the small Michigan cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bratt, "A Great Revolution in Feeling: The American Civil War in Niles and Grand Rapids, Michigan," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2005) 31#2 pp 43–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] called the war a failure and it became more and more a partisan Republican effort.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Hershock, "Copperheads and Radicals: Michigan Partisan Politics during the Civil War Era, 1860–1865," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1992) 18#1 pp 28–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederacy===
Cities played a much less important part in the heavily rural Confederacy. When the war started the largest cities in slave states were seized in 1861 by the Union, including Washington, Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville, and St. Louis. The largest and most important Confederate city, New Orleans, was captured in early 1862, and Nashville in 1863. All these cities became major logistic and strategic centers for the Union forces.  All the remaining ports were blockaded by the summer of 1861, ending normal commercial traffic, with only very expensive blockade runners getting through. The largest remaining cities were Atlanta, the railroad center which was destroyed in 1864, in the national capital in Richmond which held out to the bitter end.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Slap, and Frank Towers, eds. ''Confederate Cities: The Urban South during the Civil War Era''  (University of Chicago Press, 2015). xiv, 302 pp. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the inadequate transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in Confederate cities. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1864, the poor white women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, merchants and planters. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCurry, "'Bread or Blood!'" ''Civil War Times'' (2011) 50#3 pp 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Crisp Williams, and David Williams, "'The Women Rising': Cotton, Class, and Confederate Georgia's Rioting Women," ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' (2002) 86#12 pp. 49–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleven Confederate states in 1860 had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population.&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Paskoff, "Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy," ''Civil War History,'' (2008) 54#1 pp 35–62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late 19th century growth==
{{Further|Gilded Age}}
===Street traffic===
In a horse-drawn era, streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel.  However, they produced uneven wear, opened new hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles. Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900, pulling streetcars, wagons, and carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets.  Small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel, but larger cities wanted much better streets, so they looked to wood or granite blocks.&lt;ref&gt;David O. Whitten, "A Century of Parquet Pavements: Wood as a Paving Material In The United States And Abroad, 1840-1940." ''Essays in Economic and Business History'' 15 (1997): 209-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, a third of Chicago's 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud.  Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was [[asphalt]] paving. With London and Paris as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882, and served as a model for Buffalo, Philadelphia and elsewhere. By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, followed by brick construction.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Maier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) p 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the largest cities, street railways were elevated, which increased their speed and lessened their dangers. Street-level trolleys moved passengers at 12 miles per hour for 5 cents a ride (with free transfers), They became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort. The working-class typically walked to nearby factories and patronized small local stores.  Big-city streets became paths for faster and larger and more dangerous vehicles, the pedestrians beware.  Underground subways were a solution, with Boston building one in the 1890s followed by New York a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Fairfield, "Rapid Transit: Automobility and Settlement in Urban America" ''Reviews in American History'' 23#1 (1995), pp. 80-85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703240 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The new West ===
After 1860, railroads pushed westward into unsettled territory. They built service towns to handle the needs of railroad construction and repair crews, train crews, and passengers who ate meals at scheduled stops.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hudson, "Towns of the western railroads." ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 2#1 (1982): 41-54. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2671&amp;context=greatplainsquarterly online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gunfights and disorder characterized the [[railhead]] towns that were the target of major [[cattle drive]]s from Texas.  The violence was often exaggerated in [[dime novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Dykstra, ''The cattle towns'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odie B. Faulk, ''Dodge City: The Most Western Town Of All'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  In most of the South, there were very few cities of any size for miles around, and this held for Texas as well. Railroads finally arrived in the 1880s and they shipped the cattle out; cattle drives became short-distance affairs.  However the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Holden, "Law and Lawlessness on the Texas Frontier, 1875-1890." ''The Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' 44.2 (1940): 188-203. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30240564 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denver]]'s economy before 1870 had been rooted in mining; it then grew by expanding its role in railroads, wholesale trade, manufacturing, food processing, and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland. Between 1870 and 1890, manufacturing output soared from $600,000 to $40 million, and the population grew by a factor of 20 times to 107,000. Denver had always attracted miners, workers, whores and travelers. Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight. The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters, and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Leonard, and Thomas J. Noel, ''Denver: Mining Camp to Metropolis'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, Denver had grown to be the 26th largest city in America, and the fifth-largest city west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab12.txt|title = Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1890|publisher = U.S. Bureau of the Census|date = 15 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions, as well as hustlers, poverty and crime. Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses, from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid "cribs" located a few blocks away. Business was good; visitors spent lavishly, then left town. As long as madams conducted their business discreetly, and "crib girls" did not advertise their availability too crudely, authorities took their bribes and looked the other way. Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Secrest. ''Hell's Belles: Prostitution, Vice, and Crime in Early Denver, with a Biography of Sam Howe, Frontier Lawman.'' (2nd ed., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

With its giant mountain of copper, [[Butte, Montana]] was the largest, richest and rowdiest [[mining camp]] on the frontier. It was an ethnic stronghold, with the Irish Catholics in control of politics and of the best jobs at the leading mining corporation [[Anaconda Copper]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Emmons, ''The Butte Irish: class and ethnicity in an American mining town, 1875-1925'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; City boosters opened a public library in 1894. Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control, "an antidote to the miners' proclivity for drinking, whoring, and gambling." It was also designed to promote middle-class values and to convince Easterners the Butte was a cultivated city.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel F. Ring, "The Origins of the Butte Public Library: Some Further Thoughts on Public Library Development in the State of Montana," ''Libraries &amp; Culture'' (1993) 28#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;430–44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25542594 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Appreciative crowds filled the large, upscale "Belasco" opera house for full-scale operas and top-name artists.&lt;ref&gt;Archie L. Clark, "John Maguire, Butte's" Belasco"." The Montana Magazine of History (1952): 32-40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4515771 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skyscrapers and apartment buildings===
{{Main|skyscraper|apartment|tenement}}
In Chicago and New York, new inventions facilitated the emergence of the skyscraper in the 1880s—it was a characteristic American style that was not widely copied around the world until the late 20th century. Construction required several major innovations, the elevator, and the steel beam.  The steel skeleton, developed in the 1880s, replaced the heavy brick walls that were limited to 15 or so stories in height. The skyscraper also required a complex internal structure to solve difficult issues of ventilation, steam heat, gas lighting (and later electricity), and plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Douglas, ''Skyscrapers: A social history of the very tall building in America'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Urban housing involved a wide variety of styles, but most of the attention focused on the tenement house for the working class, and the apartment building for the middle class.

The apartment building came first, as middle-class professionals, businessmen, and white-collar workers realized they did not need and could scarcely afford single-family dwellings of the type that low land costs in the towns permitted. Boarding houses were inappropriate for family; hotel suites were too expensive.  In smaller cities, there were many apartments over stores and shops, usually occupied by proprietors of small local businesses. The residents paid rent, and did not own their apartments until the emergence of cooperatives in New York City in the 20th century, and condominiums around the country after World War II. Turnover was very high, and there was seldom was a sense of neighborhood community.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Kallman Epstein, "Multifamily Dwellings and the Search for Respectability: Origins of the New York Apartment House," ''Urbanism Past &amp; Present'' (1980) Issue 2, pp 29-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Collins Cromley, ''Alone Together: A History of New York's Early Apartments'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:The Dakota 1880s.jpg|left|180px|thumb|The Dakota luxury apartment building in New York, view from [[Central Park]],  1890]]

Starting with the Stuyvesant luxury apartment house that opened in New York in 1869, and [[The Dakota]] in 1884, affluent tenants discovered that full-time staff handled the upkeep and maintenance, as well as security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Stephen |last = Birmingham|title = Life at the Dakota|date = 1979|publisher = Random House|isbn = 9780394410791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Alpern, ''New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments: With Original Floor Plans from the Dakota, River House, Olympic Tower and Other Great Buildings'' (1987) covers 75 famous buildings starting in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

The less-lavish middle-class apartment buildings provided gas lighting, elevators, good plumbing, central heating, and maintenance men on call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Elizabeth|last = Blackmar|title =Manhattan for Rent, 1785-1850|date =1989 |publisher = Cornell University Press|isbn = 9780801420245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boston contractors build 16,000 "Triple-Deckers" Between 1870 and 1920. They were modern well-equipped buildings with a single large apartments on each floor. Chicago built thousands of apartment buildings, with the upscale ones close to the lake, where it was warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Harris, ''Chicago Apartments: A Century of Lakefront Luxury'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In every city, apartment buildings were built along the paths of the street railways, for the middle-class tenants rode the streetcar to work, while the working class saved a nickel each way and walked.

The working class crowded into tenement houses, with far fewer features and amenities. They were cheap and easy to build, and filled up almost the entire lot. There were typically five story walk-ups, with four separate apartments on each floor. There was minimal air circulation and sunlight. Until the reforms of 1879, New York tenements lacked running water or indoor toilets. Garbage pickup was erratic until late in the 19th century. Rents were cheap for those who could endure the dust, clutter, smells and noises; the only cheaper alternatives were squalid basement rooms in older buildings.  Most of the tenements survived until the urban renewal movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Plunz, ''A History of Housing in New York City: Dwelling Type and Social Change in the American Metropolis'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 47-52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lure of the metropolis===
Jeffersonian America distrusted the city, and rural spokesmen repeatedly warned their young men away.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''The rise of the city'' pp 53-77&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 ''The Evening Wisconsin'' newspaper warned cautious boys to stay on the farm. As paraphrased by historian Bayrd Still, the editor painted a grim contrast:
:Pure milk, wholesome water, mellow fruit, vegetables, and proper sleep and exercise are lacking in the city; and the "dense centers of population are unfavorable to moral growth as they are to  physical development." Sharpness and deception characterize the city merchant, mechanic, and professional man as well. How different is the situation of the "sturdy farmer removed from the dust and smoke and filth and vice of the crowded city....Content in his cottage...why should he long for the fare and follies of the madding crowd in the Gay Metropolis?"
The response came from a Milwaukee newspaper editor in 1871, who boasted that the ambitious young man could not be stopped: 
: The young man in the country no sooner elects for himself his course, than he makes for the nearest town. Scarcely has he grown familiar with his new surroundings, when the subtle attractions of the remoter city begin to tell upon him. There is no resisting it. It draws him like a magnet. Sooner or later, it is tolerably certain, he will be sucked into one of the great centers of life.&lt;ref&gt;Bayrd Still, "Milwaukee, 1870-1900: The Emergence of a Metropolis," ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' (1939) 23#2 pp. 138-162 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4631304 in JSTOR] , quotes at pp 143, and 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformers===
Historians have developed an elaborate typology of reformers in the late 19th century, focusing especially on the urban reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 108-37, 218-220&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mugwumps]] Were reform-minded Republicans who acted at the national level in the 1870s and 1880s, especially in 1884 when they split their ticket for Democrat Grover Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W. McFarland, "The New York mugwumps of 1884: A profile." ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1963): 40-58 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2146666 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Goo Goos" were the local equivalent:  the middle-class reformers who sought "good government" regardless of party.  They typically focused on urban sanitation, better schools, and lower trolley fares for the middle-class commuters. They especially demanded a nonpolitical civil service system to replace the "spoils of victory" approach by which the winners of an election replaced city and school employees. They often formed short-lived citywide organizations, such as The Committee of 70 in New York, the Citizens' Reform Association in Philadelphia, the Citizens' Association of Chicago, and the Baltimore Reform League. They sometimes won citywide elections, but were rarely reelected. Party regulars laughed at them for trying to be independent of the political party machines by forming nonpartisan tickets. The ridicule included suggestions that the reformers were not real men: they were sissies and "mollycoddles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin P. Murphy|title=Political Manhood: Red Bloods, Mollycoddles, and the Politics of Progressive Era Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KZ_tnz6j2EC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2013|publisher=Columbia UP|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, when historians call "structural reformers" were emerging; they were much more successful at reform, and marked the beginning of the [[Progressive era]]. They used national organizations, such as the [[National Municipal League]], and focused on broader principles such as honesty, efficiency, economy, and centralized decision-making by experts.  "Efficiency" was their watchword, they believed one of the problems with the machines was that they wasted enormous amounts of tax money by creating useless patronage jobs and payoffs to mid-level politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, ''The politics of efficiency: Municipal administration and reform in America, 1880-1920'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Social reformers emerged in the 1890s, most famously [[Jane Addams]] Enter large complex network of reformers based at [[Hull House]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kish Sklar, "Hull House in the 1890s: A community of women reformers." ''Signs'' (1985): 658-677 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174308 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; They were less interested in civil service reform or revising the city charter, and concentrated instead on the needs of working class housing, child labor, sanitation and welfare. Protestant churches promoted their own group of reformers, mostly women activists demanding prohibition  or sharp reductions in the baleful influence of the saloon in damaging family finances and causing family violence.  Rural America was increasingly won over by the prohibitionists, but they rarely had success in the larger cities, where they were staunchly opposed by the large German and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;Mohl, ''The New City'' pp 115-33&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] became well organized in cities of every size, and taught middle-class women the techniques of organization, proselytizing, and propaganda. Many of the WCTU veterans graduated into the woman's suffrage movement. Moving relentlessly from West to East, became the vote for women in state after state, and finally nationwide in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Bordin, ''Woman and Temperance: The quest for power and liberty, 1873-1900'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth S. Clemens, "Organizational repertoires and institutional change: Women's groups and the transformation of US politics, 1890-1920." ''American journal of sociology'' (1993): 755-798. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2781235 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

School reform was high on the agenda, since local machine politicians used the jobs in the contracts, promote the party interest, rather than the needs of the students. After examining late 19th century reform movements in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and Chicago, historian [[David Tyack]] concludes that "what the structural reformers wanted to do, then, was to replace a rather mechanical form of public bureaucracy, which was permeated with 'illegitimate' lay influence, with a streamlined 'professional' bureaucracy in which lay control was carefully filtered through a corporate school board.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Tyack, ''The one best system: A history of American urban education'' (1974) p 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanitation and public health ===
{{further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Sanitary conditions were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century. The worst conditions appeared in the largest cities, where the accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, where sewage systems were inadequate, and the water supply was of dubious quality.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Galishoff, ''Newark: the nation's unhealthiest city, 1832-1895'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians took the lead in pointing out problems, and were of two minds on the causes. The older theory of contagion said that germs spread disease, but this theory was increasingly out of fashion by the 1840s or 1850s for two reasons. On the one hand it predicted too much-- microscopes demonstrated so many various microorganisms that there was no particular reason to associate any one of them with a specific disease. There was also a political dimension; a contagious theory of disease called for aggressive public health measures, which meant taxes and regulation the business community rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Neville Bonner, ''Medicine in Chicago: 1850-1950: A chapter in the social and scientific development of a city'' (1957) pp 24-39&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the 1880s, most experts believed in the "[[Miasma theory]]" which attributed the spread of disease to "bad air" caused by the abundance of dirt and animal waste. It indicated the need for regular garbage pickup.  By the 1880s, however, European discovery of the germ theory of disease proved decisive for the medical community, although popular belief never shook the old "bad air" theory.  Medical attention shifted from curing the sick patient to stopping the spread of the disease in the first place.  It indicated a system of quarantines, hospitalization, clean water, and proper sewage disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Martin V. Melosi, ''The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr [[Charles V. Chapin]] (1856-1941), head of public health in Providence Rhode Island, was a tireless campaigner for the germ theory of disease, which he repeatedly validated with his laboratory studies.  Chapin  emphatically told popular audiences germs were the true culprit, not  filth; that diseases were not indiscriminately transmitted through the smelly air; and that disinfection was not a cure-all.  He paid little attention to environmental or chemical hazards in the air and water, or to tobacco smoking, since germs were not involved. They did not become a major concern of the public health movement until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Cassedy, ''Charles V. Chapin and the Public Health Movement'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  The second stage of public health, building on the germ theory, brought in engineers to design elaborate water and sewer systems. Their expertise was welcomed, and many became city managers after that reform was introduced in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley K. Schultz, and Clay McShane. "To engineer the metropolis: sewers, sanitation, and city planning in late-nineteenth-century America." ''Journal of American History'' (1978): 389-411. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894086 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Teaford, ''The Unheralded Triumph: City Government in America, 1870-1900'' (1984) pp 134-41&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century==
In the era 1890-1930, the larger cities were the focus of national attention. The skyscrapers and tourist attractions were widely publicized. Suburbs existed, but they Were largely bedroom communities for commuters to the central city. San Francisco dominated the West, Atlanta dominated the South, Boston dominated New England. Chicago, the nation's railroad hub, dominated the Midwest,  New York City dominated the entire nation in terms of communications, trade, finance, as well as popular culture and high culture. More than a fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Goldfield and Blaine A. Brownell, ''Urban America: A History''(2nd ed. 1990), p 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive era: 1890s–1920s===
During the [[Progressive Era]] a coalition of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts and reformers hostile to the political machines introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste and inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.

The pace was set in Detroit Michigan, where Republican mayor [[Hazen S. Pingree]] first put together the reform coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cities set up municipal reference bureaus to study the budgets and administrative structures of local governments. Progressive mayors were important in many cities,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Finegold, "Traditional Reform, Municipal Populism, and Progressivism," ''Urban Affairs Review'', (1995) 31#1 pp 20–42&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (especially Mayor [[Tom L. Johnson|Tom Johnson]]); [[Toledo, Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. DeMatteo, "The Progressive As Elitist: 'Golden Rule' Jones And The Toledo Charter Reform Campaign of 1901," ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'', (1997) 69#1 pp 8–30&lt;/ref&gt; Jersey City, New Jersey;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Tobin, "The Progressive as Single Taxer: Mark Fagan and the Jersey City Experience, 1900–1917," ''American Journal of Economics &amp; Sociology'', (1974) 33#3  pp 287–298&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]];&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, "Progressive Reform in Los Angeles under Mayor Alexander, 1909–1913," ''California Historical Quarterly,'' (1975) 534#1, pp:37–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Memphis, Tennessee]];&lt;ref&gt;G. Wayne Dowdy, "'A Business Government by a Business Man': E. H. Crump as a Progressive Mayor, 1910–1915," ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly,'' (2001) 60#3 3, pp 162–175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisville, Kentucky]];&lt;ref&gt;William E. Ellis, "Robert Worth Bingham and Louisville Progressivism, 1905–1910," ''Filson Club History Quarterly'', (1980) 54#2 pp 169–195&lt;/ref&gt; and many other cities, especially in the western states. In [[History of Illinois|Illinois]], Governor [[Frank Lowden]] undertook a major reorganization of state government.&lt;ref&gt;William Thomas Hutchinson, ''Lowden of Illinois: the life of Frank O. Lowden'' (1957) vol 2&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin was the stronghold of [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], who led a wing of the Republican Party. His [[Wisconsin Idea]] used the state university as a major source of ideas and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressivism and the Wisconsin Idea|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-036/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most dramatic changes came in [[Galveston, Texas]] were a devastating hurricane and flood overwhelmed the resources of local government. Reformers abolished political parties in municipal elections, and set up a five-man commission of experts to rebuild the city. The Galveston idea was simple, efficient, and much less conducive to corruption. If lessened the Democratic influences of the average voter, but multiplied the influence of the reform minded middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, "The Galveston Plan of City Government by Commission: The Birth of a Progressive Idea." ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' (1975): 365–408.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Galveston plan was quickly copied by many other cities, especially in the West.  By 1914 over 400 cities had nonpartisan elected commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, ''Progressive Cities: The Commission Government Movement in America, 1901–1920'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dayton, Ohio]] Had its great flood in 1913, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political [[city manager]], hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; mechanical engineers were especially preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Couperus,  "The managerial revolution in local government: municipal management and the city manager in the USA and the Netherlands 1900–1940."

=== Urban planning===
{{main|History of urban planning}}
The [[Garden city movement]] was brought over from England and evolved into the "Neighborhood Unit" form of development. In the early 1900s, as cars were introduced to city streets for the first time, residents became increasingly concerned with the number of pedestrians being injured by car traffic. The response, seen first in Radburn, New Jersey, was the Neighborhood Unit-style development, which oriented houses toward a common public path instead of the street. The neighborhood is distinctively organized around a school, with the intention of providing children a safe way to walk to school.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Christensen, ''The American garden city and the new towns movement'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Schaffer, ''Garden Cities for America: The Radburn Experience'' (Temple University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Great Depression ===
{{main|Great Depression in the United States}}
Urban America had enjoyed strong growth and steady prosperity in the 1920s .  Large-scale immigration had ended in 1914, and never fully resumed, so that ethnic communities have become stabilized and Americanized. Upward mobility was the norm, in every sector of the population supported the rapidly growing high school system.  After the stock market crash of October 1929, the nation's optimism suddenly turned negative, with both business investments and private consumption overwhelmed by a deepening pessimism that encouraged people to cut back and reduce their expectations. The economic damage to the cities was most serious in the collapse of 80 to 90 percent of the private sector construction industry.  Cities and states started expanding their own construction programs as early as 1930, and they became a central feature of the New Deal, but private construction did not fully recover until after 1945. Many landlords so their rental income drained away and many went bankrupt. After construction,  came the widespread downturn in heavy industry, especially manufacturing of durable goods such as automobiles, machinery, and refrigerators.  The impact of unemployment was higher in the manufacturing centers in the East and Midwest, and lower in the South and West, which had less manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;William H, Mullins, ''The Depression and the Urban West Coast, 1929-1933: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huts and unemployed, West Houston and Mercer St., Manhattan (NYPL b13668355-482853).jpg|thumb|Huts and unemployed men in New York City, 1935.]]
One visible effect of the depression was the advent of [[Hooverville]]s, which were  ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small rickety wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the Democratic National Committee, who referred sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies he blamed for the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment reached 25 percent in the worst days of 1932-33, but it was unevenly distributed.  Job losses were  less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs.  The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had a hard time getting their first job, and men over the age of 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Jensen, "The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553-583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954  in JSTOR] ; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]&lt;/ref&gt;  City governments in 1930-31 tried to meet the depression by expanding public works projects, as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 men were unable to provide significant additional relief.  They fell back on the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.

The federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by president Roosevelt’s [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis.  The alphabet agencies ERA, CCC, FERA, WPA and PWA built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector.  FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.

The Democrats won easy landslides in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed.  The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholics, Jews, and blacks. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of beer, political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs.  The city machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilize their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief.  FDR won the vote of practically every group in 1936, including  taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However the Protestant middle class voters but turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system.  However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm the out state vote.  The machines came through for him.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere.  Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898–1945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt’s efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and handed the expansion of New Deal ideas.  Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities.  In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored the GOP candidate Wendell Willkie 52%-48%.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, "The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940." ''Ethnicity. An Interdisciplinary Journal of the Study of Ethnic Relations'' (1981) 8#2: 189-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of full-scale war mobilization in the summer of 1940, the economies of the cities rebounded.  Even before Pearl Harbor, Washington pumped massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock  munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Teaford, ''The twentieth-century American city'' (1986) pp 90-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The war brought a restoration of prosperity and hopeful expectations for the future across the nation. It had the greatest impact on the cities of the West Coast, especially Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Lotchin, ''The Bad City in the Good War: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians led by Price Fishback have examined the impact of New Deal spending on improving health conditions in the 114 largest cities, 1929-1937.  They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending  (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide, and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Whaples and Randall E.

The '''Andalusian Center for Marine Science and Technology''' ({{lang-es|Centro Andaluz de Ciencia y Tecnología Marina}}, CACYTMAR) is a joint institute of investigation sponsored by the [[University of Cádiz]] and the Andalusian Council for Education and Science (''Consejería de Educación y Ciencia de la Junta de Andalucía''). It was created as an outcome of the II Plan Andaluz de Investigación, as one of several thematic regional investigative centers. Although it is linked to a specific university, the objective is to bring together and serve all related institutions in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]] working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uca.es/centro/cacytmar/cacytmar/presentacion/presentacion.html Presentación], CACYTMAR (official site). Accessed online 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

CACYTMAR is organized around five major thematic areas: [[oceanography]], coasts, natural resources, environmental quality, and marine technology. It is the umbrella for approximately 30 investigative projects, most of them financed by the ''Plan Nacional de I+D+i'' (National Research and Development Plan), although some are financed by the [[European Union]] or by the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government]]. There are also about 40 contracts for investigation in cooperation with businesses or other administrations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Recently &lt;!-- as of when?--&gt; four services of CACYTMAR have been put in place: the Service of Oceanographic Support,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uca.es/centro/cacytmar/servicios/menu/cacytmar/servicios/apoyo/apoyo.html Apoyo oceanográfico], CACYTMAR (official site).

{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 11th century, [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge|1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Anthropology]] circa 1940 assumed that religion is in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp=122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason=Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date=April 2015}} and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote|Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett|R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1=Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp=122–123 |2a1=Marett |2y=1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection|projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man."{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y=2000 |1pp=225–226 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1996 |2p=67 |3a1=Pandian |3y=1997 |p=507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1=Feuerbach |1y=1841 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4 |3a1=Mackey |3y=2000 |pages=41–42 |4a1=Nelson |4y=1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]],{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} and an early formulation of it is found in ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]], which observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=4}}

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]], building on Feuerbach, considered religion "a projection of the social values of society," "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society," "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson|1990}}&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}

In the 19th century, [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most anthropologists assumed that there was a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], Émile Durkheim, and [[Max Weber]].{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} They are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=4}}{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

== Definition of religion==
One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &amp;ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &amp;ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">'''Architectural determinism''' (also sometimes referred to as [[environmental determinism]] though that term has a broader meaning) is a theory employed in [[urbanism]], sociology and [[environmental psychology]] which claims the [[built environment]] is the chief or even sole determinant of [[social behaviour]]. A. S. Baum defines the notion thus "In its most extreme form, this position argues that the environment causes certain behaviours, denying any interaction between environment and behaviour. Architectural determinism poses the idea that people can adapt to any arrangement of space and that behaviour in a given environment is caused entirely by the characteristics of the environment."&lt;ref&gt;Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioural Science, article on Environmental Psychology, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the concept may be traced in [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Panopticon]] and in the Enlightenment ''[[wikt:bienfaisance|bienfaisance]]'' as expressed in the institutional reform of prisons and hospitals. However the notion only gained generally currency and universal applicability with the rise of [[Behaviourism]], [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] and the utopian social programme of the Modernist architectural movement. The term was first coined by [[Maurice Broady]] in his 1966 paper ''Social theory in Architectural Design'' &lt;ref&gt;Arena:The Architectural Association Journal, 81, 1966 p 149-154&lt;/ref&gt; which also roundly criticised the authoritarian nature of this belief. Few architects have espoused the view that design can control behaviour but it has long been an assumption amongsts urbanists and architects that architecture can limit and channel behaviour in a predictable manner. This weaker, positivist view was articulated by [[Adolf Behne]] when he asserted "you can kill a man with a building just as easily as with an axe."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Sources of architectural form, Mark Gelernter, p251.&lt;/ref&gt; The determinist belief was a contributory factor in the numerous slum clearances of the post War industrialised world (see [[Herbert J. Gans]]). Despite being a widely held, if not always articulated, theory the premise was not sustained by [[social research]], for example the "[[Hawthorne experiments]]" by Mayo at Harvard found no direct correlation between work environment and output. The determinist hypothesis as an explanation of social conduct is now most often referred to in the literature as discredited, yet is still to be found as an argument for [[urban renewal]].&lt;ref&gt;see ''Urban theory, Urban Policy'' [www.psi.org.uk/publications/archivepdfs/Housing/JV3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

==Creative art and fine art==
{{wide image|Wang Ximeng - A Thousand Li of River (Bridge).jpg|1250px|Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling. Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], "Cézanne's Doubt" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the [[art world]]" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]]. It reads "Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious".]]
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques.

Taylor &amp; Francis. 1983. p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Belle Assemblée|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pucAAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|volume=V|year=1808|publisher=J.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# '''Art for social causes.''' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Jeramia |title=RiverKings raising autism awareness with art |url=http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WMC tv |date=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053732/http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |archivedate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art exhibit aims to raise awareness of autism |url=http://www.newsminer.com/article_1a9b7e33-6ca0-56a5-89f3-c9c0798815a2.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Daily News-Miner |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anchorage art exhibit to raise awareness about autism |url=http://dhss.alaska.gov/News/Documents/press/2011/Anchorage_art_exhibit_autism_PR033111.pdf |publisher=Alaska Department of Health and Social Services |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruhl |first=Ashleigh |title=Photographer Seeks Subjects To Help Raise Cancer Awareness |url=http://www.gazettes.com/lifestyle/arts_and_entertainment/photographer-seeks-subjects-to-help-raise-cancer-awareness/article_10291db8-7614-11e2-be53-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Gazettes |date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bra art raising awareness for breast cancer |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/videos/news/national/bra-art-raising-awareness-for-breast-cancer/vgBSm/ |accessdate=22 January 2015 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Marella |title=October art walk aims to raise money, awareness for breast cancer |url=http://gargoyle.flagler.edu/2007/10/october-art-walk-aims-to-raise-money-awareness-for-breast-cancer/ |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Flagler College Gargoyle |date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Students get creative in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness#.USb6vFeIqAg |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WDTN Channel 2 News |date=26 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630141018/http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness%23.UdA8P33LfK5 |archivedate=June 30, 2013}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking to raise awareness at ArtPrize |url=http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WWMT, Newschannel 3 |date=10 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006075346/http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SciCafe – Art/Sci Collision: Raising Ocean Conservation Awareness |url=http://www.amnh.org/calendar/scicafe-art-sci-collision-raising-ocean-conservation-awareness |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in [[Darfur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SMU students raise awareness with 'Art for Darfur' |url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |accessdate=21 February 2003 |newspaper=SMU News Release |date=4 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403085335/http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |archivedate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Greg |title=Red dress art project to raise awareness of murdered and missing Aboriginal women |url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/red+dress+art+project+to+raise+awareness+of+murdered+and+missing+aboriginal+women/6442594504/story.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Global Edmonton |date=3 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raising elder abuse awareness through intergenerational art |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122162638/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathema |first=Paavan |title=Trash to treasure: Turning Mt.

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.&lt;ref name="Tucker2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hugo Tucker|title=Forms of the "medieval" in the "Renaissance": A Multidisciplinary Exploration of a Cultural Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfbNzcqgYM4C|year=2000|publisher=Rookwood Press|isbn=978-1-886365-20-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Griffiths|title=Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20714-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A. Waldie.|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Harris2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan P. Harris|title=Writing Back to Modern Art: After Greenberg, Fried, and Clark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TzAIu3LziIC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kenneth Holt|title=The Search for Aesthetic Meaning in the Visual Arts: The Need for the Aesthetic Tradition in Contemporary Art Theory and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWedB7SA-KMC|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89789-773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Tomkins, p. 186"&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur. "Artifact and Art" in ''Art/Artifact'', edited by Susan Vogel. New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H. Ferguson|authorlink2=Richard W. Mansbach|author2=Richard W. Mansbach|title=A World of Polities: Essays on Global Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adOTAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=20 March 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-98149-5|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bit-logo.jpg|thumb|BIT-Logo]]
'''Biology by Team''' in German ''Biologie im Team'' - is the first Austrian biology contest for Upper Secondary Schools.

Students at upper secondary schools, who are especially interested in biology, can deepen their knowledge and
broaden their competence in experimental biology within the frame work of this contest.
Each year, a team of teachers choose modules of key themes on which students work in the form of a voluntary exercise.
The evaluation focuses in particular on the practical work, and, since the school year 2004/05, also on teamwork. In April, a two-day closing competition takes place, in which six groups of students from participating schools are given various
problems to solve. A jury (persons from the science and corporate communities) evaluate the results and how they are presented.

The concept was developed by a team of teachers in co-operation with the AHS (Academic Secondary Schools) - Department of the Pedagogical Institute in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. 

[[File:Plakatweb.jpg|thumb]]
Since 2008 it is situated at the Science departement of the [http://www.ph-kaernten.ac.at University College of Teacher Training Carinthia].
The first contest in the school year 2002/03 took place under the motto: ''Hell is loose in the ground under us''.
Other themes included ''Beautiful but dangerous'', ''www-worldwide water 1 and 2'', ''Expedition forest'', ''Relationship boxes'', ''Mole's view'', ''Biological timetravel'', ''Biology at the University'', ''Ecce Homo'', Biodiversity, ''Death in tin cans'', ''Sex sells'', ''Without a trace'', ''Biologists see more'' and ''Quo vadis biology?'' 
The theme for the year 2018/19 is ''Biology without limits''?
Till now the following schools were participating:
• BG/BRG Mössingerstraße [[Klagenfurt]]
• BG/BRG St. Martinerstraße [[Villach]]
• BG/BRG Peraustraße [[Villach]]
• Österreichisches Gymnasium [[Prague|Prag]]
• Europagymnasium [[Klagenfurt]]
• BRG Viktring [[Klagenfurt]]
• BORG Wolfsberg [[Wolfsberg, Carinthia|Wolfsberg]]
• Stiftsgymnasium St. Paul im Lavanttal [[St. Paul im Lavanttal]]

BIT was submitted for the [http://www.deutscher-innovationspreis.de/ German Innovations-prize for Sustainable Education] and placed among the 13 „best of"all nominated projects.
With these prerequisites the base concept of „Biology By Team" can be replicated for other science and instructional fields and could provide an important contribution for the improvement of the subject and also team competence of our youth.

BIT - the only Austrian biology competition, enabled 2008 for the first time the Austrian participation at the EUSO - [[European Union Science Olympiad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5613">'''The Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS''' is a Centre of Competence of the [http://www.swiss-academies.ch/index.php Swiss Academies of Arts and Science], based on a mandate in the Swiss federal law on research. It is an advisory body, financed by public money, and devoted to [[technology assessment]]. (The abbreviation «TA» which is used to describe TA-SWISS stands for [[Technology Assessment]], and reflects the activities of the Centre.)

==Mission==
The object of the Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS is to follow technological changes and developments and to identify the social, legal and ethical consequences of new technologies. Another element of its mission is to encourage the discussion of scientific and technological challenges.

The recommendations that result from TA-SWISS projects are used to assist the decision making process, and are intended for the Swiss Parliament and the Federal Council. Depending on the topics covered, these recommendations may also be of interest to other groups, such as professional associations, commercial enterprises, universities and stakeholder groups, as well as public administrations. The media, in their role as disseminators of information, are also kept regularly informed about the activities of TA-SWISS.

TA-Swiss is full member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network&lt;ref&gt;EPTA is a network of those bodies in Europe that are devoted, at least among other tasks, to advise Parliaments, see [http://eptanetwork.org EPTA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a founding member of the German speaking Network NTA (Netzwerk Technikfolgenabschätzung).&lt;ref&gt;NTA is the association of technology assessment institutions and practitioners in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, see [http://www.netzwerk-ta.net NTA homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The activities of the Centre for Technology Assessment TA-SWISS are further divided into two areas:

1. Studies (interdisciplinary scientific analyses)
Recent studies have covered the following topics:

2. Participative projects (consultations aimed at gathering the views of citizens)
Numerous events have been organised within the scope of the participative projects – PubliForums, publifocus and other forms of dialogue, for example:
* publifocus «[https://www.ta-swiss.ch/en/medical-treatments/ Medical treatments]» (2012)
* Dialogue «[https://www.ta-swiss.ch/en/internet-of-the-future/ The Internet and me]» (2010)
* [https://www.ta-swiss.ch/en/wwviews-on-global-warming/ World Wide Views on Global Warming] (2009)
* publifocus [https://www.ta-swiss.ch/en/publifocus-ehealth/ eHealth and the electronic patient file] (2008)

==History==
Experimental beginnings: The Centre for Technology Assessment began its work in 1992. Following a number of parliamentary interventions, the Federal Council assigned the Swiss Science and Technology Council the task of developing a system of technology assessment for Switzerland over a four-year pilot phase (1992–1995).

Institutionalisation of technology assessment: In its Message relating to the promotion of training, research and technology for the years 1996-1999, the Federal Council defined the bases for the institutionalisation and financing of technology assessment in Switzerland. In 1999, technology assessment was firmly fixed in the law on research. In this way, the Federal Council reinforced the independence of TA-SWISS, which until 2007 was affiliated to the Swiss Science and Technology Council.

In 2008 a change in the law on research conferred the legal basis on the incorporation of the mandate for TA-SWISS within the Association of Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences. Accordingly, since 1 January 2008 TA-SWISS has been a Centre for Excellence of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences.

The determination of the overall effectiveness of force employment during military operations. Combat assessment is composed of three major components:
*[[battle damage assessment]] (BDA)
*[[munitions effects assessment]]
*[[reattack recommendation]].

The GS-3 is normally the single point of contact for combat assessment at the joint force level, assisted by the joint force GS-2.

'''Executive education''' (ExEd or Exec. Ed) refers to academic programs at graduate-level [[business school]]s worldwide for executives, business leaders and functional managers. These programs are generally non-credit and non-degree-granting, but sometimes lead to [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s and some offer [[Continuing education unit|continuing education units]] accepted by professional bodies and institutes. Estimates by ''[[Business Week]]'' magazine suggest that executive education in the United States is approximately an $800 million annual business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914060629/http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |archive-date=2011-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 80 percent provided by university-based business schools. Key players in university-based executive education span elite{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} universities, as well as many regional and mid-sized universities and business schools around the world.

Customized programs, which are tailored for and offered to executives of a single company, represent the fastest growing segment of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership by Design, Albert A. Vicere, Robert M. Fulmer, (1998) {{ISBN|0875848311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customized programs help organizations increase management capability by combining the science of business and performance management into specialized programs that enable executives to develop new knowledge, skills and attitudes. Knowledge translates into the capability an organization applies to the products and services it brings to the marketplace. Research shows that a firm with a clearly articulated and understood business and capability strategy will have a higher market-to-book value than a firm that does not.&lt;ref&gt;Maritan C. and Schnatterly K. (2004) [http://www.csom.umn.edu/assets/42582.pdf Intangible Assets as Drivers of Value: Technology, Capabilities and Management Systems].&lt;/ref&gt;

Open enrollment programs also are available as part of university-based executive education offerings, which occur throughout the year on selected dates, and are available to participants from different companies and organizations.

Shorter executive education programs tend to focus on specific roles or industries, or on improving specific [[leadership skills]], such as persuasion, negotiation, [[teambuilding]] or communication.

Some executive education providers offer more comprehensive management training options, such as the modular "Advanced Management Program" (AMP) offered independently by several business schools.

University-based executive education programs, and customized programs in particular, include serious engagement among executives, senior business faculty and researchers who are on the leading edge of business thought and management theory development. It has been noted that “executive education is the toughest classroom there is”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acu.edu.au/staff/our_university/publications/acu_update/2012/issue_1/new_directorate_at_acu|title=New Directorate at ACU|first=|last=Unknown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (besides other academic fields such as the hard sciences or engineering) because time-pressed and demanding executives challenge each other in the classroom as much or more as their professors. The programs are credited{{By whom|date=March 2012}} with offering unique networking and personal career development opportunities for participants, as well as opportunities for universities to build stronger [[alumni network]]s that also benefit younger, traditional MBA program graduates through networking, internships and job opportunities.

Not all observers of university-based executive education are positive. There is some debate about the nature of business school education as a form of professional development. Some believe that university-based executive education has caused some business schools to "lose track of their professional mission." This argument is made by [[Rakesh Khurana]] among others.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Khurana, R. (2007) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8463.html From higher aims to hired hands: The social transformation of American business schools and the unfulfilled promise of management as a profession]. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The genesis of executive education can be traced to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and his 1911 treatise [[Principles of Scientific Management]]. This book described how the application of the scientific method to the management of workers could improve productivity. Taylor's ideas, also known as "Taylorism"&lt;ref name=t&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Anthro/Anth101/taylorism_and_fordism.htm Taylorism and Fordism]. Vanderbilt.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; would become the standard for businesses worldwide.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

On the heels of Taylorism came The [[Alfred P. Sloan]] School of Management, which in 1914 began offering Course XV, Engineering Administration, at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. At that time, the concept of providing business training in the academic environment was gaining popularity, thus MIT created a program “specially designed to train men to be competent managers of businesses that have much to do with engineering problems.” Harvard also began offering short five-week selections of standard MBA material in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;

In 1930 Course XV at [http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php MIT] became an independent department and was named the Department of Business and Engineering Administration. In 1931 an innovative program for executive development was initiated with the backing of several industrialists. This one-year program — offering graduate study in the fundamentals of management and decision-making — was aimed at young managers who were nominated by their employers and was highly competitive. In 1938 the program received full funding by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was formally named the MIT Sloan Fellowship Program for Executive Development at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php History of MIT Sloan – MIT Sloan Newsroom]. Mitsloan.mit.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Education in the United States developed critical mass after World War II. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 — commonly known as the [[GI Bill of Rights]] — allowed veterans to take advantage of education benefits.  Many studied business in college, a privilege previously only enjoyed by the wealthy.&lt;ref name=gibill&gt;[http://www.gibill.va.gov/gi_bill_info/history.htm GI Bill History – U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs]. Gibill.va.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent executive education programs, including the 13-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard University and the four-week Institute for Management at Northwestern University’s School of Commerce (now the Kellogg School of Management), developed in response to the need to rapidly train line executives for general management in the post World War II era.

By the late 1970s nearly 20 business schools in the United States were offering some form of executive education. The science of business also was developing at a rapid pace as faculty, such as [[Michael Porter]] (Harvard ) and [[C. K. Prahalad]] (University of Michigan), published academic papers that changed the way people thought and acted within companies.

Prahalad&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/authors/prahalad C.K. Prahalad – Harvard Business Review]. Hbr.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; is most notably remembered for developing the concepts of “core competencies” and “strategic intent”. These and other respected academic business thinkers — Don Hambrick, Ram Charan, David Ulrich, Michael Hammer, Gary Hamel and many others — are the true pioneers of executive education and the ongoing effort to facilitate wealth creation and other new concepts aimed at making stronger businesses while improving the welfare of the world.

Throughout the 1970s university-based executive education continued to evolve as an industry. Several on-campus residential facilities were constructed at several universities, demonstrating the value of a standalone facility dedicated to executive education programs. This spurred the development of such facilities at schools nationwide and the subsequent expansion of short open enrollment programs. The industry’s exclusive professional association, The International University Consortium for Executive Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniconexed.org|title=Global Consortium for University-Based Executive Education - Unicon|website=UNICON}}&lt;/ref&gt; also came into existence during this period. UNICON began sponsoring a tradeshow in the 1970s for companies interested in learning about university-based executive education and an annual conference for members. UNICON has since grown into a consortium of nearly 100 universities with executive education programs around the globe. It sponsors three annual conferences that allow members to share best practices, conducts research into topics of concern and provides benchmarking data for members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniconexed.org Welcome to UNICON, the International University Consortium for Executive Education]. Uniconexed.org (2007-01-31). Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive education further developed in the 1980s and 1990s as the increasing pace and scope of global business demanded higher levels of education among employees. The [[dot-com bubble|dot-com]] boom further changed the scope of the business landscape by favoring employees and organizations that were quick to adapt to change. As longstanding business concepts became obsolete, continual training was necessary – but earning a degree was not.

In a 1999 survey of 63 programs, the [[University of Michigan Business School]] topped the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/929014|title=University of Michigan Business School|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next survey in 2001, the number of programs had doubled to 121, with a doubling of revenues to $800M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-10-14/a-mid-career-boost|title=A Mid-Career Boost|date=15 October 2001|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the survey, Executive education growth was dramatically impacted by travel restrictions and economic impact of the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Current situation==

The participation of many of the most prestigious universities around the world has enhanced the value of university-based executive education. Ongoing business challenges and opportunities – a dynamic economy, developing technologies, new business models and [[globalization]] – has made the emphasis on learning new concepts throughout ones career a necessity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Despite the growing popularity of university-based executive education around the world, the global economic recession has slowed the industry’s growth during the past few years. According to a 2011 study conducted by the [[Manchester Business School]] in partnership with [[Dubai International Academic City]] and [[Dubai Knowledge Village]], the global economic downturn has had a negative impact on learning and development spending within the Middle East. More than half the respondents noted that spending on executive education had been “significantly” affected, while other organizations agreed that spending had been “somewhat” affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20110228112046?q=TECOM%20Research Significant Number of GCC Companies Yet to Engage in Executive Education, Reveals Manchester Business School-TECOM Research], 28 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A return to higher participation appears to be coming as the economy shows more signs of improvement.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A substantial portion of the organizations surveyed by Manchester Business School said they anticipate executive education spending to moderately increase during the next three years.

The situation is similar in other parts of the world according to a late 2010 state of the industry survey conducted by UNICON,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411000713/http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |archive-date=2011-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that many prestigious universities with executive education programs around the world expect notably higher enrollment during 2011. Sixty-five percent of UNICON survey participants predicted increased participation in their open enrollment programs this year. Additionally, 78 percent of schools projected an increase in customized executive education programs during 2011. Nearly half of the schools surveyed indicated an increase in their number of programming days, now offering up to 39 weeks in open enrollment programs and an average of 49 weeks in custom programs. Slightly more than half also reported increasing the number of days that educational programs for executives are offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html Executive Education in the News – March 4, 2011 – Executive Education Momentum Sign of Economic Recovery, Cindy Bielke, C-change Strategies].

==Rankings==

Executive education rankings are carried out annually by the [[Financial Times]] and by [[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]].

Ranking may be based on aims achieved, % of women, average rank, country, course design, fac. diversity, facilities, faculty, follow-up, food, growth, intl. location, intl. participants, revenues, participants, partner schools, preparation, skills, teaching, and other criteria.

The '''Exploratorium''' is a museum in [[San Francisco]] that allows visitors to explore the world through science, art, and human perception. Its mission is to create inquiry-based experiences that transform learning worldwide. It has been described by the ''New York Times'' as the most important science museum to have opened since the mid-20th century, an achievement attributed to "the nature of its exhibits, its wide-ranging influence and its sophisticated teacher training program".&lt;ref name=Lawlessness&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=An Emphasis on Newton’s Laws (and a Little Lawlessness)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/arts/design/the-new-exploratorium-opens-in-san-francisco.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized as "a mad scientist's penny arcade, a scientific funhouse, and an experimental laboratory all rolled into one",&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Allison|title=A First Look at the New Exploratorium|url=http://www.7x7.com/arts-culture/first-look-new-exploratorium|work=7x7 Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the participatory nature of its exhibits and its self-identification as a center for informal learning has led to it being cited as the prototype for participatory museums around the world.&lt;ref name=Thrill&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothstein|first=Edward|title=The Thrill of Science, Tamed by Agendas|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium was founded by physicist and educator [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and opened in 1969 at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]], its home until January 2, 2013. On April 17, 2013, the Exploratorium reopened at Piers 15 and 17 on San Francisco's [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]. The historic interior and exterior of Pier 15 was renovated extensively prior to the move, and is divided into several galleries mainly separated by content, including the physics of seeing and listening (Light and Sound), Human Behavior, Living Systems, Tinkering (including electricity and magnetism), the Outdoor Gallery, and the Bay Observatory Gallery, which focuses on local environment, weather, and landscape.

Since the museum's founding, over 1,000 participatory exhibits have been created, approximately 600 of which are on the floor at any given time. The exhibit-building workshop space is contained within the museum and is open to view. In addition to the public exhibition space, the Exploratorium has been engaged in the professional development of teachers, science education reform, and the promotion of museums as informal education centers since its founding. Since Oppenheimer's death in 1985, the Exploratorium has expanded into other domains, including its 50,000-page website and two iPad apps on sound and color. It has also inspired an international network of participatory museums working to engage the public with general science education.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium to Show New Face in a New Place|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/science/exploratorium-to-reopen-on-san-francisco-bay-in-2013.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Exploratorium building is also working to showcase environmental sustainability efforts as part of its goal to become the largest net-zero museum in the country.&lt;ref name=SFGateNetZero&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium sets 'Net-Zero' energy goal|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-sets-Net-Zero-energy-goal-4422432.php?t=6a884541ce|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium offers visitors a variety of ways—including exhibits, webcasts, websites and events—to explore and understand the world around them. In 2011, the Exploratorium received the [[National Science Board]] 2011 Public Service Science Award for its contributions to public understanding of science and engineering.&lt;ref name='NSF2011'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119077&amp;org=NSB&amp;from=news | title = San Francisco-based Exploratorium to Receive National Science Board's 2011 Public Service Award | accessdate = 2012-06-20 | date = April 4, 2011 | publisher = [[National Science Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Inside exploratorium.jpg|thumb|left|Exploratorium's main floor, in its original [[Palace of Fine Arts]] location (2009)]]

===Founding and early years===
[[File:Frank Oppenheimer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frank Oppenheimer]], founder of the Exploratorium]]
The Exploratorium is the brainchild of [[Frank Oppenheimer]], an experimental physicist and university professor. Oppenheimer, who worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] with his brother [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], was diverted from an academic career when he was forced to resign from his position at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1949 as a result of an inquiry by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. He was blacklisted from academic positions across the country, and withdrew with his family to run a Colorado [[cattle ranch]] for almost a decade.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|104–115}}

Oppenheimer also began lending a hand with science projects of local high school students, eventually becoming the sole science teacher at the high school in [[Pagosa Springs, Colorado]]. The field trips and experiments he did with his high school students would become a blueprint for the hands-on methods of teaching and learning he would later bring to the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|115–121}}
 
When Oppenheimer was invited to join the University of Colorado's physics department in 1959, he found himself less interested in traditional laboratory research and much more interested in exploring methods of provoking curiosity and inquiry.  He received a grant from the National Science Foundation, which he used to build models of nearly a hundred science experiments.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|136–137}} This "Library of Experiments" would become the core of the Exploratorium exhibit collection, and was the forerunner of the ''Exploratorium Cookbook'', a manual explaining how to build these basic science exhibits.&lt;ref name=Cookbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium Cookbook I: A Construction Manual for Exploratorium Exhibits |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |work=Exploratorium Publications |publisher=The Exploratorium |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423045619/http://www.exploratorium.edu/pubs.net/cookbook1.html |archivedate=April 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced of the need for public museums to supplement science curricula at all levels, he toured Europe and studied museums on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. Three European museums, encountered during that year, served as important influences on the founding of the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.

Back in the United States, Oppenheimer was invited to do the initial planning for a new branch of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], but he turned it down to work on what he called his "San Francisco project". In 1967, the Oppenheimers came to [[San Francisco]] with a view towards opening an independent museum of their own. Oppenheimer sought funding and support for the endeavor using a grassroots approach, bringing a written proposal and some handmade exhibits with him as he visited scientists, businesses, city and school officials, relatives, and friends. Many prominent scientists and cultural figures endorsed the project, and the offers of support in conjunction with a $50,000 grant from the [[San Francisco Foundation]] made the museum realizable.

In late August 1969, the Exploratorium opened with little fanfare at the Palace of Fine Arts. Oppenheimer "simply opened the doors".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152}} Although the building needed many improvements, Oppenheimer couldn't afford to make the changes, and decided to allow the public to come and watch exhibits being built and changes being made as part of the participatory ethos of the institution.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book|title=Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens - Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up|last=[[K.C.

Instead, Oppenheimer insisted that the workshop be placed without a wall, right next to the main entrance so that visitors could experience "the way a shop smells when you burn the wood in a saw, or smell the oil from a lathe".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|156}} Above the workshop was a sign, made by the wife of [[George Gamow]], a physicist, educator, and friend of Oppenheimer who had died just a year before the opening of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|152,157}} The inscription said "Here Is Being Created the Exploratorium a Community Museum Dedicated to Awareness".&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|157}}  (Today, a copy of this motto is inscribed above the main entrance to the new Exploratorium at Pier 15.)

Oppenheimer served as the museum’s director until his death in 1985. Dr. Robert L. White served as director from 1987 to 1990. Dr. [[Goéry Delacôte]] served as executive director from 1991 until 2005.&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;{{cite web|title=Goéry Delacôte: Executive Profile &amp; Biography|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=2309151&amp;privcapId=2221131|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Dennis Bartels served as executive director of the Exploratorium from 2006 to 2016.

===Move to Piers 15 and 17===
The Exploratorium relocated from the Palace of Fine Arts to Piers 15 and 17, located between the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] and [[Pier 39]] along the San Francisco Embarcadero, in April 2013. The Piers location was identified by Goéry Delacôte and then-board chairman Van Kasper as a potential space for relocation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Build"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Build: The Making of a Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-66-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}  In 2005, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution exempting the museum’s 66-year lease of the piers from San Francisco’s competitive bidding process due to its unique nature as a cultural and educational institution.&lt;ref name=Sadiq&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadiq|first=Sheraz|title=Exploratorium Unveils Plans for New Home|url=http://science.kqed.org/quest/2010/10/19/exploratorium-unveils-plans-for-new-home/|work=QUEST|publisher=KQED|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking for the project, which required substantial construction and renovation, occurred on October 19, 2010. The Exploratorium holds a 66-year lease on the piers with the Port of San Francisco. Exhibits are currently only viewable at the  Pier 15 campus; Pier 17 houses some staff, with the option for future expansion.&lt;ref name=Perlman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium in S.F. beginning work on new home|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-in-S-F-beginning-work-on-new-home-3170176.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piers 15 and 17 are historic piers, built in 1931 and 1912 respectively.&lt;ref name="Under"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Under: The World Below the Museum | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-67-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}}    In 1954, the area between the piers was infilled and paved over. This infill was removed as part of the construction phase, restoring the space between the piers to public plazas, a pedestrian bridge, and open water.

==Architecture and design==

===Renovation of Piers 15 and 17===
[[File:Rust wedge.jpg|thumb|upright|Outdoors "Rust Wedge" display shows the enormous expansive force of [[rust|rusting iron]]]]
The Exploratorium campus comprises  {{convert|330,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of indoor and outdoor exhibit space, and includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of freely accessible public space. The exhibits are housed in and around Pier 15, which extends over {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} over the Bay.&lt;ref name=MovingScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Beato|first=Greg|title=The Science of Moving Science Across Town|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/arts/artsspecial/how-the-exploratorium-in-san-francisco-moved-across-town.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 was designed by architecture firm [[EHDD]].&lt;ref name=Breakthrough&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee |first=Lydia |title=Breakthrough at San Francisco's Exploratorium |url=http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |newspaper=The Architect's Newspaper |date=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517153030/http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=4930 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nibbi Brothers served as the General Contractor,&lt;ref name="Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gerfen|first=Katie|title=Exploratorium, Designed by EHDD|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/buildings/exploratorium-designed-by-ehdd_o|accessdate=4 August 2015|newspaper=THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AGA (Architectural Glass and Aluminum)]] as the Glazing Contractor. The piers had been neglected for decades leading up to the Exploratorium’s move, and extensive renovation and repair was required.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Nearly two thirds of the [[piling]]s under Pier 15 were repaired, including almost every piling needed to provide structural integrity, and new pilings were sunk.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The removal of the parking lot between the piers was done slowly over the two years of construction, and the debris from the removal was captured and recycled.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} Several pilings were left in the water between the piers, both for aesthetic reasons and to support future exhibits.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

An effort was made in the construction of the new location to preserve the historic elements of Pier 15.  The Bay Observatory was the only new structure added to the site. The east end of the pier was cleaned of [[lead paint]], revealing historic lettering underneath; designers chose to preserve the lettering rather than paint it over.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|67}} As a result, the traces of the shipping lines that originally frequented the pier can still be seen. Some of the preservation efforts presented challenges in design, however; historic windows created energy losses that had to be offset elsewhere, and the historic interior trusswork was mainly restored rather than removed, meaning that the upper-level staff offices had to be built around them.&lt;ref name="Sustain"&gt;{{cite book | last = Woolsey | first = Kristina| title = Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit | publisher = Exploratorium | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-943451-68-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

Other challenges to the design of the facilities were presented by the museum’s sustainability initiatives. The use of natural light whenever possible challenged exhibit designers relying on carefully controlled light levels; this was solved by using curtains and glare-reducing paint colors.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Other conflicts between construction and energy use included the glass in the Observatory, which would have presented a problem in cooling the building on warm days. This was overcome by adding fritted glass to the windows in thin horizontal lines through the panes to decrease the transparency without affecting the views.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The fritting also makes the reflective surfaces of the Bay Observatory safe for birds.&lt;ref name=TakingFlight&gt;{{cite news|last=Schreiber |first=Dan |title=Bird-safe building standards taking flight in San Francisco |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |accessdate=May 23, 2013 |newspaper=The San Francisco Examiner |date=June 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908200100/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/06/bird-safe-building-standards-taking-flight |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pier 15 incorporated two seismic joints as part of its [[seismic retrofit]], one separating the Bay Observatory from the Pier 15 shed and the other separating the entire pier from the land. This second joint ensures that the entire pier will move independently from the land mass in the event of an earthquake, significantly reducing the potential [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] stress.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The café at the west end of the Exploratorium is named the Seismic Joint in honor of the joint, which cuts through the area of the building where the café is situated.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

The aesthetic of the project was defined as "industrial naval chic" in keeping with the pier’s history.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt;{{rp|63}}

===Restaurant===
[[File:Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|The design scheme for the Exploratorium's Seaglass Restaurant was inspired by the exhibit ''Color of Water''.]]
The design aesthetic for both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass Restaurant was created by designer Olle Lundberg and based on the exhibit ''Color of Water''. The bar at Seaglass features a specially designed version of Exploratorium artist Shawn Lani’s exhibit ''Icy Bodies''.&lt;ref name=Feasters&gt;{{cite web|last=Meier-Johnson|first=Pat|title=Seaglass Restaurant at the Exploratorium: A Sense for the Feasters|url=http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|work=The Connected Traveler|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204423/http://connectedtraveler.com/index.php/travel-tech/science/307-san-francisco-exploratorium-has-a-sense-for-the-feast|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LorettaKeller&gt;{{cite web|last=Pape|first=Allie|title=Loretta Keller's Exploratorium Duo to Open April 17|url=http://sf.eater.com/archives/2013/03/25/loretta_kellers_exploratorium_restaurants_to_open_april_17.php|work=SF Eater|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a net-zero energy goal as part of its overall sustainability efforts. Setting this net-zero goal means that, while in operation, The Exploratorium will produce more energy on-site than it will consume on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawley|first1=Drury B.|last2=Torcellini|first2=Paul A., Ph.D., P.E.|title=Understanding Zero-Energy Buildings|journal=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.|date=September 2006|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum highlights its sustainability efforts in visible ways throughout the museum as part of a stated intention to lead by example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=22|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TruongEcoFriendly&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Landmark museum to reopen as most energy-efficient institute on Earth|url=https://news.yahoo.com/landmark-museum-to-reopen-as-most-eco-friendly-institute-on-earth-195905286.html|work=Yahoo!

The Exploratorium, in order to reach its net-zero energy goal, produces energy with a roof-mounted array of [[photovoltaics]].  There are 5,874 PV modules on the roof, totaling {{convert|78,712|sqft|m2}}, with a projected year-1 yield of 1.3 MW-AC/square foot (13.9 MW-AC/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or a total year-1 yield of 2,113,715 kWh.&lt;ref name="Sustain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Fact Sheet: Environmentally Conscious Inside and Out|url=http://www.ehdd.com/sites/ehdd2/images/6275/Exploratorium%20Sustainability%20Project%20Sheet.pdf|website=EHDD Architecture|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any surplus energy generated is intended to be fed back into the utility grid, as the projected annual energy use for the building totals at 1,275,936 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium's Net-Zero Energy Goal for New Waterfront Home 2013|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratoriums-net-zero-energy-goal-new-waterfront-home-2013|website=Exploratorium|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abellon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon, P.E.|first1=Devin A.|title=Exploratorium's New Waterfront Home Features Innovative Radiant System Using SF Bay Water|url=http://uponor.media-resources-ordp.com/casestudies/exploratorium.shtml|website=Uponor, Inc.|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schematic diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium, San Francisco.png|thumbnail|right|Diagram of bay water heating and cooling system at The Exploratorium]]
In addition to solar power, the museum makes use of an [[HVAC]] system that takes advantage of the relatively constant, moderate temperature of the bay water under the piers, which is {{convert|50|to|65|F|C}}, to heat and cool the building. The bay water is filtered and sterilized before it is brought into a {{convert|4,000|USgal|m3}} cistern below the pier, where it is held for use.  When needed, the bay water is moved to a titanium [[heat exchanger]], of which the building has two, where it is either used to heat or cool water that is cycled through a system of thermally activated radiant slabs.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abellon|first1=Devin|title=Exploring Every Possibility|url=http://www.edcmag.com/articles/95153-the-exploratorium-at-pier-15|website=EDC: The Official Magazine for the LEED Professional|publisher=BNP Media|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are {{convert|27|mi|km}} of plastic tubing in the [[radiant heating]] system in the floor, creating 82 different heating and cooling zones with distinct control systems.&lt;ref name="Build" /&gt; After the bay water passes through the heat exchangers, it is returned to the San Francisco Bay as allowed by a permit issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORDER NO. R2-2010-0082|url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/sanfranciscobay/board_decisions/adopted_orders/2010/R2-2010-0082.pdf|website=California Environmental Protection Agency: State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=California Regional Water Quality Control Board: San Francisco Bay Region|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the energy savings are expected to come from using the bay water as a [[heat sink]] for the building’s cooling needs.  When the temperature of the bay water is below that of the chilled water return from the radiant pipes, which is the case for most of the year in the Bay Area’s temperate climate, the system works in waterside [[economizer]] mode.  In this mode, the cooling loads are met either entirely or partially through passive heat exchange between the colder bay water and the warmer return water, greatly reducing the building’s energy needs.&lt;ref name=Abellon /&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 has a separate system for its ventilation needs, pairing a [[dedicated outdoor air system]] (DOAS) with [[displacement ventilation]] distribution to bring outdoor air into the building.  By integrating radiant heating and cooling and displacement ventilation, the Exploratorium has greatly reduced the portion of its HVAC system that relies on forced air.  Reducing the size of a building’s forced air system has the associated benefits of both lower energy loads as well as reduced ductwork, both of which are cost-saving.&lt;ref name="Exploring Every Possibility"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Straube|first1=John|title=The Perfect HVAC|url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/insights/bsi-022-the-perfect-hvac|website=Building Science Corporation|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has multiple features designed to reduce its water consumption.  Two large cisterns under the structural beams connecting the southeast pilings capture up to {{convert|338,000|USgal|m3}} of rainwater and fog runoff for reuse in the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|date=2012|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=17|url=http://lmngroup.pikibox.com/pikibox.com/lmngroup/uploads/sustain.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plumbing is designed for water conservation, with [[waterless urinal]]s and [[dual-flush toilet]]s projected to save an annual million gallons of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolsey|first1=Kristina|title=Sustain: The Museum as Exhibit|publisher=The Exploratorium|isbn=978-0-943451-68-8|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the bay water heating and cooling system is estimated to save two million gallons of potable water a year by eliminating the need for traditional evaporative cooling towers.&lt;ref name="ehdd.com"/&gt;

The Exploratorium at Pier 15 also makes use of natural light in the effort to reduce energy loads.  The existing building had many clerestory windows and an overhead skylight that runs the length of the interior space.  In compliance with historic preservation requirements, the building’s façade was left mostly unchanged, allowing for much of the interior space to benefit from the existing architecture’s ample daylight.  The retrofit did include the addition of high performance glazing to the existing windows.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerfen|first1=Katie|title=Exploratorium|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/cultural-projects/exploratorium.aspx|website=Architect Magazine: The Magazine of the American Institute of Architects|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Young|first1=Mignon|title=Sustainability Around The Bay|url=http://www.gabreport.com/2014/05/sustainability-around-the-bay|website=GAB: Green Architecture and Building Report|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the Exploratorium was awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum certification.&lt;ref name="USGBC Scorecard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploratorium at Piers 15/17 LEED Scorecard|url=http://www.usgbc.org/projects/exploratorium-piers-1517|website=US Green Building Council|publisher=US Green Building Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "After a two-year post-opening shakedown period of monitoring and adjusting the systems, the Exploratorium hopes to become the largest net-zero-energy-use museum in the United States and possibly the world."&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Christopher|title=A San Francisco Museum, Reborn on the Bay|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/travel/a-san-francisco-museum-reborn-on-the-bay.html|accessdate=2013-08-07|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also turning its commitment to sustainability into a learning experience by showcasing elements of the building’s green design on site.&lt;ref name=Sustain /&gt;

==Layout==
The new site contains over 600 exhibits, 25% of which were developed specifically for the Pier 15 site. With the exception of some art installations, all exhibits are developed and made onsite.&lt;ref name=OpensApril10&gt;{{cite news|last=Perlman|first=David|title=Exploratorium opens April 10 at Pier 15|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Exploratorium-opens-April-10-at-Pier-15-4430723.php|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indoor and outdoor spaces are divided into six galleries, each highlighting a specific content group. Many exhibits are mobile, however, and move among different galleries; similarly, not all exhibits fall into distinct categories.

Exhibits cover a range of subject areas, including [[human perception]] (such as vision, hearing, learning and cognition), the life sciences, physical phenomena (such as light, motion, electricity, waves and resonance, and magnetism), local environment (water, wind, fog, rain, sun, and other elements, as well as cityscape, landscape, and the flora and fauna of the Bay) and human behavior (such as cooperation, competition, and sharing).&lt;ref name=MuseumGalleries&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Galleries|url=http://exploratorium.edu/visit/galleries/|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osher West Gallery: Human Behavior===
[[File:Blowing Smoke.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors collaborate to make a [[smoke ring]] at the Exploratorium's previous location at the Palace of Fine Arts]]
The West Gallery focuses on human behavior.  Its signage and exhibits encourage visitors to play with perception; investigate memory, emotion, and judgment; and experiment with how people cooperate, compete, and share. It holds exhibits such as ''Poker Face'' (partners try to assess when someone is bluffing), ''Trust Fountain'' (an experimental exhibit from the museum’s [[National Science Foundation]]-funded Science of Sharing project, this two-person drinking fountain is based on the [[Prisoner’s dilemma]], a classic scenario centering on negotiation and trust),&lt;ref name=GalleriesExhibits&gt;{{cite web|title=Galleries and Exhibit Highlights|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/galleries-and-exhibit-highlights|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Tactile Dome'', a pitch-black environment visitors explore by touch, which was originally designed by [[August Coppola]].&lt;ref name=Coppola&gt;{{cite web|last=Barmann|first=Jay|title=August Coppola, Brother of Francis, Creator of Tactile Dome, Dies at 75|url=http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|work=SFist.com|accessdate=12 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813044417/http://sfist.com/2009/11/04/august_coppola_brother_of_francis_c.php|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Gallery also included the temporary exhibition ''The Changing Face of What is Normal: Mental Health'', which showcased the personal artifacts of patients from the now-decommissioned Willard Psychiatric Center,&lt;ref name=Lawlessness /&gt; which was on view through April 2014.

The West Gallery also houses the Kanbar Forum, a cabaret-style theater that will host music events, science lectures, and other programs when it opens in summer 2013.&lt;ref name=sparkling&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Heather|title=San Francisco's Exploratorium opens in sparkling new home|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/tech/innovation/new-exploratorium|work=CNN|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Gallery: Tinkering===
The South Gallery is a workshop area where visitors can engage in learning through [[maker movement|hands-on making]], located directly across from the Exploratorium's own internal exhibit workshop, which is also open to their view. Oppenheimer wanted visitors to be able to “smell the oil”, and insisted that the usually hidden exhibit-building activities be on display as an exhibit in its own right.&lt;ref name=shrine&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Exploratorium Reborn: Inside San Francisco's New Innovation Shrine|url=https://gizmodo.com/5994274/exploratorium-reborn-inside-san-franciscos-new-shrine-to-innovation|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exhibits in the South Gallery highlight a [[DIY]] aesthetic, and include ''Animation Stations'' where visitors can make their own [[stop motion|stop-motion films]].

Artworks on display include the ''Tinkerer’s Clock'' (a 22-foot-high clock constructed by artist [[Tim Hunkin]], with figurines in his noted cartoon style that can be manipulated by visitors and unfold into a clockface on the hour); and ''Rolling Through The Bay'' (a sculpture made by artist Scott Weaver over the course of 37 years, utilizing over 100,000 toothpicks and depicting many of the Bay Area’s iconic landmarks, through which a ping-pong ball can roll on one of several different "tours").&lt;ref name=rolling&gt;{{cite web|last=Koh|first=Barbara|title=At the Exploratorium – Scott Weaver’s Amazing Toothpick Art|url=http://sanfrancisco.about.com/od/sfevents/p/At-The-Exploratorium-Scott-Weavers-Amazing-Toothpick-Art.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bechtel Central Gallery: Seeing and Listening===
[[File:Giant Mirror at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|A visitor investigates the reflective properties of the Giant Mirror in the Central Gallery of the Exploratorium at Pier 15.]]
The Bechtel Central gallery houses many of the "classic" Exploratorium exhibits, including many of those that have been on display since the very earliest years of the museum.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; It includes a mix of new and old exhibits that investigate physics and the perception of light, color, and sound, such as ''Sound Bite'' (a demonstration of hearing with the jawbone instead of the ears) and ''Bright Black'' (a trick of perception convinces viewers that an object is white when it is almost entirely black).

===East Gallery: Living Systems===
The East Gallery houses a much-expanded selection of life sciences exhibits. Many exhibits relate directly to the immediate local environment, such as the ''Glass Settling Plate'' (barnacles and other creatures are grown on a plate in the Bay, then put live under a mobile microscope to be observed from both above and below) and the ''Algae Chandelier'' (visitors can pump air to nourish overhead tanks of colorful phytoplankton). Other exhibits explore different biological systems and processes, such as the imaging station with mouse stem cells, the live cow’s eye dissections, and the ''Live Chicken Embryo'' (one of the oldest of the Living Systems exhibits, showing live chicken embryos at different stages of development).&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|title=San Francisco Exploratorium shows off its huge new digs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57579443-1/san-francisco-exploratorium-shows-off-its-huge-new-digs/|work=CNET|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery===
The Bay Observatory building is the only new building constructed on the Exploratorium’s campus. It holds the Seaglass restaurant on its lower level and exhibits on the upper level relating to the waterfront and the cityscape. The gallery focuses on what visitors can see in real time, including the movement of clouds and tides, the changing waterfront, the movement of ships, and interpretation of oceanographic data. The Observatory has glass walls on all four sides to facilitate observation. Many of the exhibits were developed specifically for the location, such as ''Oculus'' (a circular opening in the ceiling that allows the entire gallery to be used as a timepiece, tracking seasons, solstices, and the sun’s movement), ''Visualizing the Bay'' (a 3-D topographic map of the Bay Area that allows visitors to see real data mapped over the landscape, such as the movement of fog and the salinity of the Bay over the course of days or years), and the ''Map Table'' (an assortment of historic and contemporary maps and atlases displaying different views and perspectives on the landscape).&lt;ref name=eyes&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkes|first=Alison|title=The Exploratorium’s new eyes on the bay|url=http://baynature.org/2013/04/18/the-exploratoriums-new-eyes-on-the-bay/|work=Bay Nature Magazine|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay Observatory also houses the Wired Pier project, which consists of more than a dozen sensors on and around the Bay Observatory that stream real-time data about the surrounding environment, such as quality of air and bay water, weather, tides and pollution, and compile it into interactive visualizations.&lt;ref name=Plutchak&gt;{{cite web|last=Plutchak|first=Rochelle|title=NOAA Science Has  Home at the New Exploratorium|url=http://research.noaa.gov/InDepth/Features/CurrentFeature/TabId/728/ArtMID/1884/ArticleID/10044/NOAA-Science-Has-a-Home-at-the-New-Exploratorium.aspx|work=National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Website|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor Gallery===
[[File:Fog Bridge at the Exploratorium.jpeg|thumb|Mist from Fujiko Nakaya’s Fog Bridge drifts over the water between Piers 15 and 17 at the Exploratorium.]]
The Outdoor Gallery comprises the north, south, and east aprons of Pier 15, and extends through both ticketed and unticketed space. Focus is on direct interaction with the Bay environment, which can be seen in exhibits such as ''Color of Water'' (an installation of 32 distinct [[Textile sample|color swatches]] suspended below the rail surrounding the pier so that visitors can investigate the changing colors of the Bay’s water). Another notable exhibit is ''Remote Rains'', which allows visitors to choose a past rainstorm as profiled by the Hydrometeorology Testbed, which is then recreated by a rain machine that duplicates the frequency, size, and velocity of the raindrops, giving a tangible experience of [[NOAA]] research data on storms.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300M digs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130410/us-travel-san-francisco-new-exploratorium/|work=Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the publicly accessible bridge connecting Piers 15 and 17, artist [[Fujiko Nakaya]] created an installation called ''Fog Bridge #72494'' that creates bursts of fog for six minutes every half-hour as the first in a series of large-scale temporary installations called ''Over the Water''.&lt;ref name=overthewater&gt;{{cite web|title=Over the Water|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/over-the-water|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Fog Bridge'' is {{convert|150|ft|m}} long and makes use of 800 nozzles to create the fog, which Nakaya hopes will inspire visitors to pay attention to the nature of one of San Francisco’s best-known weather patterns.  Although originally slated to be temporary, it is now on permanent display. A desalination system, located in Pier 17, conditions bay water for use in the artwork. &lt;ref name=Aleta&gt;{{cite web|last=Aleta|first=George|title=An Artist Creates Artificial Fog in San Francisco|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/artscience/2013/04/an-artist-creates-artificial-fog-in-san-francisco|work=Smithsonian Magazine Blog|accessdate=12 June 2013|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miranda" /&gt;

===Public space===
The Exploratorium campus includes {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} of publicly accessible open space. This includes the plaza facing on the Embarcadero, the connector bridge between Piers 15 and 17 where ''Fog Bridge # 72494'' is installed, the south apron of Pier 17, and the east and south aprons of Pier 15. This public space overlaps with the Outdoor Gallery, and includes some notable exhibits, such as the ''Aeolian Harp'' (an expanded version of the original installation by Doug Hollis on the roof of the Exploratorium at the Palace of Fine Arts, first created in collaboration with Frank Oppenheimer in 1976)&lt;ref name=aeolian&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeolian Harp|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/aeolian-harp|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''Bay Windows'' (visitors spin disks filled with samples of Bay mud, sand, and gravel gathered from five distinct regions of the Bay itself).&lt;ref name=baywindows&gt;{{cite web|title=Bay Windows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/outdoor-gallery/bay-windows|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restaurant===
The lower level of the Bay Observatory Building houses the Seaglass Restaurant, which, like the Seismic Joint Cafe, is open to unticketed members of the public. Both the Seismic Joint and Seaglass are run by Loretta Keller, chef-owner at Coco500, in partnership with Bon Appetit Management Company.

==Educational programs==
The Exploratorium seeks to bring hands-on inquiry to education, including training teachers in the teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;

===Teacher Institute===
[[File:Exploratorium teachers.jpg|thumb|right|Teachers from the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute examine the "String Thing" they built]]
The Teacher Institute, founded in 1984, is an Exploratorium-based professional development program geared towards middle and high school science teachers. In addition to providing workshops at the museum that teach hands-on and inquiry-based teaching methods, it provides coaches and support for novice teachers. Studies have shown that while 30 to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within five years, the retention rate for teachers who go through the Teacher Institute is 85 to 90 percent.&lt;ref name=Olney&gt;{{cite news|last=Olney|first=Jennifer|title=Teachers participate in intense training program|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/focus_on_solutions&amp;id=8775413|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=KGO-TV|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Teacher Institute is also home to the [[Iron Science Teacher]], a national competition that celebrates innovation and creativity in science teaching, which originated at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Parodying the cult Japanese TV program, ''[[Iron Chef]]'', this competition showcases science teachers as they devise classroom activities using a particular ingredient — an everyday item such as a plastic bag, milk carton, or nail. Contestants are currently or formerly part of the Exploratorium's Teacher Institute and compete before a live audience for the title of "Iron Science Teacher". Shows are also archived on the Exploratorium's website.&lt;ref name=IronScience&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Theresa|title='Iron Science Teacher' competitors at Exploratorium use museum paper as secret ingredient in fun demos|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_20993010/iron-science-teacher-competitors-at-exploratorium-use-museum|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Jose Mercury News|date=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two out of three teachers applying were being turned away due to space limitations, by the time the Exploratorium closed at its former location; following the move to the Piers, the Exploratorium has been expanding its professional development for teachers through the Teacher Institute.&lt;ref name=Olney /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, two [[MOOC]] courses were also being made available through MOOC provider [[Coursera]]. One course integrates engineering into middle and high school [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]] classrooms, and the other integrates [[maker movement|making and tinkering activities]] into elementary and middle school classrooms.&lt;ref name=Coursera&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Booker|title=Coursera Online Hub Offers Teachers Development|url=http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|work=InformationWeek|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=May 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615031051/http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/coursera-online-hub-offers-teachers-deve/240153995|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning programs===
The Exploratorium operates several programs centering on informal learning. The Institute for Inquiry (IFI) is a professional development program of the Exploratorium geared towards educators, scientists, administrators, and policymakers. The Institute is a recipient of National Science Foundation funding and designs programs, materials and tools to help leaders in the science education community further the role of inquiry in elementary science education and strengthen reform efforts. It consists of workshops and an online library of resources available to participants in the Institute.&lt;ref name=IFI&gt;{{Cite report |author=Inverness Research Associates |authorlink= |date=June 2001 |title=Report: The Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry Four Cornerstone Claims|url=http://www.inverness-research.org/reports/2001-11-ExplorIFI-4CornerstnClaims/2001-11-Rpt-ExploratrmIFI_4CornerstnClaims-Execsum.PDF |publisher=Inverness Research |page=ii |docket= |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Inquiry partnered with the [[Sonoma Valley Unified School District]] on a program combining science education with [[English Language Development]] (ELD). Data from the two-year pilot study showed that a professional development program designed to help teachers integrate ELD strategies into science lessons had a significant, measurable impact on the achievement of students in both ELD and in science.&lt;ref name=innovation&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Narrative: Integrating English Language Development and Science: A Professional Development Approach|url=http://www2.ed.gov/programs/innovation/2010/narratives/u396c100434.pdf|work=Investing in Innovation Fund Website|publisher=US Department of Education|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) is a collaboration between the Exploratorium, the [[University of California Santa Cruz]], and [[King's College London]]. CILS studies the intersection between museums and schools as centers of informal learning with the intention of understanding how informal science learning occurs and how informal educational centers such as the Exploratorium can contribute to science education reform.&lt;ref name=CILS&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Details: Center for Informal Learning and Schools|url=http://informalscience.org/projects/ic-000-000-001-775/Center_for_Informal_Learning_and_Schools|work=Informal Science|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tinkering Studio began in 2008 as an in-house program geared towards [[maker culture]] and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within the museum in a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free do-it-yourself activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of educators in afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar programs across the globe,&lt;ref name=tinkering&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie|first=Julian|title=Exploratorium's Tinkering Studio makes science fun|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Exploratorium-s-Tinkering-Studio-makes-science-fun-2295556.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=mideast&gt;{{cite news|last=Raker|first=Silva|title=Exploratorium expanding minds in Mideast|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Exploratorium-expanding-minds-in-Mideast-4395559.php|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, in collaboration with the Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the [[Discovery Science Center]], the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.&lt;ref name=cwsnetwork&gt;{{Cite report |last1=Michalchik |first1=Vera|last2=Remold|first2=Julie|last3=Verdugo |first3=Renato|date=March 2013 |title=California Tinkering Afterschool Network Pilot Year Evaluation Report |url=http://cswnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/CA-Tinkering-Afterschool-Network-Evaluation-Report-FINAL.pdf |publisher=SRI International |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium also houses a number of other educational resources. These include the Learning Commons, a library and media resource center that houses a collection of print and digital science teaching resources for use by regional educators; a webcast studio, located in the Central Gallery, which produces 75 educational Webcasts from the museum and locations around the world annually, including a live webcast of the Mars [[Curiosity Rover]] launch and landing; and Lifelong Learning, which creates educational programming for children, teens, family groups, and adults. Lifelong Learning programs further the Exploratorium’s stated dedication to informal learning and the museum as teaching tool, and include day camps, workshops for families, the Homeschool Science series (in-house classes geared specifically towards homeschooled students), the Girl’s Science Institute (multi-day workshops geared towards girls 9-11), and excursions for adults. The Exploratorium has also published a number of books, and many of the 50,000 pages on its website are hands-on activity ideas or science experiments in the museums’ signature open-ended style.

===Educational outreach===
The Exploratorium operates several educational outreach programs. The Community Outreach Program works with community organizations to provide exhibit-based educational activities for underserved children and families in the local community.&lt;ref name=tecolote&gt;{{cite news|last=Leibrich|first=Ryan|title=New Exploratorium location opens its doors|url=http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|accessdate=17 June 2013|newspaper=El Tecolote|date=April 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615204600/http://eltecolote.org/content/new-exploratorium-location-opens-its-doors/2013/04/25/|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Exploratorium is also home to XTech, a science education program for underserved middle school students. Begun in 2006, XTech was primarily funded by a National Science Foundation grant and provided afterschool activities in science, engineering, and technology in partnership with two community-based organizations in the Bay Area. XTech serves over 100 students a year in addition to 10-15 youth facilitators.&lt;ref name=xtech&gt;{{Cite report|last1=Carroll |first1=Becky |last2=Castori |first2=Pam |last3=Smith |first3=Anita |date=September 2009 |title=The Exploratorium's XTech Program: Engaging STEM Experiences for Middle School Youth |url=http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |publisher=Inverness Research |page=1 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133042/http://informalscience.org/images/evaluation/2009-09_Rpt_XTECH-SummRpt-final-1019-2009.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explainers===
The Exploratorium Explainer program, which has been operating since the museum opened, hires and trains high school students and young educators each year. The program tripled its capacity, hiring 300 Explainers, following the relocation to Pier 15 in 2013.&lt;ref name=KTVU&gt;{{cite news|title=SF Exploratorium set to open in new $300 million waterfront facility |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk |accessdate=18 June 2013 |newspaper=KTVU |date=April 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411173430/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/sf-exploratorium-set-open-new-300-million-digs/nXHLk/ |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Explainers function essentially as docents. There are two types of Explainers: High School Explainers, who are teenagers, and Field Trip Explainers, who are college students and young educators. The program was conceived by Frank Oppenheimer in the early days of the museum. He wanted to provide a visitor experience that was a learning experience in a museum context&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{Cite thesis|type=PhD |title=Explainers' development of science-learner identities through participation in a community of practice |url=http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615204432/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?acc_num=antioch1327711877 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2013 |last=Richardson |first=Anne |year=2011 |publisher=Antioch University |accessdate=17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed for guesswork and the absence of "correct" answers. He felt young people would be more capable than adults at conveying the open-ended experience he was looking for. His plan with the Explainers was to "loosen up the whole feeling of learning." Oppenheimer also intended the program to allow students to experience learning outside the framework of their school systems. The Explainers come from a highly diverse array of socioeconomic backgrounds, and he hoped they would bring families and friends who would not otherwise be likely to visit a museum.&lt;ref name=Cole /&gt;{{rp|169–174}} Both the High School and Field Trip Explainers are paid positions.

The Explainer Program was inspired by the staff demonstrations Frank observed at the Palais de la Decouverte, although the facilitators at the Palais when Oppenheimer visited were either graduate students or practicing scientists. The success of the Exploratorium’s Explainer program led the Palais to eventually hire teenage explainers of their own.&lt;ref name=ASTC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duensing|first=Sally|title=Exporting the Exploratorium:  Creating a "Culture of Learning"|journal=ASTC Dimensions|date=November–December 1999|url=http://www.astc.org/pubs/dimensions/1999/nov-dec/exporting.htm|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Explainers often cite their experiences at the Exploratorium as defining elements of their success,&lt;ref name=Hamlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamlin|first=Jesse|title=Learning From Teaching at the Exploratorium / Student guides' lessons went beyond science|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Learning-From-Teaching-at-the-Exploratorium-2914198.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=August 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; including several notable tech CEOs.&lt;ref name=verisign&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan|title=Profile of VeriSign chairman, CEO|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Linda|title=Backyard science today, an innovative workforce tomorrow|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/backyard-science-today-an-innovative-workforce-tomorrow|work=The National|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
[[File:Walter Kitundu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Kitundu]] - Artist in Residence and MacArthur Fellow]]
Despite being generally thought of as a science museum, the Exploratorium has always incorporated both science and art. As early as 1966, Frank Oppenheimer presented a paper discussing the connections between art and science, and the role of a museum in appealing to both casual visitors and serious students of all ages.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;{{rp|142}}

The formal artist in residence program was started in 1974,&lt;ref name=AIR&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist-in-Residence Program|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/arts/artist-residence|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but artworks such as Bob Miller’s ''Sun Painting'' were commissioned shortly after the museum was opened in 1969.&lt;ref name=BobMiller&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Miller|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers/bob-miller|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the founding of the artist in residence program, over 250 artworks in various disciplines have been created.

Each year, the museum invites ten to twenty artists to participate in residencies ranging from two weeks to two years. Artists-in-residence work with staff and the visiting public to create original installations, exhibits, or performances. Artists are given a stipend, housing, travel expenses, and technical support, and they have at their disposal the Exploratorium's full array of metal and woodworking shops and materials. Two artists-in-residence who went on to become staff members have been awarded [[MacArthur Fellowship]] "genius" grants: [[Walter Kitundu]] and [[Ned Kahn]].

The new Embarcadero campus opened with more than 40 pieces by prominent artists, including Douglas Hollis, [[Golan Levin]], [[Lucky Dragons]], [[Amy Balkin]], and [[Fujiko Nakaya]]. The Center for Art and Inquiry, a new project at the new location, is an initiative to catalyze and orchestrate art across the museum.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite web|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|title=Painting the Sun and Sculpting Fog|url=http://www.artnews.com/2013/03/20/the-new-exploratorium/|work=ARTnews|accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Artful Science from Sunny California |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13318084.300-review-artful-science-from-sunny-california-.html |author = Peter Turvey|volume = |work= [[New Scientist]] |date = 1992-02-15 |accessdate = 2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium has an equally long history with musical, film and other performances. Participating artists and performers included [[Laurie Anderson]], [[John Cage]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Trimpin]], and [[The Mermen]].&lt;ref name=Speakingofmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking of Music|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/40th/podcasts.php|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the artists in residence, the museum’s Osher Fellows Program hosts 4-8 resident scholars, scientists, educators, and artists every year. Notable Osher Fellows have included [[Walter Murch]], [[James Crutchfield]], [[Christian de Duve]], [[Arthur Ganson]], [[Tim Hunkin]], [[Lewis Hyde]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], [[Rosamond Wolff Purcell]], [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], and [[Juan Felipe Herrera]].&lt;ref name=Osher&gt;{{cite web|title=Osher Fellows|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/collaborations/oshers|work=The Exploratorium|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are hands-on activities for younger visitors (under 14 - needs confirmation).  The pendulum art activity has a youngster picking four different color markers.  The youngster then pushes a large board suspended by 4 wires to develop a pattern.  At the youngster's say so, the attendant places a selected color into an arm and lowers it onto a white paper weighted to the board.  The marker patterns the movement of the board. After 4 markers are done, the project is complete, signed by the 'young artist', and taken home.

==Influence==

===Impact===
In 2007, the Exploratorium was highlighted in the book ''Forces For Good'' as one of the 12 most effective non-profits in the United States, and was the only West Coast institution and only museum to make the list.&lt;ref name="Crutchfield"&gt;{{cite book|title=Forces for Good: The Six Practices of High-Impact Nonprofits|last1=Crutchfield|first1=Leslie R.|last2=McLeod Grant|first2=Heather|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|isbn=978-0787986124|page=22}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-20 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has inspired science museums worldwide, from the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego to the [[Garden of Archimedes]] in Florence, Italy. In 2003, ''[[The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science]]'' noted that about 400 science centers in 43 countries were established after the example of the Exploratorium.&lt;ref name=Pancaldi&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

===Attendance===
In 2012, 570,000 people visited the Exploratorium; 55% were adults and 45% were children. Geographically, 52% were from the Bay Area, 24% from the rest of California, 14% from other states, and 10% outside the US. Some 36% received free or discounted admission, and 44,000 attended on free admission days. Prior to the relocation, 97,000 students and chaperons visited the museum each year; of these, 67,000 participated in the Field Trip program. It was estimated that 180 million people visited Exploratorium exhibits at science centers and other locations worldwide.&lt;ref name=factsheet /&gt;

Annual attendance at the new Pier 15 location was anticipated to exceed one million.&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Paul|title=New Exploratorium, with $300 million price tag, to open next week on San Francisco waterfront|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22982616/gleaming-new-300-million-exploratorium-open-next-wednesday?source=rss|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2013, the ''New York Times'' reported that although attendance had soared, revenues still fell short of goals, forcing the Exploratorium to lay off around 1/5 of its staff.&lt;ref name=ChangCutback&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|title=Exploratorium Forced to Cut Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/science/exploratorium-forced-to-cut-back.html|accessdate=2014-05-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum officials had decided not to make a big publicity push upon reopening, fearing the overcrowding experienced by the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in 2008, but this was later viewed as "an opportunity lost".&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt;  A staffer (expecting himself to be laid off) observed that the Exploratorium seemed to be "moving from visionary, internally developed work to work-for-hire for other museums around the world”, as the management scrambled to earn more money from consulting for other organizations to replace unrealized admissions revenue.&lt;ref name="ChangCutback" /&gt; On April 17, 2014 the Exploratorium announced that attendance in the first year since re-opening was 1.1 million visitors, and that other key statistics had doubled or tripled.&lt;ref name=Fact2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Slafkosky|first=Jenny|title=Fact Sheet: One Year at Pier 15|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/fact-sheet-one-year-pier-15|work=Exploratorium|publisher=The Exploratorium|accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
[[File:Exploratorium Webcast.jpg|thumb|right|''Solar Eclipse'' webcast at the old Exploratorium.]]
Online since 1993, the Exploratorium was one of the first museums to build a site on the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name=Gnatek&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site serves 13 million visitors each year. It has received six [[Webby Award]]s since 1997, including four for Best Science Website and one for Best Education website, and has been an honoree an additional ten times.&lt;ref name=Webby&gt;{{cite web|title=The Webby Awards Gallery and Archive|url=http://winners.webbyawards.com|work=Webby Awards|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exploratorium's website is an extension of the experiences on the museum's floor and provides a large number of hands-on activities and exhibits for online-only visitors. The Exploratorium also broadcasts live video and/or audio directly from the museum floor (or from satellite feeds in the field, at such locations as Antarctica or the Belize rainforest) onto the Internet from its Webcast Studio. Webcasts provide access to special events, scientists, and other museum resources for audiences on the Web. Visitors to the website can hear or view interviews with scientists, "meet" interesting people, or tour unique locations from factories to particle accelerators.&lt;ref name=Semper&gt;

The Exploratorium has additionally released two free iPad apps, Sound Uncovered (2013) and Color Uncovered (2011), which assist in making its unique educational model as accessible as possible. Color Uncovered has been downloaded more than a million times.&lt;ref name=iPad&gt;{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Rebecca|title=Exploratorium’s new iPad app reveals ‘magic of existing phenomena’|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/12/exploratoriums-new-ipad-app-reveals-magic-of-existing-phenomena/|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===
The Exploratorium has a number of partnerships with other organizations. One notable current partnership is with the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  NOAA research vessels periodically berth at the end of Pier 15 and use the working biological labs featured in the museum to bring their research and data to the public. A number of exhibits at the Exploratorium, such as ''Remote Rains'', are based on NOAA data. NOAA scientists additionally provided training for the Explainer program to assist Explainers in explaining science to visitors based on the NOAA’s areas of research.&lt;ref name=Plutchak /&gt;

===Global Studios===
The Exploratorium Global Studios initiative is an entrepreneurial endeavor that shares resources, exhibits, and research with foreign governments, universities, partner museums, libraries, hospitals, and other public and private entities around the world. One area of significant current activity for the Global Studios initiative is the Middle East, where it hopes to assist countries that are making long-term investments in education and transitioning to more information-based economies.&lt;ref name=GlobalStudios&gt;{{cite press release |title=Exploratorium Launches Global Studios, an Entrepreneurial Endeavor to Share Knowledge and Services Around the World |language=English |date=15 November 2012 |publisher=The Exploratorium |location= |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/press-office/press-releases/exploratorium-launches-global-studios-entrepreneurial-endeavor-share |accessdate=2013-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Tinkering Studio visited a science festival in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2012, where they trained a group of teachers to help thousands of festival participants to experience the hands-on learning style favored by the Exploratorium.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar}}
The '''feminist art movement''' refers to the efforts and accomplishments of [[feminism|feminists]] internationally to produce [[feminist art|art that reflects women's lives and experiences]], as well as to change the foundation for the production and reception of contemporary art. It also sought to bring more visibility to women within [[art history]] and art practice. Corresponding with general developments within [[feminism]], and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s as an outgrowth of the so-called [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]]. It has been called "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html Jeremy Strick], director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in the ''Washington Post'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1960s was period of civil rights and [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay and lesbian rights]] movements and protests against war. It was also a period when women artists wanted to gain equal rights as men within the established art world, influenced by modernist movements "utopian ideals," and to create [[feminist art]], often in non-traditional ways, to help "change the world."&lt;ref name="Art Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm# | title=Feminist art movement | publisher=The Art Story Foundation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Bourgeois]] (1911-2010) and German-American [[Eva Hesse]] (1936-1970) explore some of the themes in [[feminist art]], like domestic life, personal experience and the women's body.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

On 20 July 1964 [[Yoko Ono]], an avant-garde artist, singer, and activist, presented ''Cut Piece'' at the Yamaichi Concert Hall, Kyoto, Japan where she sat still as parts of her clothing were cut off of her, which meant to protest violence against women. She performed it again at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="CBS Yoko Ono"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/crowd-cuts-yoko-onos-clothing-off/ | title=Crowd Cuts Yoko Ono's Clothing Off | work=CBS News | date=16 October 2003 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jarett Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, Sean, participated in the artist performance on 15 September 2013 at the Théâtre le Ranelagh in Paris.  ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Jonathan Jones considered it "one of the 10 most shocking performance artworks ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/11/scrotum-top-10-shocking-performance-art | title=The 10 most shocking performance artworks ever | publisher=The Guardian | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jonathan Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women artists, motivated by [[feminist theory]] and the [[feminist movement]], began the feminist art movement in the 1970s. Feminist art represented a shift away from [[modernism]], where art made by women was put in a different class to works made by men. The movement cultivated a new feminist consciousness, a "freedom to respond to life... [Unimpeded] by traditional male mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;Deoritha Anne Waters, Three Feminist Perspectives on Visual Media: Influences of the Second Wave Feminist Movement on Women’s Art Education and Their Lives as Artists, ed. Deoritha Anne Waters (Michigan: ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2014), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Or, as Griselda Pollock and Roszika Parker put it—a separation of Art with a capital "A" from art made by women produced a "feminine stereotype".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roszika Parker|author2=Griselda Pollock| title=Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology |publisher=Pandora, RKP|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This demand for equality in representation was codified in the [[Art Workers' Coalition]]'s (AWC) Statement of Demands, which was developed in 1969 and published in definitive form in March 1970. The AWC was set up to defend the rights of artists and force museums and galleries to reform their practices. While the coalition sprung up as a protest movement following Greek kinetic sculptor [[Takis|Panagiotis "Takis" Vassilakis]]'s physical removal of his work Tele-Sculpture(1960) from a 1969 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, it quickly issued a broad list of demands to 'art museums in general'.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Alongside calls for free admission, better representation of ethnic minorities, late openings and an agreement that galleries would not exhibit an artwork without the artist's consent, the AWC also demanded that museums 'encourage female artists to overcome centuries of damage done to the image of the female as an artist by establishing equal representation of the sexes in exhibitions, museum purchases and on selection committees'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Charles|title=Art in theory|date=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-16575-4|pages=901–2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also feminist forms of [[postmodernism]] which emerged in the 1980s. The feminist art movement grew out of the struggle to find a new way to express sexual, material, social and political aspects of life, and femininity.&lt;ref name="Kramarae pp. 92-93"&gt;Entry on feminist art practice by Katy Deepwell in {{cite book|editor1=Cheris Kramarae|editor2=Dale Spender|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfrzBcycB-4C&amp;pg=PA92|date=1 December 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist art movements emerged in [[Feminist art movement in the United States|the United States]];  Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gislind Nabakowski|author2=Peter Gorsen|author3=Sander Helke| title=Frauen in der Kunst(2 Vols.)|publisher=Frankfurt,Suhrkamp|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Spain;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mav.org.es/cronologiaMAV/cronologia.html  Mujeres en les Artes Visuales, Women in the Visual Arts, Spanish chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian feminist art timeline|Australia]]; Canada;&lt;ref&gt;Marie  Rose Arbour  ''Art et Feminisme'' Exhibition catalogue.

Japan, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Women artists from Asia, Africa and particularly Eastern Europe emerged in large numbers onto the international art scene in the late 1980s and 1990s as [[contemporary art]] became popular worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erstestiftung.org/gender-check/ Gender Check: Masculinity and Femininity in the Art in Eastern Europe],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huangfu, Binghui.(ed).''Text and Sub-Text''(Singapore: Lasalle-SIA University, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dike, Paul Chike and Oyelola, Patricia.

Major exhibitions of contemporary women artists include ''[[WACK!

'''Fuzzy subalgebras''' theory is a chapter of [[fuzzy set theory]]. It is obtained from an interpretation in a multi-valued logic of axioms usually expressing the notion of [[subalgebra]] of a given [[algebraic structure]].

== Definition ==

Consider a first order language for algebraic structures with a [[Unary operator|monadic predicate]] symbol S. Then a ''fuzzy subalgebra'' is a [[fuzzy model]] of a theory containing, for any ''n''-ary operation h, the axioms

&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1, ..., \forall x_n (S(x_1) \land ..... \land S(x_n) \rightarrow S(h(x_1, ..., x_n))&lt;/math&gt;

and, for any constant c, S(c).

The first axiom expresses the closure of S with respect to the operation h, and the second expresses the fact that c is an element in S. As an example, assume that the [[valuation structure]] is defined in [0,1] and denote by &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; the operation in [0,1] used to interpret the conjunction. Then a fuzzy subalgebra of an algebraic structure whose domain is D is defined by a fuzzy subset {{nobreak|s : D → [0,1]}} of D such that, for every d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in D, if '''h''' is the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the n-ary operation symbol h, then

* &lt;math&gt;s(d_1) \odot... \odot s(d_n) \leq s(\mathbf{h}(d_1,...,d_n))&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if '''c''' is the interpretation of a constant c such that s('''c''') = 1.

A largely studied class of fuzzy subalgebras is the one in which the operation &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the minimum. In such a case it is immediate to prove the following proposition.

'''Proposition.''' A fuzzy subset s of an algebraic structure defines a fuzzy subalgebra if and only if for every λ in [0,1], the [[closed cut]] {x ∈ D : s(x)≥ λ} of s is a subalgebra.

== Fuzzy subgroups and submonoids ==

The fuzzy subgroups and the fuzzy submonoids are particularly interesting classes of fuzzy subalgebras. In such a case a fuzzy subset ''s'' of a monoid (M,•,'''u''') is a '''fuzzy submonoid''' if and only if

# &lt;math&gt;s(\mathbf{u})=1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;s(x) \odot s(y) \leq s(x \cdot y)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the [[neutral element]] in A.

Given a group G, a '''fuzzy subgroup''' of G is a fuzzy submonoid s of G such that 
* s(x) ≤ s(x&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

It is possible to prove that the notion of fuzzy subgroup is strictly related with the notions of [[fuzzy equivalence]]. In fact, assume that S is a set, G a group of transformations in S and (G,s) a fuzzy subgroup of G. Then, by setting 

* e(x,y) = Sup{s(h) : h is an element in G such that h(x) = y}

we obtain a fuzzy equivalence. Conversely, let e be a fuzzy equivalence in S and, for every transformation h of S, set 

* s(h)= Inf{e(x,h(x)): x∈S}.

Then s defines a fuzzy sub[[group of transformation]] in S. In a similar way we can relate the fuzzy submonoids with the fuzzy orders.

Health education can be defined as the principle by which individuals and groups of people, learn to behave in a manner conducive to the promotion, maintenance, or restoration of [[health]]. However, as there are multiple definitions of [[health]], there are also multiple definitions of health education.  The Joint Committee on Health Education and Promotion Terminology of 2001 defined Health Education as "any combination of planned learning experiences based on sound theories that provide individuals, groups, and communities the opportunity to acquire information and the skills needed to make quality health decisions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joint Committee on Terminology| year = 2001 | title = Report of the 2000 Joint Committee on Health Education and Promotion Terminology | url = | journal = American Journal of Health Education | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 89–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] defined Health Education as "compris[ing] [of] consciously constructed opportunities for learning involving some form of communication designed to improve health literacy, including improving knowledge, and developing life skills which are conducive to individual and community health." &lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

==Role of health education teacher in primary school level==

From the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, the aim of public health was controlling the harm from infectious diseases, which were largely under control by the 1950s.  By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator &lt;ref name = "Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education"&gt;Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  A health educator is "a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below.

[[File:Healthed mindmap.jpg]]

===Responsibility I: Assessing Individual and Community Needs for Health Education===
*Provides the foundation for program planning
*Determines what health problems might exist in any given groups
*Includes determination of community resources available to address the problem
*Community Empowerment encourages the population to take ownership of their health problems
*Includes careful data collection and analysis
*It is essential  for healthy life
*to find out the vital health statistics in community
*The planned activity should be achievable and take into consideration the financial,personnel, and time constraints on the resources you have available. you should not plan unachievable activities.

===Responsibility II: Plan Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===

*Actions are based on the needs assessment done for the community (see Responsibility I)
*Involves the development of goals and objectives which are specific and measurable
*Interventions are developed that will meet the goals and objectives
*According to Rule of Sufficiency, strategies are implemented which are sufficiently robust, effective enough, and have a reasonable chance of meeting stated objectives

===Responsibility III: Implement Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===

*Implementation is based on a thorough understanding of the priority population
*Utilize a wide range of educational methods and techniques

===Responsibility IV: Conduct Evaluation and Research Related to Health Education===

*Depending on the setting, utilize tests, surveys, observations, tracking epidemiologicaldata, or other methods of data collection
*Health Educators make use of research to improve their practices.

===Responsibility V: Administer Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===

*Administration is generally a function of the more experienced practitioner
*Involves facilitating cooperation among personnel, both within and between programs

===Responsibility VI: Serve as a Health Education Resource Person===

===Role VII: Communicate and Advocate for Health and Health Education===

*Translates scientific language into understandable information
*Address diverse audience in diverse settings
*Formulates and support rules, policies and legislation
*Advocate for the profession of health education

==Motivation==
Education for health begins with people. It hopes to motivate them with whatever interests they may have in improving their [[living conditions]]. Its aim come is to develop in them a sense of responsibility for health conditions for themselves as individuals, as members of families, and as communities. In communicable disease control, health education commonly includes an appraisal of what is known by a population about a disease, an assessment of habits and attitudes of the people as they relate to spread and frequency of the disease, and the presentation of specific means to remedy observed deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm Washington State Department of Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107002810/http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm |date=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health education is also an effective tool that helps improve health in developing nations. It not only teaches prevention and basic health knowledge but also conditions ideas that re-shape everyday habits of people with unhealthy lifestyles in developing countries. This type of conditioning not only affects the immediate recipients of such education but also future generations will benefit from an improved and properly cultivated ideas about health that will eventually be ingrained with widely spread health education. Moreover, besides physical health prevention, health education can also provide more aid and help people deal healthier with situations of extreme stress, anxiety, depression or other emotional disturbances to lessen the impact of these sorts of mental and emotional constituents, which can consequently lead to detrimental physical effects.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bundy D. |author2=Guya H.L. | year = 1996 | title = Schools for health, education and the school-age child | url = | journal = Parasitology Today | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1016/0169-4758(96)30011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kann L. |author2=Brener N.D. |author3=Allensworth D.D. | year = 2001 | title = Health education: Results from the School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000 | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 71 | issue = 7| pages = 266–278 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2001.tb03504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credentialing==

Credentialing is the process by which the qualifications of licensed professionals, organizational members or an organization are determined by assessing the individuals or group background and legitimacy through a standardized process. Accreditation, licensure, or certifications are all forms of credentialing.

In 1978, Helen Cleary, the president of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE) started the process of certification of health educators. Prior to this, there was no certification for individual health educators, with exception to the licensing for school health educators.  The only accreditation available in this field was for school health and public health professional preparation programs.

Her initial response was to incorporate experts in the field and to promote funding for the process. The director if the Division of Associated Health Professions in the Bureau of Health Manpower of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Thomas Hatch, became interested in the project. To ensure that the commonalities between health educators across the spectrum of professions would be sufficient enough to create a set of standards, Dr. Cleary spent a great amount of time to create the first conference called the Bethesda Conference. In attendance were interested professionals who covered the possibility of creating credentialing within the profession.

With the success of the conference and the consensus that the standardization of the profession was vital, those who organized the conference created the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators. Funding for this endeavor became available in January 1979, and role delineation became a realistic vision for the future.  They presented the framework for the system in 1981 and published entry-level criteria in 1983. Seven areas of responsibility, 29 areas of competency and 79 sub-competencies were required of health education professionals for approximately 20 years for entry-level educators.

In 1986 a second conference was held in Bethesda, Maryland to further the credentialing process. In June 1988, the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators became the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC). Their mission was to improve development of the field by promoting, preparing and certifying health education specialists. The NCHEC has three division boards that included preparation, professional development and certification of health educator professionals. The third board, which is called the Division Board of Certification of Health Education Specialist (DBCHES), has the responsibility of developing and administering the CHES exam. An initial certification process allowed 1,558 individuals to be chartered into the program through a recommendation and application process. The first exam was given in 1990.

In order for a candidate to sit for an exam they must have either a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree from an accredited institution, and an official transcript that shows a major in health education, Community Health Education, Public Health Education, or School Health Education, etc. The transcript will be accepted if it reflects 25 semester hours or 37 quarter hours in health education preparation and covers the 7 responsibilities covered in the framework.

In 1998 a project called the Competencies Update Project (CUP) began. The purpose of the CUP project was to up-date entry-level requirements and to develop advanced-level competences. Through research the CUP project created the requirements for three levels, which included entry-level, Advanced I and Advanced II educators.&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell, R. R., Girvan, J. T., &amp; McKenzie, J. F. (2009). Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education. New York: Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patterson S. M. |author2=Vitello E. M. | year = 2006 | title = Key Influences Shaping Health Education: Progress Toward Accreditation | url = | journal = The Health Education Monograph Series | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 14–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the Master Certified Health Education Specialist (MCHES) was created. The MCHES exam measures the knowledge of the advanced levels and sub levels of the Seven Areas of Responsibilities. The first MCHES exam was given in October 2011.

In order to be eligible to take the MCHES exam you must have at least a master's degree in health education or related discipline along with a least 25 credit hours related to health education.  In addition, five years of documented information of practice in health education and two recommendations of past/present supervisors must be provided. A vitae/resume must also be submitted.

The Competency Update Project (CUP), 1998-2004 revealed that there were higher levels of health education practitioners, which is the reasoning for the advancements for the MCHES. Many health educators felt that the current CHES credential was an entry-level exam.

==Teaching==

In the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.

The National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students’ knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students’ motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90 percent of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf

==National Health Education Standards==

The National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K–Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards. Retrieved May 1, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/SHER/standards/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Education Code of Ethics==
The Health Education Code of Ethics has been a work in progress since approximately 1976, begun by the Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE).  Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.

"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium." &lt;ref&gt;Coalition of National Health Education Organizations. Introduction. Health Education Code of Ethics. November 8, 1999, Chicago, IL.  Retrieved May 1, 2009, from http://www.cnheo.org/code1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health Education profession is dedicated to excellence in the practice of promoting individual, family, organizational,
and community health. The Code of Ethics provides a framework of shared values within which Health Education is
practiced. The responsibility of each Health Educator is to aspire to the highest possible standards of conduct and to
encourage the ethical behavior of all those with whom they work.

'''Article I: Responsibility to the Public'''
A Health Educator’s ultimate responsibility is to educate people for the purpose of promoting, maintaining, and improving
individual, family, and community health. When a conflict of issues arises among individuals, groups, organizations,
agencies, or institutions, health educators must consider all issues and give priority to those that promote wellness and
quality of living through principles of self-determination and freedom of choice for the individual.

'''Article II: Responsibility to the Profession'''
Health Educators are responsible for their professional behavior, for the reputation of their profession, and for promoting
ethical conduct among their colleagues.

'''Article III: Responsibility to Employers'''
Health Educators recognize the boundaries of their professional competence and are accountable for their professional
activities and actions.

'''Article IV: Responsibility in the Delivery of Health Education'''
Health Educators promote integrity in the delivery of health education. They respect the rights, dignity, confidentiality,
and worth of all people by adapting strategies and methods to the needs of diverse populations and communities.

'''Article V: Responsibility in Research and Evaluation'''
Health Educators contribute to the health of the population and to the profession through research and evaluation
activities. When planning and conducting research or evaluation, health educators do so in accordance with federal and
state laws and regulations, organizational and institutional policies, and professional standards.

'''Article VI: Responsibility in Professional Preparation'''
Those involved in the preparation and training of Health Educators have an obligation to accord learners the same
respect and treatment given other groups by providing quality education that benefits the profession and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Coalition of National Health Education Organizations. Introduction.

==Health Education Career Opportunities==

The terms Public Health Educator, Community Health Educator or Health Educator are all used interchangeable to describe an individual who plans implements and evaluates health education and promotion programs. These individuals play a crucial role in many organizations in various settings to improve our nations health. Just as a Community health educator works work toward population health, a school Health educator generally teaches in our Schools. A community health educator is typically focused on their immediate community striving to serve the public.

'''Health Care Settings''': these include hospitals (for-profit and public), medical care clinics, home health agencies, HMOs and PPOs. Here, a health educator teaches employees how to be healthy. Patient education positions are far and few between because insurance companies do not cover the costs. [1]

'''Public Health Agencies''': are official, tax funded, government agencies. They provide police protection, educational systems, as well as clean air and water. Public health departments provide health services and are organized by a city, county, state, or federal government. [2]

'''School Health Education''': involves all strategies, activities, and services offered by, in, or in association with schools that are designed to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development. School health involves teaching students about health and health related behaviors. Curriculum and programs are based on the school's expectations and health. [3]

'''Non Profit Voluntary Health Agencies''': are created by concerned citizens to deal with health needs not met by governmental agencies. Missions include public education, professional education, patient education, research, direct services and support to or for people directly affected by a specific health or medical problem. Usually funded by such means as private donations, grants, and fund-raisers.[4]

'''Higher Education''': typically two types of positions health educators hold including academic, or faculty or health educator in a student health service or wellness center. As a faculty member, the health educator typically has three major responsibilities: teaching, community and professional service, and scholarly research. As a health educator in a university health service or wellness center, the major responsibility is to plan, implement, and evaluate health promotion and education programs for program participants. [5]

'''Work site Health Promotion''': is a combination of educational, organizational and environmental activities designed to improve the health and safety of employees and their families. These work site wellness programs offer an additional setting for health educators and allow them to reach segments of the population that are not easily reached through traditional community health programs. Some work site health promotion activities include: smoking cessation, stress management, bulletin boards, newsletters, and much more. [6]

'''Independent Consulting and Government Contracting''': international, national, regional, state, and local organizations contract with independent consultants for many reasons. They may be hired to assess individual and community needs for health education; plan, implement, administer and evaluate health education strategies; conduct research; serve as health education resource person; and or communicate about and advocate for health and health education. Government contractors are often behind national health education programs, government reports, public information web sites and telephone lines, media campaigns, conferences, and health education materials. [7]

==Influential individuals in health education: past and present==
'''Dorothy Bird Nyswander'''
 
Dr. Nyswander was born September 29, 1894.  She earned her bachelor's and master's degree at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] and received her Doctorate in educational psychology at Berkeley. She is a founder of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Nysawnder pursued her interest in public health at the Works Progress Administration during the depression. She served with the Federal Works Agency contributing to the establishment of nursery schools and child care centers to accommodate young mothers working in defense plants. She set up these centers in 15 northeastern states.  This did not happen quickly so she advocated all over the nation to train people to act as foster parents for the children of working women. Dr. Nyswander became the director of the City health Center in [[Astoria, Queens]] in 1939.  She spent her time as director promoting the idea of New York City keeping an eye on the health of children.  They would do this by keeping records that would follow them to whatever school they might move to.  She wrote "Solving School Health Problems" which is an analysis of the health issues in New York children.  This is still used in public health education courses today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RICHARD SEVEROPublished: December 29, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/29/us/dorothy-bird-nyswander-104-promoted-public-health-education.html?sec=&amp;spon= |title=Dorothy Bird Nyswander, 104; Promoted Public Health Education - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-12-29 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mayhew Derryberry'''

A year after his work with the American Child Health Association he earned his master's degree in education and psychology at Columbia University.  He then went on to earn his doctorate and moved to the [[New York City]] Health Department as the secretary to the sanitary superintendent. He finally moved to Washington DC and joined the US Public Health Service as a senior public health analyst. He became chief of the Public Health Service and began assembling a team of behavioral scientists. They studied the nexus of behavior, social factors, and disease. Two scientists and Derryberry conducted the study of the role of health beliefs in explaining utilization of public health screening services. This work contributed to the development of the Health Belief Model. This provided an important theoretical foundation for modern health education. His legacy was very important because he engaged behavioral and social scientists in the problems of public health and gave importance to the role of that health education plays on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mayhew Derryberry: Pioneer of Health Education |date=2003-08-27 |pmc=1448259 | pmid=14998797 |volume=94 |journal=Am J Public Health |pages=370–1 |doi=10.2105/ajph.94.3.370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Education Worldwide==
There are many countries which developed a Health Education curriculum. For example:

===Romania===
Since 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education. The National Health Education Programme in Romanian Schools was considered as being a priority for the intervention of the GFATM (Global Fund) and UN Agencies.

===Japan===

[[Shokuiku]] ([[Kanji]]: 食育) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for "[[food]] [[education]]". The law defines it as the "acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]".

It was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046%2809%2900149-3/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

Major concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:
* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.
* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html|title=shokuiku - Buzzword - Trends in Japan - Web Japan|author=|date=|website=web-japan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Families not eating meals together.



Classes in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Frank. "[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006150011/en Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project]". ''Bulletin of Keiwa College'' 15 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
Health education in Poland is not mandatory, but research has shown that even with implantation of health education that the adolescents of Poland were still not choosing to live a health lifestyle. Health education is still needed in Poland, but the factor of what is actually available, especially in rural areas, and what is affordable affects the decisions more than what is healthy.

=== Taiwan ===

The Health education in [[Taiwan]] focus on multiple topic, this included but not limit to&lt;ref name="Taiwan Health Promoting Schools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Taiwan Health Promoting Schools|url=http://hpshome.giee.ntnu.edu.tw/en/index.html|website=Taiwan Health Promoting Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125114011/http://hpshome.giee.ntnu.edu.tw/en/index.html|archivedate=2014-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'' '''Hoofdletters, Tweeling- en Meerlingdruk''' ''was a Dutch book published in 1958. In the book, author Dr. [[George van den Bergh]] made several propositions for a more economical arrangement of type in books. The book was featured in [[Herbert Spencer (graphic designer)|Herbert Spencer]]'s ''[[Typographica]]'' (Old Series, number 16, 1959) in and [[Eye (magazine)|''Eye'' magazine]] [[List of Eye magazine issues|(no. 47, vol. 12, Spring 2003)]]. [http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=85&amp;fid=451] In [[Rick Poynor]]'s ''Typographica'' he translates the Dutch title as "Capitals, twin- and multi-print." &lt;ref&gt;''Typographica'', p. 131, by [[Rick Poynor]], Princeton Architectural Press, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three principles in van den Bergh's proposals. The first was that printing in all caps (''Hoofdletters'' in Dutch means [[uppercase]] letters) would save the space wasted by the ascenders and descenders of [[lowercase]] letters. The second principle involved double printing texts that could be screened by overlaying sheets that masked every other line of text. The third principle involved double printing texts in red and green: the reader could then read through red or green "spectacles" that filtered out one text.

Erik Kindel, author of the 2003 ''Eye'' article sums up with a contemporary evaluation of the book:
{{cquote|Casting a cold eye over ''Hoofdletters, Tweeling- en Meerlingdruk'', it is difficult to see it as anything more than an earnest but bizarre solution to what was undoubtedly a real problem in postwar Europe, and the Netherlands in particular. Most designers, typographers and readers will probably find its technically deterministic contravention of long-established typographic practice merely naïve, resulting in a harmless curiosity that merits little consideration, only incredulity. But if ''Hoofdletters'' is designated a practical failure, a typography in extremis, something stops us from dismissing it out of hand. With a warmer eye it resolves into an enlightening object of mirth. While there is no indication that Van den Bergh regarded Hoofdletters with anything but complete seriousness, 45 years on it, too, operates, if accidentally, as an ingenious satire – on the preoccupations of legibility research, or the promise of technology so readily associated with the period of its invention"&lt;ref&gt;''Eye'', Number 47, Volume 12, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8212">'''Idealization''' is the process by which [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. That is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an "ideal case," then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case.

If an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive accuracy; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for [[air resistance]] when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. In this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. Although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity.

Idealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. For example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of [[Stokes' law]] allowed the calculation of drag forces. Many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations.

==Early use==
[[Galileo]] utilized the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of [[free fall]]. [[Galileo]], in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. The crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency.

The most well-known example of idealization in Galileo's experiments is in his analysis of motion. [[Galileo]] predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires [[friction]]). This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance.

==Other examples==
===Mathematics===
[[Geometry]] involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. Perfect [[circles]], [[spheres]], straight [[line (geometry)|lines]] and [[angle]]s are [[abstraction]]s that help us think about and investigate the world.

===Science===
An example of the use of idealization in [[physics]] is in [[Boyle's law|Boyle’s Gas Law]]:
''Given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa.''

In [[physics]], people will often solve for [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] systems without [[friction]]. While we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the [[force (physics)|force]] of friction is negligible.

===Social science===
It has been argued by the "Poznań School" (in Poland) that [[Karl Marx]] utilized idealization in the [[social sciences]] (see the works written by [[Leszek Nowak]]).&lt;ref&gt;About the Poznań School, see F. Coniglione, ''Realtà ed astrazione. Scuola polacca ed epistemologia post-positivista'', Catania:CUECM 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Model (economics)|economic models]] individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hamminga, N.B. De Marchi (Eds.), ''Idealization VI: Idealization in Economics'', Poznań Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences and the Humanities, Vol. 38, Rodopi:Atlanta-Amsterdam 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations.

In [[psychology]], [[idealization]] refers to a [[defence mechanism]] in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. This sometimes occurs in [[child custody]] conflicts. The child of a single parent frequently may imagine ("idealize") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. However, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. Upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had.

==Limits on use==
While idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others.&lt;ref name=LIU2004&gt;{{Citation |title=Laws and Models in a Theory of Idealization | author=Chuang Liu | journal=Synthese | year=2004 | volume=138 | issue=3 | pages=363–385 | doi= 10.1023/b:synt.0000016425.36070.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Edmund Husserl]] recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization.&lt;ref&gt;Klawiter A (2004). [http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~klawiter/Husserl&amp;Idealization-PS-82.pdf ''Why did Husserl not become the Galileo of the Science of Consciousness?''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern [[science]], it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name=LIU2004/&gt; For example, [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] suggested that Galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for extrapolation beyond what is the ideal case.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright N (1994) [http://141.105.33.55/~lomov/library/bigdvd/dvd54/Cartwright%20N.%20-%20Nature's%20Capacities%20and%20Their%20Measurement(194).pdf ''Nature's capacities and their measurement.''] pp. 186–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is continued philosophical concern over how Galileo’s idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. Since the laws created through idealization (such as the [[ideal gas law]]) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. Laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed.

'''Jehoiachin's rations tablets''' date from the 6th century BC and describe the rations set aside for a royal captive identified with [[Jeconiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas |first=David Winton |authorlink=David Winton Thomas |title=Documents from Old Testament Times |publisher=Thomas Nelson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cRBAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=tablets&amp;pg=PA84 |location=Edinburgh and London|year=1958|edition=1961|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|24:12|kjv}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|24:15–24:16|kjv}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|25:27–25:30|kjv}}; {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:9–36:10|kjv}}; {{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|22:24–22:26||}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|29:2|kjv}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|52:31–52:34|kjv}}; {{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|17:12|kjv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tablets from the royal archives of [[Nebuchadnezzar]] king of Babylon were unearthed in the ruins of Babylon that contain food rations paid to captives and craftsmen who lived in and around the city. On one of the tablets, "Ya’u-kīnu, king of the land of Yahudu" is mentioned along with his five sons listed as royal princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Babylonian_Ration_List:_King_Jehoiakhin_in_Exile,_592/1_BCE |title=Babylonian Ration List: King Jehoiakhin in Exile, 592/1 BCE |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=COJS.org |publisher=The Center for Online Judaic Studies |accessdate=23 August 2013 |quote=Ya’u-kīnu, king of the land of Yahudu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation==
The tablets were excavated from [[Babylon]] during 1899–1917 by [[Robert Koldewey]] and were stored in a barrel-vaulted underground building consisting of rows of rooms near the [[Ishtar Gate]].

==Translation==
The tablets' text states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Babylon 28122: "...t[o] Ia-'-u-kin, king..."
Babylon 28178: "10 (sila of oil) to ...Ia-'-kin, king of Ia[...] 2{{sfrac|1|2}} sila to [...so]ns of the king of Ia-a-hu-du"
Babylon 28186: "10 (sila) to Ia-ku-u-ki-nu, the son of the king of Ia-ku-du, 2{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for the 5 sons of the king of Ia-ku-du"&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another tablet reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;1{{sfrac|1|2}} sila (oil) for three carpenters from [[Arvad]], {{sfrac|1|2}} apiece,
11{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for eight woodworkers from [[Byblos]], . . .
3{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for seven Greek craftsman, {{sfrac|1|2}} sila apiece,
{{sfrac|1|2}} sila to the carpenter, Nabuetir
10 sila to Ia-ku-u-ki-nu, the [[king of Judah]]’s son,
2{{sfrac|1|2}} sila for the five sons of the Judean king. &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This evidence matches with the biblical texts found in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|24:10–17|ESV}} and {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|52:31–34|ESV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblehistory.net/newsletter/jehoiachin.htm |title=Jehoiachin's grain ration list |author=John Argubright |date=2013 |website=biblehistory.net |publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''sila'' is a [[Ancient_Mesopotamian_units_of_measurement#Capacity|Babylonian unit of capacity]] equivalent to about 800 mL (1.7 US pints).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php?searchkey=472&amp;language=id&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Landscape architecture''' is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day {{ISBN|9780500274316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.  The scope of the profession includes [[landscape design]]; [[site planning]]; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]]; erosion control; [[natural environment|environmental]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]]; [[park]]s and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private [[estate (land)|estate]] and [[house|residence]] landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a [[landscape architect]].

==Definition==
Landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[soil sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], and [[civil engineering]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces with limitations toward the landscape or park aspect of the design - large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].  The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues.

* [[Environmental assessment]] and [[landscape assessment]], planning advice and land management proposals.
* Coastal and offshore developments and [[Environmental mitigation|mitigation]]
* [[Ecological Design]] any aspect of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with natural processes and [[sustainability]]

Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in [[forestry]], nature [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[agriculture]].

Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as [[soil science]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]] or [[botany]] that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular [[species]] in a given area.

Landscape planners are concerned with [[landscape planning]] for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural and coastal land use.
Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as [[landscape archaeology]] or law to the process of landscape planning.

[[Green roof]] (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive [[roof garden]]s for [[storm water]] management, evapo-transpirative cooling, [[sustainable architecture]], aesthetics, and habitat creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extensive Vegetative Roofs {{!}} Whole Building Design Guide|url = https://www.wbdg.org/resources/greenroofs.php|website = www.wbdg.org|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|300px|Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris]]
{{Main|History of landscape architecture}}
For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The first person to write of ''making'' a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828, and [[John Claudius Loudon]] (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the ''Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term "landscape architect" was used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in the United States in 1863{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and 
[[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (1815–1852),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6412257 Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; another early American [[landscape designer]], was editor of ''The Horticulturist'' magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, ''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America'', was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Horticulture|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204051/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and [[Beatrix Farrand|Beatrix Jones (later Farrand)]] with others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in 1948 with [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]] as its first president, representing 15 countries from [[Europe]] and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=IFLAbook&gt;IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. {{ISBN|3-9522080-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=123501&amp;set=48C9DF56_2_0&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNCESCO Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflaonline.org/ The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to urban planning==
[[File:Central park photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|333px|The combination of the traditional landscape gardening and the emerging city planning combined together gave landscape architecture its unique focus. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]  used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the [[Central Park]]. ]]
Through the 19th century, [[urban planning]] became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of [[History of gardening|landscape gardening]] and the emerging field of urban planning offered Landscape Architecture an opportunity to serve these needs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of Landscape Architecture today. Among these were [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and Boston's [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and private estates for the Ford family including [[Fair Lane]] and [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House|Gaukler Point]]. One of the original ten founding members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and the only woman, was [[Beatrix Farrand]]. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; [[Yale]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; and the [[Arnold Arboretum]] for [[Harvard]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Her numerous private [[estate (land)|estate]] projects include the landmark [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, other architects — most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

Since this period [[Urban Planning]] has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as [[Civil Engineering]], [[Architecture]] and [[Public Administration]]. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin of Information for the AICP Comprehensive Planning Examination|url=https://planning-org-uploaded-media.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy_resources/certification/pdf/bulletin.pdf#page=13|website = www.planning.org|quote=There are important distinctions between planners and allied professionals and between planning and related fields. Planners approach problems comprehensively, have a long-range perspective, and deal with unique place-based issues. Although people in related professions (e.g., law, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, real estate development, etc.) and disciplines (humanities, psychology, etc.) often work with planners, they do not necessarily have the same knowledge base, skillset, and approach.
|accessdate = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline, and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]] was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. [[Roberto Burle Marx]] in [[Brazil]] combined the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.

[[Ian McHarg]] was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Ian McHarg: Overlay Maps and the Evaluation of Social and Environmental Costs of Land Use Change|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/23|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozio|first1=Ron|title=Obituary: Ian McHarg Dies|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/university-pennsylvania-prof-ian-mcharg-dies|website=Penn News|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by Urban Planners, Geographers, Forestry and Natural Resources professionals, etc.

==Profession==
In many countries, a professional [[institute]], comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In [[Europe]], [[North America]], parts of [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]], landscape architecture is a regulated profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oala.on.ca |title=The Ontario Association of Landscape Architects |publisher=Oala.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper [[Carlos Thays]], recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the [[University of Buenos Aires|UBA University of Buenos Aires]]''"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo"'' (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor’s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden]].

===Australia===
The [[Australian Institute of Landscape Architects]] (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.

AILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aila.org.au/iMIS_Prod/AILAWeb/Become_an_AILA_Member/Join/AILAWeb/Join_or_Renew.aspx?hkey=2d670d90-0f9a-49c9-a901-68bc8fd5ef5e]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.

===Canada===
In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute.  For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the ''Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act''.  Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.

Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects|Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada]] (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csla-aapc.ca/csla-aapc Canadian Society of Landscape Architects Official Site - English]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:
*Architects
*Landscape designers
*Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists.
*Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ [http://www.nzila.co.nz www.nzila.co.nz].

In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand.  The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.

Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.

NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Landscape Institute [ILI] (www.irishlandscapeinstitute.com) is the officially recognized (by the Irish State) professional body representing landscape architects and parks professionals, in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ILI was formed in 1992 by the merger of the ILHI (Institute of Landscape Horticulture of Ireland) and the IILA (Irish Institute of Landscape Architects), representing the related disciplines of landscape architecture and landscape horticulture. The Institute currently (October 2017) has a total membership of 160 (approx.) within 7 membership categories (student, graduate, affiliate, parks professional, corporate, fellow, honorary). In the absence of state regulation of the profession or title 'landscape architect', ILI is self-regulating, as for example in its adoption of the trade-marked title, 'Registered Landscape Architect', that is solely permissible for use by corporate members.

At international level, the ILI is a full member of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) through its European Region (IFLA-Europe). The ILI has play a consistent and active role in IFLA and the current president of IFLA-Europe is Irishman and ILI Past President, Mr. Tony Williams MILI.
In the Republic of Ireland, the ILI is a member institute of the Urban Forum, which represents 5 built-environment professional bodies in engineering, architecture, planning, quantity surveying and landscape architecture.

ILI promotes the landscape profession by its accreditation of the master's degree programme in University College Dublin, its certification of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its members, administration of professional practice examinations, advocacy and lobbying in respect of government policies, guidelines and standards (e.g. the National Landscape Strategy, National Planning Framework, Blue-Green Infrastructure), conferences and seminars, public lectures and design awards.

The profession grew rapidly during the Irish economic boom of the early 21st. century, benefiting from the upsurge in the construction and development sectors and from the States' capital investment in infrastructure. The recession brought a sharp reduction in membership numbers. The profession and ILI has proven resilient with clear evidence of a slow but steady recovery through growth in membership and in employment, since the commencement of economic recovery in 2014.

A key challenge remains: there is still no professional regulation or protection registration of title in Ireland, despite calls for such on successive government by ILI over many years. Therefore, there is no state-guarantee or protection of clients, for example in terms of insuring and verifying educational qualifications, professional indemnity insurance or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those claiming to be landscape architects. Notwithstanding this, there is a growing awareness in some important sectors (e.g. government departments, media, construction, tourism) of the profession. This is due - to some degree - to the ongoing work of the ILI in promoting the benefits of landscape architecture to Irish society, economy and environment.

Landscape architects in Ireland work in private practice, public sector bodies at local government level and in some state bodies (e.g. transport, national heritage) and in academia. The demand for their professional services is often associated with public infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, motorways, renewable energy facilities, water treatment plants, etc.), Blue-Green Infrastructure (planning, design and management of parks, greenspaces, amenity trees) and with construction projects related to land use developments, principally residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in urban landscapes.

Landscape architects are employed in design of:  green infrastructure, public realm, institutional/medical/industrial campuses and settings, parks, play facilities, transport (road/rail/cycle/port) corridors, retail complexes, residential estates (including plans for remediation of now-abandoned housing 'ghost' estates), village improvements, accessibility audits, graveyard restoration schemes, wind farms, wetland drainage systems and coastal zones.
They are also significantly employed in preparation/review of statutory impact assessment reports on landscape, visual and ecological impacts of planning proposals.

=== South Africa ===
In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilasa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession. It consists of three regional bodies namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA’s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the Institute. ILASA holds the country’s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).

In South Africa, the profession is regulated by The South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saclap.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt; established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP’s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.

After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the [[University of Cape Town]] or the [[University of Pretoria]], or landscape technology at the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]], professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.We also can study landscape architect in various FET institution.

===United Kingdom===
The UK's professional body is the [[Landscape Institute]] (LI). It is a [[charter]]ed body which accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.

The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.

In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled "I want to be a Landscape Architect" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aims to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building [[sustainable communities]] and fighting [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |title=CC Position Statement |first= |last= |work=landscapeinstitute.org |year=2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043428/http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called [[The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.)]]. Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB).  Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2009/12/28/landscape-architect-2.html |title=Career Advice and Guide for Job Searches - US News Business |publisher=Money.usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2672">The '''Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research''' in [[Dresden]] (German: Leibniz-Institut für Festkörper- und Werkstoffforschung Dresden) – in short [[IFW Dresden]] – is a non-university research institute and a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]]. It is concerned with modern materials science and combines explorative research in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]] with technological development of new materials and products.

==Research==
The IFW’s research program is jointly set up and implemented by scientists of the different IFW institutes. It comprises the following five research areas:

* [[Superconductivity]] &amp; [[superconductors]]
* [[Magnetism]] and [[magnetic materials]]
* Molecular [[Nanostructure]]s and [[Molecular solid]]s
* Metastable alloys
* Stress-driven architectures and phenomena

==Research institutes==
The IFW consists of five research institutes
*Institute for Solid State Research, Director: Prof. Dr. [[Bernd Büchner]]
*Institute for Metallic Materials, Director: Prof. Dr. [[Kornelius Nielsch]]
*Institute for Complex Materials, Director:  Dr. [[Thomas Gemming]] (temp.)
*Institute for Integrative Nanosciences, Director: Prof. Dr. [[Oliver G. Schmidt]]
*Institute for Theoretical Solid State Physics,  Director: Prof. Dr. [[Jeroen van den Brink]]

==History==
The IFW Dresden was founded on January 1, 1992 transforming the former  Academy Institute to an Institute of the ‘Blaue Liste’. It emerged from the largest materials science center of the former GDR, which was at the time already internationally acknowledged. Since then the IFW developed into a leading institute in selected topics of materials science.

At present the IFW employs about 400 people, among them 190 scientists, mostly physicists, chemists and materials engineers. 80 of them are young scientists working in the IFW on their doctoral thesis. About 100 guest scientists from all over the world come every year for some weeks or months to work at the IFW. The annual budget of 23 Million Euro is supplied by the Federal government and by the German states in equal parts, the latter mainly by the Free State of Saxony. Additionally to institutional funding the IFW Dresden raises project resources of about 5 Million Euro per year.

The '''Leopold matrix''' is a qualitative [[environmental impact assessment]] method pioneered in 1971.&lt;ref name="Leopold"&gt;
{{cite book |title=A Procedure for Evaluating Environmental Impact |last1=Leopold |first1=Luna B. |last2=Clarke |first2=Frank E. |last3=Hanshaw |first3=Bruce B. |last4=Balsley |first4=James R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |series=Geological Survey Circular 645 |year=1971 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Washington |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir645 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to identify the potential impact of a [[Project#Engineering project|project]] on the [[natural environment|environment]]. The system consists of a matrix with columns representing the various activities of the project, and rows representing the various environmental factors to be considered. The intersections are filled in to indicate the magnitude (from -10 to +10) and the importance (from 1 to 10) of the impact of each activity on each environmental factor.

Measurements of magnitude and importance tend to be related, but do not necessarily directly correlate. Magnitude can be measured, in terms of how much area is affected by the [[land development|development]] and how badly, but importance is a more subjective measurement. While a proposed development may have a large impact in terms of magnitude, the effects it causes may not actually significantly affect the environment as a whole. The example given by Leopold is of a [[stream]] that significantly alters the [[Erosion#Water|erosion]] patterns in a specific area, which will have a significant magnitude, but may not be important, provided the stream in question is swift moving and transports large amounts of [[soil]] anyway. In this case, an impact of significant magnitude may not actually be important to the environment in question.&lt;ref name="Leopold" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

'''Mannerism''', also known as '''Late Renaissance''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=IFMohetegAcC&amp;pg=PT330&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mannerism%20late%20renaissance&amp;f=false A World history of architecture] and [https://books.google.it/books?id=nHzqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEIJDAA Mannerism: the painting and style of the Late Renaissance]&lt;/ref&gt; is a style in [[European art]] that emerged in the later years of the Italian [[High Renaissance]] around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the [[Baroque]] style largely replaced it. [[Northern Mannerism]] continued into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1971, 483.&lt;!--If this statement can be found in the third edition of 1993, it would be preferable to cite from that edition, which is cited elsewhere in this same article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting style|Stylistically]], Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], and early [[Michelangelo]]. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceC "&gt;Gombrich 1995, {{Page needed|date=April 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title=Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich, {{ISBN|9780691070001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]]—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the [[Classical Latin|Silver Age of Latin literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation|title=the-mannerist-style |publisher=www.artsconnected.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|230px|Mannerism role-model: ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', an ancient sculpture, rediscovered in 1506; now in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The artists of Mannerism greatly admired this piece of sculpture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;]]

The word ''mannerism'' derives from the Italian ''maniera'', meaning "style" or "manner". Like the English word "style", ''maniera'' can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone "has style").&lt;ref&gt;
John Shearman, “Maniera as an Aesthetic Ideal”, in Cheney 2004, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' (1568), [[Giorgio Vasari]] used ''maniera'' in three different contexts:  to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term ''maniera greca'' to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the ''maniera'' of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney 1997, 17.&lt;!--The pagination may be different in the 1997 edition from the 2004 one found as the main entry in the reference list. Be sure the right one is being cited. Ideally, only one edition should be cited unless there is information in the earlier missing in the later edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as "la maniera moderna", or the "modern style".&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; James V. Mirollo describes how "bella maniera" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mirollo 1984, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of "bella maniera" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, "bella maniera" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As a stylistic label, "Mannerism" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] and popularized by German [[Art history|art historians]] in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century — art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. “High Renaissance” connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term Mannerist was redefined in 1967 by [[John Shearman]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by [[Fritz Grossmann]] at [[Manchester Art Gallery|Manchester City Art Gallery]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The label “Mannerism” was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique.
However, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, "la maniera" was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth 1962, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century on, art historians have commonly used the term to describe art that follows Renaissance classicism and precedes the Baroque.

Yet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period; and while the term remains controversial it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
[[File:Dividing water from Heaven.jpg|thumb|230px|Collected figures, ignudi, from Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling]]

By the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis:&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; it seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} At this point Mannerism started to emerge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence,&lt;ref name="friedlaender"&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Rome, or in both cities simultaneously.&lt;ref name="freedberg175"&gt;Freedberg 1993, 175–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and role models===
This period has been described as a "natural extension"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the art of [[Andrea del Sarto]], Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his own style at an early age, a deeply original one which was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his ''terribilità'', a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called ''[[ignudi]]'' and of the [[Libyan Sibyl]], his [[vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]] to the [[Laurentian Library]], the figures on his [[Medici]] tombs, and above all his ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]''. The later Michelangelo was one of the great role models of Mannerism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Young artists broke in to his house and stole drawings from him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects'', Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: "Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

====The competitive spirit====

The competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere [[Piero Soderini]] to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.

===Early mannerism===
[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 004.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacopo Pontormo]], ''Entombment'', 1528; Santa Felicità, Florence]]
The early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of [[Andrea del Sarto]] such as [[Jacopo da Pontormo]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]] who are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. [[Parmigianino]] (a student of [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]) and [[Giulio Romano]] (Raphael’s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome.  These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as "anti-classical”,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its "anti-classical" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550.&lt;ref name="freedberg175" /&gt; Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book ''After Raphael'' that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.

In past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican model]], the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], and the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Manfred Wundram, "Mannerism," Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, [accessed 23 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c. 1520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' no longer seemed to interest young artists.

===High maniera===
The second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} from the earlier, so-called "anti-classical" phase.
Subsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected "manner" (''maniera''). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between "unseen, but felt, quotation marks".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. [[Agnolo Bronzino]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called "stylish style" or ''Maniera'' in its maturity.&lt;ref&gt;
Shearman 1967, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of mannerism==
[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Surrey 1546.jpg|thumb|230px|English Mannerism: [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], 1546, a rare English Mannerist portrait by a Flemish immigrant]]

The cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by [[Titian]] in his long career.  A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the first international artistic style since the [[Gothic art|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the [[Northern Mannerism]]. [[Francis I of France]], for example, was presented with [[Bronzino]]'s ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]''. The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] brothers, [[Caravaggio]] and [[Cigoli]], revived naturalism. [[Walter Friedlaender]] identified this period as "anti-mannerism", just as the early mannerists were "anti-classical" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1957, {{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.

Outside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at [[School of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], it is known as the "[[Henry II style]]" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of [[Northern Mannerism]] include the court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], as well as [[Haarlem]] and [[Antwerp]]. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to [[England|English]] visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as "[[Elizabethan]]" and "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson 1983, 157–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the "pittore vago," a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.

==Sculpture==
As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the [[High Renaissance]], which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence, next to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''. [[Baccio Bandinelli]] took over the project of ''[[Hercules and Cacus]]'' from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] to "a sack of melons", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the [[pedestal]] of statues.  Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellini's bronze ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'' is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the ''David''s of Michelangelo and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 183–187&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel [[Cellini Salt Cellar|Salt Cellar]] (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bronze figures for collector's [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which [[Giambologna]], originally [[Flemish]] but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the ''[[figura serpentinata]]'', often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 194–202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early theorists==
[[File:Pietro Francavilla - Apollo Victorious over the Python - Walters 27302.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Pietro Francavilla]], ''Apollo Victorious over the Python'', 1591. [[The Walters Art Museum]]]]

===Giorgio Vasari===
[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'': he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (''invenzione''), expressed through virtuoso technique (''maniera''), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's [[Medici]] patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' would be called "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural "architectural" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short.

===Gian Paolo Lomazzo===
Another literary figure from the period is [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]], who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His ''Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura'' (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of [[decorum]], which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical ''Idea del tempio della pittura'' (''The ideal temple of painting'', Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the "four temperaments" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.

==Some Mannerist artists==
[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|230px|High Mannerism: ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'' by [[Bronzino]], c. 1545; [[National Gallery|National Gallery, London]].]]

The Dragon seems of sino-oriental influence.]]

===Jacopo da Pontormo===
[[Pontormo|Jacopo da Pontormo]]'s ''Joseph in Egypt'' features what would in the Renaissance have been considered incongruous colors and an incoherent handling of time and space.

===Rosso Fiorentino and the School of Fontainebleau===
[[Rosso Fiorentino]], who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of [[Andrea del Sarto]], in 1530 brought Florentine mannerism to [[Fontainebleau]], where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the "[[School of Fontainebleau]]".

The examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of [[engraving]]s, to [[Antwerp]] and from there throughout Northern Europe from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and [[allegory]], and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.

===Agnolo Bronzino===
Mannerist portraits by [[Bronzino|Agnolo Bronzino]] are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles.

===Alessandro Allori===
[[Alessandro Allori]]'s (1535–1607) ''Susanna and the Elders'' (''below'') is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.

===Tintoretto===
[[Tintoretto]]'s ''Last Supper'' (below) focuses on light and motion, bringing the image to dramatic life.  Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the [[angel]]s looking on in awe, in line with the old Catholic maxim that "If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist."

===El Greco===
[[El Greco]] attempted to express [[religious]] emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high Renaissance Classicism, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring "acid" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg29/gg29-over1.html |title=National Gallery of Art – El Greco |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) (1541–1614) |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benvenuto Cellini===

[[Benvenuto Cellini]] created the [[Cellini Salt Cellar]] of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]] (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.

===Joachim Wtewael===
[[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working.  His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of [[Pieter Aertsen]], and mythological scenes, many small [[cabinet painting]]s beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.

===Giuseppe Arcimboldo===
[[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (also spelled ''Arcimboldi'') is known for his portraits contrived from a [[still life]] composition

==Mannerist architecture==
Mannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the renaissance norms.&lt;ref name=vanda&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-mannerism/ |title=Style Guide: Mannerism  |date= |website= |publisher=Victoria and Albert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Art|last=Wundram|first=Manfred|publisher=Grove|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the [[Laurentian Library]], was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vSfOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=michelangelo+pioneered+mannerist+style#v=onepage&amp;q=michelangelo%20pioneered%20mannerist%20style&amp;f=false|page=Foreward|nopp=true|title=Michelangelo: 240 Colour Plates|isbn=9788892577916|last1=Peitcheva|first1=Maria|date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with inventing the [[giant order]], a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence.&lt;ref name=venturi/&gt; Defining mannerist in this context, architect and author [[Robert Venturi]] wrote "Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously." &lt;ref name=venturi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designtheory.fiu.edu/readings/venturi_architecture_as_signs.pdf |title=Architecture as Signs and Systems |last1=Venturi |first1=Robert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance examples===

An example of mannerist architecture is the [[Villa Farnese]] at [[Caprarola]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffin David, ''The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome'', Princeton University Press, 1979: 281–85&lt;/ref&gt; in the rugged country side outside of [[Rome]]. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.

Dense with ornament of "Roman" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated "set piece" against unpretentious vernacular walling.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

From the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in [[Valletta]], the new capital city of [[Malta]], were designed by the architect [[Girolamo Cassar]] in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include [[St. John's Co-Cathedral]], the [[Grandmaster's Palace (Valletta)|Grandmaster's Palace]] and the seven original [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)#Valletta|auberges]]. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the [[Baroque]] period. However, a few buildings, such as [[Auberge d'Aragon]] and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, still retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellul |first1=Michael |title=In search of Girolamo Cassar: An unpublished manuscript at the State Archives of Lucca |journal=Melita Historica |date=2004 |volume=XIV |issue=1 |page=37 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2004)1/02.pdf |issn=1021-6952 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313191703/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14%282004-07%29/MH.14%282004%291/02.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerism in literature and music==

{{See also|Metaphysical poets}}
In English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the "Metaphysical" poets of whom the most famous is [[John Donne]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The witty sally of a Baroque writer, [[John Dryden]], against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:

{{quote|He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires but in his amorous verses, ''where nature only'' should reign; and ''perplexes the minds'' of the fair sex with ''nice''&lt;ref&gt;'Nice' in the sense of 'finely reasoned.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''speculations'' of philosophy when he should ''engage their hearts'' and entertain them with the softnesses of love.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1957"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gardner, Helen |title=Metaphysical Poets |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zS_EXPFEtKwC&amp;q=dryden#v=snippet&amp;q=dryden&amp;f=false |publisher=Oxford University Press, London |year=1957 |accessdate=2014-08-15|isbn=9780140420388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} (italics added)}}

The rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by [[Tim Carter (musicologist)|Tim Carter]]:

{{quote|The madrigal, particularly in its aristocratic guise, was obviously a vehicle for the ‘stylish style’ of Mannerism, with poets and musicians revelling in witty conceits and other visual, verbal and musical tricks to delight the connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 1991, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and [[counterpoint|contrapuntally]] complex [[polyphonic]] music made in France in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1946–47, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This period is now usually referred to as the ''[[ars subtilior]]''.

===Mannerism and theatre===
''The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context'' by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1992,{{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and effetto meraviglioso of the comici dell'arte. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.

The preciosity in [[Jacques Callot]]'s minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's ''Balli di Sfessania'' (literally, dance of the buttocks) celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the innamorate (lovers) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second school at Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1994, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commedia dell'arte, ''disegno interno'', and the ''discordia concors''====
Important corollaries exist between the ''disegno interno'', which substituted for the ''disegno esterno'' (external design) in mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist ''discordia concors'' (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his batte. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.

=== Neo-Mannerism ===
According to art critic [[Jerry Saltz]], "Neo-Mannerism" (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are "squeezing the life out of the art world".&lt;ref name="saltz"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Jerry Saltz on Art’s Insidious New Cliché: Neo-Mannerism |last=Saltz |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Saltz |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/jerry-saltz-on-arts-insidious-new-clich.html |publisher=Vulture |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers "have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary".&lt;ref name="saltz" /&gt;

'''Matthew Lipman''' (August 24, 1923 in [[Vineland, New Jersey]] &amp;ndash; December 26, 2010 in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]) is recognized as the founder of [[Philosophy for Children]].  His decision to bring [[philosophy]] to young people came from his experience as a professor at [[Columbia University]], where he witnessed underdeveloped reasoning skills in his students. His interest was particularly on developing reasoning skills by teaching [[logic]]. The belief that children possess the ability to think abstractly from an early age, led him to the conviction that bringing logic to children's education earlier would help them to improve their reasoning skills. 

In 1972 he left Columbia for [[Montclair State College]] to establish the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://cehs.montclair.edu/academic/iapc/ Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children]&lt;/ref&gt; where he began to take philosophy into [[K-12]] classrooms in Montclair. That year he also published his first book specifically designed to help children practice philosophy, ''[[Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery]]''. The IAPC continues to develop and publish [[curriculum]], working internationally to advance and improve philosophy for children.

Lipman died, aged 87, in [[West Orange, New Jersey]] on December 26, 2010. Lipman's marriage to his first wife, [[New Jersey Senate|New Jersey State Senator]] [[Wynona Lipman]], ended with their divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Douglas.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''Memoria''' was the term for aspects involving [[memory]] in Western classical [[rhetoric]]. The word is Latin, and can be translated as "memory".

It was one of five canons in classical rhetoric (the others being [[inventio]], [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) concerned with the crafting and delivery of speeches and prose.

The art of rhetoric grew out of [[Public speaking|oratory]], which was the central medium for intellectual and political life in ancient Greece. Legal proceedings, political debates, philosophical inquiry were all conducted through spoken discourse. Many of the great texts from that age were not written texts penned by the authors we associate them with, but were instead orations written down by followers and students. In Roman times, while there was a much greater body of written work, oration was still the medium
for critical debate. Unlike public speakers of today, who use notes or who read their speeches, good orators were expected to deliver their speeches without such aids.

''Memoria'' was the discipline of recalling the arguments of a discourse. It generally received less attention from writers than 
other parts of rhetoric, as there is less to be said about the subject. However, the need to memorize speeches did influence the structure of discourse to some extent. For example, as part of ''dispositio'', some attention was paid to creating structures (such as the ''[[Dispositio|divisio]]'', an outline of the major arguments of a discourse) that would also aid memory. Some writers also discussed the use of various mnemonic devices to assist speakers.

But rhetoricians also viewed ''memoria'' as requiring more than just rote memorization. Rather, the orator also had to have at his command a wide body of knowledge to permit improvisation, to respond to questions, and to refute opposing arguments. Where today's speech-making tends to be a staged, one-way affair, in former times, much oration occurred as part of debates, dialogues, and other settings, in which orators had to react to others. Moreover, rhetoricians also recognized that the credibility of a speaker depended not just on the strength of his prepared arguments, but on the audience's perceptions of the speaker. In Greece, Rome, and the Renaissance, a speaker's familiarity of many areas of learning was seen as a virtue.

==In the Renaissance==
When the Humanists took up the ideas on memory found the writings of Classical authors, memoria played an important role in the pedagogical system. Texts were learned first by rote memorization, then re-read for meaning. Children's ability to memorize was aided by "[[memory table]]s", which were first available in manuscript form, and were, from the 1470s onwards, some of the first products of the printing press. (Source: Paul Gehl, ''A Moral Art: Grammar, Society, and Culture in Trecento Florence'' (1993)

==Memory and Kairos==
Memory, the fourth canon of rhetoric, and invention, the first canon, are connected. The [[Rhetorica ad Herennium|ad Herennium]] states that memory is the “treasury of things invented”, indirectly referring to the custom of accumulating commonplaces. Hence, for a rhetor, memory is as much related to the need to extemporize as to the necessity to memorize a discourse for delivery; in this way it is linked to [[kairos]] and to the ideas of [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]] and amplification (Burton).

Crowley and Hawhee state about memory and kairos, "... kairos and memory were partnered in several ways. First, both require a kind of 'attunement' in that the rhetor who is gathering items for reserve in the memory must be thinking simultaneously about what's available now that might be useful later. Secondly, memory requires an attunement during the moment of speaking or composing, a recognition of the right time for recalling an illustrative example, an argument, and so on" (317).

==Memory Systems==
Ancient peoples used [[Art of memory|elaborate systems]], such as the [[Method of loci|Method of Loci]], to store large amounts of information in their memories. Today, we use literate and electronic memory systems. Literate memory systems include books, periodicals, and libraries. Electronic systems include computers, databases, computer software, the World Wide Web, and other artificial memory devices (Crowley and Hawhee 325-28).

==The Three Elements of the Canon of Memory==
'''Memorizing One's Speech'''
Centuries ago, ancient orators had to memorize and present speeches without the help of note cards or crib sheets. Note taking, as a way to remember certain things, was looked down upon in ancient cultures. In his Phaedrus, Plato has Socrates explaining that relying on writing or taking notes weakened the mind and memory:

''"If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls: they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves"''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Any Greek in Ancient times who was caught using the note-taking method would be laughed at and deemed "weak-minded".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Nowadays, it is much more common for speakers to use note cards, though speeches are much more impressive without the use of notes.
 
Using memory during a speech can also affect how the orator influences the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the speaker addresses the audiences relying solely on their memory, they build a certain amount of ethos within the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cazacu|first=Aurel M.|title=Seneca - The Rhetor.|journal=Annals of Spiru Haret University, Journalism Studies|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=85–87|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=10&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memoria in relation to ethos during a speech situation can be described as a certain amount trustworthiness felt between the audience, as well as a level of similarity, authority, or expertise that the orator has over the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Ancient Greece, in today's society, it is much more acceptable for politicians and for people of authority to use aids when delivering addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Ota Thomas|title=American Public Address And The Mass Media.|journal=Western Speech|date=1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=44–49|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e25cba9d-788c-4066-9d30-6cb47a9e44a1%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=118|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it could be viewed as an aid to use notes or teleprompters, greater importance is placed on actually conveying the information to the audience in a clear and concise manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvi|first=Sofia Dildar|author2=Abdul Baseer|title=An Analysis Of Barack Obama's Speech 'Keynote Address At The 2004 Democratic National Convention'.|journal=Language in India|date=2011|volume=11|issue=10|pages=310–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Making One's Speech Memorable'''
For ancient orators, the excellence of how a speech was presented was more important than the simple delivery of the speech. An important feature of delivering a speech was finding ways to make one's audience remember one's speech topic. One had to be sure to one's audience learned the information or ideas presented to it.

'''Keeping a Treasury of Rhetorical Fodder'''
The third element of memory has to do with using quotes, facts, or anecdotes that could be used in future speeches. A professional orator is known to always have a treasury of rhetorical fodder close at all times.

A '''mound system''' is an alternative to the traditional rural [[septic system]] [[drain field]].  The mound system is an engineered drain field used in areas where septic systems are more prone to failure due to having extremely [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] or impermeable soils, [[soil]] with shallow cover over porous bedrock, and soils that have a high seasonal [[water table]].&lt;ref name="WI1"&gt;Converse, J.C., and J.E. Tyler. 2000. "WISCONSIN MOUND SOIL ABSORPTION SYSTEM:." Accessed on 10 Oct. 2007. [http://www.soils.wisc.edu/sswmp/SSWMP_15.24.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary waste liquids cleaning and purification action in a drain field is performed by a [[biofilm]] in the loose fill surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the soil permeability is too low, liquid is not absorbed fast enough, resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the soil permeability is too high, or is exposed to  fractured bedrock, the wastewater quickly penetrates down to the water table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the [[aquifer]]. In either situation, the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.

==History==

The mound system was originally designed in the 1940s by the [[North Dakota State University|North Dakota College of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt; It was known as the Nodak Disposal System.  In 1976 the [[University of Wisconsin]] studied the mound systems under the university's Waste Management Project.  This project published the first design manual indicating the appropriate site conditions and design criteria for mounds. In 2000 a new manual was released.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

==Design==
The mound system includes a [[septic tank]], a dosing chamber, and a mound.  Waste from homes is sent to the septic tank where the solid fraction settles to the bottom of the tank.  The effluent is sent to a second tank called a ''dosing chamber,'' from which the effluent is distributed to the mound at a metered rate (in ''doses'').  Wastewater is partially treated as it moves through the mound sand.  Final treatment and disposal occurs in the soil beneath the mound.  The mound system can also better handle the effluent since it doesn't all come into the mound at once allowing it to clean the effluent better which helps to keep the system from failing.

The absorption mound is built in layers at different depths. The depths of these layers are determined by the depth of the limiting layer of the soil, which may be a seasonal [[water table]], bedrock, [[fragipan]], or [[Till|glacial till]].&lt;ref name="Ohio8"&gt;Hamilton County General Health District. 2005. Household Sewage Treatment System. Hamilton County. Accessed on Oct. 15, 2007. [http://www.hamiltoncountyhealth.org/files/files/Fact%20Sheets/Water%20Quality/HSTS%20Manual/HSTS%20Manual%20Part%201.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;  Standards created by [[Ohio State University]] state that 24&amp;nbsp;inches of natural soil should be above the limiting layer in the soil. A layer of specifically sized sand is placed on top of the natural soil so that the natural soil and sand reach a depth of 4 feet. The distribution pipes that are fed by the dosing chamber are placed on top of the sand in layers of gravel. Then [[Geotextile|construction fabric]] and soil are placed on top of the gravel to help keep the pipes from freezing.  The top layer of soil also allows the mound to be planted with grass or non-woody plants in order to control erosion &lt;ref name="Ref7"&gt;7 Mancl, K. 2001. Managing Septic Tank-Mound Systems. Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet. Ohio State University. Accessed on 15 Oct 2007 [http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213191927/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html |date=2007-12-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When installing a mound system, the soil in the area where the mound is to be placed will not be compacted or disturbed. Any trees that are on the area are cut away at ground level, and the roots and stumps left in place.  The surface of the area for the mound is then roughened up with a [[Plow#Chisel plough|chisel plough]]. This prepares the area for the sand. Work is done from upslope of the mound area so that the ground down slope of the mound does not get compacted. Tyler tables are used to help determine the area of a mound.
&lt;!-- nonexistent cite &lt;sup&gt;(11)&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;

Time dosing is an important aspect in the functioning of the mound system.  Research done by Darby on sand filters showed that short frequent doses of effluent onto sand filters with orifices that are closely spaced helps to improve effluent quality.&lt;ref name="Ref10"&gt;Ohio Department of Health. 2007.

This does not give the biota the proper amount of time to clean the effluent.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

== Summary ==
Municipal engineering is concerned with [[municipality|municipal]] [[infrastructure]]. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining [[street]]s, [[sidewalks]], [[water supply network]]s, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]].  In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services.  It can also include the optimizing of [[municipal solid waste|garbage]] collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other [[civil engineering]] specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously (for a given street or development project), and managed by the same municipal authority.

== History ==

Modern municipal engineering finds its origins in the 19th-century [[United Kingdom]], following the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the growth of large industrial cities. The threat to urban populations from epidemics of waterborne diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[typhus]] lead to the development of a profession devoted to "sanitary science" that later became "municipal engineering".

A key figure of the so-called "public health movement" was [[Edwin Chadwick]], author of the parliamentary report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lzK5iitgFpUC&amp;dq=%22The+Sanitary+Condition+of+the+Labouring+Population%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c1PT6hM-0t&amp;sig=0X-fVS7mnsKicgP6oK50rEboxkE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rnPISs_uJ-WZjAeJ3uE6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Report to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry Into the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain: With Appendices|first=Great Britain Poor Law|last=Commissioners|date=16 June 2018|publisher=W. Clowes and sons|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, published in 1842.

Early British legislation included:

*[[Police burgh#The 1833 act|Burgh Police Act 1833]] - powers of paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, supplying with water and improving their communities.
*[[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]
*[[Public Health Act 1866]] – formation of drainage boards
*[[Public Health Act 1875]] known at the time as the Great Public Health Act
This legislation provided local authorities with powers to undertake municipal engineering projects and to appoint borough surveyors (later known as "municipal engineers").

In the U.K, the Association of Municipal Engineers, (subsequently named Institution of Municipal Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230330/http://www.placecheck.info/municipal_engineering_archive.htm|title=Municipal Engineering Archive|date=5 September 2008|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was established in 1874 under the encouragement of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to address the issue of the application of sanitary science.  By the early 20th century, Municipal Engineering had become a broad discipline embracing many of the responsibilities undertaken by local authorities, including roads, drainage, flood control, coastal engineering, public health, waste management, street cleaning, water supply, sewers, waste water treatment, crematoria, public baths, [[slum clearance]], town planning, public housing, energy supply, parks, leisure facilities, libraries, town halls and other municipal buildings.

In the UK, the development of different strands of knowledge necessary for the management of municipal infrastructure led to the emergence of separate specialised institutions, including:
*For drainage: Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, 1895
*For town planning: Town Planning Institute 1914 ... subsequently becoming the Royal Town Planning Institute
*For street lighting: Association of Public Lighting Engineers, 1934...subsequently becoming the Institution of Lighting Engineers
*For highway engineering: Institution of Highways and Transportation, 1930
*For public housing: Institute of Housing, 1931

In 1984 the Institution of Municipal Engineers merged with the Institution of Civil Engineers.

Since the 1970s, there has been a global trend toward increasing privatisation and outsourcing of municipal engineering services.

In the UK in the 1990s a change in management philosophy brought the demise of the traditional organisational structure of boroughs where the three functions of town clerk, borough treasurer and borough engineer were replaced by an administrative structure with a larger number of specialised departments.

In the late 1990s and early 21st century there was increasing dissatisfaction over what was perceived to be fractured and dysfunctional public services designed along narrow specialties. A more holistic approach to urban engineering began to emerge as an alternative concept. Critics of the specialised approach included the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]] that complained that the specialised approach to management of the public realm focussed too much on the on efficient movement of vehicles rather than the more general interests of local communities....GANESH.One of the civil eng.

== Professional practice ==

In the United Kingdom there is no longer any formal professional qualification in municipal engineering although there are degree courses available in urban engineering.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

A professional certificate in Urban Engineering is available from through the Institution of Incorporated Engineers via the Public Realm Information and Advice Network.

The British [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) caters to practitioners employed in the public sector, private consultancy and academia through its Proceedings Journal Municipal Engineer.  The journal, first published in 1873, has a global scope and covers the whole life cycle of municipal services addressing technical, political and community issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, Ian. “Municipal Engineer – the silver anniversary”. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Municipal Engineer, Vol 162, ME2, June 2009, pp65-68&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition an
Expert Panel responds on behalf of ICE to Government consultations and is represented on the International Federation of Municipal Engineering.

== International organization ==
The International Federation of Municipal Engineering (IFME) is an organisation comprising professional municipal engineers from all round the world.  IFME's mission is to connect municipal engineers, public works professionals, public agencies, institutions and businesses around the world in order that they can share a global pool of knowledge and experience.  The aim is to foster continued improvement in the quality of public works and wider community services.

The inaugural meeting was held in 1960 at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris.  Membership has grown steadily and in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Buchan, Neil.  “Briefing Note - International Federation of Municipal Engineering”. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Municipal Engineer, Vol 163, ME3, Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt; comprised representatives from national associations in:  Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Southern Africa (South Africa, Botawana, Namibia &amp; Zimbabwe), Sweden, UK (England, Scotland, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland) and USA.   Belgium and San Marino are presently Corresponding Members.

== Related engineering disciplines ==
Municipal or urban engineering combines elements of [[environmental engineering]], [[water resources engineering]] and [[transport engineering]].

== Relationship to urban design or urban planning ==
Today, municipal engineering may be confused with [[urban design]] or [[urban planning]].  Whereas the urbanist or urban planner may design the general layout of streets and public places, the municipal engineer is concerned with the detailed design.  For example, in the case of the design of a new street, the urbanist may specify the general layout of the street, including landscaping, surface finishings and urban accessories, but the municipal engineer will prepare the detailed plans and specifications for the roads, sidewalks, municipal services and street lighting.

== Site civil works ==
In the case of large buildings or plants, facilities or campuses, site civil works may be required that are similar in scope or type as municipal infrastructure, namely, access roads, parking lots, potable water supply (including fire hydrants), on-site waste water treatment plants, site drainage including sedimentation and retention ponds or basins, etc.  In most engineering consulting firms, Structural Engineering and Municipal Infrastructure are typically separate departments.  On a large construction project, the civil engineering design will typically be divided into a structural portion, designed by structural engineers and typically focused on the buildings, and "civil" portion, designed by municipal engineers and focused on the site.[gani..CW]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11084">The '''National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease''' ('''NCFAD'''), located in the [[Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health]] in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is part of the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]’s National Centres for Animal Disease. NCFAD is co-located with the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]’s [[National Microbiology Laboratory]].

NCFAD provides state-of-the-art scientific expertise and technologies for the prevention, detection, control and reporting of foreign animal diseases (FAD) and emerging animal diseases. The lab has diagnostic capabilities for a large number of FADs including, but not limited to: avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, and Nipah and Hendra virus infections.

The NCFAD has received designations by the [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE)e as a reference laboratory for both highly pathogenic avian influenza and for classical swine fever, in recognition of excellence in diagnostic competency, test method development, validation, research, collaboration and training.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/XX_LIST_LAB.pdf OIE Reference Experts and Disease Index].&lt;/ref&gt; The NCFAD is also accredited to the international quality standard, ISO/IEC 17025 for both diagnostics and research. ISO accreditation means that an international level of standardization has been met; this ensures state-of-the-art technology, worldwide compatibility and competence in diagnostic and research activities.

== Mandate and Role ==

The mandate of the NCFAD is to provide scientific and laboratory services for the rapid and accurate identification and reporting of foreign animal diseases. The lab has five main functions: Testing services; technology development and research; training; scientific advice; and international consultation.

NCFAD staff are experts in tests to detect FAD agents, and they perform many of these tests on a routine basis to meet requirements for import, export, and domestic disease control - including surveillance, the provision of confirmatory testing of suspect material, and reference laboratory services. NCFAD scientists also undertake research to develop better testing technologies for FADs. Staff also serve on international committees; maintain international linkages and collaborations with FAD experts in other countries; and provide training to veterinarians, graduate students, and technologists.

One of the methods for providing this training is through a specialized annual course that focuses on FAD recognition, diagnosis and pathogenesis (the origins and development of disease and the mechanisms that cause disease).  It is the only facility in Canada that is equipped to present this course. Participants include CFIA field veterinarians, veterinary pathologists from Canada’s teaching colleges, and veterinary diagnosticians from provincial laboratories.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/agen/broch/sciwortrav5e.shtml#tc52 Foreign animal disease recognition training].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

NCFAD is organized into several Sections and Units:

'''Classical Swine Fever/Avian Influenza''' – This Section provides diagnostic testing services, technology development, research, training, and scientific consultation services. Diseases of primary concern are: classical swine fever, African swine fever, Newcastle disease, and notifiable avian influenza. This Section has expertise in the detection, isolation, identification, sequencing and characterization of viruses using conventional and molecular techniques. In addition to OIE Reference Laboratory status for classical swine fever and avian influenza, this Section is also the National Reference Laboratory and as such aides coordination of the network of provincial/university diagnostic animal health laboratories across Canada.

'''Vesicular Diseases''' – This Section provides testing services, technology development and research, training, and scientific consultation services for vesicular diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis.  This Section is also involved in the study of host responses, disease transmission and pathogenesis of vesicular diseases.  Both in vivo and in vitro work is carried out under strict containment conditions.

'''Serology/Immunology''' – This Section conducts both scheduled and special tests for the detection of antibodies to foreign animal disease agents in addition to assay development, validation, training and scientific consultation services.  The bulk of scheduled tests (avian influenza, Newcastle disease, bluetongue, pseudorabies, vesicular stomatitis and epizootic hemorrhagic disease) involve the use of validated test methods on traditional farm animal species and the qualification of these animals or their products for movement into, out of, or within Canada and in support of national sero-surveys required by Canada’s trading partners and the OIE to maintain the country’s disease-free status.  The Section provides this service for NCFAD as well as for the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network (CAHSN).

'''Zoonotics/Emerging Diseases (Special Pathogens)''' – This is the Containment Level 4 (CL4) Section of NCFAD. CL4 is where scientists can work safely with the most serious viruses. The Section provides expertise in the area of special pathogens, particularly the CL4 agents and zoonotic containment level 3 agents of veterinary importance such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Ebola virus and Rift Valley fever virus. The Section maintains a state of readiness for emergencies or outbreak situations through research, technical development, training and scientific consultation. Protected by positive pressure suits, bench work with infectious agents is conducted in a highly specialized CFIA containment level 4 laboratory. Attached directly to this laboratory is a containment cubicle that allows work with large animals under the CL4 conditions.  The staff members receive extensive training prior to work in CL4 and CL3 zoonotic.

'''Reagent Development''' - The Reagent Development Section has expertise in the characterization and production of reagents used in diagnostic testing and research to ensure efficient and reliable supply of high quality reagents and cells for use in diagnostic testing and research.  The mandate for the reagent development unit is to provide three core services to NCFAD.  These services involve the production and characterization of: 1) monoclonal antibodies 2) recombinant proteins and 3) mammalian, avian and insect cells. Each of the services is provided by research and technical staff who specialize in up-to-date technologies relating to the efficient productions of quality reagents.

'''Pathology''' – The Pathology Section at the NCFAD delivers diagnostic services by conducting histopathological, electron microscopical and immunohistochemical tests for the diagnosis of a broad range of infectious animal diseases foreign to Canada.  The unit also investigates the pathogenesis of foreign animal and emerging diseases, for example: avian influenza, Nipah virus infection, Rift Valley fever, capripox, lumpy skin disease, glanders, and classical swine fever.

'''Animal Care''' – The Animal Care Unit collaborates in diagnostic and research activities involving the use of animals.  This unit is involved in assays for the determination of pathogenicity indices for avian viruses, the production of serum standards for diagnostic test methods, and research projects on disease pathogenesis. NCFAD primarily works with farm animals such as pigs, chickens and cattle in order to carry out its mandate. The Animal Care Unit consists of a veterinarian and laboratory animal technologists.  This unit is devoted to the best possible care for the animals and ensures that all animal use meets or exceeds the guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC).

== History ==

In the 1980s, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada identified both the need for new laboratories including high-containment space (Containment Level 3 and 4). Around the same time, Health Canada was also considering the need to replace outdated laboratories and add Containment Level 4. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building and Winnipeg was chosen as the site; an announcement was made in October 1987.

After some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre (a major teaching hospital), the University of Manitoba’s medical school, and other life science organizations. Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as “the Virology Lab”) began with an official groundbreaking in December 1992. The design team, headed by the Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc., visited 30 laboratories to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction finished toward the end of 1997 with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 and all laboratories coming on line after that. The official opening took place in 1999.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213074113/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_81_e.html News Release].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the animal health programs began moving into the new facility, they had become part of the new Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The agency was created in April 1997 by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act &lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-16.5/ CFIA Act].&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of combining and integrating the related inspection services of three separate federal government departments: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Health Canada. The establishment of the CFIA consolidated the delivery of all federal food safety, animal health, and plant health regulatory programs.

== Containment ==

In addition to operating a Containment Level (CL) 2 laboratory as well as extensive CL3 laboratories, NCFAD also operates a Containment Level 4 laboratory, which provides the capability to work safely with the most serious viruses.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/sci/bio/anima/convet/convet1-3e.shtml#a2 Animal Pathogen Containment Levels].&lt;/ref&gt; A Level 4 laboratory is designed for agents that usually produce very serious and untreatable diseases, which can be spread easily through airborne or casual contact. All animal diseases classed as Level 4 are zoonotic, meaning that they can transfer to humans. Staff wear pressurized biosafety suits which are disinfected after each session. All air and waste are sterilized on exit.

== Workforce ==

NCFAD maintains a staff of approximately 65 people; primarily scientists and laboratory technicians.

[[File:OrdFossilsMN.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brachiopods]] and [[bryozoans]] in an [[Ordovician]] limestone, southern Minnesota]]
'''Paleobiology''' (UK &amp; Canadian English: '''palaeobiology''') is a growing and comparatively new discipline which combines the methods and findings of the [[natural science]] [[biology]] with the methods and findings of the [[earth science]] [[paleontology]]. It is occasionally referred to as "[[geobiology]]".

Paleobiological [[research]] uses biological [[field research]] of current [[biota (ecology)|biota]] and of [[fossil]]s millions of years old to answer questions about the [[molecular evolution]] and the [[evolutionary history of life]]. In this [[scientific]] quest, [[macrofossil]]s, [[microfossil]]s and [[trace fossil]]s are typically analyzed. However, the 21st-century [[biochemical]] analysis of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] samples offers much promise, as does the [[biometric]] construction of [[phylogenetic tree]]s.

An investigator in this field is known as a paleobiologist.

==Important research areas==
*[[Paleobotany]] applies the principles and methods of paleobiology to [[flora]], especially [[Embryophyta|green land plants]], but also including the [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[seaweed]]s ([[algae]]). See also [[mycology]], [[phycology]] and [[dendrochronology]].
*[[Paleozoology]] uses the methods and principles of paleobiology to understand [[fauna]], both [[Vertebrata|vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.  See also [[vertebrate paleontology|vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate paleontology]], as well as [[paleoanthropology]].
*[[Micropaleontology]] applies paleobiologic principles and methods to [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], [[Protista|protists]] and [[microscopy|microscopic]] [[pollen]]/[[spore]]s.  See also [[microfossil]]s and [[palynology]].
*[[Paleovirology]] examines the evolutionary history of viruses on paleobiological timescales.
*[[Biochemistry|Paleobiochemistry]] uses the methods and principles of [[organic chemistry]] to detect and analyze [[molecular biology|molecular-level evidence]] of ancient life, both [[microscopic]] and [[macroscopic]].
*[[Paleoecology]] examines past [[ecosystem]]s, [[paleoclimatology|climate]]s, and [[Paleogeography|geographies]] so as to better comprehend [[Evolutionary history of life|prehistoric life]].
*[[Taphonomy]] analyzes the [[post-mortem]] history (for example, decay and [[decomposition]]) of an individual organism in order to gain insight on the [[Ethology|behavior]], [[death]] and [[Natural environment|environment]] of the [[fossilization|fossilized]] organism.
*[[Ichnology|Paleoichnology]] analyzes the [[animal tracks|tracks]], [[bioerosion|borings]], trails, [[burrow]]s, impressions, and other [[trace fossil]]s left by ancient organisms in order to gain insight into their behavior and [[ecology]].
*[[Stratigraphic paleobiology]] studies [[geologic time scale|long-term secular]] changes, as well as the (short-term) [[stratigraphy|bed-by-bed sequence]] of changes, in  [[Cladistics|organismal characteristics]] and behaviors.  See also [[Stratification (archeology)|stratification]], [[sedimentary rock]]s and the [[geologic time scale]].
*[[Evo-devo|Evolutionary developmental paleobiology]] examines the [[evolution]]ary aspects of the modes and trajectories of growth and development in the [[timeline of evolution|evolution of life]] – [[clade]]s both [[extinct]] and [[Extant taxon|extant]]. See also [[adaptive radiation]], [[cladistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[phylogenetic tree]].

==Paleobiologists==
The founder or "father" of modern paleobiology was Baron [[Franz Nopcsa von Felsö-Szilvás|Franz Nopcsa]] (1877 to 1933), a Hungarian scientist trained at the University of Vienna. He initially termed the discipline "paleophysiology."

However, credit for coining the word ''paleobiology'' itself should go to Professor [[Charles Schuchert]]. He proposed the term in 1904 so as to initiate "a broad new science" joining "traditional paleontology with the evidence and insights of geology and isotopic chemistry."&lt;ref&gt;Schuchert is cited on page 170 of ''Cradle of Life: The Discovery of Earth's Earliest Fossils'' (Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]) by [[J. William Schopf]] (1999). {{ISBN|0-691-00230-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]], a [[Smithsonian]] adventurer, has been cited as the "founder of [[Precambrian]] paleobiology." Although best known as the discoverer of the mid-[[Cambrian]] [[Burgess shale]] animal fossils, in 1883 this American curator found the "first Precambrian fossil cells known to science" – a [[stromatolite]] reef then known as ''Cryptozoon'' [[algae]]. In 1899 he discovered the first [[acritarch]] fossil cells, a Precambrian [[alga]]l [[phytoplankton]] he named ''Chuaria''. Lastly, in 1914, Walcott reported "minute cells and chains of cell-like bodies" belonging to Precambrian [[purple bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Walcott's contributions are described by J. William Schopf (1999) on pages 23 to 31. Another good source is E. L. Yochelson (1997), ''Charles Doolittle Walcott: Paleontologist'' (Kent, Ohio: [[Kent State University Press]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Later 20th-century paleobiologists have also figured prominently in finding [[Archean|Archaean]] and [[Proterozoic]] eon [[microfossil]]s: In 1954, [[Stanley A. Tyler]] and [[Elso Sterrenberg Barghoorn|Elso S. Barghoorn]] described 2.1 billion-year-old [[cyanobacteria]] and [[fungi]]-like [[microflora]] at their [[Gunflint Chert]] fossil site. Eleven years later, Barghoorn and [[J. William Schopf]] reported finely-preserved Precambrian microflora at their Bitter Springs site of the [[Amadeus Basin]], Central Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The paleobiologic discoveries of Tyler, Barghoorn and Schopf are related on pages 35 to 70 of Schopf (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1993, Schopf discovered O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-producing [[blue-green bacteria]] at his 3.5 billion-year-old [[Apex Chert]] site in [[Pilbara Craton]], [[Marble Bar]], in the northwestern part of [[Western Australia]]. So paleobiologists were at last homing in on the origins of the Precambrian "[[Oxygen catastrophe]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Apex chert microflora is related by Schopf (1999) himself on pages 71 to 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pandemonia''' is a character and persona created as [[conceptual art]] by an anonymous London-based artist that has appeared in the art and fashion world since 2009.&lt;ref name="Stylist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Pandemonia|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/londonfashionweek/meet-pandemonia |work=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]] |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clad in a latex full-head mask with stylized hair and latex dresses,&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt; Pandemonia is seven feet tall and was described by Katia Ganfield of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' as "[[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s blonde caricatures ... brought to life as a 7 ft [[Jeff Koons]] inflatable".&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemonia|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/pandemonia-roy-lichtenstein-inflatable-seven-foot-tall- |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Katia |last=Ganfield |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often accompanied by an inflatable white dog named Snowy.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

Pandemonia told ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'':
{{Quote|Back in 2008 the newspapers were full of celebrities. I was drawn towards creating art that documented our time. It seemed evident to me that the best way to parody this world would be to create my very own celebrity. I created a truly artificial one, in the spirit of consumerist values. Slim, tall, glossy, forever young and, of course, famous.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;}}

Initially a "[[gate crashing|crasher]]" at fashion and social events, Pandemonia eventually became a [[London Fashion Week]] VIP guest.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;

Pandemonia is a critical reflection and, as such, an intervention upon ideas of celebrity and femininity.  She is a pointed manifestation of how these ideas intersect with mass media, social media, and the marketability of desire. The art of Pandemonia herself is that of a constructed figure placed in the landscape of media, fashion and art events that has instigated the media response by feeding back to the media its own language, imagery and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On: Pandemonia (Interview) |url=http://www.vogue.it/people-are-talking-about/focus-on/2012/03/pandemonia |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Italia]] |date=12 March 2012 |first=Susanna |last=Cappellaro |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=When I pop up in celebrity circles I can see the mechanism of fame from both the inside and outside. Just as celebrities presented their image to the public, I present the celebrities my image. At least I know I'm acting out celebrity. My dog, Snowy, breaks the ice. People relate to him. Funny how people relate to an inflatable dog, isn't it?|author=Pandemonia |source=&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;}}

The growth of Pandemonia's celebrity is one of the themes in her art, which also explores archetypes of pop myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

Pandemonia’s art is not only cross-media (sculpture, digital art, photography, and performance), but also cross-generational as she ties the earliest moments of [[Pop Art]] to the most current worlds of celebrity, fashion and contemporary art, creating an arc and evolution which continues its ongoing exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oddamagazine.com/|title=ODDA Magazine Home Page|website=oddamagazine.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pandemonia was chosen by [[Camper (company)|Camper]] as the protagonist and muse for its Kobarah shoe style, and has been featured in stores and billboards in several major cities including Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camper Celebrates Kobarah Shoe During Milan’s Salone Del Mobile|url=http://footwearnews.com/2016/fashion/designers/camper-kobarah-shoe-event-milan-salone-del-mobile-211601/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philippine Genome Center (PGC)''' is a multi-disciplinary research facility in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]] which specializes in [[genomics]].
==History==
The Philippine Genome Center was first conceptualized in 2009 in response to the [[SARS outbreak]] which affected Hong Kong, the [[dengue]] outbreaks which affecting the Philippines, and the then-ongoing [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 flu pandemic]] which originated in Mexico. The first grants received by the PGC were for dengue diagnostic testing and [[H1n1|H1N1]] surveillance.&lt;ref name="ei"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Estospace|first1=Eden|title=Philippine Genome Center: Big step in health and agri research|url=https://www.enterpriseinnovation.net/article/philippine-genome-center-big-step-health-and-agri-research-1630239239|accessdate=21 April 2018|work=Enterprise Innovation|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the facility was placed under the jurisdiction of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman|University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman]]'s Office of the President as per the approval of the UP Board of Regents in its July 31, 2009 meeting.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://pgc.up.edu.ph/index.php/about/|publisher=Philippine Genome Center|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UP Board of Regents approved the transfer of management and supervision of the PGC from the university's Office of the President to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs in February 26, 2016.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==Facilities==
The PGC has two "core facilities"; the Core Facility for Bioniformatics (CFB) and the DNA Sequencing Core Facility. A [[biobank]] is planned as PGC's third facility.&lt;ref name="gmadna"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luces|first1=Kim|title=PHL Genome Center opens new DNA sequencing facility to local researchers|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/328088/phl-genome-center-opens-new-dna-sequencing-facility-to-local-researchers/story/|accessdate=21 April 2018|work=GMA News|date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two facilities were funded by a {{Philippine peso|100 million}} (US$2.2 million) grant over three years from the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) of the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name="ei"/&gt;

===DNA Sequencing Core Facility===
Opened in September 24, 2013 The DNA Sequencing Core Facility (DSCF) was the first core facility to open. Genomic studies in the field of agriculture, biodiversity, forensics, health, and ethnicity are conducted in the DSCF with the intent to specifically cater to Filipino needs.&lt;ref name="gmadna"/&gt; [[DNA sequencing|DNA]] and [[Genome sequencing]] services are provided at the DSCF.&lt;ref name="ei"/&gt;

===Core Facility for Bioniformatics===
The Core Facility for Bioinformatics (CFB) is a facility that provides genome-scale data generation and analysis to local researchers in the academe, from government institutions and private organizations. It also provides genomic data storage. It is also augmented by a [[IBM]] [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer which is also used by the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) and [[Project Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards]] (Project NOAH) for weather forecast and climate change modelling purposes in addition to genomic research use. The CFB was launched in April 14, 2014 while the supercomputer was made operational within the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ronda|first1=Rainier Allan|title=DOST activates IBM supercomputer|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/04/14/14/dost-activates-ibm-supercomputer|accessdate=21 April 2018|work=ABS-CBN News|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Satellite image of Noordoostpolder, Netherlands (5.78E 52.71N).png|thumb|right|[[Satellite imagery|Satellite image]] of [[Noordoostpolder]], [[Netherlands]] (595.41&amp;nbsp;km²)]] 

A '''polder''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpɔldər|-|Nl-polder.ogg}}) is a low-lying tract of land enclosed by [[dike (construction)|dikes]] that form an artificial [[hydrology|hydrological]] entity, meaning it has no connection with outside water other than through manually operated devices. There are three types of polder:
# [[Land reclamation|Land reclaimed]] from a body of water, such as a lake or the [[sea|sea bed]]
# [[Flood plain]]s separated from the sea or river by a dike
# [[Marshes]] separated from the surrounding water by a dike and subsequently drained; these are also known as ''[[koog]]s'' especially in Germany

The ground level in drained marshes [[Subsidence|subsides] over time. All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and water pressure of [[ground water]], or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or drained by opening [[sluice]]s at [[low tide]]. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of [[peat]] (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. 
 
Polders are at risk from flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the [[muskrat]] is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former [[fen]]lands and coastal areas.

Flooding of polders has also been used as a military tactic in the past. One example is the flooding of the polders along the [[Yser]] river during [[World War I]]. Opening the sluices at high tide and closing them at low tide turned the polders into an inaccessible swamp which allowed the Allied armies to stop the German army.

==Etymology==
From [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''polder'' ("polder"), from [[Middle Dutch]] ''polre'', from [[Old Dutch]] ''polra'', ultimately from ''pol-'' "part of land, elevated above its surroundings"; with [[augmentative]] suffix ''-er'' and [[Epenthesis|epenthetical]] '' -d-''.

==Polders and the Netherlands==
[[Image:Gemaal de Leyens.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Pumping station in [[Zoetermeer]], [[Netherlands]]. The polder lies lower than the surrounding water on the other side of the dike. The [[Archimedes' screw]]s are clearly visible.]] 
The [[Netherlands]] is frequently associated with polders, as its engineers became noted for developing techniques to drain wetlands and make them usable for agriculture and other development. This is illustrated by the saying: "God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=3HjRCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=origin+of+phrase+%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.&amp;q=%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.#v=snippet&amp;q=%22God%20created%20the%20world%2C%20but%20the%20Dutch%20created%20the%20Netherlands%22.&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;". 

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 ''polders''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/rws/waterinnovatiebron/cgi-bin/toonlijst.pl?config=config&amp;var=volgnr&amp;val=1&amp;layout=index-forceframe&amp;confignr=1&amp;menu=1067260347&amp;menuitem=1120115781| publisher=Rijkswaterstaat| title=''Kijk naar de geschiedenis''| accessdate=2008-01-21}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; nationwide. By 1961 {{convert|6800|sqmi}}, about half of the country's land, was reclaimed from the sea.&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half the total surface area of ''polders'' in north-west Europe is in the Netherlands. The first [[embankment dam|embankments]] in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century. 

As a result of flooding disasters, [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]s called ''waterschap'' (when situated more inland) or ''hoogheemraadschap'' (near the sea, mainly used in the [[Holland]] region)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=waterschap|url = http://www.waterschappen.nl/mijn-waterschap.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142234/http://www.waterschappen.nl/|archivedate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were set up to maintain the integrity of the water defences around polders, maintain the waterways inside a polder, and control the various water levels inside and outside the polder. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such they are the oldest democratic institution in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain polder integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way politics]]—the ''[[Polder Model]]''.

The [[North Sea flood of 1953|1953 flood disaster]] prompted a new approach to the design of dikes and other water-retaining structures, based on an acceptable probability of overflowing. Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequences. The potential damage in lives, property and rebuilding costs is compared to the potential cost of water defences. From these calculations follows an acceptable flood risk from the sea at one in 4,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years, while it is one in 100–2,500&amp;nbsp;years for a river flood. The particular established policy guides the Dutch government to improve flood defences as new data on threat levels becomes available. 

Some famous Dutch polders and the year they were laid dry are:
* [[Beemster]] (1609-1612)
* [[Schermer]] (1633-1635)
* [[Haarlemmermeerpolder]] (1852)
* As part of the [[Zuiderzee Works]]:
** [[Wieringermeerpolder]] (1930)
** [[Noordoostpolder]] (1942)
** [[Flevopolder]] (1956-1966)

== Examples of polders ==
===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh has 123 polders, of which 49 are sea-facing. These were constructed in the 1960s to protect the coast from tidal flooding and reduce salinity incursion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/98292/bangladesh-polders-under-threat "Bangladesh polders under threat"], Irin News&lt;/ref&gt; They reduce long-term flooding and waterlogging following [[storm surge]]s from [[tropical cyclone]]s. They are also cultivated for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ "Bangladeshi project to enhance polders amidst climate woes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408091108/http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ |date=2014-04-08 }}, Unearth News&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2008}}
'''''Politics of Nature: How to Bring the Sciences Into Democracy''''' (2004, {{ISBN|0-674-01289-5}}) is a book by the French theorist and [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Bruno Latour]]. The book is an English translation by Catherine Porter of the French book, ''Politiques de la nature''. It is published by [[Harvard University Press]].

==Overview==
In the book, Latour argues for a new and better take on political ecology (not the discipline but the ecological political movements, e.g. greens) that embraces his feeling that, "political ecology has nothing to do with nature". In fact, Latour argues that the idea of nature is unfair because it unfairly allows those engaged in political discourse to "short-circuit" discussions. Latour uses [[Plato|Plato's]] [[Allegory of the Cave|metaphor of "the cave"]] to describe the current role of nature and science in separating facts from values which is the role of politics and non-scientists. Building on the arguments levelled in his previous works, Latour argues that this distinction between facts and values is rarely useful and in many situations dangerous. He claims that it leads to a system that ignores nature's socially constructed status and creates a political order without "due process of individual will".

Instead, he calls for a "new Constitution" where different individuals can assemble [[Democracy|democratically]] without the definitions of facts and values influenced by current attitudes towards nature and scientific knowledge. Latour describes an alternate set of rules by which this assembly, or collective as he calls it, might come together and be constituted. He also describes the way that entities will be allowed in or out in the future. In describing this collective, Latour draws attention to the role of the spokesperson, who must be doubted but who must speak for otherwise mute things in order to ensure that the collective involves both "humans and non-humans". This is also an important aspect of [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) that can be found in his main sociological works.

The book includes a short summary at the end and a glossary of terms.

== Reviews of the book ==
[[Sal Restivo]] emphasises that the book is reproducing the insights from [[Science Studies]], which [[Bruno Latour]] himself has greatly contributed to. However, [[Sal Restivo]] questions whether Latour understood [[social constructivism]] and what [[sociologist]]s actually do.&lt;ref&gt;S. Restivo. Politics of Latour. Organization &amp; Environment, 18(1):111–115, Jan 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14695">'''Polysyndeton''' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] πολύ ''poly'', meaning "many", and συνδετόν ''[[syndeton]]'', meaning "bound together with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon|title=Polysyndeton|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/P/polysyndeton.htm|work=Rhetoric.byu.edu|publisher=Silva Rhetoricae|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stylistic scheme, polysyndeton is the deliberate insertion of [[Conjunction (grammar)| conjunction]]s into a sentence for the purpose of "slow[ing] up the rhythm of the prose" so as to produce "an impressively solemn note."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[grammar]], a '''polysyndetic coordination''' is a [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] in which all conjuncts are linked by coordinating conjunctions (usually ''and'', ''but'', ''or'', ''nor'' in English).

==Examples==

A passage from [[The Book of Genesis]], 1:24-25 exemplifies the stately effect of polysyndeton: 

{{quote |''And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind."  And it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps upon the earth to its kind. And God saw that it was good.''&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Author [[Ernest Hemingway]] employs the conjunction "and" to convey "a flow and continuity of experience" in a passage from his short story "[[Winner Take Nothing |After the Storm]]": 
{{quote| ''"I said, 'Who killed him?' and he said 'I don't know who killed him, but he's dead all right,' and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights or windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside Mango Key and she was right only she was full of water."''&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The poet [[John Keats |Keats]] used conjunctions in a verse from [[Endymion (poem)| Endymion]]:  
{{quote| ''And soon it lightly dipped, and rose, and sank,
''And dipped again...''&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. P. 264&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the King James Bible==
Polysyndeton is used extensively in the [[King James Version of the Bible]], where ''and'' is used as a literal translation of the Hebrew [[waw-consecutive]] and the Ancient Greek particle [[wikt:δέ|δέ]]. For example:

* "And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and [[Noah]] only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 7:22–24)
* "Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty." ([[Leviticus]] 5:2)
* "And Joshua, and all of Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had." ([[Joshua]] 7.24)

== In Shakespeare ==
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is known for using various rhetorical devices in his works, including polysyndeton.
* "When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too" (''[[King Lear]]'' 5.3.11–5)
* "Why, this is not a boon! 'Tis as I should entreat you to wear your gloves, or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, or sue you to do a peculiar profit to your person" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.85–9)
* "If there be cords, or knives, or poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.443–5)
* "Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.42–5)
* "Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous-where is your mother?" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.59–61)

==Modern usage==
Writers of modern times have also used the scheme:

* "There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway. Little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season, and of lobster shells in the lobster season, and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons, encroached upon its high places." ([[Charles Dickens]], ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', 1848)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Kenzie|title=Polysyndeton|url=http://prezi.com/t6wdyb7-gco8/polysyndeton/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Papa O. never knocked. He kicked the door in happily and shouted cheerfully, 'What you say, all peoples? How's t'ings, ever-body?' Papa O. pulled people out of bed and rattled pans and laughed at nothing and argued with unseen bartenders until somebody gave him sausage and eggs and coffee and bread and hung the accordion safely away." ([[Nelson Algren]], "How the Devil Came Down Division Street", 1944, in ''[[The Neon Wilderness]]'', 1947)
* "Let the whitefolks have their money and power and segregation and sarcasm and big houses and schools and lawns like carpets, and books, and mostly—mostly—let them have their whiteness." ([[Maya Angelou]], ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'', 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gabriel|first=Jacob|title=Asyndeton and Polysyndeton|url=http://prezi.com/7rbdhtguue_r/asyndeton-and-polysyndeton/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Cormac McCarthy==
[[Cormac McCarthy]] used polysyndeton extensively throughout his ten novels (1965–2006), especially "and" to replace an increasing number of commas. (By ''[[The Border Trilogy]]'', commas are mostly used between unquoted voices and narration, as in: "Bring it here, he said.") Examples from each novel:

* Then the barrel of the gun shortening and withdrawing in the cup of his shoulder and his face bent to the stock and him walking into it, the black plume of smoke forming soundlessly about the muzzle and the shot popping into his leg, audible and painless in his flesh and him taking another step with the same leg and pitching forward as if he had stepped in a hole and then he could hear the shot. [...] The first night he built his fire and was sitting by it with his shotgun leaning against a tree and was sipping coffee from a canteen cup [...] (''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'', 1965)
* Now the entire herd had begun to wheel wider and faster along the bluff and the outermost ranks swung centrifugally over the escarpment row on row wailing and squealing and above this the howls and curses of the drovers that now up-reared in the moil of flesh they tended and swept with dust had begun to assume satanic looks with their staves and wild eyes as if they were no true swineherds but disciples of darkness got among these charges to herd them to their doom. [...] The hogs boiled past squealing and plunging and the chalky red smoke of their passage hung over the river and stained the sky with something of sunset. [...] He was dressed in a dusty frockcoat and carried a walking stick and he wore a pair of octagonal glasses on the one pane of which the late sun shone while a watery eye peered from the naked wire aperture of the other. (''[[Outer Dark]]'', 1968)
* They passed under flowering apple&lt;!--"appletrees", sic--&gt;trees and passed a log crib chinked with orange mud and forded a branch and came in sight of an aged clapboard house that stood in blue shade under the wall of the mountain. [...] Kirby turned his head to one side and gripped his nose between his thumb and forefinger and sneezed a gout of yellow snot into the grass and wiped his fingers on the knee of his jeans. (''[[Child of God]]'', 1973)
* Suttree looked at the ground and smiled and wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist and looked up again. [...] The skiff bobbed and slid heavily and the bilgewater surged. [...] Suttree stretched and rubbed his back and eyed the sun. It was already very hot. He went along the deck and pushed open the door and entered. (''[[Suttree]]'', 1979)
* The horse screamed and reared and the Apache struggled to keep his seat and drew his sword and found himself staring into the black lemniscate that was the paired bores of Glanton's double&lt;!--"doublerifle", sic--&gt;rifle. [...] Dust stanched the wet and naked heads of the scalped who with the fringe of hair below their wounds and tonsured to the bone now lay like maimed and naked monks in the bloodslaked dust and everywhere the dying groaned and gibbered and the horses lay screaming. [...] The judge wrote on and then he folded the ledger shut and laid it to one side and pressed his hands together and passed them down over his nose and mouth and placed them palm down on his knees. [...] He bows to the fiddlers and sashays backwards and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and he is a great favorite, the judge. He wafts his hat and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and he pirouettes and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and fiddling at once. (''[[Blood Meridian]]'', 1985)
* The mouths of the cans were lensed with tinted cellophane and they cast upon the sheeting a shadowplay in the lights and smoke of antic demon players and a pair of goshawks arched chittering through the partial darkness overhead. (''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'', 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Cormac McCarthy, ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]''. New York: Vintage Books/Random House, 1993, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They were running on the plain harrying the antelope and the antelope moved like phantoms in the snow and circled and wheeled and the dry powder blew about them in the cold moonlight and their breath smoked palely in the cold as if they burned with some inner fire and the wolves twisted and turned and leapt in a silence such that they seemed of another world entire. (''[[The Crossing (McCarthy novel)|The Crossing]]'', 1994)
* They stood in the doorway and stomped the rain from their boots and swung their hats and wiped the water from their faces. [...] They stomped their boots again and crossed to the bar and stood and thumbed back their hats and propped their boots on the rail above the tiled drainway while the barman poured their whiskies. In the bloodred barlight and the drifting smoke they raised their glasses briefly and nodded as if to salute some fourth companion now lost to them and they tilted back the shots and set the empty glasses on the bar again and wiped their mouths with the backs of their hands. (''[[Cities of the Plain (novel)|Cities of the Plain]]'', 1998)
* The deputy left Chigurh standing in the corner of the office with his hands cuffed behind him while he sat in the swivelchair and took off his hat and put his feet up and called Lamar on the mobile. [...] He dropped his cuffed hands over the deputy's head and leaped into the air and slammed both knees against the back of the deputy's neck and hauled back on the chain. (''[[No Country for Old Men]]'', 2005)
* Out on the road the pilgrims sank down and fell over and died and the bleak and shrouded earth went trundling past the sun and returned again as trackless and as unremarked as the path of any nameless sisterworld in the ancient dark beyond. (''[[The Road]]'', 2006)

== In film ==
* "But all you have to do is knock on any door and say, 'If you let me in, I'll live the way you want me to live, and I'll think the way you want me to think,' and all the blinds'll go up and all the windows will open, and you'll never be lonely, ever again." (''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'', 1960, [[Spencer Tracy]] as "Henry Drummond")
* "And the Germans will not be able to help themselves from imagining the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the Germans will talk about us. And the Germans will fear us. And when the Germans close their eyes at night, and their subconscious tortures them for the evil they’ve done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with." (''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', 2009, [[Brad Pitt]] as "Lieutenant Aldo Raine")&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ft7kkXO98c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antonym==
It can be contrasted with [[asyndeton]], which is a coordination containing no conjunctions often manipulating the rhythm of a passage in the attempt to make a thought more memorable, and [[syndeton]], which is a coordination with one conjunction.

Two examples of asyndeton:

* "[[Veni, vidi, vici]]" ([[Julius Caesar]])&lt;ref name=Glossary&gt;{{cite web|title=A Glossary of Rhetorical Terms with Examples|url=http://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms#13|work=Modern &amp; Classical Languages, Literatures &amp; Culture|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardships, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty." ([[J. F. Kennedy]], [[inaugural address of John F. Kennedy|inaugural address]], 1961)&lt;ref name=Glossary /&gt;

An example of syndeton:

* "You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom, and chuckled at catastrophe". ([[Wizard of Oz (character)|The Wizard]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', 1939)

[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Light]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] founded the College of New Jersey in 1746 in order to train ministers.&lt;ref name = Princeton&gt;{{cite web | title = Princeton University 250th Anniversary Celebration Collection|url= http://findingaids.princeton.edu/collections/AC180/#description |work= Library Finding Aids|publisher= Princeton University |accessdate= 11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was the educational and religious capital of Scottish Presbyterian America. In 1754, trustees of the College of New Jersey suggested that, in recognition of Governor [[Jonathan Belcher]]'s interest, Princeton should be named as Belcher College. Belcher replied: "[[belching|What a name]] that would be!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=1933 |page=487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uhJbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=jonathan+belcher++++princeton++what+the+hell+of&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_0vYwy0gtt&amp;sig=6_AUl6-04_GJUFx8PIDz3_R7hDU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI7NO0-KC9xwIVAx8eCh0Yfwbj#v=onepage&amp;q=jonathan%20belcher%20%20%20%20princeton%20%20what%20the%20hell%20of&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1756, the college moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was [[Nassau Hall]], named for the royal [[House of Orange-Nassau]] of [[William III of England]].

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five [[President of Princeton University|presidents]], [[John Witherspoon]] became president in 1768 and remained in that office until his death in 1794. During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for secular leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jeffry H | last = Morrison | title = John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the [[American Revolution]] and particularly the [[Battle of Princeton]], during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by [[George Washington]], fired [[cannon]] on the building to rout them from it.

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oberdorfer |first=Don |authorlink=Don Oberdorfer |publisher=Trustees of Princeton University |date=1995 |isbn=0-691-01122-2 |title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|page=24|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the [[United States capital|country's capital]] for four months.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires (1802 and 1855), Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin [[lion sculpture]]s that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall/&gt; Nassau Hall's bell rang after the hall's construction; however, the fire of 1802 melted it. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.&lt;ref name="apc-nassau-hall" /&gt;

[[James McCosh]] took office as the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = McCosh, James|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|pages = |url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html|oclc = 4193433|work = A Princeton Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the [[High Victorian Gothic]] style to the campus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; McCosh Hall is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=apc-nassau-hall /&gt;

In 1879, the first thesis for a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] Ph.D. was submitted by James F. Williamson, Class of 1877.

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=April|title=When Did the College of New Jersey Change to Princeton University?|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/mudd/2015/07/when-did-the-college-of-new-jersey-change-to-princeton-university/|website=Mudd Manuscript Library Blog|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university. In 1900, the Graduate School was established.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oberdorfer |first=Don |authorlink=Don Oberdorfer |publisher=Trustees of Princeton University |date=1995 |isbn=0-691-01122-2 |title=Princeton University: The First 250 Years|pages=268–269|edition=First|chapter=A Princeton Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, [[Woodrow Wilson]], graduate of the Class of 1879, was elected the 13th president of the university.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Under Wilson, Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept in the US that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.

In 1906, the reservoir [[Lake Carnegie]] was created by [[Andrew Carnegie]].&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; A collection of historical photographs of the building of the lake is housed at the [[Seeley G.

While always independent of the university, the Institute for Advanced Study occupied offices in Jones Hall for 6 years, from its opening in 1933, until its own campus was finished and opened in 1939. This helped start an incorrect impression that it was part of the university, one that has never been completely eradicated.

In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates. In 1887, the university actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in [[Turkish history]] in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study "critical languages" in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.

As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by Sally Frank, [[Eating club (Princeton University)|Princeton's eating clubs]] were required to go coeducational in 1991, after [[Tiger Inn]]'s appeal to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Associated Press | title = Princeton Eating Club Loses Bid to Continue Ban on Women | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | date = January 23, 1991 | page = A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of "Old Nassau" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/nyregion/princeton-song-goes-coed.html | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1987-03-01 | title = Princeton song goes coed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009-11, Princeton professor [[Nannerl O. Keohane]] chaired a committee on undergraduate women's leadership at the university, appointed by President [[Shirley M.

===Cannon Green===

[[File:Cannon Green Princeton c1909.jpg|thumb|Cannon Green ca. 1909, with East Pyne, Whig and Clio Halls]]

Buried in the ground at the center of the lawn south of Nassau Hall is the "Big Cannon," which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the [[Battle of Princeton]]. It remained in Princeton until the [[War of 1812]], when it was taken to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=1 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |location=Philadelphia |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. It was removed to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students in 1838 and buried in its current location in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J.

A second "Little Cannon" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|Whig Hall]]. This cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of [[Rutgers University]] in 1875. The theft ignited the [[Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War]]. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hageman |first=John Frelinghuysen |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions|volume=2|year=1879|edition=2nd|publisher=J.

Princeton has six undergraduate [[residential college]]s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior [[Resident assistant|resident advisers]]. Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenities—such as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkrooms—and a collection of administrators and associated faculty. Two colleges, [[Wilson College, Princeton University|Wilson College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.

Rockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.

Wilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the "New New Quad") before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, including "waffle ceilings", the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four-year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].

Forbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Princeton Companion|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|chapter = West, Andrew Fleming|oclc = 4193433|chapter-url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html}}{{Self-published inline|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes currently houses over 400 undergraduates and a number of resident graduate students in its residential halls.

In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.

The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/TNEQ_a_00090#.VGSgkJOsUk8 |first=Benjamin |last=Sacks |title=Harvard's "Constructed Utopia" and the Culture of Deception: The Expansion toward the Charles River, 1902-1932 |publisher=The New England Quarterly | date= June 2011 | accessdate =November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the GC was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]]. Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated1" /&gt; The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]]. The attached New Graduate College departs in its design from Collegiate Gothic; it is reminiscent of the former dormitories of Butler College, the newest of the five pre-Whitman residential colleges.

Today, the Triangle Club performs its annual freshmen revue, fall show, and Reunions performances in McCarter. McCarter is also recognized as one of the leading regional theaters in the United States.

====Art Museum====
{{main|Princeton University Art Museum}}

[[File:Art Museum Princeton.JPG|thumb|left|The Art Museum]]

The [[Princeton University Art Museum]] was established in 1882 to give students direct, intimate, and sustained access to original works of art that complement and enrich instruction and research at the university. This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.

Numbering over 92,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the [[Mediterranean]] regions, Western Europe, China, the United States, and Latin America. There is a collection of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], including [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in [[Antioch]]. [[Medieval]] Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century, with masterpieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh, and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including iconic paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.

One of the best features of the museums is its collection of Chinese art, with important holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and [[calligraphy]]. Its collection of [[pre-Columbian]] art includes examples of Mayan art, and is commonly considered to be the most important collection of pre-Columbian art outside of Latin America. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings and a comprehensive collection of over 27,000 original photographs. African art and Northwest Coast Indian art are also represented. The Museum also oversees the outdoor Putnam Collection of Sculpture.

==Demographics==
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
In 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other [[Ivy League]] schools. Sixteen percent of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. Caroline C. Pam of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' wrote that Princeton was "long dogged by a reputation for [[anti-Semitism]]" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students.&lt;ref name=PamCarolineJewish&gt;{{cite web|author=Pam, Caroline C.|url=http://observer.com/1999/05/enrollment-of-jews-at-princeton-drops-by-40-percent-in-15-years/|title=Enrollment of Jews at Princeton Drops by 40 Percent in 15 Years|publisher=''[[The New York Observer]]''|date=1999-05-31|accessdate=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time many Jewish students at Princeton dated Jewish students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] because they perceived Princeton as an environment where it was difficult to find romantic prospects; Pam stated that there was a theory that the dating issues were a cause of the decline in Jewish students.&lt;ref name=PamCarolineJewish/&gt;

==Organization==
The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the overall direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

With an endowment of $22.15 billion, Princeton University is among the wealthiest universities in the world. Ranked in 2010 as the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|third]] largest endowment in the United States, the university had the greatest per-student endowment in the world (over $2 million for undergraduates) in 2011.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite news |title = Colleges with the Biggest Endowment Per Student|year = 2011|work = CNBC.com|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130531100005/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|archive-date = May 31, 2013 |others = Praefcke, Andreas (photo credit)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a significant endowment is sustained through the continued donations of its alumni and is maintained by investment advisers.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news |title = Endowment Climbs Past $13 Billion|work = [[Dly.

==Academics==

[[File:University Library, Princeton University-LCCN2008679653.tif|thumb|left|East Pyne Hall, home to several departments in the [[humanities]], in a 1903 photo when it served as the University library]]

Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Required independent work is a hallmark of undergraduate education at Princeton. Students graduate with either the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).

The [[graduate school]] offers advanced degrees spanning the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and engineering. [[Doctorate|Doctoral education]] is available in most disciplines.&lt;ref name="degree programs"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.princeton.edu/main/academics/departments/|title = Departments &amp; Programs|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 19, 2015|date = October 1, 2015}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in architecture, engineering, finance, and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.

===Undergraduate===

[[File:McCosh 50 (front).jpg|thumb|McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus]]

Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a "precept." To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as "junior papers." Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/|title = About Us|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 19, 2015|at = Role of Honor Committee|website = Honor Committee|date = May 19, 2015}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|title = Honor Code|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = June 1, 2011 |website = The Student Guide to Princeton|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074938/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|archivedate = June 15, 2010}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}} {{Dead link |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68|title = Honor Code|type = YouTube video|year = 2008|others = music and lyrics by Peter Mills|access-date = October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|title = Committee on Discipline|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|website = ODUS: Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students|date = August 25, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103152504/http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/pages/sources/|title = Acknowledging Your Sources|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|date = August 2011|website = Academic Integrity}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool, effectively ending the school's [[early decision]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url = https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/86/07G08/|title = Princeton to end early admission|date = September 18, 2006|accessdate = October 25, 2015|publisher = Princeton University}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, following decisions by the [[University of Virginia]] and [[Harvard University]] to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute an [[early action]] program, starting with applicants for the Class of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |url = https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S29/85/15K32/index.xml|title = Princeton to reinstate early admission program|date = February 24, 2011|accessdate = October 25, 2015 |publisher = Princeton University}}{{Self-published source|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[American City Business Journals|''The Business Journal'']] rated Princeton as the most selective college in the Eastern United States in terms of admission selectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Thomas |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2011/12/princeton-is-most-selective-college-in.html|title = Princeton is the most selective college in the Eastern US|publisher = [[Bus.

====Grade deflation policy====
[[File:Einstein_classroom.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Room 302 is a lecture hall at [[Frist Campus Center]] restored to its condition when [[Albert Einstein]] taught there]]

In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, implemented a grade deflation policy to curb the number of A-range grades undergraduates received.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/12/02/24601/|publisher=''The Daily Princetonian''|title=On grade deflation|year=2009|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as a larger percentage of the student body received them.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school.&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally,&lt;ref name="On grade deflation"/&gt; but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/22law.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1277406249-7I3hc765HdqNtR0HmzFjDw|work=New York Times|title=In Law Schools, Grades Go Up, Just Like That|accessdate=June 24, 2010 | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | date=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bakadesuyo.com/does-obvious-grade-inflation-hurt-students|publisher=Barking up the wrong tree|title=Does Obvious Grade Inflation Hurt Students|year=2010|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped down at the end of the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/education/31princeton.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=At Princeton University, Grumbling About Grade Deflation|accessdate=January 28, 2011 | first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, a faculty committee tasked by Dean of the College [[Valerie Smith (academic)|Valerie Smith]] to review the effectiveness of grade deflation found not only that the 35% target was both often misinterpreted as a hard quota and applied inconsistently across departments, but also that grades had begun to decline in 2003, the year before the policy was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Nicole|title=No more A quotas: Faculty committee recommends Princeton University change its grading policy |url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/08/no_more_a_quotas_faculty_committee_recommends_princeton_university_change_its_grading_policy.html|accessdate=5 June 2015 |work=nj.com|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|title=Princeton University - Valerie Smith appointed president of Swarthmore College|website=www.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316001345/http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S42/45/30C97/index.xml?section=topstories|archivedate=March 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee concluded that the observed lower grades since 2003 were the result of discussions and increased awareness during and since the implementation of the deflation policy, and not the deflation targets themselves, so recommended removing the numerical targets while charging individual departments with developing consistent standards for grading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report from the Ad Hoc Committee to Review Policies Regarding Assessment and Grading |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S40/73/33I92/PU_Grading_Policy_Report_2014_Aug.pdf|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed as recommended by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Windemuth|first1=Anna|title=After faculty vote, grade deflation policy officially dead |url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2014/10/breaking-after-faculty-vote-grade-deflation-policy-officially-dead/|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=The Daily Princetonian|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate===

The [[Princeton University Graduate School|Graduate School]] has about 2,600 students in 42 academic departments and programs in social sciences, engineering, natural sciences, and humanities. These departments include the [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]], [[Princeton University Department of History|Department of History]], and [[Princeton University Department of Economics|Department of Economics]].

In 2017-8, it received nearly 11,000 applications for admission and accepted around 1,000 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Admission Statistics|url=https://gradschool.princeton.edu/about/statistics/admission-statistics|website=Princeton University|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University also awarded 319 Ph.D. degrees and 170 final master's degrees. Princeton has no [[medical school]], [[law school]], [[business school]], or [[school of education]]. (A short-lived [[Princeton Law School]] folded in 1852.) It offers professional graduate degrees in architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy, the last through the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], founded in 1930 as the School of Public and International Affairs and renamed in 1948 after university president (and U.S. President) [[Woodrow Wilson]].

University housing is guaranteed to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98% of students live on campus in dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193259/http://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 17, 2008 |title=Housing and Dining |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshmen and sophomores must live in [[residential college]]s, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities.
The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.

Princeton hosts two [[Model United Nations]] conferences, PMUNC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmunc.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321211627/http://www.pmunc.org/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 21, 2005|title=Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC)|accessdate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall for high school students and PDI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonirc.org/|title=Princeton Interactive Crisis Simulation (PICSIM)|accessdate=June 25, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820185207/http://www.picsim.org/|archivedate=August 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spring for college students. It also hosts the Princeton Invitational Speech and Debate tournament each year at the end of November. Princeton also runs Princeton Model Congress, an event that is held once a year in mid-November. The four-day conference has high school students from around the country as participants.

Although the school's admissions policy is [[need blind]], Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities |accessdate=October 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826131543/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions "the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity," but goes on to say that "still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus."

==Athletics==

[[File:Princeton University Cleo tiger.jpg|thumb|left]]

Princeton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides "a variety of physical education and recreational programs" for members of the Princeton community. According to the athletics program's mission statement, Princeton aims for its students who participate in athletics to be "'student athletes' in the fullest sense of the phrase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |title = Princeton University Mission Statement |accessdate = Jun 1, 2011 |author = Princeton Athletic Communications |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111223084238/http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |archivedate = December 23, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/main/campuslife/athletics/ |title=Athletics &amp; Fitness |accessdate= Jun 1, 2011 | publisher = Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton's colors are orange and black. The school's athletes are known as ''Tigers'', and the mascot is a tiger. The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2007/09/11/18534/ |title=Mascot revamped but still 'The Tiger' | first =Esther | last = Breger |date=Sep 11, 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian | accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Tigers men's basketball|men's basketball program]] is noted for its success under [[Pete Carril]], the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nba.com/coachfile/pete_carril/ |title= Pete Carril |publisher=NBA |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril introduced the [[Princeton offense]], an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.&lt;ref name= carril-nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Carril Is Yoda to Notion of Perpetual Motion | first =John | last = Branch |newspaper=The New York Times |date= Mar 30, 2007 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/30carril.html |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat [[UCLA]], the defending national champion, in the opening round of the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996 NCAA tournament]],&lt;ref name = carril-nyt /&gt; in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/ncaatourneyupset.html | title= When underdogs dance | publisher = ESPN | accessdate = Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986–87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against [[Monmouth University]] on Dec 14, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap/_/id/253480163/monmouth-hawks-vs-princeton-tigers | title = Princeton loses lowest-scoring D-I game since 3-point line | agency = Associated Press | publisher = ESPN |date=Dec 15, 2005 | accessdate =Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men's [[water polo]] team is currently a dominant force in the Collegiate Water Polo Association, having reached the [[Final Four]] in two of the last three years. Similarly, the [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|men's lacrosse program]] enjoyed a period of dominance 1992–2001, during which time it won six national championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usila.org/NCAAChampionHistory.htm |title=The NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship, formerly known as the Wingate Memorial Champion | publisher= US Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association | accessdate = Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club and intramural===

[[File:Princeton students after a freshman vs. sophomores snowball fight in 1893.jpg|thumb|Princeton students after a freshman vs. sophomores snowball fight in 1893]]

In addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts about 35 club sports teams.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main /&gt; [[Princeton Rugby|Princeton's rugby team]] is organized as a club sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One of Princeton's oldest clubs flourishes | first =Ben | last = Laguna |date=Apr 3, 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |url = http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/04/03/20695/ |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, nearly 300 teams participate in intramural sports at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222000136/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = December 22, 2007 |title = The Student Guide to Princeton: Intramurals |publisher = Princeton University |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intramurals are open to members of Princeton's faculty, staff, and students, though a team representing a residential college or eating club must consist only of members of that college or club. Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |title=General Information |publisher=Princeton University Campus Recreation |accessdate=Jun 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301120351/http://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |archivedate=March 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games is [[Princeton Cannon Song]], the Princeton University [[fight song]].

[[Bob Dylan]] wrote "Day of The Locusts" (for his 1970 album ''[[New Morning#Day of the Locusts|New Morning]]'') about his experience of receiving an honorary doctorate from the University. It is a reference to the negative experience he had and it mentions the [[Brood X]] [[cicada]] infestation Princeton experienced that June 1970.

==="Old Nassau"===
{{main|Old Nassau}}
{{listen
 | filename = Old Nassau.ogg
 | title = Old Nassau
 | description = 
 | format = [[ogg]]
}}
"[[s:Old Nassau|Old Nassau]]" has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859. Its words were written that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck, and published in the March issue of the ''Nassau Literary Review'' (the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country). The words and music appeared together for the first time in ''Songs of Old Nassau'', published in April 1859. Before the Langlotz tune was written, the song was sung to ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'''s melody, which also fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/oldnassau2.asp| title=History of Old Nassau|accessdate=July 5, 2008 | publisher = Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Old Nassau does not only refer to the university's anthem. It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after [[William III of England|William III]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. When built, it was the largest college building in North America. It served briefly as the capitol of the United States when the Continental Congress convened there in the summer of 1783. By [[metonymy]], the term can refer to the university as a whole. Finally, it can also refer to a [[chemical reaction]] that is dubbed "[[Old Nassau reaction]]" because the solution turns orange and then black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed054p167.2 |title=The Old Nassau reaction | work = Journal of Chemical Education | publisher = ACS Publications and Division of Chemical Education | accessdate = February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4817">The '''professional skills tests''', also known as the '''QTS Skills Tests''', are computer-based tests in literacy and numeracy (and until 2012 also in ICT) which must be passed by anyone attempting to gain [[Qualified Teacher Status|qualified teacher status]] (QTS) in [[England]]. The tests must be passed before enrolling onto an initial teacher training course, such as the [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE), or the [[Bachelor of Education]] (BEd).

The goal of the tests is to "assess the core skills that teachers need to fulfil their professional role in schools, rather than the subject knowledge needed for teaching," and "to ensure all teachers are competent in numeracy and literacy, regardless of their specialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional skills tests|url=http://sta.education.gov.uk|publisher=HM Government (UK)|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information about the tests==
Official information about the tests is provided by the Department for Education: [http://sta.education.gov.uk/ Professional skills tests].

The [http://sta.education.gov.uk/professional-skills-tests/literacy-skills-tests literacy test] focuses on spelling, punctuation, grammar and comprehension. The test questions are randomly selected from a bank of standardised questions. The overall difficulty of the test varies, and the passmark is adjusted accordingly.

The [http://sta.education.gov.uk/professional-skills-tests/numeracy-skills-tests numeracy test] starts off with a section of 12 mental arithmetic questions, each with a strict time limit, though paper working is allowed. These questions are spoken through headphones and do not appear on the computer screen. This is followed by a section of 16 more complex questions, displayed on the screen, involving interpretation of statistical data and graphs, and problem solving. For this section of the test an on-screen calculator is supplied.

Practice tests which simulate the real tests can be accessed at [https://practice.skillstestbooking.com practice.skillstestbooking.com]. Access is open to anyone but a valid email address must be supplied.

Candidates are restricted to one attempt and two re-sits for each of the tests. If not successful after three attempts, a candidate can make a further attempts.

Candidates whose first language is not English, or who have a recognised special need (for example, dyslexia), are granted extra time to take the tests. Special arrangements are made in the case of visual or hearing impairment, or physical impairment.

Until April 2012 there was also an [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] skills test. The areas of [[Information and communications technology]] tested were word processing, spreadsheets, databases, e-mails, the Internet, and presentation software.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teacherstalk.co.uk/resources/qts-ict-test.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making arrangements to take the test==
The tests are administered by [[learndirect]] and take place in learndirect test centres around England. Registration and bookings are made using the website [https://www.skillstestbooking.com www.skillstestbooking.com]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The first attempt at each of the tests is free of charge, but learndirect charge a fee for re-sits.

The tests are conducted on computers in supervised environments. Candidates cannot take any materials, phones, watches, etc. into the test room. Paper is provided for doing mental calculations. The tests can be taken on the same day, or at different times depending on the availability of test slots.

==Skills tests in the wider United Kingdom==
The professional skills tests are only required for initial teacher training in England. Teachers training in [[Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teacher training and education in Wales FAQ|url=http://www.teachertrainingcymru.org/node/18|publisher=Teacher Training Cymru|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland]] or [[Northern Ireland]] do not have to take the tests.

The notion of rape culture was developed by [[second-wave feminist]]s, primarily in the United States, beginning in the 1970s. Critics of the concept dispute the existence or extent of rape culture, arguing that the concept is too narrow or that, although there are cultures where rape is pervasive, the idea of a rape culture can imply that the rapist is not at fault but rather the society that enables rape.

==Origins and usage==
The term "rape culture" was first coined in the 1970s in the United States by [[second-wave feminist]]s, and was applied to contemporary American culture as a whole.&lt;ref name="Smith2004 174"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Merril D.|title=Encyclopedia of Rape|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-32687-5|edition=1st|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, second-wave feminists had begun to engage in [[consciousness-raising]] efforts designed to educate the public about the prevalence of rape. Previously, according to Canadian psychology professor [[Psychology's Feminist Voices|Alexandra Rutherford]], most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating rarely happened.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape'' quoted in {{cite journal |title=Sexual Violence Against Women: Putting Rape Research in Context |author=Rutherford, Alexandra |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |doi=10.1177/0361684311404307 |date=June 2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=342–347 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/35/2/342.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of rape culture posited that rape was common and normal in American culture, and that it was one extreme manifestation of pervasive societal misogyny and sexism. Rape was defined as a crime of violence rather than a crime of sex as it had been before and the focus of rape shifted from desire for sexual pleasure to one of male domination, intimidation and a sense of control over gender norms.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller&gt;Brownmiller, Susan.

The first published use of the term appears to have been in 1974 in ''[[Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women]]'', edited by [[Noreen Connell]] and Cassandra Wilson&lt;!-- careful before wikilinking - currently leads to a singer --&gt; for the [[New York Radical Feminists]].&lt;ref name="FeministsConnell1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York Radical Feminists|author2=Noreen Connell|author3=Cassandra Wilson|title=Rape: the first sourcebook for women|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ej1BAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Rape+Culture%22|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=31 October 1974|publisher=New American Library|isbn=9780452250864|page=105|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book, the group stated that "our ultimate goal is to eliminate rape and that goal cannot be achieved without a revolutionary transformation of our society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faar-aegis.org/NovDec_74/review_NovDec74.html |title=Book Review: Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women (New York Radical Feminists) |author=Freada Klein |website=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |date=November–December 1974 |publisher=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book, along with [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s 1975 ''[[Against Our Will|Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape]]'', was among the earliest to include first-person accounts of rape.

The film explored how mass media and popular culture have perpetuated attitudes towards rape.&lt;ref name="Norsigian 29–30"/&gt;

In a 1992 ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'' paper entitled "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio suggested that the term originated as "rape-supportive culture" in Brownmiller's ''Against Our Will.''&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio, "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", ''Journal of Social Issues'', vol. 48, n. 1, 1992; published in Di Karen J. Maschke, "The legal response to violence against women",  Routledge 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-2519-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the phrase began to be used more widely in multiple forms of media.

==Overview==
Feminists and gender activists conceptualize rape culture as a cultural environment that encourages gender violence, as well as perpetuating "rape myths", ranging from treating rape as merely "rough sex" to blaming the victim for inviting rape.

[[Michael Parenti]] believes that rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as [[victim blaming]], reluctance by authorities to go against [[patriarchial]] cultural norms, as well as fears of [[stigmatization]] suffered by rape victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parenti|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Parenti |title= The Cultural Struggle|pages=71–79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIhkVEPmyTgC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;vq=rape%20culture&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2013|year=2005|publisher= Seven Stories Press|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 9781583227046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists{{who|date=October 2018}} posit that rape culture links non-consensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial worldviews, laced with [[misogyny]] and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape.

One explanation for the commonality of these myths is that only certain "bad" or "misbehaved" women are raped. This creates a category of women separated from the general population which encourages an "otherness" and reduces the idea that anyone is vulnerable to being raped.&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lonsway | first1 = Kimberly A. | last2 = Fitzgerald | first2 = Louise F. | year = 1994 | title = Rape Myths: In Review | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 133–64 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1994.tb00448.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herman1989&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Dianne F.|editor1-last=Freeman|editor1-first=Jo|title=Women: a feminist perspective|date=1989|publisher=Mayfield Pub. Co.|location=Mountain View, Calif.|isbn=9780874848014|edition=4th|chapter=The Rape Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common rape myth is that no event is random. This promotes the idea that the women who are raped were not raped for no reason, but that they deserved it. If women believe that they were the cause of the rape, they may not go to authorities.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Society also uses the stereotype of men being aggressive as an excuse for their actions. This justifies and normalizes rape. Society creates these myths, scaring women before they are even raped. Another reason for the acceptance of rape culture is the [[Just-world hypothesis|"just-world" hypothesis]] which claims that what happens to an individual in life is inherently tied to his or her actions and thus seen as justly deserved. People who believe in this theory would also be more likely to believe women who are raped deserve it in some way. Finally, rape can be attributed to ways women were treated historically, as a factor used to oppress and create control over women.&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994/&gt;

Brownmiller, in ''Against Our Will'', discusses three ideas that helped bring awareness to some clearly-defined rape myths of the early to mid 20th century. First, any woman can be a rape victim regardless of age, size, shape, ethnicity, or status. Second, any man can be a rapist, not just "evil" or "mentally ill" men as thought in previous decades. Finally, rape can occur in many different forms besides the stereotype of a violent, forceful rape done by a stranger.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;

The idea any women could be raped was a new proposition that called attention to the notion of victim blaming. Now that rape could affect anyone, there would not be a proper way for men and women to avoid it. Some rape myths that were widely accepted on the basis of what kind of women would be raped were ideas that the victim was always "young, careless [and] beautiful" or they are "loose" women who "invite rape" by provoking men."&lt;ref name=Gordon1991&gt;Gordon, Margaret T., and Stephanie Riger. ''The Female Fear: The Social Cost of Rape''. Urbana: U of Illinois, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0029124901}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whatley1993&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whatley | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Riggio | first2 = R. E. | year = 1993 | title = Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims | url = | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 502–11 | doi=10.1177/088626093008004005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brownmiller's idea about victim blaming was supposed to expose rape myths thus eradicating victim-blaming, blaming the victim in rape circumstances is still a common practice.

Rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the sexual violence of select individuals and cast them off as deviant perverts rather than acknowledging that anyone can be capable of rape. In the 1960s, rapists were often seen as mentally ill or deviants in society, and this view persisted among some people into the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt; 

As related to Brownmiller's final point about different forms of rape, a common non-believed "rape myth" was the idea of spousal rape or partner rape. Rape myths had suppressed the incidence of such events now known as "intimate partner rape"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bandbacktogether.com/intimate-partner-rape-resources/ |title=Intimate Partner Rape Resources |publisher=Band Back Together |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122010024/http://bandbacktogether.com/intimate-partner-rape-resources/ |archivedate=22 January 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[marital rape]]"; at one time, the view was that women could never claim to be raped by a spouse. Rape cases in which both parties previously knew one another has been coined "[[acquaintance rape]]", a term first coined by Robin Warshaw in 1988, and subsequently used by prominent academics such as Mary P. Koss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warshaw|first1=Robin|title=I Never Called It Rape|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gGJHAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780060551261|date=1988-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris O'Sullivan teaches that acts of [[sexism]] are commonly employed to validate and [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalize]] normative [[misogyny|misogynistic]] practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being, or a rape victim might be blamed for being raped because of how she dressed or acted.  O'Sullivan examines rape culture and fraternities, identifying the socialization and social roles that contribute to sexual aggression, and looks at "frat life" and brotherhood ideals of competition and camaraderie. In these groups, sex is viewed by young men as a tool of gaining acceptance and bonding with fellow "brothers", as they engage in contests over sex with women.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, ''Transforming a Rape Culture,'' edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R.

To some, the root cause of rape culture is the "domination and objectification of women".&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=127046 |title=Sexual Face of Violence: Rapists on Rape (abstract) |author=Vogelman, L. |publisher=Raven Press Ltd (book); National Criminal Justice Reference Service (abstract) |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Rape culture is a fluid and always-changing entity that is socially produced and socially legitimated, so throughout time and place its definitions will change.

Since the late 20th century, researchers and activists have repeatedly returned to the issue of rape culture on university campuses, especially in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. Often, victims are dissuaded from reporting sexual assaults because of universities' and colleges' ambivalent reactions to rape reports and desire to suppress bad news. Victims may not want to risk stigmatization and scrutiny in their lives, especially in campus society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Irina|last2=Doherty|first2=Kathy|title= Accounting for Rape|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victim-hood is a social creation, and is associated with stigma. Definitions of what counts as "rape" and who is treated as a "genuine victim" are constructed in discourse and practices that reflect the social, political, and cultural conditions of society. For instance, rape victims may not be considered as such if it appears they did not struggle or put up a fight. Their emotional responses are observed and reported during investigations to aid in deciding if the victim is lying or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Irina|last2=Doherty|first2=Kathy|title= Accounting for Rape|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, college administration officials have sometimes questioned accounts of victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventive legislation as the [[Clery Act]], which requires colleges to report on crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/campus_inq/Feds-launch-investigation-into-Swarthmores-handling-of-sex-assaults.html|title=Feds launch investigation into Swarthmore's handling of sex assaults|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_d684d872-1e7e-11e3-978b-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Annual campus crime report may not tell true story of student crime|work=[[Daily Nebraskan]]|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape culture is closely related to [[slut-shaming]] and [[victim blaming]], in which rape victims are considered at fault for being raped. Scholars argue that this connection is made due to a culture that shames all female sexuality that is not for the purpose of reproduction in a hetero-normative married household.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt; That some victims do not report rapes to the police due to fear of not being believed is often cited as a symptom of a rape culture.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt;&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news |title=Rape culture is real |url=http://cupwire.ca/articles/47672 |author=Ketterling, Jean |newspaper=The Xaverian Weekly |publisher=Canadian University Press |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of women who did not report rape said it was because of fear of not being believed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Backman |first1=Ronet  |last2= |first2= |year=1988 |title=The factors related to rape reporting behavior and arrest: new evidence from the National Crime Victimization Survey |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=8 |doi= |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/25/1/8.abstract |accessdate=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming is part of a phenomenon known as 'Rape Myth Acceptance,' a term coined by researcher Martha Burt in the 1980s. It is defined as prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists which can range from trivializing rape, [[denial]] of widespread rape, labeling an accuser as a liar, stating that most rape accusations are false, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or accepting that the victim "deserved it" because she was defined as a slut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wcsap.org/sites/www.wcsap.org/files/uploads/documents/RapeMyths2007.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111120222031/http://wcsap.org/sites/www.wcsap.org/files/uploads/documents/RapeMyths2007.pdf|dead-url = yes|archivedate = 20 November 2011|title = RAPE MYTHS|date = May 2001|accessdate = |website = www.wcsap.org|publisher = |last = Anderson|first = Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause of victim blaming has been the vague understanding of what constitutes rape in the scenario of a victim wanting to have sex with the perpetrator. If a victim wants to have sex but refuses to consent to sex and the perpetrator continues, the situation would be considered rape; however, it becomes easier for others to blame the victim for the situation because he or she did "want to have sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality: Interdisciplinary Readings|last=Moore|first=Newlyn B.|last2=Davidson, Sr.|first2=J. Kenneth|last3=Fisher|first3=Terri D.|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780195389494|location=New York|pages=358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of [[pornography]], which is seen as an expression of a culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis|first=Ellen|title=Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/nyls38&amp;div=26&amp;id=&amp;page=|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of rapists often feature fusion of several pornographic motifs.&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt; 

[[Prison rape]] is a topic about which jokes are abundant. Linda McFarlane, director of [[Just Detention International]], states "Humor is part of the cultural attitude that (prison) is the one place where rape is okay."&lt;ref name=Clark2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/141594/why_does_popular_culture_treat_prison_rape_as_a_joke|title=Why Does Popular Culture Treat Prison Rape As a Joke?|author=Anna Clark|date=16 August 2009|website=Alternet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexualization ===
[[Sexualization]] and [[sexual objectification]] are practices that contribute to the normalization of hyper-sexualized perceptions of women, which is a theme in rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suarez|first=Eliana|last2=Gadalla|first2=Tahany M.|date=11 January 2010|title=Stop Blaming the Victim: A Meta-Analysis on Rape Myths|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=25|issue=11|pages=2010–2035|doi=10.1177/0886260509354503|pmid=20065313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hald|first=Gert Martin|last2=Malamuth|first2=Neil M.|last3=Yuen|first3=Carlin|date=1 January 2010|title=Pornography and attitudes supporting violence against women: revisiting the relationship in nonexperimental studies|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=36|issue=1|pages=14–20|doi=10.1002/ab.20328|pmid=19862768|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyper-sexualized or [[Pornography|pornographic]] media is often attributed with perpetuating aggressive behaviors and attitudes supporting violence against women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Media depictions of violent sexual activity are also noted to increase behavioral aggression.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Mike|last2=D'alessio|first2=Dave|last3=Brezgel|first3=Keri|date=1 December 1995|title=A Meta-Analysis Summarizing the Effects of Pornography II Aggression After Exposure|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=22|issue=2|pages=258–283|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1995.tb00368.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexualizing imagery surfaces and reinforces misogynistic beliefs in some instances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This media can come in forms of movies, music, advertising, video games and more.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asking For It: The Alarming Rise of Rape Culture-and What We Can Do About It|last=Harding|first=Kate|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7382-1702-4|location=Boston, MA|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victim blaming and slut shaming===
''[[Victim blaming]]'' is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime is partially or entirely attributed as responsible for the transgressions committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Emilie|title=Boxelder bug variations : a meditation on an idea in language and music|year=1985|publisher=Milkweed Editions|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=978-0915943067}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a victim of a crime (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggest that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim her or his own fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Cole | first1 = Jennifer | last2 =Logan | first2 = T.K. | title = Negotiating the challenges of multidisciplinary responses to sexual assault victims: sexual assault nurse examiner and victim advocacy programs |journal=Research in Nursing and Health | date = February 2008 | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–85 |doi=10.1002/nur.20234| pmid = 18163392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fehler-Cabral|first1=Giannina | last2 =Campbell | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Patterson | first3= Debra | title = Adult sexual assault survivors' experiences with sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]]| date = December 2011 |volume=26|issue=18 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511403761 |pmid=21602203 | pages=3618–3639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming may also occur among a victim's peers, and college students have reported being ostracized if they report a rape against them, particularly if the alleged perpetrator is a popular figure or noted athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Reddington |first1 =Frances P.

''[[Slut shaming]]'' is a variant on victim blaming, to do with the shaming of sexual behavior. It describes the way people are made to feel guilty or inferior for certain sexual behaviors or desires that deviate from traditional or orthodox gender expectations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A study of college women from sociologists at the University of Michigan and the University of California found that slut-shaming had more to do with a woman's social class than it did with their activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Taylor |first1 = Marisa | url= http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/29/slut-shaming-study.html | title= Slut-shaming has little to do with sex, study finds | website = america.aljazeera.com | publisher = [[Al Jazeera America]] | date=29 May 2014 | accessdate= 6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slut shaming can create a double standard between men and women and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/journals/SPQ/Jun14SPQFeature.pdf|title=Good Girls: Gender, Social Class, and Slut Discourse on Campus|last=Armstrong|first=Elizabeth|date=2014|website=American Sociological Association|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SlutWalk]] movement aims to challenge victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wavaw.ca/slutwalk-vancouver-a-march-to-end-rape-culture/ | title=SlutWalk Vancouver: A march to end rape culture | website = wavaw.ca | publisher = Women Against Violence Against Women | date = 29 May 2013| accessdate= 23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape culture has been described as detrimental to both women and men. Some writers and speakers, such as [[Jackson Katz]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and [[Don McPherson]], have said that it is intrinsically linked to [[gender role]]s that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Katz, "Tough Guise" videorecording, Media Education Foundation, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]], victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Heldke |first1= Lisa |last2= O'Connor |first2= Peg|title= Oppression, Privilege, &amp; Resistance|year=2004|publisher= McGraw Hill|location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others link rape culture to modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be "rape free" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and become visible in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that result in their using rape to suppress women.&lt;ref name="Odem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odem|first1=Mary E.|last2=Clay-Warner|first2=Jody|title=Confronting Rape and Sexual Assault|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA111|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7|page=111}}

Others also link rape culture to environmental insecurities, where men objectify women as part of their struggle to control their immediate environment. It is also linked to gender segregation, and the belief that rape proves masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryle|first=Robyn|title=Questioning Gender: A Sociological Exploration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DK8086_VaGQC&amp;pg=482#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2011|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=978-1-4129-6594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manifestations of rape culture include [[denial]] of widespread rape,&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/172024/americas-rape-problem-we-refuse-admit-there-one |title=America's Rape Problem: We Refuse to Admit That There Is One |last= Valenti |first= Jessica  |date=4 January 2013  |publisher= [[The Nation]] |accessdate=4 February 2013}}

One concern is that the rape culture in the United States can influence juror decision-making in sexual assault trials. The result is that men who have committed sexual assault crimes may receive little to no punishment, which serves to strengthen the rape culture in the American judicial system and American society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hildebrand|first1=Meagen|last2=Najdowski|first2=Cynthia|title=The Potential Impact of Rape Culture on Juror Decision Making: Implications For Wrongful Acquittals in Sexual Assault Trials|journal=Albany Law Review|date=2015|volume=78|issue=3|pages=1059–1086}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the law as written not being put into effect in practice, legal definitions of rape have been criticized for placing a high burden of proof on victims to demonstrate non-consent.&lt;ref name= "Larcombe 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larcombe |first1=W |last2=Fileborn |first2=B |last3=Powell |first3=A |last4=Hanley |first4=N |last5=Henry |first5=N |title='I think it's rape and I think he would be found not guilty' focus group perceptions of (un) reasonable belief in consent in rape law |journal=Social and Legal Studies |date=2016 |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=611–629 |doi=10.1177/0964663916647442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals likely use legal definitions and jury convictions in their conceptualization of “real rape.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lynch |first1=KR |last2=Jewell |first2=JA |last3=Golding |first3=JM |last4=Kembel |first4=HB |title=Associations Between Sexual Behavior Norm Beliefs in Relationships and Intimate Partner Rape Judgments |journal=Violence Against Women |date=5 May 2016 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=426–51 |doi=10.1177/1077801216642871 |pmid=27153859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws, which are passed by (mostly male) lawmakers, tend to represent dominant groups' interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muehlenhard |first1=CL |last2=Peterson |first2=CD |last3=Humphreys |first3=TP |last4=Jozkowski |first4=KN |title=Evaluating the One-in-Five Statistic: Women's Risk of Sexual Assault While in College |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=4 April 2017 |volume=54 |issue=4–5 |pages=549-576 |doi=10.1080/00224499.2017.1295014 |pmid=28375675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larcombe et al.&lt;ref name= "Larcombe 2016" /&gt; posit "a legal definition of rape as non-consensual penetration achieved through unlawful force, coercion, fraud or exploitation – that is, containing a fault element that describes the tactic the perpetrator used to effect the assault – may conform more closely to social and social science definitions of rape."

=== Effects on women ===
According to Ann Burnett, the concept of rape culture explains how society perceives and behaves towards rape victims and rape perpetrators.&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burnett|first1=Ann|last2=Mattern|first2=Jody L.|last3=Herakova|first3=Liliana L.|last4=Kahl|first4=David H.|last5=Tobola|first5=Cloy|last6=Bornsen|first6=Susan E.|title=Communicating/Muting Date Rape: A Co-Cultural Theoretical Analysis of Communication Factors Related to Rape Culture on a College Campus|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|date=November 2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=465–485|doi=10.1080/00909880903233150}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a number of rape myths that are held are "no means yes", women can resist rape if they really wanted to, women who are raped are promiscuous therefore "asking to be raped" and many women falsely report rape to protect their own reputations or because they are angry at the "perpetrator" and want to create a type of backlash.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; A theory for why rape myths are so common in society is because they are perpetuated by norms already present in society. Researchers claim that communication and language is created by the dominant patriarchy. In positions of power, men control how women are portrayed in the media, women's censorship of body and voice, etc. which forces women to submit to the gender stereotypes formed by the dominant culture. The dominance of the male language in society creates the concept of a "slutty woman" and forces women to begin to monitor their behavior in fear of how they will be perceived within the rape culture.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

One effect rape culture has on women is their lack of understanding or a feeling of ambiguity surrounding the idea of consent and rape. Burnett's study followed college women's experiences of rape revealing that many students could not define what the term rape really meant, did not believe consent had to be verbal and felt sexual consent was always vague and hard to pinpoint.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Along with this were people believing women who had "allegedly been raped" were "asking for it" because of how they were dressed or their flirtatious behavior.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Women in the study also assumed that men expected sex in exchange for drinks or dinner bought earlier for the woman.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Because of their lack of awareness of what rape was and because of how they were acting/what they were wearing, women believed they had in some way provoked the rape to happen.&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Some women also did not report the rape if it did not fit the stereotypical version of rape, physical injury and force committed by a stranger. When raped by someone the individual knew, women felt less inclined to label the assault as rape.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, Dean G., Heidi S. Resnick, Benjamin E. Saunders, and Connie L. Best. "Chapter 10 Rape, Other Violence Against Women, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder." ''Adversity, Stress, and Psychotherapy''. Ed. Bruce P. Dohrenwend. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They could not, therefore, report the incident or rape because they were either confused about what had happened or believed it to be their own fault.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

After a rape has already occurred or after the victim acknowledged that she has been raped, women still did not report the incident because they felt it would ultimately hurt or punish them. Some reasons that women did not report their rape is because they did not want to bring attention to themselves, psychologically, they did not want to have to remember what had happened to them, and they did not want people to find out and gain a negative reputation.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Because of the existing rape myths mentioned above, women knew that reporting rape could potentially make them out to be a "slut" or "easy" and garnish a reputation that would affect how others perceived them.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = Susan T. | last2 = Kuriloff | first2 = Peter J. | last3 = Lottes | first3 = Ilsa | year = 1994 | title = Understanding attributions of blame in stranger rape and date rape situations: An examination of gender, race, identification, and students social perceptions of rape victims | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 19| pages = 1719–1734 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb01571.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women noted that they felt that they could not even admit the rape to friends and family they trusted most because they were so afraid of the repercussions.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt; Women felt that they would not be supported, would have their validity questioned or be blamed for the incidents that happened. As a result, rape can lessen women's trust in others and make them feel isolated.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

Another effect rape culture has on young women is a victim's self-reflection. After a rape, women reported feeling dirty, thought of themselves as slutty, and believed that they had "used or damaged goods." Women felt ashamed of themselves for what had happened and felt that they no longer fit the ideal "pure and virginal" stereotype that men want.&lt;ref name=Bell1994/&gt; Women's belief that they were somehow rotten and their feelings that no one would want to be with them after the rape created feelings of depression and anxiety amongst victims.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

If women do choose to discuss their rape with others, many still remain under scrutiny unless it is proven that they are telling the truth.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Men belonging to the college study reported that they felt the rape was validated if the woman had taken the accusation to court and then won. Only then was the rape taken seriously by men. Men were also more likely to victim blame than women for the rape, especially if the case was not reported. Women who chose not to tell or chose to tell only people who were close to her were often deemed liars or exaggerators when others found out about the rape.&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt; Because no legal action was attempted, onlookers often believed that the rape was "not a big deal" or "must not have happened."&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Without some kind of validation from a person in authority, rape, according to college students in the study, was believed to not be as prominent or affect as many women as was the reality.

Although there is a wide range of research on the consequences of sexual violence on victims, there is little information on the economic effect, especially for economically vulnerable victims such as Black and Latina women.&lt;ref name=Loya2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loya|first1=Rebecca M.|title=The Role of Sexual Violence in Creating and Maintaining Economic Insecurity Among Asset-Poor Women of Color|journal=Violence Against Women|date=2014|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1299–1320|doi=10.1177/1077801214552912|pmid=25288596}}&lt;/ref&gt; These consequences of sexual violence disproportionately harm these specific demographics, because they make up a large portion of the group afflicted by income-poverty and asset poverty. Simply being from one of these poverty backgrounds increases the risk of sexual violence and discourages victims from reporting a rape crime as there is less confidence in the police services and there is a higher crime rate in areas of poverty.&lt;ref name=Loya2014/&gt;

=== Effects on men ===
{{main|Toxic masculinity}}

"[[Toxic masculinity]]"—a concept posited by some feminist scholars—is a number of negative traits and expectations burdening men in society.

Most male rape victims would not come forward to the police or in a survey, out of feelings of shame. The male gender stereotype suggests that men should be tough enough to avoid rape, if raped by a man, or sexually driven enough to enjoy it, if raped by a woman. Men were less likely to report rape because they felt reporting it would undermine their masculinity. This was related to characteristics of submissiveness and weakness attributed to rape victims, opposite of gender stereotypes pertaining to men which focus on dominance and aggressiveness.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pino1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pino | first1 = Nathan W. | last2 = Meier | first2 = Robert F. | year = 1999 | title = Gender Differences in Rape Reporting | doi = 10.1023/A:1018837524712 | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 40 | issue = 11/12| pages = 979–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = Michelle | last2 = Mccartney | first2 = Samantha | year = 2003 | title = Effects of Gender and Sexuality on Judgements of Victim Blame and Rape Myth Acceptance in a Depicted Male Rape | url = | journal = Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 391–98 | doi=10.1002/casp.741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like female victims, male victims also fear the stigmatization associated with rape. When they do report, they are often met with disbelief, dismissiveness, or blame from police and other services.&lt;ref name=Struckman-Johnson1992&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Struckman-Johnson|first1=Cindy|last2=Struckman-Johnson|first2=David|title=Acceptance of male rape myths among college men and women|journal=Sex Roles|date=August 1992|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=85–100|doi=10.1007/BF00290011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this, men are less likely than women to reveal the nature of the assault having been sexual or fail to mention any genital contact. They are also more likely to deny and hide how the attack affected them emotionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1980 | title = Male Rape Victims: Noninstitutionalized Assault | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 137 | issue = 2| pages = 221–23 | doi=10.1176/ajp.137.2.221 | pmid=7352580 | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = A | last2 = Divasto | first2 = P | last3 = Jackson | first3 = R | last4 = Voorhees | first4 = D | last5 = Christy | first5 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male rape victims, in comparison to female victims, are more likely to blame themselves for the incident because they are thought to be more capable of fighting back or getting away from their attacker. 

Homosexual men, similar to heterosexual women, were made to feel like they had "asked for it" based on their behavior.&lt;ref name=Struckman-Johnson1992/&gt;

Men are more likely to believe myths about rape, dismiss the situation, or become assailants themselves because of the emphasis of what it means to be masculine in society.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pino1999/&gt; Dianne Herman found that date rape was most likely to occur when a man had requested or initiated the date, the man paid for the date, the man drove, when drinking took place and when the couple found themselves alone. Because of the effort put into the date, men often felt entitled to some payment in the form of sexual gratification. When this did not happen, men felt it was more acceptable to rape. Herman claims that the American dating system emphasizes men as possessors of females, who can be seen as sexual objects ready to be "paid for."&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;

Marilyn Frye has stated that to dismantle rape culture would require the undoing of more than just the normalization and tolerance of sexual assault and rape - it would require addressing gender stereotypes in a patriarchal society and relieving both genders from their pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frye | first1 = Marilyn | year = 1996 | title = The Necessity of Differences: Constructing a Positive Category of Women | url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 991–1010 | doi=10.1086/495128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a patriarchal society, men are expected to be dominant: strong, violent, sexual, and controlling. Women are expected to be submissive: weak, passive, decorative, and controllable. Men are socialized to believe they need to prove their masculinity by taking this control and dominating women. This is not only enforced by expectations of men to be dominant but also society's discouragement of men showing any emotions, vulnerability, or sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pino1999/&gt; This expectation is often traced back to cultural values of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plenary 2 – Redefining Gender Violence – Transcripts from Converge!

While research about rape culture has been mostly conducted in Westernized countries, particularly the United States,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} there are a number of other countries that have been described as "rape supportive" societies. These places have similarities to Western countries in terms of beliefs and gender stereotyping, but there are some significant differences that explain the high rate of rape and sexual assault in these less developed parts of the world.

===  In Pakistan ===
Violence against women is typical and the norm, especially marital abuse, as it is seen as a private matter not believed to be "appropriate for intervention or policy changes". Due to cultural beliefs, [[spousal abuse]] and especially rape is rarely considered a crime. This is due to Pakistan's [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society and gender roles that expect men to be violent and dominant and women to be fragile and weak. Religious norms familiar to Pakistan also embrace violence and discrimination toward women, emphasizing that women would not be able to live without men. Normalization of violence and rape against women continues to be reflected in high rates of rape in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Ali2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gavino|first2=MI|date=April 2008|title=Violence against women in Pakistan: a framework for analysis|url=http://jpma.org.pk/PdfDownload/1372.pdf|journal=JPMA. The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association|volume=58|issue=4|pages=198–203|pmid=18655430|last1=Ali|first1=PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main types of rape that are prevalent are political rapes and honor ([[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]) rapes. Beyond the typical type of assault for dominance and control, comes rape with the intention of revenge. Because women are not seen as individuals but rather as objects or possessions, rape is sometimes a political move to seek revenge against an enemy. Fights and feuds are settled by raping the rival's mother, wife, daughter or sister.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hermeneutics and honor: negotiating female "public" space in Islamic/ate societies|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Univ. Press|isbn=9780932885210|location=Cambridge, Mass.|last1=Afsaruddin|first1=Asma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honor rapes are used as a tactic to take away sometime of value belonging to the woman. Because women are seen as objects for men to possess, taking away her honor through rape diminishes her worth.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt;

Rape is rarely reported in Pakistan due to the inequality between the two genders.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt; Women do not speak out about rape because they want to uphold their family's honor. Similar to the honor rapes where value is taken from someone's wife, rapes can dishonor entire families. Women whose rapes are found out fear being ostracized or abandoned and disowned by their families. Victims of rape that are discovered might lose their families, their husbands and their homes. They think of themselves as bayghairate, a person without honor or someone who has lost self-respect, because of what has happened and do not want to be stigmatized or humiliated by their society. Women are highly discouraged from talking or reporting about their rape because of these reasons.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt;

One ambiguity that perpetuates the negative stereotype and reaction toward women rape victims is the blurred understanding between rape and [[adultery]]. When a married woman is raped by another man, if she reports it, the women herself has the high possibility of being charged with the crime of adultery and sent to jail.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt; Because women are thought to be submissive and obedient to their husbands, the Pakistani culture emphasizes the need and expectation for a wife to be faithful to her husband in all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt; Fear of being charged and punished for their own rape makes women keep quiet about their assaults. Women who do decide to report also face the possibility that they were raped by a government official or other law enforcement officer, thus diminishing the chance of the punishment for the perpetrator and increasing the chance of punishment for the victim.&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt;

=== In India ===
{{main|Rape in India}}
India has a rape culture rooted in both its traditional Indian culture as well as its British colonial legacy, which blames victims of rape, is sympathetic to perpetrators, and which treats women who have been raped as "damaged goods" who then suffer further afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patil|first1=Vrushali|last2=Purkayastha|first2=Bandana|title=The transnational assemblage of Indian rape culture|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=41|issue=11|date=19 May 2017|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/01419870.2017.1322707}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dhillon|first1=Amrit|title=Men blame women in western clothes: India's rape culture is thriving|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/lets-forget-what-we-said-five-years-ago-india-still-lives-with-a-rape-culture-20171207-h00ygg.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Smita|title=India's rape crisis is worsening, and there still isn't a national registry for sex offenders|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2017/03/10/india-rape-crisis-sex-offender-registry-561757.html|work=Newsweek|date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are laws on the books to protect victims of rape, these laws are often not enforced, especially when the perpetrator is from a more powerful caste or is wealthier than the person who was raped, there is often a failure to properly gather evidence from rape victims and to care for them afterwards, and there is little legal assistance for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Everyone Blames Me": Barriers to Justice and Support Services for Sexual Assault Survivors in India|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors|work=Human Rights Watch|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnan|first1=Kavita|title=Rape Culture and Sexism in Globalising India - Sur - International Journal on Human Rights|journal=Sur - International Journal on Human Rights|date=3 December 2015|volume=12|issue=22|pages=255–259|url=http://sur.conectas.org/en/rape-culture-and-sexism-in-globalising-india/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some rural areas which operate outside the legal system the punishment for rape and murder can be something as trivial as 100 sit ups or push ups. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/2145393/india-where-punishment-rape-and-murder-includes-100-sit-ups&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape has also been used as a form of punishment in India as well extrajudicially. A famous example is the [[Kunan Poshpora incident]] where the soldiers of the [[Indian Army]] gang raped between 100-150 women as a form of punishment for their village being allegedly complicit in separatist activity, the Indian state did not charge anyone as of yet for this crime and has instead discredited those who have leaked this citing it as "baseless", showing a form of victim blaming on a state level. &lt;ref&gt;https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/all-these-years-later-do-not-forget-the-kunan-poshpora-mass-rapes/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/docid/467fca501a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rape is also done to intimidate communities, for example, the [[Kathua rape case]] where an 8-year-old girl named Asifa Bano who belonged to the nomadic [[Bakarwal]] community was abducted, drugged, tortured and then gang-raped inside a [[Hindu]] temple before being murdered and having her body disposed of in a forest. This act was done by local villagers with the help and participation of police officers. Following the discovery of the dead body there was then a classic example of victim-blaming when members of a local religious group, the Hindu Ekta Manch, led a protest in support of the accused which was attended by two local politicians in the [[BJP]]; India's current ruling party. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/kathua-rape-case-jammu-bar-association-calls-for-protest-on-thursday-118041100455_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/mar/03/kathua-rape-and-murder-case-amid-protests-in-support-of-accused-jammu-and-kashmir-government-says-1781586.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Certain states in India such as [[Haryana]], which borders the capital city [[New Delhi]] have a rape culture ingrained into the society where the victim is blamed if she is above 14 years of age and is then seen as having tarnished the family reputation. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thequint.com/videos/documentaries/rape-is-consensual-inside-haryanas-rape-culture&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the victim is seen as the main reason behind the rape or is seen as equally at fault as the perpetrator. Rape is essentially seen as consensual according to [[Panchayati raj]]. 

According to NCRB 2015 statistics, [[Madhya Pradesh]] has the highest raw number of rape reports among Indian states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = NCRB data shows 95% rape victims in India known to offenders; Madhya Pradesh tops the list | url= http://www.firstpost.com/india/ncrb-data-shows-95-rape-victims-in-india-known-to-offenders-3433136.html| location = Chennai, India | work = [[FirstPost]] | date = 9 May 2017 | accessdate = 27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jodhpur]] has the highest per capita rate of rape reports in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = NCRB Report: These 6 Indian cities have the highest rate of crimes against women| url= http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/ncrb-report-2015-six-indian-cities-most-unsafe-for-women-3005926/ | location = Chennai, India | work = [[The Indian Express]] | date = 1 September 2016 | accessdate = 27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women and girls in the [[BIMARU]] region of North India are more vulnerable to be raped than in states like [[Kerala]] which has the highest HDI, literacy with a  more progressive and tolerant society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malhotra|first1=Aditi|title=A ‘Rape Map’ of India|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/01/03/a-rape-map-of-india/|work=WSJ|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In South Africa ===
In a study conducted by [[Rachel Jewkes]], Yandina Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell and Kristin Dunkle, men from the three districts in the [[Eastern Cape]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal]] provinces of South Africa were surveyed about rape. The prevalence among the men was high; about 1 in 4 men had raped another person, mostly young women.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jewkes | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Sikweyiya | first2 = Yandisa | last3 = Morrell | first3 = Robert | last4 = Dunkle | first4 = Kristin | year = 2011 | title = Gender Inequitable Masculinity and Sexual Entitlement in Rape Perpetration South Africa: Findings of a Cross-Sectional Study | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0029590 | pmid = 22216324 | pmc = 3247272 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = e29590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men said they had committed rape for a number of different reasons. Many raped women and young girls for "fun" or out of boredom. Gang rapes were also quite common amongst the men, about 1 in 5 men had participated in one, which reflected the society's belief that it was common and "what boys do". Drinking and peer pressure were also common reasons for raping. A majority claimed they had raped because they were punishing the women, either acquaintances or girlfriends, for having made them angry. Sub-areas and communities saw rape as a legitimate punishment for women and reasonable under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewkes|first1=Rachel|last2=Sikweyiya|first2=Yandisa|last3=Morrell|first3=Robert|last4=Dunkle|first4=Kristin|title=Why, when and how men rape: Understanding rape perpetration in South Africa|journal=South African Crime Quarterly|date=8 March 2016|issue=34|doi=10.17159/2413-3108/2010/v0i34a874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men also had sex with very young women or virgins in order to "cleanse themselves of diseases".&lt;ref name=Leclerc2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leclerc-Madlala | first1 = Suzanne | year = 2002 | title = On the Virgin Cleansing Myth: Gendered Bodies, AIDS and Ethnomedicine | url = | journal = African Journal of AIDS Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 87–95 | doi=10.2989/16085906.2002.9626548| pmid = 25871812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women were often targeted because they were virgins and because the men believed they were easy to overpower and would not report it. Men were not afraid of repercussions.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Researchers have attempted to explain the high rate of rape in South Africa and have connected it to the traditional and cultural norms embedded within the society. Certain norms like the belief of rape myths, the inequality between men and women, and the need to express their dominance made the rape appear justified to the assailants. Many began raping when they were young teenagers for entertainment, reflecting the notion that rape is a pastime for young men and boys.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Rape and sexual violence are also prevalent in South Africa because of confusion about what is to be regarded as rape. Certain acts of sexual coercion may not be legally distinguishable. While the criminal offense of rape is condemned by the society, many rapes or sexual assaults might not be recognized as such and thus are not thought to be unacceptable behavior.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Activist Pumla Dineo Gqola says that events like the rape trial of then Vice President and now President of South Africa, [[Jacob Zuma]] are not surprising and are a reflection of ideas of masculinity and femininity in contemporary South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Pumla Dineo Gqola.African Identities.

The high rate of rape in South Africa, combined with the inability of the criminal justice system and the healthcare system to contain the crisis, have been compared to a 'gender civil war'.{{by whom|date=June 2017}} The majority of women in South Africa are raped by people they know.

====University====

[[File:Herbert Baker clocktower, Rhodes University, 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Rhodes University.The picture was taken at an anti-rape march during 2004.]]
On 17 April 2016, a list of the names of 11 men and titled 'Reference List' was posted anonymously on [[Facebook]]. The post gave no descriptions or made any allegations. However, within a matter of time students, were able to connect what these students had in common which were rape allegations. The students demanded a suspension and investigation of the individuals on the list. The police were called to intervene in order to neutralize the protests at [[Rhodes University]]. This put rape in universities in the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Seddon. The Daily Maverick.‘We will not be Silenced’: Rape Culture, #RUReferencelist, and the University Currently Known as Rhodes.

====National protest====
On 6 August 2016, four women staged a silent protest at the [[Electoral Commission of South Africa|IEC]] results announcement ceremony. The protesters said that they could not be silent given the rape and gender-based violence in South Africa. Even though President [[Jacob Zuma]] was acquitted of the charges, the young protesters says that an acquittal does not mean the president is innocent due to the failure of the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-06-four-women-the-president-and-the-protest-that-shoock-the-election-results-ceremony|title=Four women, the president and the protest that shook the election results ceremony|first=Ra'eesa|last=Pather|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural values====
Cultural values stemming from traditional practices still influence South African rape culture. [[Ukuthwala]], also known as "wife abduction", is a traditional marriage practice in which a man kidnaps a young woman with the intent of convincing the girl and her family to agree to the marriage. There are examples of this happening in Hindu societies of India as well. Another belief, kusasa fumbi or [[sexual cleansing]], is the idea that having sex cleans the body, specifically from illnesses. A more specific type cleaning would be virgin cleansing, which is the belief that having sex with a virgin will eliminate deadly diseases such [[HIV/AIDS]]. Kusasa fumbi is a reflection of the indigenous medical views of the country.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leclerc2002/&gt;

===Societies without a rape culture===

There are societies in which rape is not culturally acceptable, in which there is no rape culture and in which rape is almost non-existent, such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, Andrew Lawrence (2007). [https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/1308/3291941.PDF?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Dissertation: Evaluating Theories of Sexual Violence Using Rape Offenses in the National Crime Victimization Survey and the National Incident Based Reporting System].

The culture is also [[matrilineal]], so inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter. The society of Minangkabau exhibits the ability of societies to lack rape culture without social equity of genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peletz|first1=Michael G.|title=The King Is Dead; Long Live the Queen!|journal=American Ethnologist|date=2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=39–41|doi=10.2307/3805147|jstor=3805147|doi-broken-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Some writers, academics and groups have disputed the existence or prevalence of rape culture or described the concept as harmful. Others believe that rape culture exists, but disagree with certain interpretations or analyses of it.

The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN), an anti-sexual violence organizations, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identified problems with an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, "In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainn.org/news-room/rainn-urges-white-house-task-force-to-overhaul-colleges-treatment-of-rape|title=RAINN Urges White House Task Force to Overhaul Colleges' Treatment of Rape|date=6 March 2014|website=RAINN.org|publisher=RAINN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, RAINN cites a study by David Lisak, which estimated that 3% of college men were responsible for 90% of campus rapes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Task Force to  Protect Students from Sexual Assault United States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women|url=https://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|website=rainn.org|accessdate=2 February 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators.  RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape "has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|title=WH Task Force Recommendations|date=28 February 2014|website=RAINN.org|publisher=RAINN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Camille Paglia]]&lt;ref&gt;Teitel, Emma (2013). "[http://www.macleans.ca/authors/emma-teitel/camille-paglia-on-rob-ford-rihanna-and-rape-culture/ Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture]", Macleans, 16 November 2013; URL accessed 16 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; has described concerns about rape culture as "ridiculous" and "[[neuroticism|neurotic]]", an artifact of [[bourgeois]] [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] ideologies that people are essentially good and that all social problems can be remedied with education. This rape culture concept is much to the detriment of young college-educated women she says. Paglia argues that said individuals are ill-prepared to anticipate or cope with the small minority of deeply [[evil]] people in the world, who simply don't care about following laws or obeying social convention. Moreover, Paglia says, feminist proponents of rape culture tend to completely ignore male victims of sexual assault.

Caroline Kitchens, in a 2014 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' titled "It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria" suggested that "Though rape is certainly a serious problem, there's no evidence that it's considered a cultural norm. ...On college campuses, obsession with eliminating 'rape culture' has led to censorship and hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchens, C. (2014). [http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria]. Time Magazine, 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Heather MacDonald suggested that "In a delicious historical irony, the baby boomers who dismantled the university's intellectual architecture in favor of unbridled sex and protest have now bureaucratized both."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H. (2008).  [http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html The Campus Rape Myth].  City Journal, Winter 2008, 18 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joyce E. Williams, "the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men".&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joyce E.|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|date=31 December 2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405183529|page=493|editor=George Ritzer |editor2=J. Michael Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common "one in four women will be raped in her lifetime" claim is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, "There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines."&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sommers |first=Christina Hoff |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Researching the "Rape Culture" of America |accessdate=4 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D5GgDDEZ?url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archivedate=21 December 2012 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommers and others&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"&gt;Gilbert, Neil. Realities and mythologies of rape. Society, Jan–Feb 1998 v35 n2 p356(7)&lt;/ref&gt; have specifically questioned Mary Koss's oft-cited 1984 study that claimed 1 in 4 college women have been victims of rape, charging it overstated rape of women and downplayed the incidence of men being the victims of unwanted sex. According to Sommers, as many as 73% of the subjects of Koss's study disagreed with her characterization that they had been raped,&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hb), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; while others have pointed out that Koss's study focused on the victimization of women, downplaying the significance of sexual victimization of men,&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"/&gt; even though its own data indicated one in seven college men had been victims of unwanted sex.&lt;ref name=robin&gt;Robin Warshaw, ''[[I Never Called It Rape]]'', Harper &amp; Row, 1988 ([http://www.union.edu/offices/dean/sart/campus/ cited here])&lt;/ref&gt; Sommers points out that Koss had deliberately narrowed the definition of unwanted sexual encounters for men to instances where men were penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hb), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers, such as [[bell hooks]], have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it is too narrowly focused; in 1984, she wrote that it ignores rape's place in an overarching "culture of violence".&lt;ref&gt;[[bell hooks]], ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', quoted in ''Feminism is for Everybody'' by bell hooks, {{ISBN|0-89608-628-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she contributed a chapter to a book on rape culture, focusing on rape culture in the context of patriarchy in black culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=hooks |first=bell |chapter=Seduced By Violence No More |title=Transforming a Rape Culture | editor1-last  =Buchwald | editor1-first =Emilie | editor2-last  =Fletcher | editor2-first =Pamela | editor3-last  =Roth | editor3-first =Martha |publisher=Milkweed Editions |year=1993 |isbn=978-0915943067 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a Canadian journalist, has been critical of feminist Mary Koss's discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that "rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture" as "remarkably [[Misandry|misandric]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barbara Kay|year=2014|title='Rape culture' fanatics don't know what a culture is|website=National Post|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140309204907/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/|dead-url=yes|archivedate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadaliyya]], an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, stating that [[orientalists]] had appropriated the term to promote [[racist]] [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men]], as well as [[stereotypes of South Asians]] in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports [[demonizing]] [[Middle Eastern]] and [[South Asia]]n men as "racially prone to rape" and similar tactics employed by the [[British Raj|British]] as part of a [[racist]] [[Indophobic]] [[propaganda]] campaign during the [[1857 rebellion]] casting resistance fighters as rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9371/orientalist-feminism-rears-its-head-in-india|title= Orientalist Feminism Rears its Head in India|last1= Gupta|first1= Amith|date=2 January 2013|website= Academic|publisher= Arab Studies Institute|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN conducted its 'Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific' in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unwomen-asiapacific.org/docs/WhyDoSomeMenUseViolenceAgainstWomen_P4P_Report.pdf|title=Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study's general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study's methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study's sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24713110|title=How many men in Asia admit to rape?|date=1 November 2013|website= Article|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SlutWalk ===
[[File:Toronto-Slutwalk.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The first SlutWalk in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], 3 April 2011]]
[[SlutWalk]] is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made 
by [[Toronto]] police officer Michael Sanguinetti on 24 January 2011.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/|title=SlutWalk Toronto|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While addressing the issue of [[campus rape]] at a [[York University]] safety forum, Sanguinetti said that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized".&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/940665--cop-apologizes-for-sluts-remark-at-law-school |title=Cop apologizes for 'sluts' remark at law school |work=Toronto Star |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Curtis |last=Rush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SlutWalk movement are credited with popularizing the term via mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2088234-1,00.html |title=Will SlutWalks Change the Meaning of the Word Slut? |author=Gibson, Megan |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture—which they define as a culture in which "sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable"—and to end [[slut-shaming]] and victim blaming.&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2011/09/23/slutwalk-joburg-takes-to-the-streets |title=Slutwalk Joburg takes to the streets |newspaper=Times LIVE |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |title=FAQ |publisher=Slutwalk NYC |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007174743/http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |archivedate=7 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary goal of this organization is to deconstruct the stigma that often comes with being a victim of rape or sexual assault. Ringrose and Renold said that "the stigma relates to the way women dress and behave, but in fact male sexual aggression is the problem".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringrose|first=Jessica|last2=Renold|first2=Emma|date=1 May 2012|title=Slut-shaming, girl power and 'sexualisation': thinking through the politics of the international SlutWalks with teen girls|journal=Gender and Education|volume=24|issue=3|pages=333–343|doi=10.1080/09540253.2011.645023|issn=0954-0253}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SlutWalk that took place in London promoted several different kinds of attire including lingerie, nipple, tassels, and T-shirts with slogans to demonstrate what women wear is not a form of consent for sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The SlutWalk of Philadelphia was rebranded as The March to End Rape Culture. The idea behind the name change is so the walk can be more inclusive and promotes more diversity in its participants, volunteers, and sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.generocity.org/march-to-end-rape-culture-broadens-message-with-name-change/ |title=March to end rape culture |publisher=generocity |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original SlutWalk took place in the city of [[Toronto, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto" /&gt; [[Amber Rose]] is also a figure in the United States where she holds her annual Amber Rose SlutWalk in Los Angeles, California while also raising awareness for empowerment and the Amber Rose Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amberroseslutwalk.com|title=Amber Rose SlutWalk|last=|first=|date=|website=Amber Rose SlutWalk|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slutwalk in Latin America|SlutWalks]]&amp;nbsp;have taken place in some conservative Catholic countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. According to&amp;nbsp;"Sex and the Barrio"&amp;nbsp;writers Edgerton and Sotirova, SlutWalk protests began in South America taking on the name&amp;nbsp;"[[Marcha de las Putas]]".&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2011/sex-and-the-barrio|title=Sex and the Barrio: A Clash of Faith in Latin America {{!}} World Policy Institute|website=www.worldpolicy.org|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are protesting the idea that women dressed in revealing clothing are asking to get raped. They held the walk in the South American capitol of Buenos Aires on 28 September 1990, a day that was named the Day for the Decriminalization of Abortion in Latin America.&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt; Due to the overwhelming Catholic influence, some SlutWalks have taken on an anti-Catholic tone in response to sermons, such as the one in [[Costa Rica]], where a leading clergyman preached that "Women should dress modestly to avoid being 'objectified'", adding that the purpose of sex is "fertilization".&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt; The march even reached the Cathedral of San Jose just as mass was concluding.&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt;

'''Sacred Harp''' singing is a tradition of sacred choral music that originated in [[New England]] and was later perpetuated and carried on in the [[American South]] of the United States. The name is derived from ''The Sacred Harp,'' a ubiquitous and historically important tunebook printed in [[shape notes]]. The work was first published in 1844 and has reappeared in multiple editions ever since.  Sacred Harp music represents one branch of an older tradition of American music that developed over the period 1770 to 1820 from roots in [[New England]], with a significant, related development under the influence of "revival" services around the 1840s. This music was included in, and became profoundly associated with, books using the [[shape note]] style of notation popular in America in the 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;David Warren Steel, "Shape-note hymnody," in ''Grove Music Online'' (Oxford UP: article updated 16 October 2013) [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2252332 Subscription Required]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred Harp music is performed ''[[a cappella]]'' (voice only, without instruments) and originated as [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian]] music.

== The music and its notation ==

The name of the tradition comes from the title of the shape-note book from which the music is sung, ''The Sacred Harp''. This book exists today in various editions, discussed below.

In shape-note music, notes are printed in special shapes that help the reader identify them on the [[scale (music)|musical scale]]. There are two prevalent systems, one using four shapes, and one using seven.  In the four-shape system used in ''The Sacred Harp'', each of the four shapes is connected to a particular syllable, ''fa'', ''sol'', ''la'', or ''mi'', and these syllables are employed in singing the notes,&lt;ref&gt;This is a simplified version of Guidonian solmization which was also used in Elizabethan England: see [[Solfège#Origin]]&lt;/ref&gt; just as in the more familiar system that uses ''do'', ''re'', ''mi'', etc. (see [[solfege]]). The four-shape system is able to cover the full musical scale because each syllable-shape combination other than ''mi'' is assigned to two distinct notes of the scale. For example, the C major scale would be notated and sung as follows:

[[Image:TheShapesOfShapeNoteSinging 4ShapeSystem.gif|center||600 px|The [[C major scale]] in [[shape notes]]]]

The shape for ''fa'' is a triangle, ''sol'' an oval, ''la'' a rectangle, and ''mi'' a diamond.

In Sacred Harp singing, pitch is not absolute. The shapes and notes designate degrees of the scale, not particular pitches. Thus for a song in the key of C, ''fa'' designates C and F; for a song in G, ''fa'' designates G and C, and so on; hence it is called a ''moveable "do"'' system.

When Sacred Harp singers begin a song, they normally start by singing it with the appropriate syllable for each pitch, using the shapes to guide them. For those in the group not yet familiar with the song, the shapes help with the task of [[sight reading]]. The process of reading through the song with the shapes also helps fix the notes in memory. Once the shapes have been sung, the group then sings the verses of the song with their printed words.

==Singing Sacred Harp music==
[[File:HollowSquareInSacredHarp.PNG|thumb|The hollow-square seating arrangement for Sacred Harp singing]]
Sacred Harp groups always sing [[a cappella]], that is to say, without accompanying instruments.&lt;ref&gt;In particular, no [[harp]]s are present. The term "Sacred Harp" is sometimes taken by singers to be a metaphor for the human voice (Anon. 1940, 127).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On a number of early historical recordings, a piano or parlor organ accompanied the singers. In the ensuing decades, the practice of using such instruments has evidently died out.&lt;/ref&gt;  The singers arrange themselves in a hollow square, with rows of chairs or pews on each side assigned to each of the four parts:  treble, [[Alto (voice)|alto]], [[tenor]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. The treble and tenor sections are usually mixed, with men and women singing the notes an octave apart.

There is no single leader or conductor; rather, the participants take turns in leading. The leader for a particular round selects a song from the book, and "calls" it by its page number. Leading is done in an open-palm style, standing in the middle of the square facing the tenors (see: ''[[Leading Sacred Harp music]]'').

The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] at which the music is sung is relative; there is no instrument to give the singers a starting point. The leader, or else some particular singer assigned to the task, finds a good pitch with which to begin and intones it to the group (see: ''[[Pitching Sacred Harp music]]''). The singers reply with the opening notes of their own parts, and then the song begins immediately.

The music is usually sung not literally as it is printed in the book, but with certain deviations established by custom; see [[Performance practice of Sacred Harp music]].

As the name implies, Sacred Harp music is [[sacred music]] and originated as Protestant Christian music. Many of the songs in the book are [[hymn]]s that use words, meters, and stanzaic forms familiar from elsewhere in Protestant [[hymn]]ody. However, Sacred Harp songs are quite different from "mainstream" Protestant hymns in their musical style: some tunes, known as [[fuguing tune]]s, contain sections that are [[polyphony|polyphonic]] in texture, and the [[harmony]] tends to deemphasize the interval of the [[interval (music)|third]] in favor of [[perfect fourth|fourths]] and [[perfect fifth|fifths]]. In their melodies, the songs often use the [[pentatonic scale]] or similar "gapped" (fewer than seven-note) scales.

In their [[musical form]], Sacred Harp songs fall into three basic types. Many are ordinary ''[[hymn tune]]s'', mostly composed in four-bar phrases and sung in multiple verses.  ''[[Fuging tune]]s'' contain a prominent passage about 1/3 of the way through in which each of the four choral parts enters in succession, in a way resembling a [[fugue]].  ''Anthems'' are longer songs, less regular in form, that are sung through just once rather than in multiple verses.&lt;ref&gt;The harmony and form of Sacred Harp music are discussed in Cobb (1978, chapter 2) and in more technical detail in Horn (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venues for singing===

Sacred Harp singing normally occurs not in church services, but in special gatherings or "singings" arranged for the purpose. Singings can be local, regional, statewide, or national. Small singings are often held in homes, with perhaps only a dozen singers. Large singings have been known to have more than a thousand participants. The more ambitious singings include an ample potluck dinner in the middle of the day, traditionally called "dinner on the grounds."

Some of the largest and oldest annual singings are called "conventions". The oldest Sacred Harp convention was the [[Southern Musical Convention]], organized in [[Upson County, Georgia]] in 1845. The two oldest surviving Sacred Harp singing conventions are the [[Chattahoochee Musical Convention]] (organized in [[Coweta County, Georgia]] in 1852), and the [[East Texas]] Sacred Harp Convention (organized as the [[East Texas Musical Convention]] in 1855).

=== Sacred Harp music as participatory music ===
[[File:Sacred Harp 192 Schenectady.webm|thumb|Performance in Alabama of the tune "Schenectady", 2011]]
Sacred Harp singers view their tradition as a participatory one, not a passive one. Those who gather for a singing sing for themselves and for each other, and not for an audience. This can be seen in several aspects of the tradition.

First, the seating arrangement (four parts in a square, facing each other) is clearly intended for the singers, not for external listeners. Non-singers are always welcome to attend a singing, but typically they sit among the singers in the back rows of the tenor section, rather than in a designated separate audience location.

The leader, being equidistant from all sections, in principle hears the best sound. The often intense sonic experience of standing in the center of the square is considered one of the benefits of leading, and sometimes a guest will be invited as a courtesy to stand next to the leader during a song.

The music itself is also meant to be participatory. Most forms of choral composition place the melody on the top (treble) line, where it can be best heard by an audience, with the other parts written so as not to obscure the melody. In contrast, Sacred Harp composers have aimed to make each musical part singable and interesting in its own right, thus giving every singer in the group an absorbing task.&lt;ref&gt;Horn (1970, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, "bringing out the melody" is not a high priority in Sacred Harp composition, and indeed it is customary to assign the melody not to the trebles but to the tenors. Fuging tunes, in which each section gets its moment to shine, also illustrate the importance in Sacred Harp of maintaining the independence of each vocal part.

==History of Sacred Harp singing==

Marini (2003) traces the earliest roots of Sacred Harp to the "country parish music" of early 18th century England. This form of rural church music evolved a number of the distinctive traits that were passed on from tradition to tradition, until they ultimately became part of Sacred Harp singing. These traits included the assignment of the melody to the tenors, harmonic structure emphasizing fourths and fifth, and the distinction between the ordinary four-part hymn ("plain tune"), the anthem, and the [[fuging tune]]. Several composers of this school, including [[Joseph Stephenson (composer)|Joseph Stephenson]] and [[Aaron Williams (composer)|Aaron Williams]], are represented in the 1991 Edition of ''The Sacred Harp''.  For further information on the English roots of Sacred Harp music, see ''[[West gallery music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sources for this paragraph: Marini (2003, 77), Temperley (1983), and the essay "Distant Roots of Shape Note Music" by Keith Willard, posted at the fasola.org web site ([http://fasola.org/introduction/English_Roots.html]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the mid 18th century, the forms and styles of English country parish music were introduced to America, notably in a new tunebook called ''Urania'', published 1764 by the singing master [[James Lyon (singing master)|James Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;Marini (2003, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;  This stimulus soon led to the development of a robust native school of composition, signaled by the 1770 publication of [[William Billings]]'s ''The New England Psalm Singer'', and then by a great number of new compositions by Billings and those who followed in his path. The work of these composers, sometimes called the "[[Music of the United States before 1900#First New England School|First New England School]]", forms a major part of the Sacred Harp to this day.

Billings and his followers worked as singing masters, who led [[singing schools]]. The purpose of these schools was to train young people in the correct singing of sacred music. This pedagogical movement flourished, and led ultimately to the invention of [[shape note]]s, which originated as way to making the teaching of singing easier. The first shape note tunebook appeared in 1801:  ''The Easy Instructor''&lt;ref&gt;Dick Hulan writes, "My copy of William Smith's ''Easy Instructor, Part II'' (1803) attributes the invention [of shape notes] to 'J. Conly of Philadelphia'." According to David Warren Steel, in ''John Wyeth and the Development of Southern Folk Hymnody'', "This notation was invented by Philadelphia merchant John Connelly, who on 10 March 1798 signed over his rights to the system to Little and Smith." Andrew Law also laid claim to the invention of the shape note system.&lt;/ref&gt; by William Smith and William Little. At first, Smith and Little's shapes competed with a rival system, created by [[Andrew Law (composer)|Andrew Law]] (1749–1821) in his ''The Musical Primer'' of 1803. Although this book came out two years later than Smith and Little's book, Law claimed earlier invention of shape notes. In his system, a square indicated ''fa'', a circle ''sol'', a triangle ''la'' and a diamond, ''mi.'' Law used the shaped notes without a musical staff. The Smith and Little shapes ultimately prevailed.

Shape notes became very popular, and during the first part of the nineteenth century, a [[List of shape-note tunebooks|whole series]] of shape note tunebooks appeared, many of which were widely distributed. As the population spread west and south, the tradition of shape note singing expanded geographically. Composition flourished, with the new music often drawing on the tradition of [[folk music|folk song]] for tunes and inspiration. Probably the most successful shape note book prior to ''The Sacred Harp'' was [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''[[Southern Harmony]]'', published in 1835 and still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;The shape note systems continued to evolve throughout the 19th century; for a more complete history, see [[shape note]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as they flourished and spread, shape notes and the kind of participatory music which they served came under attack. The critics were from the urban-based "better music" movement, spearheaded by [[Lowell Mason]], which advocated a more "scientific" style of sacred music, more closely based on the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] styles of contemporaneous European music. The new style gradually prevailed. Shape notes and their music disappeared from the cities prior to the Civil War, and from the rural areas of the Northeast and Midwest in the following decades. However, they retained a haven in the rural South, which remained a fertile territory for the creation of new shapenote publications.&lt;ref&gt;Source for this paragraph: Marini (2003, 81). Evidence that Americans outside the rural South were slow, even reluctant, to give up their old music is given in Horn (1970, ch. 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arrival of ''The Sacred Harp'' ===
Sacred Harp singing came into being with the 1844 publication of [[Benjamin Franklin White]] and [[Elisha J. King]]’s ''The Sacred Harp''. It was this book, now distributed in several different versions, that came to be the shape note tradition with the largest number of participants.

B. F. White (1800-1879) was originally from [[Union County, South Carolina]], but since 1842 had been living in [[Harris County, Georgia]]. He prepared ''The Sacred Harp'' in collaboration with a younger man, E. J. King, (ca. 1821–44), who was from [[Talbot County, Georgia]]. Together they compiled, transcribed, and composed tunes, and published a book of over 250 songs.

King died soon after the book was published, and White was left to guide its growth.  He was responsible for organizing [[singing school]]s and conventions at which ''The Sacred Harp'' was used as the songbook. During his lifetime, the book became popular and would go through three revisions (1850, 1859, and 1869), all produced by committees consisting of White and several colleagues working under the auspices of the [[Southern Musical Convention]].  The first two new editions simply added appendices of new songs to the back of the book. The 1869 revision was more extensive, removing some of the less popular songs and adding new ones in their places. From the original 262 pages, the book was expanded by 1869 to 477. This edition was reprinted and continued in use for several decades.

===Origin of the modern editions===

Around the turn of the 20th century, Sacred Harp singing entered a period of conflict over the issue of traditionalism. The conflict ultimately split the community.&lt;ref&gt;The primary source for this section is Cobb (2001, chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

B. F. White had died in 1879 before completing a fourth revision of his book; thus the version that Sacred Harp participants were singing from was by the turn of the century over three decades old. During this time, the musical tastes of Sacred Harp's traditional adherents, the inhabitants of the rural South, had changed in important ways. Notably, [[Southern Gospel|gospel music]] - syncopated and chromatic, often with piano accompaniment - had become popular, along with a number of church hymns of the "mainstream" variety, such as "Rock of Ages."  Seven-shape notation systems had appeared and won adherents away from the older four-shape system (see [[shape note]] for details). As time passed, Sacred Harp singers doubtless became aware that what they were singing had become quite distinct from contemporary tastes.

The natural path to take&amp;mdash;and the one ultimately taken&amp;mdash;would be to assert the archaic character of Sacred Harp as an outright virtue. In this view, Sacred Harp should be treasured as a time-tested musical tradition, standing above current trends of fashion. The difficulty with adopting traditionalism as a guiding doctrine was that different singers had different opinions about just what form the stable, traditionalized version of Sacred Harp would take.

The first move was made by [[Wilson Marion Cooper|W. M. Cooper]], of [[Dothan, Alabama]], a leading Sacred Harp teacher in his own region, but not part of the inner circle of B. F. White's old colleagues and descendants. In 1902 Cooper prepared a revision of ''The Sacred Harp'' that, while retaining most of the old songs, also added new tunes that reflected more contemporary music styles.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2004) characterizes Cooper book style thus: it "contains a greater proportion of "camp meeting" songs than the Denson book, with more compressed part-writing, chromatic harmonies, and choruses characterized by call-and-response rather than "fuging" style. Denson book singers generally say that the Cooper book sounds more like "new book or
gospel singing."&lt;/ref&gt;  Cooper made other changes, too:

*He retitled many old songs. These songs were formerly named by their tune, using arbitrarily chosen place names ("New Britain", "Northfield", "Charlestown"). The new names were based on the text; thus "New Britain" became "Amazing Grace", "Northfield" became "How Long, Dear Savior", and so on. The old system was intended in colonial times to permit mixing and matching of tunes and texts, but was unnecessary in a system where the pairing of tune and text was fixed.
*He transposed some songs into new keys. This is thought to have brought the notation closer to actual performing practice.
*He wrote new alto parts for the many songs that originally just had three vocal lines.

The Cooper revision was a success, being widely adopted in many areas of the South, such as Florida, southern Alabama, and Texas, where it has continued as the predominant Sacred Harp book to this day. The "Cooper book," as it is now often called, was revised by Cooper himself in 1907 and 1909. His son-in-law published the book in 1927, including an appendix compiled by revision committee. The Sacred Harp Book Company was formed in 1949, and subsequent revision has been supervised by editorial committees under its instruction. New editions were issued in 1950, 1960, 1992, 2000, 2006 and 2012.

In the original core geographic area of Sacred Harp singing, northern Alabama and Georgia, the singers did not in general take to the Cooper book, as they felt it deviated too far from the original tradition. Obtaining a new book for these singers was made more difficult by the fact that B. F. White's son [[James Landrum White|James L. White]], who would have been the natural choice to prepare a new edition, was a non-traditionalist.  His "fifth edition" (1909)&lt;ref&gt;This edition may be viewed in digital form at [http://originalsacredharp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/j-l-white-sacred-harp-fifth-edition.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; won little support among singers, while his "fourth edition with supplement" (1911) enjoyed some success in a few areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 98-110&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a committee headed by [[Joseph Stephen James]] produced an edition entitled ''Original Sacred Harp'' (1911) that largely satisfied the wishes of this community of singers.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 94-98&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SacredHarp1991ed.jpg|thumb|1991 edition of ''The Sacred Harp'' showing the characteristic horizontal format of shape note books]] --&gt;
[[File:Photo of Original Sacred Harp (Denson edition) songbook.jpg|thumb|"Original Sacred Harp (Denson Revision)"]]

The James edition was further revised in 1936 by a committee under the leadership of the brothers [[Seaborn McDaniel Denson|Seaborn]] and [[Thomas Jackson Denson|Thomas Denson]], both influential [[singing school]] teachers. Both died shortly before the project was complete, and the remaining work was overseen by [[Paine Denson]], son of Thomas. This book was entitled ''Original Sacred Harp, Denson Revision'', and was itself revised 1960, 1967, and 1971;&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 110-117&lt;/ref&gt; a more thorough revision and remodeling of this book, overseen by [[Hugh McGraw]], is known simply as the "1991 Edition," though some singers still call it the "Denson book."

Even the highly traditionalist James and Denson books followed Cooper in adding alto parts to most of the old three-part songs (these alto parts led to an unsuccessful lawsuit by Cooper).&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Buell E. (2001) ''The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music'' pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; Some people (see for instance the reference by Buell Cobb given below) believe that the new alto parts imposed an esthetic cost by filling in the former stark open harmonies of the three-part songs. Wallace McKenzie (reference below) argues to the contrary, basing his view on a systematic study of representative songs.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie further judges that the Cooper alto parts were more successful than the Denson ones in retaining the original harmonic style.&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, there is little support today for abandoning the added alto parts, since most singers give a high priority to giving every side of the square its own part to sing.

It was thus that the traditionalism debate split the Sacred Harp community, and there seems little prospect that it will ever reunite under a single book. However, there have been no further splits. Both the Denson and the Cooper groups adopted traditionalist views for the particular form of Sacred Harp they favored, and these forms have now been stable for about a century.

The strength of traditionalism can be seen in the front matter of the two hymnbooks. The Denson book is forthrightly Biblical in its defense of tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;DEDICATED TO
All lovers of Sacred Harp Music, and to the memory of the illustrious and venerable patriarchs who established the Traditional Style of Sacred Harp singing and admonished their followers to "seek the old paths and walk therein".&lt;ref&gt;The passage quotes [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 6:16:  "Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Cooper book also shows a warm appreciation of tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;May God bless everyone as we endeavor to promote and enjoy Sacred Harp music and to continue the rich tradition of those who have gone before us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To say that both communities are traditionalist does not mean they discourage the creation of new songs. To the contrary, it is part of the tradition that musically creative Sacred Harp singers should become composers themselves and add to the canon. The new compositions are prepared in traditional styles, and could be considered a kind of tribute to the older material. New songs have been incorporated into editions of ''The Sacred Harp'' throughout the 20th century.

===Other Sacred Harp books===

Two other books are currently used by Sacred Harp singers. A few singers in north Georgia employ the "White book," an expanded version of the 1869 B. F. White edition edited by [[James Landrum White|J. L. White]]. [[African-American]] Sacred Harp singers, although primarily users of the Cooper book, also make use of a supplementary volume, ''The Colored Sacred Harp'', produced by [[Judge Jackson]] (1883–1958) in 1934 and later revised in two subsequent editions. In his book ''Judge Jackson and The Colored Sacred Harp'', Joe Dan Boyd identified four regions of Sacred Harp singing among African-Americans: eastern Texas (Cooper book), northern Mississippi (Denson book), south Alabama and Florida (Cooper book), and New Jersey (Cooper book). The ''Colored Sacred Harp'' is limited to the New Jersey and south Alabama-Florida groups. Sacred Harp was "exported" from south Alabama to New Jersey. It appears to have died out among the African-Americans in eastern Texas.

In summary, three revisions of and one companion book to ''The Sacred Harp'' are currently in use in Sacred Harp singing:

*''The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition'' (the "Denson book"). Carrollton, GA: Sacred Harp Publishing Company.
*''The Sacred Harp, Revised Cooper Edition, 2012''. Samson, AL: The Sacred Harp Book Company.
*''The Sacred Harp, J. L. White Fourth Edition, with Supplement'' (the "White book"). Atlanta, GA: J. L. White. Released 1911; republished 2007.
*''The Colored Sacred Harp''. Ozark, AL: Judge Jackson. [3rd revised edition (1992) includes rudiments by H. J. Jackson (son of J. Jackson) and an autobiography of Judge Jackson].

Sacred Harp books generally contain a section on [[Rudiments of music|rudiments]], describing the basics of music and Sacred Harp singing.

===The spread of Sacred Harp singing in modern times===

In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has experienced a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not grow up in the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;For an extended narrative of this spread, see Bealle (1997, chapter 4).&lt;/ref&gt; New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.&lt;ref name="Clawson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clawson|first=Laura|title=I Belong to This Band, Hallelujah!: Community, Spirituality, and Tradition Among Sacred Harp Singers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8bua5aSIDMC&amp;pg=PA163|date=15 September 2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10959-6|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The U.S. beyond the South====
There are now strong Sacred Harp singing communities in most major urban areas of the United States, and in many rural areas, as well.&lt;ref&gt;A guide to singings that demonstrates this dramatic spread may be found at the "fasola.org" web site, under http://fasola.org/singings/.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first groups of singers formed outside the traditional Southern home region of Sacred Harp singing was in the Chicago area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Miller (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The first Illinois convention was held in 1985, with enthusiastic and strongly proactive support by prominent Southern traditional singers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Midwest Convention is now acknowledged to be one of the major American conventions, attracting hundreds of singers from all over the US and abroad.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Similarly, the Sacred Harp singing community in western New England has become a prominent one in recent years. In March 2008, the 2008 Western Massachusetts Sacred Harp Convention attracted over 300 singers from 25 states and a number of foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-13/120504721045690.xml&amp;coll=1|title=Sacred Harp sing draws followers|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent singing conventions outside the South include, for example, the Keystone Convention in Pennsylvania, the Missouri Convention, and the Minnesota State Convention, which began in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freude.com/mnfasola/convention.html|title=22nd Annual Minnesota State Sacred Harp Singing Convention|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sacred Harp Singing beyond the US====
In more recent times Sacred Harp singing has spread beyond the borders of the United States.

The [[United Kingdom]] has had an active Sacred Harp community since the 1990s. The first UK Sacred Harp convention took place in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukshapenote.org.uk/ukconvns.html |title=Conventions |work=United Kingdom Sacred Harp &amp; Shapenote Singing |publisher=Edwin and Sheila Macadam |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are regular singings in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonsacredharp.org/|title=London Sacred Harp|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonsacredharp.bandcamp.com/|title=Music - London Sacred Harp|work=London Sacred Harp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Home Counties, the Midlands, Yorkshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sheffieldsacredharp.weebly.com/|title=Sheffield &amp; South Yorkshire Sacred Harp|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancashire, Manchester, Brighton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brightonshapenote.weebly.com/|title=Brighton Shape Note Singing|work=Brighton Shape Note Singing|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyneside,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastleshapenote.co.uk/|title=tyneside sacred harp and shape note singing|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Anglia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norwichsacredharp.tumblr.com/|title=Norwich Sacred Harp|work=Norwich Sacred Harp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolsacredharp.org/|title=Bristol Sacred Harp|work=Bristol Sacred Harp|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shapenotescotland.weebly.com/|title=Shapenote Scotland|work=Shapenote Scotland|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has a decades-long tradition of Sacred Harp singing, particularly in [[Southern Ontario]] and the [[Eastern Townships]] of [[Quebec]]. Singings have been organized weekly in [[Montreal, Quebec]] since 2011, as well as a monthly afternoon sing, and the first Montreal all-day sing took place in the spring of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/montrealsacredharpsingers/|title=Montreal Sacred Harp Singers - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred Harp singing has happened on a monthly basis for years in [[Toronto]].

[[Australia]] has had Sacred Harp singing since 2001, and singings are held regularly in Melbourne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/groups/147368602037141/|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/surryhillsshapenotesingers/|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canberra &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/Canberrashapenote/|title=Log into Facebook - Facebook|work=Facebook|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blackwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blackwood-Academy/121582631252295|title=Blackwood Academy|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Australian All Day Singing was held in Sydney in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timberandsteel.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/australias-first-ever-sacred-harp-singing-convention-hits-sydney/|title=Australia’s First Ever Sacred Harp Singing Convention Hits Sydney|work=Timber and Steel|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Sacred Harp singing was introduced to [[Ireland]], by Dr Juniper Hill of [[University College Cork]], spreading quickly from a class module into the wider community. In March 2011 U.C.C. hosted the first annual Ireland Sacred Harp Convention, and the Cork community held their first All-Day Singing on 22 October 2011. There are now also growing Sacred Harp communities in Belfast and Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corksacredharp.com/|title=Cork Sacred Harp|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most recent development, Sacred Harp singing has expanded beyond the limits of English-speaking countries to mainland Europe. In 2008 a singing community was established in Poland (which hosted the first Camp Fasola Europe in September 2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://campfasola.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Camp-Fasola-Application-Europe-2012.pdf Application form for Camp Fasola Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany there are regular weekly or monthly singings in Bremen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpbremen.org/english|title=English - Sacred Harp Bremen|publisher=|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Hamburg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacredharphamburg.weebly.com/|title=Sacred Harp Singing in Hamburg - Sacred Harp Hamburg Singing School - Home|work=Sacred Harp Singing in Hamburg|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpberlin.de|title=Sacred Harp Berlin|last=|first=|date=|website=Sacred Harp Berlin|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cologne&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpcologne.com|title=Sacred Harp Cologne|website=Sacred Harp Cologne|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Munich, most of them with their own annual All-Day singings.  Elsewhere in Germany, singers meet irregularly in Frankfurt, Gießen and Nürnberg.

==Origins of the music==
{{See also|Sacred Harp hymnwriters and composers}}
The music used in Sacred Harp singing is eclectic. Most of the songs can be assigned to one of four historical layers.

{{ordered list
| The oldest of these layers comes from 18th century New England, and represents a rendition in shape notes of the work of outstanding early American composers such as [[William Billings]] and [[Daniel Read]], who worked as singing masters.&lt;/li&gt;
| A second layer comes from the decades around 1830, following the migration of the shape note tradition to the rural South. Many of the songs in this layer are believed to be originally secular [[folk music|folk tunes]], harmonized in parts and given religious lyrics. As one would expect from the folk origin of such music, it often emphasizes the notes of the [[pentatonic scale]]. They often employ stark, vivid harmonies based on open fifths. Most of the songs of this layer were originally composed in just three parts (treble, tenor, bass), with the altos added later, as noted above.

The sound of this musical layer, as well as to some extent ''The Sacred Harp'' in general, can be observed by comparing versions of the well-known hymn "[[Amazing Grace]]", which is familiar to many Americans in a form such as the following:

[[File:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.PNG|center|thumb|600 px|A familiar harmonization of "Amazing Grace".  [[Media:AmazingGraceFamiliarStyle.OGG|Click]] to hear piano reduction ([[Ogg]] format, 234K)]]

In ''The Sacred Harp'' (1991 edition), "Amazing Grace" is harmonized quite differently. Note that the "air", or melody, is in the tenor.

[[File:AmazingGraceSacredHarp1991Edition.PNG|center|thumb|750px|"Amazing Grace" in a form similar to that in ''The Sacred Harp'', 1991 edition.  [[Media:AmazingGraceSacredHarp1991Edition.OGG|Click]] to hear piano reduction ([[Ogg]] format, 225K)]]

(As noted above, the title "New Britain" is the name of the tune, not the song as a whole.)

| A third layer of ''Sacred Harp'' music is from the mid nineteenth century and represents the popular sensibility of that era. A number of these mid-century works have an almost primal simplicity&amp;mdash;the harmony is essentially a single extended major chord, and the parts a decoration in slow tempo of that chord.
| The most recent layer consists of the songs that were added to the books during the twentieth century. These are the work of musically creative participants in the Sacred Harp tradition, who strove to create songs that would fit into the existing tradition by adopting the style of one of the earlier periods. About a sixth of the Denson edition is taken up with such compositions, dating from as recently as 1990. The twentieth-century composers often have recycled their lyrics from earlier Sacred Harp songs (or from their sources, such as the work of the 18th-century hymnodist [[Isaac Watts]]). A number of these modern compositions have become favorites of the singing community, and it is anticipated that future editions of ''The Sacred Harp'' will also include new songs.
}}

There are a few additional songs in ''The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition'' that cannot be assigned to any of these four main layers. There are some very old songs of European origin, as well as songs from the English rural tradition that inspired the early New England composers. There are also a handful of songs by European [[classical music|classical]] composers ([[Ignaz Pleyel]], [[Thomas Arne]], and [[Henry Rowley Bishop]]).The book even includes five hymns by [[Lowell Mason]], long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that ''The Sacred Harp'' has preserved to this day.&lt;ref&gt;See the online Index to the Denson edition: http://fasola.org/indexes/1991/?v=composer&lt;/ref&gt;

The description just given is based on ''The Sacred Harp, 1991 edition'', also known as the Denson edition. The widely used "Cooper" edition overlaps considerably (about 60%) in content, but also includes many later songs. A detailed comparison of the two editions has been made by Sacred Harp scholar Gaylon L. Powell, available [http://resources.texasfasola.org/tunecomparisonindex.html here].

==Other books with the title ''Sacred Harp''==

''The Sacred Harp'' was a popular name for 19th century hymn and tune books, with no fewer than four bearing the title. The first of these was compiled by John Hoyt Hickok and printed in [[Lewistown, Pennsylvania|Lewiston, Pennsylvania]] in 1832. The second was compiled by Lowell and Timothy Mason and printed in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1834, as part of the "better music" movement mentioned above. The publisher released their book as a [[shape note]] edition, while they preferred to urbanize their audience by releasing a round note edition.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1933b, 395)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gould (55)&lt;/ref&gt;

The third ''Sacred Harp'' was the one by [[Benjamin Franklin White|B. F. White]] and E. J. King (1844), the origin of today's Sacred Harp singing tradition.

Lastly, according to W. J. Reynolds, writing in ''Hymns of Our Faith'', there was yet a fourth ''Sacred Harp'' - ''The Sacred Harp'' published by J. M. D. Cates in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1867.

{{portal|Sexuality}}
A '''Sexual Attitude Reassessment''', sometimes '''Sexual Attitude Restructuring''' ('''SAR'''), seminar is a process-oriented, structured group experience to promote participants' awareness of their attitudes and values related to sexuality, and to assist them in understanding how these attitudes and values affect them professionally and personally. Since the primary purpose of a SAR is the examination of attitudes and values, it is not a traditional academic experience designed to disseminate [[cognitive]] information, nor is it [[psychotherapy]] directed toward the resolution of personal problems.

A SAR provides an opportunity for participants to explore and understand their beliefs, attitudes, values and biases within the realm of sex and sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This self-exploration and self-understanding facilitates comfort that ultimately fosters improved communication skills, both on a professional and a personal level.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

By becoming increasingly aware of their perceptions, beliefs, and feelings, participants become increasingly comfortable with the wide variation of existing sexual attitudes, behaviours, practices, and even sub-cultures.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Council of Representatives|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients|url=https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/amp-a0024659.pdf|website=APA|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comfort is necessary for sexual health professionals, and is also beneficial for individuals striving for personal growth and the development of healthy personal relationships.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

During a SAR, participants examine [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and sexual attitudes from numerous perspectives using a variety of images. The nature of a SAR requires that some of the media be explicit. The use of explicit media is necessary for increasing [[self-awareness]] and personal comfort with the many areas of sex and sexuality. In addition to the personal growth, the event involves small group discussions during which participants are challenged with the opportunity to practice their professional or [[interpersonal skills]].

The '''slide''' ('''Schleifer''' in German, '''Coulé''' in French, '''Superjectio''' in Latin)&lt;ref name=don&gt;Donington, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Ornament (music)|musical ornament]] often found in [[baroque]] musical works, but used during many different periods.&lt;ref name=don /&gt; It instructs the performer to begin two or three scale steps below the marked note and "slide" upward—that is, move stepwise diatonically between the initial and final notes.&lt;ref name=N352&gt;Neumann 1993, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Though less frequently found, the slide can also be performed in a descending fashion.&lt;ref name=N352 /&gt;

==History==
In ''The Interpretation of Early Music'', [[Robert Donington]] surveys many treatises to ascertain the history of the slide.&lt;ref name=don /&gt; Writing in 1654, [[John Playford]] noted that the slide can be used in ascending (he called it "elevation") or in descending (he called it "double backfall") forms.&lt;ref name=don /&gt; [[Christopher Simpson]] described the figure in his ''Division Violist'': "Sometimes a note is graced by sliding to it from the third below, called an 'elevation', now something obsolete. Sometimes from the third above; which we call a double-backfall. This sliding a third, up, or down, is always done upon one string."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Simpson, ''The Division Violist, or An Introduction to the Playing upon A Ground'' (London: William Godbid, 1659), p. 9. The example is taken from the second edition, 1665.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Mace]] (1676) notes that the + sign above a note indicates its use.

[[Henry Purcell]] (1696), [[Jacques Champion de Chambonnières]] (1670) and [[Jean-Henri d'Anglebert]] (1689) use the French word ''coulé''. D'Anglebert in particular shows how the slide can fill in the intervals of a [[major third]] and a [[perfect fourth]]. [[Jean Rousseau (violist)|Jean Rousseau]] (1687) called the figure a ''plainte''.&lt;ref&gt;John Spitzer, "Grammar of Improvised Ornamentation: Jean Rousseau's Viol Treatise of 1687," ''Journal of Music Theory'' 33, No. 2 (Autumn, 1989), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chelys or Division Violist by Christopher Simpson.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Symbols and execution of double backfall (two comma-like marks) and elevation (the + sign), from ''Chelys, or the Division Violist'' by [[Christopher Simpson]] (1665)]]
[[File:D'Anglebert 1659.jpg|thumb|220px|Portion of a table of embellishments and their execution showing the ''coulé'' as a slur-like marking between notes – from [[Jean-Henri d'Anglebert|D'Anglebert's]] ''Pièces de Clavessin'' (1659)]]

Whereas the majority of treatises indicate the slide is to begin on the beat, Donington notes that [[Johann Gottfried Walther]] (1708) believed the slide should occur prior to the beat.&lt;ref name=don /&gt; Frederick Neumann (in 1973) indicates that any of the 3 notes of a 3-note slide could occur on the beat, but did not cite any sources to support this.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann 1973, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993, he stated that the slide could occur only before or on the beat (i.e. the last note of the slide on the beat, or the first note of the slide on the beat).&lt;ref name=N352 /&gt;

[[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], in his ''Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen'' (1753), described the slide in two ways: 1) a two-note ascending prefix to a note; and 2) a three-note prefix similar to a [[turn (music)|turn]].&lt;ref name=cpe&gt;Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, ''Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments,'' trans and ed. by William J. Mitchell (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1949), pp. 136–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he suggested a symbol for the slide (of a side-ways turn symbol), this suggestion was not generally adopted, and usually the ornament is written out.&lt;ref name=cpe /&gt; Bach felt that the use of the slide was determined by the character of the music, favoring "highly expressive movements."&lt;ref name=cpe /&gt; Regarding the three-note slide, he described it as being appropriate to works which describe "sadness in languide, adagio movements. Halting and subdued in nature, its performance should be highly expressive, and freed from slavish dependence on note values."&lt;ref name=cpe /&gt; He also noted that the ornament is more effective when it some of its notes are dissonant against the bass below it.&lt;ref name=cpe /&gt;

Bach concludes his discussion of the slide by noting two important points:
#the performer should aim for an unaffected and subdued expression, rather than trying to fill out notes;
#the lack of multiple notes should not be seen has having more expressiveness.

Bach also suggested the slide could have a dotted rhythm, enhancing its expressiveness.&lt;ref name=cpe /&gt;  As quoted by Donington, [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] (1752) indicated that undotted slides belong to the French style, whereas dotted slides are appropriate to Italian style.&lt;ref name=don /&gt;

Though [[Leopold Mozart]] did not use the term ''Schleifer'' in his ''Gründliche Violinschule'' (1756), his description and musical examples indicated that the slide could be used as an elaboration of and ascending or descending [[appoggiatura]]s: "It is frequently the custom to make the ascending appoggiatura from the third below, even if it should appear to flow from the neighbouring note. But in such cases one makes it mostly with two notes.&lt;ref&gt;Mozart, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; ... To the passing appoggiature belong also those improvised ornamentations which I will call {{em|übersteigende}} and {{em|untersteigende Zwischen-Schläge}} [rising and falling intermediate gracenotes]. They occur between the appoggiatura and the principal note, descending quite smoothly from the appoggiatura to the principal note."&lt;ref&gt;Mozart, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Clavierschule'' (1789, revised 1802), Johann Gottlob Türk understood two kinds of characters appropriate to slides: 1) those that are short, without dotted rhythm, and 2) those that are long and with dotted rhythm.&lt;ref name=turk1&gt;Türk, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The short slide, he said, consisted of two notes and is to be used to "increase the liveliness of a composition" and therefore needs to be played fast.&lt;ref name=turk1 /&gt; It is often used when the melodic line ascends a fourth, although it could be also be appended to notes moving in stepwise ascending motion. Türk indicated a preference for slides on the strong beat, citing the examples of C.P.E. Bach, but quotes Agricola (in Tosi's ''Anleitung zur Singkunst'', p.&amp;nbsp;88) that a slide could fill out a melodic gap whose final note occurs on a weak beat.&lt;ref name=turk2&gt;Türk, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing three-note slides, Türk states that the character of the slide is wholly dependent on the mood of the music: a lively work will suggest a fast slide, and a "sorrowful" work will be the appropriate place for a slower decoration.&lt;ref name=turk3&gt;Türk, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the three-note slide is used primarily on the strong beat. He explains that the dotted slide is used only in music with an "agreeable or tender character."&lt;ref name=turk3 /&gt; He recommends playing the first note of the slide with emphasis and the following notes "softly and caressingly." As the first note of the slide is akin to an appogiatura (whose length always varies according to circumstances), so too should the slide be seen whose duration is variable and dependent on context.&lt;ref name=turk4&gt;Türk, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; He also warned against novice keyboard players who insert too many slides into their playing.&lt;ref name=turk2 /&gt; After a discussion on the contextual mutability of slides, Türk concludes the section on slides with the wish that composers would notate slides in regular rhythms so as to remove doubt as to their correct execution.&lt;ref name=turk4 /&gt;

'''''The Inner Reaches of Outer Space''''' is a 1986 book by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], the last book completed before his death in 1987. In it, he explores the intersections of art, psychology and religion, and discusses the ways in which new myths are born. In writing the book, Campbell drew on transcripts of a series of lectures and conversations that he gave in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] between 1981–1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Inner Reaches of Outer Space|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=New World Library|year=2002|isbn=9781577312093|location=Novato, California|pages=xi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including legendary symposiums with astronaut [[Rusty Schweickart]] and with members of the [[Grateful Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=New World Library|year=2003|isbn=978-1577314042|location=Novato, California|pages=xxii, xxxi, 180|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally published by [[Alfred van der Mark]] in 1986, the book was rereleased by [[Harper &amp; Row]] in 1988. With the publication of the third edition by [[New World Library]] in 2002, ''The Inner Reaches of Outer Space'' became the second title in the [[Joseph Campbell Foundation]]'s ''[[Collected Works of Joseph Campbell]]'' series.

'''''Verstehen''''' ({{IPA-de|fɛɐˈʃteːən}}, literally: "to understand"), in the context of German philosophy and [[social science]]s in general, has been used since the late 19th century – in English as in German – with the particular sense of the "interpretive or participatory" examination of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |title=Verstehen: The Sociology of Max Weber |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307133502/http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |archive-date=2011-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely associated with the work of the German [[sociologist]], [[Max Weber]], whose [[antipositivism]] established an alternative to prior [[sociological positivism]] and [[economic determinism]], rooted in the analysis of [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm "Anti-positivism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403001519/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm |date=April 3, 2012 }} at Historylearningsite.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In [[anthropology]], ''Verstehen'' has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture attempts to relate to it and understand others. 

''Verstehen'' is now seen as a concept and a method central to a rejection of positivistic social science (although Weber appeared to think that the two could be united). ''Verstehen'' refers to understanding the [[Meaning-making|meaning]] of action from the actor's point of view. It is entering into the shoes of the other, and adopting this research stance requires treating the actor as a subject, rather than an object of your observations. It also implies that unlike objects in the natural world human actors are not simply the product of the pulls and pushes of external forces. Individuals are seen to create the world by organizing their own understanding of it and giving it meaning. To do research on actors without taking into account the meanings they attribute to their actions or environment is to treat them like objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?term=VERSTEHEN "Verstehen"]: entry in the ''Online Dictionary of the Social Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning&lt;!--'Interpretative sociology', 'Interpretative sociology' and 'Verstehende Soziologie' redirect here--&gt;==
'''Interpretative sociology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''verstehende Soziologie'') is the study of society that concentrates on the meanings people associate to their social world.&lt;ref name="Sociology"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretative sociology strives to show that reality is constructed by people themselves in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

''Verstehen'' roughly translates to "meaningful understanding" or "putting yourself in the shoes of others to see things from their perspective". Interpretive sociology differs from positivist sociology in three ways:
#Interpretive sociology deals with the meaning attached to behavior, unlike positivist sociology which focuses on action. 
#Interpretive sociology sees reality as being constructed by people, unlike positivist sociology which sees an objective reality "out there". 
#Interpretive sociology relies on qualitative data, unlike positivist sociology which tends to make use of quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

==Dilthey and hermeneutics==
''Verstehen'' was introduced into philosophy and the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaften]]'') by the German [[Historism|historist]] philosopher [[Johann Gustav Droysen]]. He first made a distinction between nature and history in terms of the categories of space and time. The method of the [[natural sciences]] (''Naturwissenschaften'') is explanation (''[[wikt:erklären|erklären]]&lt;!--German verb--&gt;''), while that of history is understanding (''verstehen&lt;!--German verb--&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Historik: Vorlesungen über Enzyklopädie und Methodologie der Geschichte''. Stuttgart: Fromann-Holzboog, [1858] 1977: 22, 150f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Grundriss der Historik'', Berlin 1862, p. 4 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droysen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7_lrAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl= ''Grundriss der Historik''], Verlag von Veit &amp; Comp., 1868, p. 11: §14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu4rCkENQvcC&amp;dq= ''Methodological Individualism: Background, History and Meaning''], Routledge, 2001, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Verstehen'' was later used by the German philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie'', Berlin 1894, p. 1314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Introduction to the Human Sciences''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the first-person participatory perspective that agents have on their individual experience as well as their culture, history, and society. In this sense, it is developed in the context of the theory and practice of ''interpretation'' (as understood in the context of [[hermeneutics]]) and contrasted with the external objectivating third-person perspective of ''explanation'' (''das Erklären'') in which human agency, subjectivity, and its products are analyzed as effects of impersonal natural forces in the natural sciences and social structures in sociology.

Twentieth-century philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[Truth and method]]'', Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; have been critical of what they considered to be the romantic and subjective character of ''Verstehen'' in Dilthey, although both Dilthey and the early Heidegger were interested in the "[[facticity]]" and "life-context" of understanding, and sought to universalize it as the way humans exist through language on the basis of [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcOjTiSNFZoC&amp;dq= ''Ontology: The Hermeneutics of Facticity''], Indiana University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Bambach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaWALY0raiEC&amp;dq= ''Heidegger, Dilthey, and the crisis of historicism''], Cornell University Press, 1995, p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' also played a role in [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schutz]]'s analysis of the "[[lifeworld]]." [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] further transformed the concept of ''Verstehen'', reformulating it on the basis of a transcendental-pragmatic philosophy of language and the theory of communicative action.

==Weber and the social sciences==
[[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simmel, ''Die probleme der Gechichtsphilosophie. Eine erkentnistheoretische Studie''. Munich: Verlag von Dunker und Humboldt, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced interpretive understanding (''Verstehen'') into [[sociology]], where it has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture (such as an [[anthropologist]] or [[sociologist]]) relates to an indigenous people or sub-cultural group on their own terms and from their own point of view, rather than interpreting them in terms of his or her own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' can mean either a kind of [[Empathy|empathic]] or participatory understanding of social phenomena. In anthropological terms this is sometimes described as [[cultural relativism]], especially by those that have a tendency to argue toward universal ideals. In sociology it is an aspect of the comparative-historical approach, where the context of a society like twelfth century "France" can be potentially better understood (''Besserverstehen'') by the sociologist than it could have been by people living in a village in Burgundy. It relates to how people in life give meaning to the social world around them and how the [[social scientist]] accesses and evaluates this "first-person perspective". This concept has been both expanded and criticized by later social scientists. Proponents laud this concept as the only means by which researchers from one culture can examine and explain behaviors in another. While the exercise of ''Verstehen'' has been more popular among social scientists in [[Europe]], such as Habermas, ''Verstehen'' was introduced into the practice of [[sociology]] in the [[United States]] by [[Talcott Parsons]], an American follower of [[Max Weber]]. Parsons used his [[structural functionalism]] to incorporate this concept into his 1937 work, ''The Structure of Social Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=John J. Macionis, Linda M.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|edition=7th Canadian|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber had more specific beliefs than Marx where he put value to understanding and meaning of key elements—not just with intuition or sympathy with the individual but also the product of "systematic and rigorous research". The goal is to identify human actions and interpreting them as observable events leading us to believe that it not only provides for a good explanation for individual actions but also for group interactions. The meaning attached needs to include constraints and limitations and analyze the motivation for action. Weber believed that this gives the sociologist an advantage over a natural scientist because "We can accomplish something which is never attainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective understanding of the action of the component individuals" (Weber, Economy and Society, p.&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gingrich|first=Paul|title=Max Weber|url=http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s30f99.htm|work=Sociology 250|publisher=University of Regina, Department of Sociology and Social Studies|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the social scientific concept of ''Verstehen'' such as [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Dean MacCannell]] counter that it is simply impossible for a person born of one culture to ever completely understand another culture, and that it is arrogant and conceited to attempt to interpret the significance of one culture's [[symbol]]s through the terms of another (supposedly superior) culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Such criticisms do not necessarily allow for the possibility that ''Verstehen'' does not involve "complete" understanding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Just as in physical science all knowledge is asymptotic to the full explanation, a high degree of cross-cultural understanding is very valuable. The opposite of ''Verstehen'' would seem to be ignorance of all but that which is immediately observable, meaning that we would not be able to understand any time and place but our own. A certain level of interpretive understanding is necessary for our own cultural setting, however, and it can easily be argued that even the full participant in a culture does not fully understand it in every regard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Critics also believe that it is the sociologist's job to not just observe people and what people do but also share in their world of meaning and come to appreciate why they act as they do. Subjective thoughts and feelings regarded as bias in the sciences is an important aspect to be controlled for while doing sociological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">A '''Virtual Season''' or '''Virtual Series''' is a [[fan_fiction|fan-driven]] continuation of a television program.  While they are typically written for [[Cancellation_(television)|cancelled programs]], they sometimes run concurrently with programs that are still airing original episodes.  Virtual Seasons can be written by a single author, by several collaborating authors in a [[fandom]], or even reproduced episodically in a single video or series of videos. These series can be written in [[screenplay]] or [[prose]] format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Virtual_Season "Virtual Season"], [[Fanlore]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuation "Continuation Fic"], ''TV Tropes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptFic "Script Fic"], ''TV Tropes''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* One of the first virtual seasons was for the TV series ''[[Forever Knight]]'', which was cancelled in 1996 and followed by a virtual fourth season ([http://www.fkfanfic.com/v4s/eps.htm 'V4S']).
* There are websites that collate many different Virtual Seasons into one place, a "Virtual Network", such as [http://www.mzp-tv.co.uk/ ''MZP''].
* [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]] have spawned many different Virtual Seasons, such as the [http://www.mzp-tv.co.uk/portfolio-item/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/ ''MZP Buffy Virtual Continuation''] and [http://www.mzp-tv.co.uk/portfolio-item/angel/ ''MZP Angel Virtual Continuation'']
* ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', which was cancelled in 1997, spawned several virtual seasons, continuing the trend. The Unaired Fifth Season ([http://lcfanfic.com/thm-tufs.htm 'TUFS']) and Season 5 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143658/http://geocities.com/chiefpam/Season5/season5.html 'S5']) each "aired" on Sunday nights during the 1997/98 television season, while [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143706/http://geocities.com/chiefpam/Season6/season6.html 'Season 6'] followed during the 1998/99 season.
* [[Millennium (TV)|''Millennium'']] was cancelled in 1999, six months short of its millennial climax, so a [http://www.fourthhorsemanpress.com/Abyss/Fiction/VS4.htm ''Virtual Season 4''] completed the storyline for fans. In 2005 [http://www.mzp-tv.co.uk/portfolio-item/millennium/ ''Virtual Season 5''] aired, produced by a different creative team, but using the Virtual Season 4 as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. A [http://mmvs6.blogspot.com/ ''Virtual Season 6''], by another creative team, is currently in production.
* [[Night_Stalker_(TV_series)|Night Stalker]], which was cancelled in 2005, had a [http://www.mzp-tv.co.uk/portfolio-item/night-stalker/ ''Virtual Series Continuation''] that finished off the rest of Season 1 with 10 new episodes in screenplay format, and then a 20 episode Season 2.
* ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' spawned a [http://www.wtv-zone.com/trgarchive/vs/ ''Virtual Season''] which was designed to give the fans something to do and read during the summer hiatus. It ran from 2000-2005.
* A small group of fans for [[The Pretender (TV series)]] created [http://www.fanficweb.org/tvs/pretender/ ''The Pretender Virtual Season''] in 2001-2002, ignoring the two TV movies that followed and extending the story through two seasons, two "movies", and an epilogue.
* [http://vv8.jetc.org ''Voyager Virtual Season Project''] ran for 2 years, starting in 2001 and ending in 2003, extending ''[[Star Trek Voyager]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s story an extra two years and into yet another "Lost in Space" adventure.
* [http://www.mzp-tv.co.uk/portfolio-item/firefly-still-flying/ ''Still Flying''] was a [[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]] continuation which began airing in 2005, continuing the story from where the first season left off.

The '''World Vegetable Center''' ({{zh|c=亞蔬—世界蔬菜中心}}), previously known as the '''Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center''', is an international, [[nonprofit]] institute for [[vegetable]] research and development. It was founded in 1971 in Shanhua, southern Taiwan, by the [[Asian Development Bank]], Taiwan, Republic of Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Taiwan"&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/-business/2008/07/11/164969/Taiwan-vegetable.htm "Taiwan vegetable center to open CentAm branch"], [[The China Post]], July 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomato"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8NR12W1-B0IC&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=%22World+Vegetable+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fG2dTMjYO4G8lQfIpb3lCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22World%20Vegetable%20Center%22&amp;f=false Tomato yellow leaf curl virus disease]: ''management, molecular biology, breeding for resistance'' by Henryk Czosnek, シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社, 2007, Pg. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

These countries wished for the Center to become the "facilitator" for the Collaborative Vegetable Research Network for Southeast Asia, which was to work toward completing various projects that the founding nations put forth. Overall, the main goal of this continues to be to "reduce [[malnutrition]] and alleviate [[poverty]] in [[developing nations]] through improving production and consumption of vegetables."&lt;ref name="Taiwan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomato" /&gt;

==Research and development==
The use of vegetables as crops that are of high worth is important in the "[[Sustainable Development Goals]]" of the United Nations Development Program and the World Vegetable Center. &lt;ref&gt;United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. [https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/]&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetables bred by the Center can be used in poorer areas, where they can serve as "an important source of income" and can help fight [[micronutrient]] deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger KM, Lumpkin TA. 2005. Horticulture for Poverty Alleviation – The Unfunded Revolution. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=781784&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center’s current crop portfolio focuses on four groups of globally important vegetables, according to the AVRDC:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avrdc.org/fileadmin/pdfs/For_you/AVRDC-HQ.pdf AVRDV - World Vegetable Center Info PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*solanaceous crops: ([[tomato]], sweet pepper, [[chili pepper]], [[eggplant]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Research-and-evidence/case-studies/research-case-studies/2012/The-great-pyramid-Ty-tomatoes-resist-pests-and-diseases-/ The great pyramid: Ty tomatoes resist pests and diseases] [http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/ R4D]&lt;/ref&gt;
:*bulb [[alliums]] ([[onion]], [[shallot]], [[garlic]])
:*crucifers ([[cabbage]], [[Chinese cabbage]])
:*cucurbits ([[Cucurbitaceae]]): ([[cucumbers]], [[pumpkins]])

Indigenous vegetables, particularly those of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] are another focus of research at the World Vegetable Center. Indigenous vegetables are domesticated or semi-wild vegetable crops that are grown in particular regions as an integral part of a local [[food]] system. Many of them are [[underutilized crops]],&lt;ref&gt;New Agriculturalist. 2008. Making more of undervalued crops. http://www.new-ag.info/pov/views.php?a=426&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in regions where they are not native.&lt;ref&gt;Vikram, [http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-2162920,flstry-1.cms "How green was my veggie"], [[The Economic Times]], June 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germplasm collection==
A collection of vegetable [[germplasm]] is kept at the World Vegetable Center, which is considered to have the "largest and most diverse collection...in the world.".&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO]. 2009. Draft Second Report on the State of the World’s Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, p. 60. Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/meeting/017/ak528e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The collection itself contains more than 60,000 accessions of 442 different species collected from 156 countries.&lt;ref&gt;International Innovation. 2014. "The need for dietary diversity." Issue 155. [http://digimag.internationalinnovation.com//launch.aspx?eid=d460c264-4719-4aad-ba28-435f8f3aaa39&amp;pnum=48]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3XaXsVAZAwkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22World+Vegetable+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sW6dTJTzFIG0lQeGm9XkCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22World%20Vegetable%20Center%22&amp;f=false "Green inheritance: the WWF book of plants"] by Anthony Julian Huxley and Martin Walters, University of California Press, 2005, Pg. 169,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Research-and-evidence/case-studies/research-case-studies/2012/At-this-bank-for-vegetables-withdrawals-produce-interest-/%20 "At this bank for vegetables, withdrawals produce interest"] by [http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/ R4D]&lt;/ref&gt;
