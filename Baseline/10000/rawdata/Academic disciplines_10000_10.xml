'''9-slice scaling''' (also known as '''Scale 9 grid''' or '''9-slicing''') is a 2D image resizing technique to proportionally scale an image by splitting it in a grid of nine parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/9-slice-scaling-explained/135243/149344-4.html|title=9-slice scaling explained|website=Lynda.com - from LinkedIn|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key idea is to prevent [[image scaling]] distortion by protecting the pixels defined in 4 parts (corners) of the image and scaling or repeating the pixels in the other 5 parts. 

A variation of the concept, the 3-slice scaling, consists in a grid of 3 parts in which only the pixels in 2 parts (the edges) are protected and the pixels on the middle part are repeated.

== History and use ==
The concept was first introduced in a consumer application by [[Macromedia]] in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] 8 (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/8/releasenotes.html|title=Macromedia - Flash : Flash 8 Release Notes|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was available as feature to scale symbols. Later on, in 2007 Adobe introduced it as a feature in [[Adobe Fireworks]] CS3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/archive/fireworks/articles/9-slice_scaling.html|title=Improved 9-slice scaling in Fireworks|website=www.adobe.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Adobe Illustrator]], and [[Adobe Flash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1057744/flashcs3.html|title=Flash CS3 Professional|first1=David |last1=Karlins|date=May 7, 2007
|website=Macworld|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Today is also present as a feature of game development software like [[Unreal Engine|Unreal engine]], Urho3D, and [[Unity (game engine)|Unity 3D]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/9SliceSprites.html|title=Unity - Manual: 9-slicing Sprites|last=Technologies|first=Unity|website=docs.unity3d.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The technique can be used to manipulate both [[Raster graphics|bitmap/raster graphics]] and [[vector graphics]]. A current implementation of the 9-slice technique is present on the [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] 3 Backgrounds and Borders spec&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/|title=CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3|last=Bos|first=Bert|last2=Etemad|first2=Elika J.|date=2014-09-09|website=www.w3.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08|last3=Kemper|first3=Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using the ''border-image'' property.

[[File:Ecozone Afrotropic.svg|300px|thumb|The Afrotropical realm, marked in blue]]
:''See [[Tropical Africa]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] for other aspects.''
The '''Afrotropical realm''' is one of the Earth's eight [[biogeographic realm]]s. It includes [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara Desert]], the southern and eastern fringes of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the island of [[Madagascar]], southern [[Iran]] and extreme southwestern [[Pakistan]], and the islands of the western [[Indian Ocean]]. It was formerly known as the '''Ethiopian Zone''' or '''Ethiopian Region'''.

==Major ecological regions==
Most of the Afrotropic, with the exception of Africa's southern tip, has a [[tropical]] climate. A broad belt of deserts, including the [[Atlantic Desert|Atlantic]] and [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]] deserts of northern Africa and the [[Arabian Desert]] of the Arabian Peninsula, separate the Afrotropic from the [[Palearctic]] realm, which includes northern Africa and temperate [[Eurasia]].

===Sahel and Sudan===
South of the Sahara, two belts of [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical grassland and savanna]] run east and west across the continent, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. Immediately south of the Sahara lies the [[Sahel]] belt, a transitional zone of semi-arid short grassland and [[acacia]] savanna. Rainfall increases further south in the [[Sudanian Savanna]], also known simply as the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], a belt of taller grasslands and savannas. The Sudanian Savanna is home to two great [[flooded grasslands and savannas|flooded grasslands]], the [[Sudd]] wetland in [[South Sudan]], and the [[Niger Inland Delta]] in [[Mali]]. The [[forest-savanna mosaic]] is a transitional zone between the grasslands and the belt of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]] near the equator.

===[[Southern Arabian woodlands]]===
South Arabia, expressed as being mostly Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwestern Saudi Arabia, has few permanent forests. Some of the notable are [[Jabal Bura']], Jabal [[Raymah]], and [[Jabal Badaj]] in the Yemeni highland escarpment, and the seasonal forests in eastern Yemen and the [[Dhofar]] region of Oman. Other woodlands scatter the land and are very small and are predominantly [[juniper]] or [[acacia]] forests.

===Forest zone===
The [[forest zone]], a belt of lowland [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]], runs across most of equatorial Africa's [[intertropical convergence zone]]. The [[Upper Guinean forests]] of West Africa extend along the coast from [[Guinea]] to [[Togo]]. The [[Dahomey Gap]], a zone of forest-savanna mosaic that reaches to the coast, separates the Upper Guinean forests from the [[Lower Guinean forests]], which extend along the [[Gulf of Guinea]] from eastern [[Benin]] through [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]] to the western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The largest tropical forest zone in Africa is the [[Congolian forests]] of the [[Congo Basin]] in Central Africa. A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast, from southern [[Somalia]] to [[South Africa]].

===East African grasslands and savannas===
* ''Acacia''-''Commiphora'' grasslands
* [[Serengeti]]

===Eastern Africa's highlands===
[[Afromontane]] region, from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] to the [[Drakensberg Mountains]] of South Africa, including the [[East African Rift]]. Distinctive flora, including ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and ''[[Afrocarpus]]'', as well as giant ''[[Lobelia]]s'' and ''[[Dendrosenecio|Senecio]]s''.
* [[Ethiopian Highlands]]
* [[Albertine rift montane forests]]
* [[East African montane forests]] and [[Eastern Arc forests]]

===Southern African woodlands, savannas, and grasslands===
[[File:Afrotropic-Ecozone-Southern Africa.svg|200px|thumb|Southern Africa as described in Plant Taxonomic Database Standards No. 2]]
* [[Miombo woodlands]]
* Zambezian mopane and ''Baikiaea'' woodlands
* [[Bushveld]]

===Deserts of southern Africa===
* [[Namib Desert]]
* [[Kalahari Desert]]
* [[Karoo]]
* [[Tankwa Karoo]]
* [[Richtersveld]]

===Cape floristic region===
The [[Cape floristic region]], at Africa's southern tip, is a [[Mediterranean climate]] region that is home to a significant number of endemic taxa, as well as to plant families like the [[protea]]s (''Proteaceae'') that are also found in the [[Australasian realm]].

===Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands===
{{main|Ecoregions of Madagascar}}
[[Madagascar]] and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub-region of the realm, with numerous [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[taxon|taxa]] like the [[lemur]]s. Madagascar and the [[Seychelles]] are old pieces of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], and broke away from Africa millions of years ago. Other Indian Ocean islands, like the [[Comoros]] and [[Mascarene Islands]], are volcanic islands that formed more recently. Madagascar contains several important biospheres, as its [[biodiversity]] and ratio of endemicism is extremely high.

==Endemic plants and animals==

===Plants===
The Afrotropical realm is home to a number of endemic plant families. [[Ecoregions of Madagascar|Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands]] are home to ten endemic families of flowering plants; eight are endemic to Madagascar ([[Asteropeiaceae]], [[Didymelaceae]], [[Didiereaceae]], [[Kaliphoraceae]], [[Melanophyllaceae]], [[Physenaceae]], [[Sarcolaenaceae]], and [[Sphaerosepalaceae]]), one to [[Seychelles]] ([[Mesdusagynaceae]]) and one to the [[Mascarene Islands]] ([[Psiloxylaceae]]). Twelve plant families are endemic or nearly endemic to South Africa (including [[Curtisiaceae]], [[Heteropyxidaceae]], [[Penaeaceae]], [[Psiloxylaceae]] and [[Rhynchocalycaceae]]) of which five are endemic to the [[Cape floristic region|Cape floristic province]] (including [[Grubbiaceae]]). Other endemic Afrotropic families include [[Barbeyaceae]], [[Montiniaceae]], [[Myrothamnaceae]] and [[Oliniaceae]].

===Animals===
{{main|Fauna of Africa}}
The East African Great Lakes ([[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Malawi]], and [[Tanganyika]]) are the center of biodiversity of many freshwater fishes, especially [[cichlid]]s (they harbor more than two-thirds of the estimated 2,000 species in the family).&lt;ref&gt;I.P.Farias et al., Total Evidence: Molecules, Morphology, and the Phylogenetics of Cichlid Fishes, Journal of Experimental Zoology (Mol Dev Evol) 288:76–92 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The West African coastal rivers region covers only a fraction of West Africa, but harbours 322 of West African's fish species, with 247 restricted to this area and 129 restricted even
to smaller ranges. The central rivers fauna comprises 194 fish species, with 119 endemics and only 33 restricted to small areas.&lt;ref&gt;T.Moritz and K. E. Linsenmair, West African fish diversity – distribution patterns and possible conclusions for conservation strategies (in African Biodiversity: Molecules, Organisms, Ecosystems, Springer, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afrotropic has various endemic [[bird]] families, including [[ostrich]]es (Struthionidae), [[sunbird]]s, the [[secretary bird]] (Sagittariidae), [[guineafowl]] (Numididae), and [[mousebird]]s (Coliidae). Also, several families of [[passerines]] are limited to the Afrotropics; These include [[rock-jumper]]s (Chaetopidae) and [[rockfowl]] (Picathartidae).

Africa has three endemic orders of mammals, the [[Tubulidentata]] ([[aardvark]]s), [[Afrosoricida]] ([[tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s), and [[Macroscelidea]] ([[elephant shrew]]s). The [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|East-African plains]] are well known for their diversity of large mammals.

Four species of great apes ([[Hominidae]]) are endemic to Africa: both species of [[gorilla]] (western gorilla, ''Gorilla gorilla'', and eastern gorilla, ''Gorilla beringei'') and both species of [[chimpanzee]] ([[common chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes'', and [[bonobo]], ''Pan paniscus''). [[Human]]s and their ancestors originated in Africa.

'''Archaeological ethics''' refers to the [[moral]] issues raised through the study of the material past. It is a branch of the [[Philosophy of archaeology]].

In common with other academic disciplines, archaeologists are bound to conduct their investigations to a high standard and observe intellectual property laws, [[Health and Safety]] regulations and other legal obligations. Professional bodies in the field require that their members work towards the preservation and management of archaeological resources, treat human remains with dignity and also usually encourage [[outreach]] activities. Where these bodies exist, sanctions are in place for those professionals who do not observe these ethical codes. By no means all jurisdictions have such professional bodies however and even where they do exist, membership may not be necessary in order to carry out archaeological investigations. While such considerations are fundamental to a pursuit, they are unfortunately coming rather late to the field. Questions regarding ethics have only arisen since the UNESCO accords in the 1970s began to protect world culture.

A common ethical issue in [[modern archaeology]] has been the treatment of human remains found during [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]s, especially those that represent the ancestors of [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] groups in the [[New World]] or the remains of other minority races elsewhere. Where previously sites of great significance to native peoples could be excavated and any burials and [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] taken to be stored in museums or sold, there is increasing awareness in the West of taking a more respectful approach. The [[NAGPRA]] legislation in the [[United States of America]] is an example of this. The issue is not limited to ancient remains; nineteenth- and twentieth-century burial sites investigated by archaeologists such as [[First World War]] graves and cemeteries disturbed by developments have seen the remains of people with closely connected living relatives being exhumed and taken away.

The international trade in [[antiquities]], although not formally connected with the modern discipline of archaeology has also raised ethical questions regarding the ownership of archaeological artefacts. The market for imported antiquities has encouraged damage to [[archaeological site]]s and often led to appeals for the recall.

Examples of archaeological material removed from its place of origin and controversy over its return include the [[Elgin Marbles]].

A wider question of control and ownership over the past has also been raised through the political manipulation of the [[archaeological record]] to promote [[nationalism]] and justify military invasion. A famous example is the corps of archaeologists employed by [[Adolf Hitler]] to excavate in central Europe in the hope of finding evidence for a region-wide [[Aryan]] culture. Many archaeologists in the West today are employees of national governments or are privately employed instruments of government-derived archaeology legislation. In all cases this legislation is a compromise to some degree or another between the interests of the archaeological remains and the interests of economic development. Questions regarding the ethical validity of government heritage policies and whether they sufficiently protect important remains are raised during cases such as [[High Speed 1]] in [[London]] where burials at a cemetery at [[St Pancras railway station]] were hurriedly dug using a [[J. C. Bamford|JCB]] and mistreated in order to keep an important infrastructure project on schedule.

Another issue is the question of whether unthreatened archaeological remains should be excavated (and therefore destroyed) or preserved intact for future generations to investigate, perhaps using more advanced techniques that could provide more detailed information. Some archaeological guidance such as [[PPG 16]] has established a strong ethical argument for only excavating sites threatened with destruction.

Problem Areas in Archaeological Ethics
* Human Remains
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis local traditions and cultures
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis the architectural remains that have been uncovered during an excavation
* Responsibility of the Archaeologist vis-a-vis dissemination of the material uncovered, not only in academic circles but also to a broader public, both in the area of the excavation and from where the Sponsors come
* Balancing World, National and regional claims to various parts of the archaeological record
* protecting Archaeological sites and objects from illegal trade

An autonomous body under the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DST), [[Government of India]], the institute is situated at Manora Peak (1,951 m (6,401&amp;nbsp;ft)), about 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nainital]], a popular hill station.&lt;ref name="ni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |title=Local attractions: Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) |publisher=[[Nainital district]] official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829134618/http://nainital.nic.in/observatory.htm |archivedate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Observatory#Astronomical observatories|astronomical observatory]] is open to the public during working days on afternoons. For night viewing however, three - four days on moonlight nights are fixed and prior permission is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nainitaltourism.com/observatory_aries.html|title=OBSERVATORY ( Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES)|publisher=Official Nainital tourism website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute was started on 20 April 1954 under the supervision of Dr.A.N.Singh as Uttar Pradesh State Observatory (UPSO) in the premises of the [[Govt. Sanskrit College]], presently known as [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]], [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].
With the creation of the State of [[Uttarakhand]] on 9 Nov 2000, and because of its geographical location within the boundaries of [[Uttarakhand]], UPSO came under the administrative control of the new government and was re-christened as the State Observatory (SO). Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) was its new name when it came under the Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST), Govt. of India as an autonomous body on 22 March 2004.

==Research facilities==
===Astronomy and Astrophysics===
[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Belgian PM Charles Michel activate the ARIES Telescope located in Uttarakhand.jpg|thumb|300px|Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] and Belgian Prime Minister [[Charles Michel]] remotely activate the ARIES telescope from [[Brussels]] on 30 March 2016.]]
Research activities at ARIES cover topics related to the sun, stars and galaxies. ARIES has made significant contributions particularly to the field of star clusters and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). The longitude of ARIES (79° East) locates it in the middle of a 180-degree wide longitude band having modern astronomical facilities lying between the Canary Islands (20° West) and Eastern Australia (157° East).Observations, which are not possible in Canary Islands or Australia due to daylight, can be made at ARIES. Because of its geographical location and existence of good astronomical observation sites, ARIES has made unique contributions to many areas of astronomical research, particularly those involving time critical phenomena (e.g., the first successful attempt in the country to observe optical afterglow of GRBs was carried out from ARIES). A large number of eclipsing binaries, variable stars, star clusters, nearby galaxies, GRBs, and supernova have been observed from ARIES. The other research fields of the institute include solar astronomy, stellar astronomy, star clusters, stellar variability and pulsation, photometric studies of nearby galaxies, Quasars, and transient events like supernovae and highly energetic Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). A total solar eclipse lasting about 4 minutes was successfully observed from Manavgat, Antalya in Turkey on 29 March 2006 by a team of scientists from the Institute.

In past, new ring systems around Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were discovered from the observatory. Recently, for the first time a direct correlation between the intra-night optical variability and the degree of polarization of the radio jets in Quasars was established based on the observations from ARIES. For the first time periodic oscillations are detected in optical intra day variability data of blazers which is extremely useful to get the blackhole mass of blazers and also provide a strong support to accretion disk based models of AGN.

===Atmospheric Sciences===
Nainital (29.40N; 79.50E, 1958 m amsl) is located at a high altitude in the Central Himalayas and away from urban cities or any major pollution source. This factor makes it very suitable for carrying out observations in background condition and to study the regional environment, particularly interactions between natural and anthropogenic trace species and climate change. Additionally, the ARIES site can also provide information on long range transport of pollutants. Studies on lower atmospheric dynamics are also very important in this region, which is severely lacking over northern India.

==Infrastructure==
The Institute has in-house workshops to meet the requirements of electronic, mechanical, and optical maintenance of the instruments. ARIES has a modern computer center with internet facility and a well maintained library with more than 10,000 volumes of research journals and an excellent collection of books on Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics and Atmospheric Sciences.

'''The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine''' is an international instrument aiming to prohibit the misuse of innovations in [[biomedicine]] and to protect human [[dignity]]. The Convention was opened for signature on 4 April 1997 in [[Oviedo, Spain]] and is thus otherwise known as the '''Oviedo Convention'''. The International [[treaty]] is a manifestation of the effort on the part of the [[Council of Europe]] to keep pace with developments in the field of biomedicine; it is notably the first multilateral binding instrument entirely devoted to biolaw.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention entered into force on 1 December 1999.

==Characteristics==
The Convention provides a framework structure to preserve human dignity comprehensively across the field of [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubios.info/EJ123/ej123d.htm Ismini Kriari-Cataris, ''The Convention for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine: Convention on human rights and biomedicine,'' Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences Athens, Greece, Journal of Asian and International Bioethics, 12 (2002) 90-93]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is shaped around the premise that there is a fundamental connection between human rights and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum common standard is created by the Convention and allows states to legislate for a greater degree of protection upon ratification (''Article 27''). In addition, judicial protection is conferred on the national courts. Therefore, there is no basis on which an individual can bring an action in relation to the Oviedo Convention alone. The Convention may only be referenced in conjunction with proceedings brought in respect of a violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Absence of any provisions for a judicial procedure from the convention is considered to be a major weakness of the Oviedo Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gr2tq4rz9x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+Convention+on+Human+Rights+and+Biomedicine%3A+An+appraisal+of+the+Council+of+Europe+Convention&amp;rft.jtitle=European+Journal+of+Health+Law&amp;rft.au=Roscam+Abbing%2C+H.D.C&amp;rft.date=1998&amp;rft.issn=0929-0273&amp;rft.eissn=1571-8093&amp;rft.volume=5&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=377&amp;rft.epage=387&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1163%2F15718099820522588&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=29051894&amp;paramdict=en-NZ Henriette Roscam Abbing, ''The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. An Appraisal of the Council of Europe Convention'', European Journal of Health Law, 1998, no.5, p.379]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==
The rate of advancement in biomedicine caused concern to the Council of Europe that as much as development in this field instilled hope for mankind, it also posed a threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; It became the objective of the Council of Europe to set out common general standards for the protection of the dignity of the human person in relation to biomedical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  A draft convention was requested by the Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/healthbioethic/cdbi/default_en.asp Committee on Bioethics]&lt;/ref&gt; and drafted by its Working Group in July 1992. The draft convention underwent public consultation in July 1994, adopted by the Committee of Ministers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/cm/home_en.asp Committee of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1996, and finally opened for signature on 4 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parties to the Convention==
35 states have signed the ‘’’Oviedo Convention’'' since it was opened for signature in 1997, however only 29 of these states have signed and ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/164/signatures|title=Parties to the Oviedo Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=Treaty Office|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that only 29 states have implemented the principles of the instrument into their national law. Furthermore, 6 of those ratifying states have reservations limiting the extent to which they are bound to certain provisions. Notably, the UK and Germany have neither signed nor ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=164&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Parties to the Oviedo Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; The UK considered the convention too restrictive, whereas Germany thought it too permissive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues addressed by the Convention==
The preamble to the Oviedo Convention makes clear that its intention is for developments in biomedicine to benefit future generations and all of humanity.  The convention sets out the legal framework, which will ensure the protection of the dignity and identity of the human being. Intended as a supplementary instrument, the convention will be read in conjunction with other human rights protections namely: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Introduction.aspx UDHR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx ICCPR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx ICESCR]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx CRC]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ([[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms|ECHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf ECHR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703000000/http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf |date=July 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/T/DGHL/Monitoring/SocialCharter/ European Social Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Principles===
The general provisions of the Oviedo Convention outline the object and purpose of the instrument. The aim is to secure the dignity of human beings within the field of biomedicine. Several principles are adopted in order to achieve this goal. Embodied in the first chapter to the convention, the principles relate to the primacy of the human being, equitable access to healthcare ([[health equity|equitable access to healthcare]]), and professional standards.

===Consent===
The issue of consent is pivotal to the Convention because of the relationship it has to individual [[autonomy]]. Medical intervention carried out without consent is a general prohibition within ''Article 5''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, consent must be free and fully informed. Free and [[informed consent]] is based on objective information. Protection is afforded to those not able to consent and provision is made for emergency situations. Specific rules must be observed where any medical intervention is carried out in any situation where a person is not able to give free and informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private life and right to information===
This issue is closely related to the right to privacy in [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. The scope of the right encompasses an individual’s entitlement not to know as well as the right to know information regarding their health. Interests of the patient, a third party, or society may lead to a restriction of either facet of the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter III]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human genome===
The Oviedo Convention incorporates provisions to address concerns relating to research into the [[human genome]]. Focus is honed on [[genetic testing]], the storage of genetic data and modification of the human genome.  Genetic testing as a tool for discrimination is prohibited under ''Article 11'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 11]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Article 12'' allows genetic testing only for health or for scientific research linked to health purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching theme is that genetic testing is reserved for health-related purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, modification of the human genome, for reasons other than health-related is generally prohibited under ''Article 13'' of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
The freedom of scientific research&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=freedom%20of%20scientific%20research  World Congress for Freedom of Research]&lt;/ref&gt; is embodied in ''Chapter V''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter V]&lt;/ref&gt; However, precedence is afforded to the protection of human dignity and other fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the freedom of research is qualified (''Article 15'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out on human beings is under strict controls set forth by the convention (''Article 16'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 16]&lt;/ref&gt; The general rules on consent stipulated in ''Chapter II''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt; must be observed in the context of research. In addition, the creation of embryos [[in vitro]] for the purposes of scientific research is expressly prohibited (''Article 18'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 18]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Organs and Transplantation===
The Convention provides the general rule that living donors for organ transplants are only to be utilised if there is no availability of organs from a deceased person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter VI]&lt;/ref&gt; Any removed parts of the body must be disposed of respectfully in accordance with the wishes of the individual. In addition, there is to be no financial gain arising from the human body or its parts, however adequate compensation for expenses incurred for a medical procedure is not prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 132]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules relating to consent laid out in ''Chapter II'' of the Convention also apply in the context of organ transplantation.

==Infringements of the Provisions of the Convention==
In accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, any individual who has suffered damage should have access to fair compensation (''Article 24'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 24]&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate judicial protection is required to be put in place to ensure there is no infringement of the principles contained in the Convention. Proportionate sanctions will be imposed for non-compliance in accordance with ''Article 25''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider Protection==
The Oviedo Convention reflects a [[minimum harmonisation]] instrument. Therefore, parties to the convention have jurisdiction to provide a greater degree of protection than that offered by the convention. However, they cannot offer lesser protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 161-162]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of the Convention==
Questions of interpretation may be referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for an advisory opinion to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 164]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are unable to bring an action on the basis of violation of the Oviedo Convention alone, but may reference the provisions in proceedings relating to the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Reservations==
A [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] may be made with respect to a particular provision of the convention (''Article 36''). Six states have reservations regarding particular provisions:
* [[Croatia]]
* [[Denmark]]
* [[France]]
* [[Norway]]
* [[Switzerland]]
* [[Turkey]]

==Denunciation==
Any [[signatory]] can denounce the convention by means of notification to the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]].

==Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings==
Deliberate [[cloning]], to create genetically identical human beings, is contrary to human dignity and constitutes a misuse of biology and medicine. It is therefore prohibited under this protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/168.htm Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Transplantation==
The protocol stipulates that, insofar as is possible, equitable access to transplantation services should be ensured. In addition, any transplantation should be carried out with respect for rights and freedoms of donors, potential donors, and recipients of organs and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/186.htm Protocol on Transplantation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Biomedical Research==
In the context of biomedical research, the protocol aims to ensure protection for dignity and identity of all human beings without discrimination. The Protocol recognises that research can contribute to saving and improving human life but it can also run contrary to the fundamental principles of dignity and other rights. Where this may be the case the research should not be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/195.htm Protocol on Biomedical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes==
The protocol responds to the concerns regarding possible improper use of genetic testing and aims to protect the dignity and identity of all human beings within this sphere. Through restricting use of genetic testing to health purposes only the convention aims to achieve its object and purpose. Genetic Testing is also permitted for scientific research, but its regulation is not included in this Protocol. It also establishes the need of free and informed consent and genetic counselling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/203.htm Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DEEP2 Survey''' or '''DEEP2''' was a two-phased [[Redshift survey]] of the [[Redshift]] z=~1 universe (where z= a measure of speed and by extension, the distance from earth).  It used the twin 10 metre [[Keck telescopes]] in Hawaii (the world's second largest optical telescope) to measure the spectra and hence the redshifts of approximately 50,000 galaxies. It was the first project to study galaxies in the distant Universe with the resolution of local surveys like the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and was completed in 2013.

[[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]]'s '''''De fato''''' (Latin, "Concerning [[Fate]]") is a partially [[lost work|lost]] philosophical treatise written in 44 BC. Only two-thirds of the work exists; the beginning and ending are missing.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preface, iv&lt;/ref&gt; It takes the form of a [[dialogue]], although it reads more like an exposition,&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt;  whose [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]] are Cicero and his friend [[Aulus Hirtius]].

In the work, Cicero analyzes the concept of [[Fate]], and suggests that [[free will]] is a condition of Fate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero, Marcus Tullius]]. Trans.  [[Charles Duke Yonge|C.D. Yonge]] [https://archive.org/details/treatisesofcicer00ciceuoft ''The treatises of M.T. Cicero: On the nature of the gods; On divination; On fate; On the republic; On the laws; and On standing for the consulship.'' pg. 264. London G. Bell, 1878. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De fato''. I.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero, however, does not consciously deal with the distinction between [[fatalism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref name='Henry'&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/282901 Henry, Margaret Y. ''Cicero's Treatment of the Free Will Problem.'' Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, 58 pp. 32-42. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1927. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that ''De Fato'' is an appendix to the treatise on theology formed by the three books of ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' and the two books of ''[[De Divinatione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''On the Orator: Book 3. On Fate. Stoic Paradoxes. Divisions of Oratory,'' pg. 189. Translated by H. Rackham. Loeb Classical Library 349. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; These three books provide important information regarding [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[cosmology]] and [[theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=JokeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=de+fato+cicero&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2l3CV2_bWv&amp;sig=sqS8InVynu4iZI91o8uG51Y7E6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCTgKahUKEwjxwdffgOvGAhUGV5IKHU39CPk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Colish, Marcia. ''The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages, Volume 1'', pg 109]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''De fato'' is part of the second group of Cicero's writings.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The work was composed at Pozzuoli between April 17th and May 23rd of 44 BC.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the work would have most likely been completed prior to Cicero's abortive departure for Greece in July of that year.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written in haste, as Cicero was planning to return to the political arena.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preface, iv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argumentation==
Hirtius notes that Cicero has adopted the [[Platonic Academy|Academic method]] of investigation: arguing against all propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De fato.'' II.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he outlines the positions of [[Democritus]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]], and [[Aristotle]] as those who maintained that everything happens by necessity. As such Cicero develops the propositions of [[Hard determinism|fate and necessity]] as follows:

{{quote|"If all things happen by fate, all things happen with an antecedent cause; and if this is true of desire, it is true also of what follows desire, and therefore true of assent. But if the cause of desire is not within us, desire itself is not in our power; and if this is so, then those things which are brought about by desire are not within us. Therefore neither assent nor action is in our power; and  from this it follows that neither praise nor blame are just, nor honours nor punishment"&lt;ref name='Huby'&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4181841 Huby, Pamela M. ''An Epicurean Argument in Cicero, "De Fato" XVII-40.''Phronesis 15.1, pp. 83-85. BRILL, 1970. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cicero essentially dismisses this proposition as [[reductio ad absurdum|antithetical]] to what is observed, but postulates freedom as a necessity for moral life.&lt;ref name='Henry'/&gt; Ultimately, Cicero maintains this position as he is emotionally convinced that it is in man's power to achieve virtue for himself; if determinism were the order of things, then such ability would not be true.&lt;ref name='Henry'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="966">In [[telecommunication]], the term '''degree of start-stop distortion''' has the following meanings: 

# In [[asynchronous serial communication]] [[data transmission]], the ratio of (a) the [[absolute value]] of the maximum measured difference between the actual and theoretical intervals separating any [[significant instant]] of [[modulation]] (or [[demodulation]]) from the significant instant of the start element immediately preceding it to (b) the [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]]. 
# The highest absolute value of individual [[distortion]] affecting the significant instants of a [[start-stop modulation]]. 

The degree of distortion of a start-stop modulation (or demodulation) is usually expressed as a percentage. Distinction can be made between the degree of late (positive) distortion and the degree of early (negative) distortion.

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3693">'''Environmental virtue ethics''' (EVE) is, as the name suggests, a way of approaching [[environmental ethics]] through the lens of [[virtue ethics]]. It is paradoxically both a very new and a relatively old or established approach. It is old or established because, as Louke Van Wensveen points out, almost all environmental literature employs virtue language.&lt;ref name="Wensveen, 2000"&gt;Louke van Wensveen, ''Dirty Virtues: The Emergence of Ecological Virtue Ethics'' (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; It is new because it is only recently that this tendency to use virtue-laden language has been taken up explicitly and addressed through the lens of philosophical virtue ethics.

Early interest in applying virtue theory to environmental problems can be found in disparate articles in academic and environmental journals, such as Thomas Hill's "Ideals of Human Excellence and Preserving Natural Environments."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Hill, "Ideals of Human Excellence and Preserving Natural Environments," ''Environmental Ethics'' 5 (fall 1983):211-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major analysis of this approach is Louke Van Wensveen’s influential book ''Dirty Virtues: The Emergence of Ecological Virtue Ethics''.&lt;ref name="Wensveen, 2000"/&gt;

Environmental virtue ethicists take inspiration for a variety of schools of virtue ethics and from diverse backgrounds in environmental ethics. Nevertheless, there are three general approaches to identifying virtues and vices within EVE. First, the "virtue theory approach," which attempts to build an environmental virtue ethics from the ground up. Second, the "environmental exemplar approach," which looks to people who are generally considered to be environmentally virtuous as models. And, finally, the "extensionist approach," which takes traditional virtues and extends them to operate in an environmentally meaningful way.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Sandler, ''Character and Environment: A Virtue-Oriented Approach to Environmental Ethics'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007), 10-11).&lt;/ref&gt; While some authors take one of these approaches, others combine elements from two or more. 

Typical EVE topics include: the explication of specific virtues or vices; the analysis of specific exemplars who embody one or more of the virtues; the attempt to weigh in on specific environmental problems from the perspective of virtue ethics, including offering rules (“v-rules”) for conduct or making actual policy recommendations; and, of course, arguing for the theoretical foundation and legitimacy of the virtue-theory approach to environmental ethics.

The '''Euchologium Sinaiticum''' is a 109-folio [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic#Canon|Canon of Old Church Slavonic]] [[euchologium]]. It contains parts of the liturgy of the St. [[John Chrysostom]], and is dated to the 11th century.

== Manuscripts ==
Part of the manuscript was found in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Egypt]] in 1850 by the Russian [[archimandrite]] [[Porphyrius Uspensky]] ([[#SinSl37|Sin. slav. 37]]), and there it's still kept today excepting the three folios taken by Uspenskij and N.P. Krylov to Saint Petersburg, Russia ([[National Library of Russia|NLR]] Ms. глаг. 2 &amp; 3). Among the Sinai manuscripts discovered in 1975 is a 28-folio fragment of the Euchologium Sinaiticum (Sin. slav. 1/N).

== Editions ==
It was first published by Czech L. Geitler in 1882 in Zagreb. In the edition ''[[Patrologia Orientalis]]'' (t. XXIV, fasc. 5, 1933, p. 605-802 and t. XXV, fasc. 3, 1939, p. 487-617) it was published by J. Frček. Slovene Slavist R. Nahtigal published a facsimile edition it in Ljubljana in 1941, and in 1942 in a Cyrillic transcription. A facsimile edition of the recent discoveries of Euchologium fragmenta has been published by I. C. Tarnanidis: ''The Slavonic Manuscripts Discovered in 1975. at St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai'' (Thessaloniki, 1988).

== Context ==
Researchers emphasize that the manuscript is a collection of diverse prayers of different origins: some of them are scribed to the pre-Cyrillo-Methodian Salzburg mission, and for others it's being claimed that they represent Eastern-rite missal fragments. We don't know much of its language: nasal vowels are well-preserved, there is no notation of palatalism in syllabic sonorants ''r'' and ''l'', strong [[yer]]s are sometimes preserved, and sometimes vocalized (''ъ'' &gt; ''o'', ''ь'' &gt; ''e''), weak yers are sometimes omitted, [[Jagić's rule]] is confirmed etc.

The '''Euthalian Apparatus''' is a collection of additional editorial material, such as divisions of text, lists, and summaries, to the [[New Testament]]'s [[Book of Acts]], [[Catholic epistles]], and [[Pauline epistles]]. This additional material appears at the beginnings of books, in the margin of the text, and at the ends of books, as well as in line and paragraph separations. This material is traditionally associated with the name of [[Euthalius]].

== Description ==
Euthalius divided the text of the Acts and Catholic epistles into chapters, with a summary of contents at the top of each chapter. To Euthalius were also referred a division of the Acts into 16 αναγνωσεις (''lessons'') and of the Pauline epistles into 31 sections. But these lessons are quite different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F. H. A.|last= Scrivener|authorlink= Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|title=[[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]|publisher=[[George Bell &amp; Sons]]|location=London|year=1894|volume=1|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Euthalius prepared also the text of the Acts and Epistles in which text is written [[Stichometry|stichometrically]].&lt;ref name = Waltz&gt;Robert Waltz, [http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Divisions.html#Euth ''Euthalian Apparatus'', in: ''Encyclopedia of Textual Criticism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

To the Euthalian Apparatus belong: a chronology of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], the martyrdom of Paul, a list of places at which the Epistles were thought to be written, and the names associated with Paul in the headings to the Epistles.&lt;ref name = Ehrman&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]] &amp; [[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The quotations from the Old Testament cited in the Pauline epistles are numbered and catalogued in a list.&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt; Overall, the Apparatus is a collection of varied aids for the reader.&lt;ref name = Ehrman/&gt;

The Euthalian Apparatus is contained in numerous manuscripts: [[Codex Mutinensis]], [[Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2]], [[Codex Argenteus]], [[Minuscule 3]], [[Minuscule 5|5]], [[Minuscule 6|6]], [[Minuscule 35|35]], [[Minuscule 38|38]], and many other medieval manuscripts of the New Testament.

== Dating ==
The Euthalian apparatus has variously been dated to between the 4th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref name = Marchand&gt;Marchand, James, 1956. "The Gothic Evidence for 'Euthalian Matter,'" in ''Harvard Theological Review'', vol. 49 no. 3, pp. 159-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Marchand]] argued that the Euthalian apparatus probably dated to the first half of the 4th century, arguing that the original must precede its incorporation into [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt;

The Greek texts do not include the Euthalian apparatus until relatively late, but Armenian and Syriac texts incorporated it by the late 5th or early 6th century, with Gothic texts including it by the early/mid 6th century.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt; The Greek [[Codex Coislinianus]] includes it in the 6th century. James Marchand argued that either [[Ulfilas|Wulfila/Ulfilas]] had incorporated the Euthalian matter into the Gothic text in the mid 4th century, or Sunnia and Frethela had done so in the early 5th century, with Wulfila/Ulfilas being more likely.&lt;ref name = Marchand/&gt;

== Authorship ==
The authorship usually is attributed to one Euthalius. He was identified as Bishop of Sulci in [[Sardinia]], but according to [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|Tregelles]] he was a Bishop of Sulca in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Tregelles, ''An Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'', London 1856, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[William Wake|Wake]] and L. A. Zacagni Euthalius was a Bishop of Sulce, near [[Aswan|Syene]].&lt;ref name = Bleek&gt;{{cite book|first=F. H. A.|last= Scrivener|authorlink= Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener|title=[[A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament]]|publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons|location=London|year=1894|volume=1|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested{{by whom|date=March 2013}} that the name of the real author of the Apparatus was Evagrius. According to [[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]] it was [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Bleek, [https://archive.org/stream/introductionton00urwigoog#page/n322/mode/2up ''Introduction to the New Testament''], tranl. [[William Urwick the younger|William Urwick]], Edinburgh 1870, Volume 2, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Hermann von Soden thought, that Euthalius lived in the 7th century, possibly in [[Antioch]].&lt;ref&gt;H. von Soden, ''Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments'', pp. 637-649&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce M. Metzger]] stated: "How much of this supplementary material was drawn up by Euthalius and how much was added later is not known."&lt;ref name = Ehrman/&gt;

'''Futurism''' ({{lang-it|Futurismo}}) was an [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[social movement]] that originated in [[Italy]] in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Giacomo Balla]], and [[Luigi Russolo]]. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=The 20th-Century art book|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=978-0714835426|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnason|last2=Harvard|first2=H.|last3=Mansfield|first3=Elizabeth|title=History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography|date=December 2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205259472|pages=189|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important Futurist works included Marinetti's ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', Boccioni's sculpture ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'', Balla's painting ''[[Abstract Speed + Sound]]'', and Russolo's ''[[The Art of Noises]]''. Although it was largely an [[Italians|Italian]] phenomenon, there were parallel movements in [[Russia]], [[England]], [[Belgium]] and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even [[Futurist meals]]. To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements [[Art Deco]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and to a greater degree [[Precisionism]], [[Rayonism]], and [[Vorticism]].

==Italian Futurism==
Futurism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909 by the Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"/&gt;  Marinetti launched the movement in his ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut28144gut Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''I manifesti del futurismo'', February 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in ''La gazzetta dell'Emilia'', an article then reproduced in  the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on Saturday 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2883730/f1.image Le Figaro, ''Le Futurisme'', 1909/02/20 (Numéro 51)]. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaai190904-01.2.3&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-futurism------ Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''Declaration of Futurism'', published in Poesia, Volume 5, Number 6, April 1909] (Futurist manifesto translated to English). Blue Mountain Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy"&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/7/73/Futurist_Aristocracy_1_1923.pdf Futurist Manifesto, reproduced in ''Futurist Aristocracy'', New York, April 1923]&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon joined by the painters [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Gino Severini]] and the composer [[Luigi Russolo]]. Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. "We want no part of it, the past", he wrote, "we the young and strong ''Futurists!''"  The Futurists admired [[speed]], [[technology]], youth and [[violence]], the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over [[nature]], and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, "however daring, however violent", bore proudly "the smear of madness", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.

Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti, et al, 1914] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting.  Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings:  "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places.  ...  The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techpaint.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of [[Divisionism]], breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been originally created by [[Giovanni Segantini]] and others.  Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art.&lt;ref&gt;Severini, G., ''The Life of a Painter'', Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-691-04419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severini was the first to come into contact with [[Cubism]] and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists.  Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.

[[File:Umberto Boccioni 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Umberto Boccioni]], sketch of ''[[The City Rises]]'' (1910)]]
They often painted modern urban scenes.  Carrà's ''[[The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli|Funeral of the Anarchist Galli]]'' (1910–11) is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in, in 1904.  The action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes.  His ''Leaving the Theatre'' (1910–11) uses a Divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights.

Boccioni's [[The City Rises (Boccioni)|''The City Rises'']]  (1910) represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge, rearing red horse in the centre foreground, which workmen struggle to control.  His ''States of Mind'', in three large panels, ''The Farewell'', ''Those who Go'', and ''Those Who Stay'', "made his first great statement of Futurist painting, bringing his interests in [[Bergson]], Cubism and the individual's complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the 'minor masterpieces' of early twentieth century painting."&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;Humphreys, R. ''Futurism'', Tate Gallery, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including "lines of force", which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space, "simultaneity", which combined memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events, and "emotional ambience" in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;

Boccioni's intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of Bergson, including the idea of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], which Bergson defined as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it.  The Futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted.  Boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book, ''Pittura scultura Futuriste: Dinamismo plastico'' (''Futurist Painting Sculpture: Plastic Dynamism'') (1914).&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussions of Boccioni's debt to Bergson, see Petrie, Brian, "Boccioni and Bergson", ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 116, No.852, March 1974, pp.140-147, and Antliff, Mark "The Fourth Dimension and Futurism: A Politicized Space", ''The Art Bulletin'', December 2000, pp.720-733.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giacomo Balla, 1912, Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, oil on canvas, 89.8 x 109.8 cm, Albright-Knox Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giacomo Balla]], 1912, ''[[Dinamismo di un Cane al Guinzaglio]]'' (''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash''), [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]]]]
Balla's ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'' (1912) exemplifies the Futurists' insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement.  The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash&amp;nbsp;—and the feet of the woman walking it&amp;nbsp;—have been multiplied to a blur of movement.  It illustrates the precepts of the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' that, "On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career.  Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular."&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;  His ''Rhythm of the Bow'' (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist's hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.

The adoption of Cubism determined the style of much subsequent Futurist painting, which Boccioni and Severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brush-strokes of divisionism.  But Futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static Cubism of [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]]. Although there were Futurist portraits (e.g. Carrà's  ''Woman with Absinthe'' (1911),  Severini's ''Self-Portrait'' (1912), and Boccioni's  ''Matter'' (1912)), it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified Futurist painting—e.g. Boccioni's ''[[The Street Enters the House]]'' (1911), Severini's ''Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin'' (1912), and Russolo's ''Automobile at Speed'' (1913)

In 1912 and 1913, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas.  In ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' (1913) he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment, which was central to his theory of "dynamism".  The sculpture represents a striding figure, cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the [[Tate Modern]]. (It now appears on the national side of [[Italian euro coins|Italian 20 eurocent coins]]). He explored the theme further in ''Synthesis of Human Dynamism'' (1912), ''Speeding Muscles'' (1913) and ''Spiral Expansion of Speeding Muscles'' (1913).  His ideas on sculpture were published in the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techsculpt.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture |publisher=Unknown.nu |date=1910-04-11 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1915 Balla also turned to sculpture making abstract "reconstructions", which were created out of various materials, were apparently moveable and even made noises.  He said that, after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles, he understood that "the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth ... I felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires, cardboard planes, cloth and tissue paper, etc."&lt;ref name=MartinM&gt;Martin, Marianne W. ''Futurist Art and Theory'', Hacker Art Books, New York, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan group, around Marinetti, Boccioni, and Balla, and the Florence group, around Carrà, [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1879–1964) and [[Giovanni Papini]] (1881–1956), created a rift in Italian Futurism.  The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish "an immobile church with an infallible creed", and each group dismissed the other as ''passéiste.''

Futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic.  The ''Futurist Manifesto'' had declared, "We will glorify war&amp;nbsp;—the world's only hygiene&amp;nbsp;—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman."&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/manifesto.html |title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements, it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of 1913.&lt;ref name=MartinM/&gt;  Then, fearing the re-election of [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolitti]], Marinetti published a political manifesto.  In 1914 the Futurists began to campaign actively against the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], which still controlled some Italian territories, and Italian neutrality between the major powers. In September, Boccioni, seated in the balcony of the Teatro dal Verme in Milan, tore up an Austrian flag and threw it into the audience, while Marinetti waved an Italian flag.  When Italy entered the [[First World War]] in 1915, many Futurists enlisted.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Jerry, "Back to the Future", The New Yorker, September 6, 2004, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the war marked several Futurists, particularly Marinetti, who fought in the mountains of Trentino at the border of Italy and Austria-Hungary, actively engaging in propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'The Futurist mountains': Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War|journal = Modern Italy|date = 2013-11-01|issn = 1353-2944|pages = 323–338|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13532944.2013.806289|first = Selena|last = Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combat experience also influenced Futurist music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Futurist War Noises: Confronting and Coping with the First World War|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8fx1p115#page-1|website = California Italian Studies|accessdate = 2015-09-13|last = Daly|first = Selena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of war disguised the fact that Italian Futurism had come to an end. The Florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of 1914.  Boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in 1916.  Severini painted some significant war pictures in 1915 (e.g. ''War'', ''Armored Train'', and ''Red Cross Train''), but in Paris turned towards Cubism and post-war was associated with the [[Return to Order]].

After the war, Marinetti revived the movement.  This revival was called ''il secondo Futurismo'' (Second Futurism) by writers in the 1960s.  The art historian [[Giovanni Lista]] has classified Futurism by decades: "Plastic Dynamism" for the first decade, "Mechanical Art" for the 1920s, "Aeroaesthetics" for the 1930s.

==Russian Futurism==
{{main|Russian Futurism|Cubo-Futurism}}
[[File:Cyclist (Goncharova, 1913).jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Goncharova]], ''Cyclist'', 1913]]
Russian Futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts. The poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] was a prominent member of the movement. Visual artists such as [[David Burlyuk]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Kazimir Malevich]] found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings and were poets themselves. It has also a larger impact on the all [[suprematism]] movement. Other poets adopting Futurism included [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and [[Aleksey Kruchenykh]]. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the Futurist opera ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'', with texts by Kruchenykh and sets by Malevich.

The main style of painting was [[Cubo-Futurism]], adopted in 1913 when [[Aristarkh Lentulov]] returned from Paris and exhibited his paintings in Moscow.  Cubo-Futurism combines the forms of [[Cubism]] with the representation of movement.  Like their Italian predecessors the Russian Futurists were fascinated with dynamism, speed and the restlessness of modern urban life.

The Russian Futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past, saying that [[Pushkin]] and [[Dostoevsky]] should be "heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity". They acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to Marinetti, whose principles they had earlier adopted, obstructing him when he came to Russia to proselytize in 1914.

The movement began to decline after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution of 1917]]. Some Futurists died, others emigrated. Mayakovsky and Malevich became part of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] establishment and the [[Agitprop]] movement of the 1920s. Khlebnikov and others were persecuted. Mayakovsky committed suicide on April 14, 1930.

[[File:Casa Sant'Elia.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Futurist architecture]] by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]]]

==Architecture==
{{further|Futurist architecture}}
The Futurist architect [[Antonio Sant'Elia]] expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for ''La Città Nuova'' (The New City) (1912–1914).  This project was never built and Sant'Elia was killed in the First World War, but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artists.  The city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of Futurist life is projected.  The city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life.  Sant'Elia aimed to create a city as an efficient, fast-paced machine.  He manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects. Baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity.  In the new city, every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy.  The city was not meant to last, and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past.

Futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the Fascist state's tendency towards [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]]-classical aesthetic patterns. Nevertheless, several Futurist buildings were built in the years 1920–1940, including public buildings such as railway stations, maritime resorts and [[post office]]s.  Examples of Futurist buildings still in use today are [[Trento]]'s railway station, built by [[Angiolo Mazzoni]], and the [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella station]] in [[Florence]].  The Florence station was designed in 1932 by the ''Gruppo Toscano'' (Tuscan Group) of architects, which included [[Giovanni Michelucci]] and [[Italo Gamberini]], with contributions by Mazzoni.

==Music==
{{main|Futurism (music)}}
Futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery, and would influence several 20th-century composers.

[[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] joined the Futurist movement in 1910 and wrote a ''Manifesto of Futurist Musicians'' in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what he had to say. According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the "sublime genius" of [[Wagner]] and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers, for example [[Richard Strauss]], [[Elgar]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Sibelius]]. By contrast, the Italian [[symphony]] was dominated by [[opera]] in an "absurd and anti-musical form". The [[College or university school of music|conservatories]] was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the "rickety and vulgar" operas of [[Puccini]] and [[Umberto Giordano]]. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher [[Pietro Mascagni]], because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled "the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice."

[[Luigi Russolo]] (1885–1947) wrote ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russolo |first=Luigi |url=http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |title=The Art of Noises on Theremin Vox |publisher=Thereminvox.com |date=2004-02-22 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607122724/http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html The Art of Noises] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094533/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential text in 20th-century musical aesthetics. Russolo used instruments he called ''[[intonarumori]]'', which were [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] [[noise]] generators that permitted the performer to create and control the [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of several different types of noises. Russolo and Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with ''intonarumori'', in 1914. However they were prevented from performing in many major European cities by the outbreak of war.

Futurism was one of several 20th-century movements in art music that paid homage to, included or imitated machines. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] has been seen as anticipating some Futurist ideas, though he remained wedded to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/papers/lombardi.html |title=Daniele Lombardi in ''Futurism and Musical Notes'' |publisher=Ubu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russolo's ''intonarumori'' influenced [[Stravinsky]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[George Antheil]], [[Edgar Varèse]],&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt; [[Stockhausen]] and [[John Cage]]. In [[Pacific 231]], Honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive. There are also Futurist elements in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''The Steel Step'' and in his Second Symphony.

Most notable in this respect, however, is the American [[George Antheil]]. His fascination with machinery is evident in his ''Airplane Sonata'', ''Death of the Machines'', and the 30-minute ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]''. The ''Ballet Mécanique'' was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by [[Fernand Léger]], but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone. The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three [[xylophones]], four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two "live pianists", and sixteen synchronized player pianos. Antheil's piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play.

Other composers offered more melodic variants of Futurist music, notably [[Franco Casavola]], who was active with the movement at the invitation of Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and [[Arthur-Vincent Lourié]], the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five ''Synthèses'' offer a form of dodecaphony, while ''Formes en l'air'' was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, [[Leo Ornstein]] gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the [[Daily Sketch]] newspaper ''"one listened with considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital."''

==Dance==
The Futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine.  The altitude of a flying plane, the power of a car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience.  The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian {{Ill|Giannina Censi|it}}. Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her "Aerodanze" and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: " I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I made myself a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled,... And the face had to express what the pilot felt."&lt;ref&gt;Klöck, A. (1999) ''Of Cyborg Technologies and Fascistized Mermaids: Giannina Censi’s ‘Aerodanze’ in 1930s Italy'', Theatre Journal 51(4): 395–415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/overview/futurism Juliet Bellow, ''Futurism and Dance'', Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism, 305], American University, 09/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{main|Futurism (literature)}}
Futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem).  The Futurists called their style of poetry ''parole in libertà'' (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

Theater also has an important place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.
There are a number of examples of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as  Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Giordano Bruno Sanzin (''Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista'' edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as 'parole in libertà'. Arnaldo Ginna's 'Le ''locomotive con le calze'''(Trains with socks on)plunges into a world of absurd nonsense, childishly crude. His brother Bruno Corra wrote in ''Sam Dunn è morto'' (Sam Dunn is Dead) a masterpiece of Futurist fiction, in a genre he himself called 'Synthetic' characterized by compression, and precision; it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony.

[[File:Blast2.jpg|thumb|The cover of the last edition of ''[[BLAST (magazine)|BLAST]]'', the [[literary magazine]] of the British [[Vorticist]] movement, a movement heavily influenced by Futurism]]
Many Italian Futurists supported [[Fascism]] in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, radicals, admirers of violence, and were opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party (''Partito Politico Futurista'') in early 1918, which was absorbed into [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci di combattimento]]'' in 1919, making Marinetti one of the first members of the [[National Fascist Party]]. He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, calling them "reactionary", and walked out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrawing from politics for three years; but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944. The Futurists' association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in [[architecture]]. After the [[Second World War]], many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.

Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Fascist Italy but failed to do so.  Mussolini chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said, "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art.  Art belongs to the domain of the individual.  The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braun, Emily, ''Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism'', Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's mistress, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board.  Although in the early years of Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of "[[degenerate art]]" from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.

Marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant-garde with each.  He moved from Milan to Rome to be nearer the centre of things.  He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, married despite his condemnation of marriage, promoted religious art after the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 and even reconciled himself to the Catholic Church, declaring that Jesus was a Futurist.

[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), lampada a grattacielo, 1929.jpg|thumb|An example of Futurist design: "Skyscraper Lamp", by the Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], 1929]]
Although Futurism mostly became identified with Fascism, it had leftist and anti-Fascist supporters.  They tended to oppose Marinetti's artistic and political direction of the movement, and in 1924 the socialists, communists and anarchists walked out of the Milan Futurist Congress. The anti-Fascist voices in Futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and the Italo-German [[Pact of Steel]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus, Günther, "New Research on Futurism and its Relations with the Fascist Regime", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 2007, Vol. 42, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;  This association of Fascists, socialists and anarchists in the Futurist movement, which may seem odd today, can be understood in terms of the influence of [[Georges Sorel]], whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum.

Futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture.

===Aeropainting===
{{main|Aeropittura}}
Aeropainting (''aeropittura'') was a major expression of the second generation of Futurism beginning in 1926.  The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters,&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |title=Osborn, Bob, ''Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter'' |publisher=Simultaneita.net |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090815/http://www.simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |archivedate=2010-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered aeroplanes and [[aerial landscape art|aerial landscape]] as new subject matter.  Aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment, including realism (especially in works of propaganda), abstraction, dynamism, quiet Umbrian landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;" ... dal realismo esasperato e compiaciuto (in particolare delle opere propagandistiche) alle forme asatratte (come in Dottori: ''Trittico della velocità''), dal dinamismo alle quieti lontane dei paesaggi umbri di Dottori ... ." ''L'aeropittura futurista'' http://users.libero.it/macbusc/id22.htm&lt;/ref&gt; portraits of Mussolini (e.g. Dottori's ''Portrait of il Duce''), devotional religious paintings, decorative art, and pictures of planes.

Aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of 1929, ''Perspectives of Flight'', signed by [[Benedetta]], [[Depero]], [[Gerardo Dottori|Dottori]], [[Fillìa]], Marinetti, [[Enrico Prampolini|Prampolini]], [[Somenzi]] and [[:it:Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)|Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)]]. The artists stated that  "The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective" and that "Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything." Crispolti identifies three main "positions" in aeropainting: "a vision of cosmic projection, at its most typical in Prampolini's 'cosmic idealism'  ... ; a 'reverie' of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairy-tale (for example in Dottori ...); and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery (particularly in [[Tullio Crali|Crali]], but also in Tato and Ambrosi)."&lt;ref&gt;Crispolti, E., "Aeropainting", in Hulten, P., ''Futurism and Futurisms'', Thames and Hudson, 1986, p.413&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters.  Major figures include [[Fortunato Depero]], [[Enrico Prampolini]], [[Gerardo Dottori]] and Crali. Crali continued to produce ''aeropittura'' up until the 1980s.

==Legacy==
Futurism influenced many other twentieth-century art movements, including [[Art Deco]], [[Vorticism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and much later [[Neo-Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, Neo-Futurism. Published by: Architectural Association School of Architecture https://www.jstor.org/stable/29543561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pinkus, ''Self-Representation in NeoFuturism and Punk''. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press https://www.jstor.org/stable/3190376&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct, having died out in 1944 with the death of its leader Marinetti.

Nonetheless, the ideals of Futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. [[Ridley Scott]] consciously evoked the designs of [[Antonio Sant'Elia|Sant'Elia]] in ''[[Blade Runner]]''. Echoes of Marinetti's thought, especially his "dreamt-of metallization of the human body", are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in [[manga]]/[[anime]] and the works of artists such as [[Shinya Tsukamoto]], director of the ''Tetsuo'' (lit. "Ironman") films. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the literary genre of [[cyberpunk]]—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the [[Internet]], such as [[Stelarc]] and [[Mariko Mori]], produce work which comments on Futurist ideals. and the art and architecture movement Neo-Futurism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/18509/facts.yes_is_more_an_archicomic_on_architectural_evolution.htm Yes is More.

A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement in theatre began in 1988 with the creation of the [[Neo-Futurist]] style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/neofuturists-tml-twenty-five-years-history-anniversary/Content?oid=11871597 |title=Too Much Light at 25: An oral history |last1=Potter |first1=Janet |date=16 December 2013 |website=Reader |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]'s 1986 album 'Futurista' was inspired by the movement. It features a speech from Tommaso Marinetti in the track 'Variety Show'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/stranger-in-a-strange-world/1043 Ryuichi Sakamoto interview published ''Music Technology Magazine'' in August 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gongche'' notation''' or '''''gongchepu''''' is a traditional [[musical notation]] method, once popular in ancient [[China]]. It uses [[Chinese character]]s to represent [[musical note]]s. It was named after two of the Chinese characters that were used to represent musical notes, namely "{{lang|zh|[[wikt:工|工]]}}" ''gōng'' and "{{lang|zh|[[wikt:尺|尺]]}}" ''chě''. Since the pronunciation ''chě'' for the character "{{lang|zh|尺}}" is uncommon, many people call it '''''gongchi'' notation''' or '''''gongchipu''''' by mistake{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

[[Sheet music]] written in this notation is still used for [[traditional Chinese musical instruments]] and [[Chinese opera]]s. However the notation is becoming less popular, replaced by mostly ''jianpu'' ([[numbered musical notation]]) and sometimes the standard western notation.

== The notes ==

=== Basic characters ===

The notation usually uses a [[Solfege#Variations|movable "do"]] system. There are variations of the character set used for musical notes. A commonly accepted set is shown below with its relation to ''jianpu'' and [[solfege]].
:{| class="wikitable" align="center"

|{{lang|ja|ル}}||{{lang|ja|人}}||{{lang|ja|フ}}||{{lang|ja|り}}||{{lang|ja|久}}||{{lang|ja|ゐ}}||&amp;nbsp;
|}

=== Usual variations ===

The three notes just below the central octave are usually represented by special characters:
:{| class="wikitable" align="center" 
|- align="center"
!''Gongche''
|width="22%"|{{lang|zh|合}}&lt;br&gt;''hé''
|width="22%"|{{lang|zh|四}}&lt;br&gt;''sì''
|width="22%"|{{lang|zh|一}}&lt;br&gt;''yī''
|- align="center" valign="top"
!''Jianpu''
|5̣

|(7̣)&lt;br&gt;
|- align="center"
!Solfege
|sol||la||(between ti♭ and ti)
|- align="center"
!Simplified Japanese notation
|{{lang|ja|ㄙ}}||{{lang|ja|マ}}||{{lang|ja|ㄧ}}
|}
Sometimes "{{lang|zh|士}}" ''shì'' is used instead of "{{lang|zh|四}}" ''sì''. Sometimes "{{lang|zh|一}}" ''yī'' is not used, or its role is exchanged with "{{lang|zh|乙}}" ''yǐ''.

To represent other notes in different [[octave]]s, traditions differ among themselves. For ''[[Kunqu]]'', the end strokes of "{{lang|zh|上}}" "{{lang|zh|尺}}" "{{lang|zh|工}}" "{{lang|zh|凡}}" are extended by a tiny slash downward for the lower octave, a [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] "{{lang|zh|亻}}" is added for one octave higher than the central. For [[Cantonese opera]], however, "{{lang|zh|亻}}" means an octave lower, while "{{lang|zh|彳}}" means an octave higher.

Some other variations:
* "{{lang|zh|尺}}" is replaced by "{{lang|zh|乂}}" in Taiwanese tradition.
* "{{lang|zh|凡}}" is replaced by "{{lang|zh|反}}" in Cantonese tradition.
* "{{lang|zh|彳上}}", the "do" just above the central octave, is usually replaced by "{{lang|zh|生}}" in Cantonese tradition.

The following are two examples.

=== Pronunciation ===

When the notes are sung in different opera traditions, they do not sound as the words would be pronounced in the respective [[varieties of Chinese|regional dialects]]. Instead, they are pronounced in an approximation of [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The following is an example from Cantonese opera.

== Rhythm ==

[[Image:Kungchepo_old_mcdonald.png|left|thumb|250px|An example of ''gongche'' notation]]

''Gongche'' notation does not mark the relative length of the notes. Instead, marks for the [[percussion]], understood to be played at regular intervals, are written alongside with the notes. Gongche is written in the same format as how Chinese was traditionally written; from top to bottom and then from right to left. The rhythm marks are written to the right of the note characters.

The diagram at the left illustrates how the tune "Old McDonald Had a Farm" will look like if written in ''gongche'' notation. Here, "{{lang|zh|。}}" denotes the stronger beat, called "{{lang|zh|板}}" ''bǎn'' or "{{lang|zh|拍}}" ''pāi'', and "{{lang|zh|、}}" denotes the weaker beat, called "{{lang|zh|眼}}" ''yǎn'' or "{{lang|zh|撩}}" ''liáo''. In effect, there is one beat in every two notes, i.e. two notes are sung or played to each beat. These notes in solfege with markings will show a similar effect:
:'''do''' do &lt;u&gt;do&lt;/u&gt; sol '''la''' la &lt;u&gt;sol&lt;/u&gt; &amp;nbsp; '''mi''' mi &lt;u&gt;re&lt;/u&gt; re '''do'''

[[File:Kam Hok Yap Mun-Yeung Kwan Sam Tip.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Example of gongche use with [[guqin]] tablature and beat marks.]]

Using this method, only the number of notes within a beat can be specified. The actual length of each note is up to tradition and the interpretation of the artist.

Notice that the actual rhythm marks used differ among various traditions.

== History and usage ==

''Gongche'' notation was invented in the [[Tang Dynasty]]. It became popular in the [[Song Dynasty]]. It is believed to have begun as a [[tablature]] of certain musical instrument, possibly using a fixed "do" system. Later it became a popular pitch notation, typically using a movable "do" system.

The notation is not accurate in modern sense. It provides a musical skeleton, allowing an artist to improvise. The details are usually passed on by oral tradition. However, once a tradition is lost, it is very difficult to reconstruct how the music was supposed to sound. Variations among different traditions increased the difficulty in learning the notation.

The system was also introduced to Korea (where it is referred to as ''gong jeok bo'') in ancient times and many traditional musicians still learn their music from such scores (although they typically perform from memory).

''[[Kunkunshi]]'', a [[Okinawan music|Ryukyuan]] musical notation still in use for [[sanshin]], was directly influenced by Gongche.&lt;ref&gt;East Asia: China, Japan, and Korea (Garland Encyclopedia of World Music). 2001. page 828&lt;/ref&gt;

Seidenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the process of learning to read is complex and builds on cognitive, linguistic, and social skills developed from a very early age.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

==Writing systems==
{{Main|Writing system}}

Usually, in order to understand a text, it is necessary to understand the spoken language associated with that text. In this way, writing systems are distinguished from many other symbolic communication systems.&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The World's Writing Systems]] |year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-507993-0|editor=Daniels, Peter T. |editor2=William Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts, and often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. The great benefit of writing systems is their ability to maintain a persistent record of information expressed in a language, which can be retrieved independently of the initial act of formulation.&lt;ref name="Daniels"/&gt;

==Acquiring reading==
A child's ability to learn to read, known as [[reading readiness]], begins in infancy, as the child begins attending to the speech signals in their environment and begins producing spoken language.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=81–83 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children make some use of all the material that they are presented with, including every [[perception]], [[concept]] and [[word]] that they come in contact with; thus the environment in which a child develops affects the child's ability to learn to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; The amount of time that a child spends together with [[parents]] or other important caregivers while listening to them read is a good predictor of the level of reading that the child will attain later in life.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Tiffany|title=Touch Therapy|year=2000|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=New York|isbn=0-443-05791-5|pages=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child sits with a caregiver, looking at pictures and listening to stories, they will slowly learn that all the different lines on each page make different symbols and then that together these symbols refer to words.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt;  Taking time to read to children is the most important precursor to a child's [[Training and development|development]] of reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; Preschool-aged children with limited exposure to books and reading in their home, including limited experience of being read to, are at risk of reading difficulties.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; For example, these children tend to have less exposure to literary phrases, such as "Once upon a time",&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; and have smaller vocabularies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biemiller|first=Andrew|title=Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network|url=http://www.literacyencyclopedia.ca/pdfs/topic.php?topId=19|accessdate=20 November 2011|pages=10|format=pdf|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyersBotting2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers|first1=L. |last2=Botting|first2=N. |title=Literacy in the mainstream inner-city school: Its relationship to spoken language|journal=Child Language Teaching and Therapy|volume=24 |issue=1|year=2008 |pages=95–114|issn=0265-6590 |doi=10.1177/0265659007084570}}&lt;/ref&gt; both factors that affect the ability to read by limiting comprehension of text. The environment in which a child lives may also impact their ability to acquire reading skills. Children who are regularly exposed to chronic environmental noise pollution, such as highway traffic noise, have been known to show decreased ability to discriminate between [[phonemes]] as well as lower reading scores on standardized tests.&lt;ref name="CohenGlass1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Sheldon|last2=Glass|first2=David C.|last3=Singer|first3=Jerome E.|title=Apartment noise, auditory discrimination, and reading ability in children|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=9 |issue=5|year=1973 |pages=407–422 |issn=0022-1031 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(73)80005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the ideal process of what is called emergent or early literacy&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; begins in the relationship between hearing spoken language, seeing [[written language]] and feeling loved. The positive feeling that arises from spending time with books in a loving context provides a strong foundation and intrinsic [[motivation]] for the long and cognitively challenging process of learning to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 81-83"/&gt; However, reading to children and ensuring exposure to many [[books]] is not enough to prepare them for reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf90"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=90 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another critical skill is the ability to name letters or characters.&lt;ref name="Wolf90"/&gt;

===Age to introduce literacy learning===
Some scholars favor a developmentally appropriate approach in which formal instruction on reading begins when children are about six or seven years old, while others favor limited amounts of literacy instruction at the age of four and five, in addition to non-academic, intellectually stimulating activities.&lt;ref name="vanKleeck2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Kleeck | first1 = A. | last2 = Schuele | first2 = C.

Some parents teach their children to read as babies. Babies learn to read differently and more easily than children who learn to read in school from formal instruction. The most important aspect of early (baby) reading is interaction with loving parents and bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased quote from Dr. Richard Gentry (Ph.D Reading Education).

In a discussion on academic kindergartens, professor of child development [[David Elkind]] has argued that, since "there is no solid research demonstrating that early academic training is superior to (or worse than) the more traditional, hands-on model of early education", educators should defer to developmental approaches that provide young children with ample time and opportunity to explore the natural world on their own terms.&lt;ref name="Elkind"&gt;{{cite journal|first=David |last=Elkind |title=Much Too Early| journal= Education Next|year= 2001 |url=http://educationnext.org/much-too-early/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elkind emphasized the principle that "early education must start with the child, not with the subject matter to be taught."&lt;ref name="Elkind" /&gt;

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA 2007]] OECD data from 54 countries demonstrates "no association between school entry age ... and reading achievement at age 15".&lt;ref name="Suggate"&gt;Sebastian Suggate, "Watering the garden before a rainstorm: the case of early reading instruction" in ''Contemporary Debates in Childhood Education and Development'', ed. Sebastian Suggate, Elaine Reese. pp. 181–190.&lt;/ref&gt; A German study of 50 kindergartens compared children who, at age 5, had spent a year either "academically focused", or "play-arts focused" and found that in time the two groups became inseparable in reading skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Suggate | first1 = S.

==Reading development==
{{tone|date=July 2012}}
There are five stages of reading development.  They are the emerging pre-reader, novice reader, decoding reader, fluent comprehending reader, and the expert reader. It is normal that children will move through these different stages at different rates.

===Emerging pre-reader===
The emerging pre-reader stage, also known as [[reading readiness]], happens when a young child sits and listens to someone read to them. Emerging reading takes many years of language experience, along with the increase of both conceptual and social development.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  Showing that this process starts early in a child's life is the fact that children typically produce their first few words before their first birthday.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;  This emerging pre-reader stage usually lasts for the first five years of a child's life.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=115–139 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the emerging pre-reader stage children will often "read" books and stories. They will tell the story as they have memorized it and turn the pages appropriately. They call what they are doing "reading" since they typically don't yet understand that their parents or caregivers are decoding written words. To them, they are doing what they think their parents or caregivers are doing when reciting the story.

One group of researchers in the United States found in the late 1990s and 2000s that the traditional way of reading to children made little difference in their later ability to read, and hypothesized this was because children spend relatively little time actually looking at the text.  They found that simple exercises during reading which directed children to pay attention to and think about letters and words made a significant difference in early reading progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/29/153927743/small-change-in-reading-to-preschoolers-can-help-disadvantaged-kids-catch-up | title=Small Change In Reading To Preschoolers Can Help Disadvantaged Kids Catch Up|agency=NPR|author=Alix Spegel|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novice reader===
[[File:School in Laos - Reading time.jpg|thumb|Reading time at a primary school in rural Laos. Learning to read poses different challenges in Laos compared to English-speaking countries. The written language follows clear phonetic rules, so the mechanics of reading are easier than with English. However, children learn from a teacher with a blackboard, and get little or no opportunity to improve their reading skills by reading for pleasure. Most schools have no library and no books except textbooks; even fourth-grade students often cannot read a full sentence. The daily reading period shown here uses books provided by Big Brother Mouse, which promotes reading in Lao schools and villages.]]The next step in the learning to read process is the novice reading stage&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  also known as selective association.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;  This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; To do this, the child must first figure out the [[Alphabetic principle]] and master it in only a few years.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; Most children know that the words on a page in a [[book]] mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning.  They know that these [[words]] are made of the sounds of their particular [[language]], and that letters convey these sounds.  Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; If a child is able to master this skill, called [[phonological awareness]], it is one of the best predictors of a child's success in learning to read.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; One way that you can teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as [[nursery rhymes]] that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words.  Another way to teach a child to read is through little "games" in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words "have" and "who".&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.

===Decoding reader===
The transition from the novice reader stage to the decoding stage is marked by the absence of painful [[pronunciation]]s and in its place the sounds of a smoother, more confident reader.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; In this phase of learning to read, the reader adds at least 3,000 words to what they can decode. For example, in the English language, that readers need to now learn the variations of the vowel-based [[rhyme]]s and [[vowel]] pairs. It is essential during this stage, if a reader is going to become fluent, the reader needs to acquire a sufficient repertoire of the letter-patterns and vowel-pairs that help to make up words that go beyond the basic level.The faster a child can see that the word "together" is "to-ge-ther", the faster the reader will become a more fluent reader.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;
As children move forward with their reading skills, they learn a great deal about what is really inside a [[word]]; the stem, roots, [[prefixes]] and [[suffixes]] that make up [[morphemes]] of the [[language]].&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;  By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as "s" and "ed" because these are attached to many words.  Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as "sight chunks" that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but it is a matter of being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing.  The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

In the beginning of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more you do it the better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.

It is also in the decoding phase that the child will learn to go beyond what is said in writing in the story to get the underlying meaning of what the story is really about. In the decoding stage a child also learns that if a sentence or paragraph is not understood, re-reading it a second or third time may be necessary in order to fully understand the passage.  Knowing when a text needs to be re-read is a very important skill and can improve comprehension greatly.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

===Fluent, comprehending reader===
The next stage in reading development is the fluent, comprehending reader stage, in which children shift from learning to read, to reading to learn.  In this stage the reader builds up a substantial background of knowledge of spelling.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; It is during this time in a reader's development that teachers and parents can be tricked by fluent-sounding reading into thinking that a [[child]] understands everything that they are reading. As the content of what they are able to read  becomes more demanding, good readers will develop knowledge of [[figurative language]] and [[irony]] which helps them to discover new meanings in the text. This will assist them to understand the meaning of what they are reading beyond what is written on the page.  While learning to read, one of the most powerful moments is when fluent comprehending readers learn to enter into the lives of imagined heroes and heroines.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; Examples of books where these imagined heroes and heroines could be found in include [[Harry Potter]], [[Lord of the Rings]], [[Huckleberry Finn]].  The comprehension process grows while reading books like these, where children learn how to connect prior knowledge, predict good or bad consequences, draw inferences from every danger-filled corner, monitor gaps in their understanding, and interpret how each new clue, revelation, or added piece of knowledge changes what they know. In learning these new skills, they learn to unpeel the layers of meaning in a [[word]], a [[phrase]] or a [[thought]].&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

There are two ways in which increasing fluency can be supported.  They include explicit instruction in comprehension by a child's teacher and the child's own desire to read. Engaging in conversation about what they are reading allows the beginning reader to ask critical [[questions]], facilitating a better understanding of the central meaning.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt;

At the end of this stage, before the reader becomes an expert reader, many processes are starting to become automatic. This increasing automaticity frees up cognitive resources so that the reader can reflect on meaning.  With the decoding process almost automatic by this point, the brain learns to integrate more [[metaphorical]], inferential, [[analogical]], background and [[experiential knowledge]] with every newly won millisecond.  This stage in learning to read often will last until early adulthood.&lt;ref name="Wolf143"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=143 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expert reader===
The final stage in learning to read, is the expert stage.  When a reader is at this stage of reading, it will usually only take them one half second to read almost any word.&lt;ref name="Wolf145"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=145 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree to which expert reading will change over the course of an [[adult]]'s life depends on what a person reads and how much they read.&lt;ref name="Wolf156"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=156 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a person matures, life experiences as well as the cognitive process of reading text shapes reading comprehension.  It is this interpretive response that adds depth to reading and will often take the reader in a new direction from where the [[author]] intended.&lt;ref name="Wolf156"/&gt;

==Methods of teaching reading==

===Alphabetic languages===
Educators have argued for years about which method is best to teach reading to children. For the English language, there are two major methods, [[Phonics]] and [[Whole language|Whole Language]], within which there are subtypes [[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]] and [[Sight word]] respectively. Each method is employed at differing rates depending on the country and the specific school division. Some educators are beginning to use the two methods in conjunction to maximize the benefits of both methods.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;
[[Phonics]] is a teaching method that stresses character-sound correspondences,&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Esopenko C, Cummine J, Sarty GE |title=Neural representations of visual words and objects: a functional MRI study on the modularity of reading and object processing |journal= Brain Topogr |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=89–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17929158 |doi=10.1007/s10548-007-0034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky R, Cummine J, Owen WJ, Friesen CK, Shih F, Sarty GE |title=FMRI of ventral and dorsal processing streams in basic reading processes: insular sensitivity to phonology |journal=Brain Topogr |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=233–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16845597 |doi=10.1007/s10548-006-0001-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan ST, Tang SW, Tang KW, Lee WK, Lo SS, Kwong KK |title=Hierarchical coding of characters in the ventral and dorsal visual streams of Chinese language processing |journal=NeuroImage |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=423–35 |date = November 2009|pmid=19591947 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.078}}&lt;/ref&gt; specific rules and their use in reading and spelling.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sanabria Díaz G, Torres Mdel R, Iglesias J, etal |title=Changes in reading strategies in school-age children |journal=Span J Psychol |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=441–53 |date = November 2009|pmid=19899646 |doi=10.1017/S1138741600001827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helps beginning readers understand how characters are linked to sounds ([[phonemes]]), patterns of letter-sound correspondences and spelling in English, and how to apply this knowledge when they read to sound out words. Phonics teachers present the spellings for different sounds in a specific order, introducing the simplest (or most useful) patterns early on; these patterns are then practiced.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; A disadvantage to phonics is that in some languages like English, complex letter-sound correspondences can cause confusion for beginning readers.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rayner|first=Keith|author2=Barbara Foorman |author3=Charles Perfetti |author4=David Pesetsky |author5=Mark Seidenberg |title=How Should Reading be Taught?|journal=Scientific American|date=March 2002|pages=84–91 |format=pdf |url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/pspi/reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional phonics instruction has marked benefits. Early reading often involves significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes all the words the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing on the principle of linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"/&gt; It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

Traditional phonics instruction can also have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the [[Coarticulation|coarticulated]] nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carello C, LeVasseur VM, Schmidt RC |title=Movement sequencing and phonological fluency in (putatively) nonimpaired readers |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=375–9 |date = July 2002|pmid=12137142 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00467.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word ''cat'' compared to the word ''cot''. The initial hard ''c'' is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one prepares to say ''cat'', and the more limp position as one prepares to say ''cot''. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically do not yet know the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ''ight'' in ''right'') is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) can be helpful in promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation.

(e.g. /a/, /k/, /t/.) Then, when reading a word, he learns to say each sound in the word (e.g. /k/ - /a/ - /t/); and to "blend" these sounds into a pronunciation of the word (e.g. "cat").

Synthetic phonics does not teach whole words as shapes; and does not involve guessing at words from context, picture and initial letter clues.

There are other types of phonics, such as [[Analytical phonics]], that differ in their approach based on how a "chunk" within the word is defined (i.e. individual phonemes, syllables, or non-blended units).

[[Whole language|Whole Language]] is widely used in the U.S.A. and Canada. It is a reading and learning method that trains students to focus on words, sentences and paragraphs as a whole rather than letters. This method aims to make reading fun and keep children motivated, which is beneficial because learning to read depends heavily on what the student does and not the teacher.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; While the child is typically very engaged in this method, many children struggle to infer the specific rules of the language on their own, which causes the child's decoding and spelling to suffer during development.&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Summary" /&gt;

One subtype is [[Sight word]], which is sometimes called the "look-say" method. A sight vocabulary of 50-100 words is first memorized&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2002"/&gt;  and subsequent words are learned as wholes, often by seeing them used repeatedly in the context of a story.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; It tells children to find meaning by guessing, by recognizing whole words they have memorized, by looking at the pictures, and by creating a context based on surrounding words. It encourages students to "construct their own meaning" (with guidance from peers and facilitator of consensus process).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weatherly|first=Cynthia|title=GLOSSARY of Education Terms|url=http://www.crossroad.to/glossary/education.html#whole|work=Brave New Schools|accessdate=14 November 2011|author2=Sarah Leslie |author3=Charlotte Iserbyt |author4=Marla Quenzer |author5=Betty Lewis |author6=Elizabeth Stoner }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It relies heavily on the child's experience with language as a whole.
The following are some features of the whole language philosophy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the whole language philosophy?|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ReferenceMaterials/glossaryofliteracyterms/WhatIsTheWholeLanguagePhilosop.htm|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Children are expected to learn to read and write as they learned to talk, that is gradually, without a great deal of direct instruction.
*Learning is emphasized more than teaching; it is assumed that the children will learn to read and write, and the teacher facilitates that growth.
*Children read and write every day in a variety of situations.
*Reading, writing, and spoken language are not considered separate components of the curriculum or merely ends in themselves; rather they permeate everything the children are doing.
*There is no division between first ''learning to read'' and later ''reading to learn''. (adapted from Weaver, C. 1990)
&lt;br /&gt;
Which style use in teaching reading has divided educators for years. It is now known that using the two approaches together is more powerful than either program alone.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt; The technical skills learned through phonics are important for many children when learning to read, spell, and general language comprehension and engagement of children in the whole-language approach is also important to keep the children motivated and excited to learn. Many teachers and schools acknowledge this and say that they use multiple methods to teach children to read.

=== Logographic languages ===

Languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are normally written in [[logograms]] ([[hanzi]] and [[kanji]], respectively), which represent a whole word or [[morpheme]] with a single character.  There are a large number of characters, and the sound that each makes must be learned directly or from other characters which contain "hints" in them, such as, in Japanese, 民's [[On reading#On.27yomi .28Chinese reading.29|on-reading]] being min and 眠 which shares the same on-reading as  民, that being min. In the same way whereas the right part contains the characters pronunciation, 員's on-reading is in and 韻 has exactly the same on, however this is not true for all characters. Kun readings, on the other hand, have to be learned and memorised as there is no way to tell from each character.

[[Ruby character]]s are used in textbooks to help children learn the sounds that each logogram makes.  These are written in a smaller size, using an alphabetic or [[Syllabary|syllabic]] script.  For example, [[hiragana]] is typically used in Japanese, and the [[pinyin]] [[romanization]] into Latin alphabet characters is used in Chinese.

The examples above spell the word ''kanji'', which is made up of two kanji characters: 漢 (''kan'', written in hiragana as かん), and 字 (''ji'', written in hiragana as じ).

Textbooks are sometimes edited as a cohesive set across grades so that children will not encounter logograms they are not yet expected to have learned.

==Skills required for proficient reading==
{{Globalize|section|date=July 2010}}
According to the report by the US [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) in 2000,

Other important skills are: [[rapid automatized naming]] (RAN),&lt;ref name="Lervåg"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lervåg A, Hulme C | year = 2009 | title = Rapid automatized naming (RAN) taps a mechanism that places constraints on the development of early reading fluency | url = | journal = Psychol.

*'''[[Speech perception|Speech Awareness]]''': The awareness of individual parts of speech as they apply to individual written characters is crucial for understanding reading (as defined by translating written characters into spoken language). [[Phonological awareness]], which includes the manipulation of [[rhymes]], [[syllable]]s, and [[syllable onset|onsets]] and [[syllable rime|rimes]], is most prevalent in Alphabetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehri|first=Linnea|author2=Simone Nunes |author3=Dale Willows |author4=Barbara Valeska Schuster |author5=Zohreh Yaghoub-Zadeh |author6=Timothy Shanahan |title=Phonemic awareness instruction helps children learn to read: Evidence from the National Reading Panel's meta-analysis|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|date=July–September 2001|volume=36|issue=3|pages=250–287 |jstor=748111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The important part of speech depends on the [[Writing system]] employed.
* '''[[Fluency]]''': The ability to read orally with speed, accuracy, and [[vocal]] expression. The ability to read fluently is one of several critical factors necessary for reading comprehension. If a reader is not fluent, it may be difficult to remember what has been read and to relate the ideas expressed in the text to their background knowledge. This accuracy and automaticity of reading serves as a bridge between decoding and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Rasinski, T"/&gt;
* '''[[Vocabulary]]''': A critical aspect of reading comprehension is vocabulary development.&lt;ref name="Justice 2002 87–106"/&gt; When a reader encounters an unfamiliar word in print and decodes it to derive its spoken pronunciation, the reader understands the word if it is in the reader's spoken vocabulary. Otherwise, the reader must derive the meaning of the word using another strategy, such as context. If the development of the child's vocabulary is impeded by things such as ear infections, that inhibit the child from hearing new words consistently, then the development of reading will also be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wolf, Maryanne |author2=Stoodley, Catherine J. |title=Proust and the squid: the story and science of the reading brain |publisher=Harper |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=104–105 |isbn=0-06-018639-9 |oclc=471015779 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Reading comprehension]]''': The NRP describes comprehension as a complex [[cognitive]] process in which a reader intentionally and interactively engages with the text. Reading comprehension is heavily dependent on skilled word recognition and decoding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendeou P, Savage R, van den Broek P |title=Revisiting the simple view of reading |journal=Br J Educ Psychol |volume=79 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=353–70 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19091164 |doi=10.1348/978185408X369020 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; oral reading fluency, a well-developed vocabulary and active engagement with the text.&lt;ref name="Fien 2010 631–653"/&gt;
*'''[[Rapid automatized naming]]''': The ability to say quickly the names of letters, objects and colors predicts an individual's ability to read. This might be linked to the importance of quick retrieval of [[phonological]] representations from [[long-term memory]] in reading and the importance of object-naming circuits in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] that are recruited to underpin a child's word-recognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Lervåg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Denckla MB 1974"/&gt;
*'''[[Orthography]]''' describes or defines the set of symbols used in a language, and the rules about how to write these symbols.  Orthographic Development proceeds in increasing complexity as a child learns to read. Some of the first things to be learnt are the orthographic conventions such as the direction of reading and that there are differing typefaces and capitalization for each symbol.&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; In general, this means that to read proficiently, the reader has to understand elements of the written language including [[hyphen]]ation, [[capitalization]], [[word|word breaks]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], and [[punctuation]].&lt;ref name="Coulmas, Florian 1996. p. 379"/&gt;
* '''Practice''': repeated exposure to print improves many aspects of learning to read and most importantly the knowledge of individual words. It increases the speed at which high frequency words are recognized which allows for increased [[Fluency]] in reading. It also supports orthographic development,&lt;ref name="Wolf, 2007, 115-139"/&gt; [[Reading comprehension]] and [[Vocabulary]] development.&lt;ref name="Rayner, 2001"/&gt;

==Reading difficulties==
Difficulties in reading typically involve difficulty with one or more of the following: decoding, reading rate, reading fluency, or reading comprehension.

===Decoding===
{{Main|Dyslexia}}
Difficulty with decoding is marked by having not acquired the [[phoneme]]-[[grapheme]] mapping concept. One specific disability characterized by poor decoding is [[dyslexia]], defined as brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]]|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia. Although the symptoms vary from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;  Adults, can have either developmental dyslexia&lt;ref name='Heim'&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Facoetti A |title=Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia |journal=Brain Res Cogn Brain Res |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=185–91 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668226 |doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00270-7 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Lorusso ML |author3=Paganoni P |display-authors=3 |last4=Cattaneo |first4=Carmen |last5=Galli |first5=Raffaella |last6=Umiltà |first6=Carlo |last7=Mascetti |first7=Gian Gastone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anchoring&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ahissar M |title=Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Reading rate===
Individuals with reading rate difficulties tend to have accurate word recognition and normal comprehension abilities, but the reading speed is below grade level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Catts, Hugh William |author2=Kamhi, Alan G. |title=The connections between language and reading disabilities |publisher=L.

===Reading fluency===
Individuals with reading fluency difficulties fail to maintain a fluid, smooth pace when reading. Strategies used for overcoming reading rate difficulties are also useful in addressing reading fluency issues.&lt;ref name="National Reading Panel, 2000, Subgroups"/&gt;

===Reading comprehension===
Individuals with reading comprehension difficulties are commonly described as poor comprehenders. They have normal decoding skills as well as a fluid rate of reading, but have difficulty comprehending text when read. Increasing vocabulary knowledge, listening skills and teaching basic comprehension techniques may help facilitate better [[reading comprehension]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">The '''log wind profile''' is a semi-empirical relationship commonly used to describe the vertical distribution of horizontal mean wind speeds within the lowest portion of the [[planetary boundary layer]].  The relationship is well described in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oke, T.R.|title=Boundary Layer Climates|edition=|publisher=Methuen|year=1987|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] profile of wind speeds is generally limited to the lowest 100 m of the atmosphere (i.e., the [[surface layer]] of the [[atmospheric boundary layer]]). The rest of the atmosphere is composed of the remaining part of the planetary boundary layer (up to around 1000 m) and the troposphere or free atmosphere.  In the free atmosphere, geostrophic wind relationships should be used.

==Definition==
The equation to estimate the mean wind speed (&lt;math&gt;u_z&lt;/math&gt;) at height &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; (meters) above the ground is:
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u_z = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \left[\ln \left(\frac{z-d}{z_0} \right) + \psi(z,z_0,L)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction velocity]] (m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Von Kármán constant]] (~0.41), &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the zero plane displacement (in metres), &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Roughness Length|surface roughness]] (in meters), and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability]] term where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Monin-Obukhov length|Obukhov length]] from [[Monin-Obukhov similarity theory]]. Under [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|neutral stability]] conditions, &lt;math&gt;z/L = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; drops out and the equation is simplified to,
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u_z = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \left[\ln \left(\frac{z-d}{z_0} \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/CENTER&gt;

Zero-plane displacement (&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) is the height in meters above the ground at which zero wind speed is achieved as a result of flow obstacles such as trees or buildings.  It can be approximated as &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the average height of the obstacles.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"&gt;Holmes JD.

Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if estimating winds over a forest canopy of height 30 m, the zero-plane displacement could be estimated as d = 20 m.

Roughness length (&lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;) is a corrective measure to account for the effect of the roughness of a surface on wind flow.  That is, the value of the roughness length depends on the terrain.  The exact value is subjective and references indicate a range of values, making it difficult to give definitive values. In most cases, references present a tabular format with the value of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; given for certain terrain descriptions. For example, for very flat terrain (snow, desert) the roughness length may be in the range 0.001 to 0.005 m.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;  Similarly, for open terrain (grassland) the typical range is 0.01-0.05 m.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;  For cropland, and brush/forest the ranges are 0.1-0.25 m and 0.5-1.0 m respectively. When estimating wind loads on structures the terrains may be described as suburban or dense urban, for which the ranges are typically 0.1-0.5 m and 1-5 m respectively.&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;

In order to estimate the mean wind speed at one height (&lt;math&gt;{{z}_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;) based on that at another (&lt;math&gt;{{z}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;), the formula would be rearranged,&lt;ref name="Holmes2015"/&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u({{z}_{2}})=u({{z}_{1}})\frac{\ln \left( ({{z}_{2}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \right)}{\ln \left( ({{z}_{1}}-d)/{{z}_{0}} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;/CENTER&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u({{z}_{1}})&lt;/math&gt; is the mean wind speed at height &lt;math&gt;{{z}_{1}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Limits==
The log wind profile is generally considered to be a more reliable estimator of mean wind speed  than the [[wind profile power law]] in the lowest 10–20 m of the planetary boundary layer. Between 20 m and 100 m both methods can produce reasonable predictions of mean wind speed in neutral atmospheric conditions. From 100 m to near the top of the atmospheric boundary layer the power law produces more accurate predictions of mean wind speed (assuming neutral atmospheric conditions).&lt;ref name="Cook, N.J. 1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cook, N.J.|title=The designer's guide to wind loading of building structures: Part 1|edition=|publisher=Butterworths|year=1985|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neutral atmospheric stability assumption discussed above is reasonable when the hourly mean wind speed at a height of 10 m exceeds 10&amp;nbsp;m/s where turbulent mixing overpowers atmospheric instability.&lt;ref name="Cook, N.J. 1985"/&gt;

==Applications==
Log wind profiles are generated and used in many [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric pollution dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Microwave sounding unit]] temperature measurements''' have been obtained from the [[troposphere]] since 1979, when they were included within NOAA [[weather satellite]]s.  By comparison, the usable balloon ([[radiosonde]]) record begins in 1958 but has less geographic coverage and is less uniform.

[[Satellite]]s do not measure [[temperature]].  They measure [[radiance]]s in various [[wavelength]] bands, which must then be mathematically [[Inverse problem|inverted]] to obtain [[Remote sensing#Data processing|indirect inferences]] of temperature.&lt;ref name="NRC2000"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Atmospheric Soundings |title=Issues in the Integration of Research and Operational Satellite Systems for Climate Research: Part I.

As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data  have obtained different temperature trends. Among these groups are [[Remote Sensing Systems]] (RSS) and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH). The satellite series is not fully homogeneous - the record is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical instrumentation. The sensors deteriorate over time, and corrections are necessary for satellite drift in orbit. Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites, making intercalibration difficult.

To compare to the trend from the [[Instrumental temperature record|surface temperature record]] (approximately +0.07&amp;nbsp;°C/decade over the past century and +0.15-0.16&amp;nbsp;°C/decade since 1979) it is most appropriate to derive trends for the part of the atmosphere nearest the surface, i.e., the lower [[troposphere]].  Doing this, through January 2012:
* RSS v3.3 finds a trend of +0.137&amp;nbsp;°C/decade.&lt;ref name="RSS"/&gt;
* UAH v5.4 finds a trend of +0.136&amp;nbsp;°C/decade.&lt;ref name="UAH TLT"/&gt;

There have been complaints of data problems with both records, and difficulty reconciling climate model predictions with the observed data.

==Creation of the satellite temperature record==
[[File:Weighting Function.png|thumb|MSU weighting function.]]
{{Main|Satellite temperature measurements}}
Since 1979, [[microwave sounding unit]]s (MSUs) on [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric [[oxygen]]. The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere, as demonstrated by theory and direct comparisons with atmospheric temperatures from radiosonde (balloon) profiles. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403061135/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png |date=2013-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 2 is broadly representative of the troposphere, albeit with a significant overlap with the lower stratosphere (the weighting function has its maximum at 350 hPa and half-power at about 40 and 800 hPa). In an attempt to remove the stratospheric influence, Spencer and Christy developed the synthetic "2LT" product by subtracting signals at different view angles; this has a maximum at about 650 hPa. However this amplifies noise,&lt;ref name="Christy1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christy |first=John R. |authorlink= |author2=Spencer, Roy W. |author3=Lobl, Elena S.  |year=1998 |title=Analysis of the Merging Procedure for the MSU Daily Temperature Time Series |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2016&amp;ndash;2041 |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011&lt;2016:AOTMPF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1998JCli...11.2016.}}&lt;/ref&gt; increases inter-satellite calibration biases and enhances surface contamination.&lt;ref name="Fu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fu |first=Qiang |authorlink= |author2=Johanson, Celeste M. |year=2005 |title=Satellite-Derived Vertical Dependence Of Tropical Tropospheric Temperature Trends |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=L10703 |doi=10.1029/2004GL022266 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=2005GeoRL..3210703F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2LT product has gone through numerous versions as various corrections have been applied.

Records have been created by merging data from nine different MSUs and AMSU data, each with peculiarities  that must be calculated and removed because they can have substantial impacts on the resulting trend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/seminars/960521SM.html The Satellite Temperature Records: Parts 1 and 2] May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of constructing a temperature record from a radiance record is difficult and some of the required corrections are as large as the trend itself:&lt;ref name="CCSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap2.pdf|title=CCSP sap 1.1|accessdate=2011-01-15|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224094945/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap2.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Diurnal sampling

All the MSU instruments and to a lesser extent AMSU drift slowly from the sun-synchronous equatorial crossing time changing the local time observed by the instrument, therefore the natural diurnal cycle may be aliased into the long term trend. 
The diurnal sampling correction is in the order of a few hundredths °C/decade for TLT and TMT.

; Orbit decay

All Polar orbiting satellite lose height after launch, the orbital decay is stronger during period of elevated solar activity when the enhanced ultraviolet radiation warm the upper atmosphere and increase the frictional drag over the spacecraft.

The orbital decay change the instrument view angle relative to the surface and thus the observed microwave emissivity, furthermore the long term time-series is constructed by sequential merging of the inter-calibrated satellite data so that the error is summed up over time, the required correction is in the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C/decade for TLT.

; Calibration changes

Once every earth scan MSU instrument use the deep space (2.7K) and on-board warm targets to make calibration measures, however as the spacecraft drifts through the diurnal cycle the calibration target temperature may change due to varying solar shadowing effect, the correction is in the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C/decade for TLT and TMT.

One widely reported satellite temperature record, developed by [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]] and [[John Christy]] at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH), is current version  corrects previous errors in their analysis for orbital drift and other factors.  The record comes from a succession of different satellites and problems with inter-calibration between the satellites are important, especially NOAA-9, which accounts for most of the difference between the RSS and UAH analyses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123040542/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html |date=2012-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA-11 played a significant role in a 2005 study by Mears ''et al.'' identifying an error in the diurnal correction that leads to the 40% jump in Spencer and Christy's trend from version 5.1 to 5.2.&lt;ref name="Mears2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mears |first=Carl A. |authorlink= |author2=Wentz, Frank J. |year=2005 |title=The Effect of Diurnal Correction on Satellite-Derived Lower Tropospheric Temperature |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5740 |pages=1548&amp;ndash;1551 |doi=10.1126/science.1114772 |url= |accessdate= |quote=|pmid=16141071 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1548M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of satellite temperature data interpretation==
In the late 1990s the disagreement between the surface temperature record and the satellite records was a subject of research and debate. The lack of warming then seen in the records was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwarming.org/article.php?uid=167 |title=Christy and Spencer Respond to Critics; Water Vapor Still Not Resolved |accessdate= |work=Cooler Heads Coalition |date=October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911190509/http://www.globalwarming.org/article.php?uid=167 |archivedate=2007-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] that reviewed upper air temperature trends stated:
                                                             
:"Data collected by satellites and balloon-borne instruments since 1979 indicate little if any warming of the low- to mid-troposphere—the atmospheric layer extending up to about 5 miles from the Earth's surface. Climate models generally predict that temperatures should increase in the upper air as well as at the surface if increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are causing the warming."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9755/reconciling-observations-of-global-temperature-change?onpi_newsdoc011200= The National Academies], "Reconciling Observations of Global Temperature Change", 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The same panel then concluded that

:"the warming trend in global-mean surface temperature observations during the past 20 years is undoubtedly real and is substantially greater than the average rate of warming during the twentieth century. The disparity between surface and upper air trends in no way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has been rising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reconciling Observations of Global Temperature Change |author=Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate |year=2000 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-309-06891-6 |pages=1&amp;ndash;4 |chapter=Executive Summary |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/books/0309068916/html/2.html#pagetop }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llanos2000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Miguel |last=Llanos |title=Panel weighs in on global warming: Earth’s surface is warmer, they say, even if upper air isn’t |url=http://www.msnbc.com/news/356875.asp?cp1=1 |work=MSNBC |publisher= |date=2000-01-13 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427072934/http://www.msnbc.com/news/356875.asp?cp1=1 |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the UAH data showed a ''cooling'' of 0.05K per decade (at 3.5&amp;nbsp;km - mid to low troposphere). Wentz &amp; Schabel at RSS in their 1998 paper showed this (along with other discrepancies) was due to the orbital decay of the NOAA satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115152656/http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |archive-date=2010-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the orbital changes had been allowed for the data showed a 0.07K per decade ''increase'' in temperature at this level of the atmosphere.

In April 2002, for example, an analysis of the satellite temperature data showed warming of only 0.04&amp;nbsp;°C per decade, compared with surface measurements showing 0.17 ±  0.06&amp;nbsp;°C per decade.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Doubts had been raised as early as 2000 about the UAH analysis by the work of Prabhakara et al.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2000/2000GL011719.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; which minimised errors due to satellite drift. They found a trend of 0.13&amp;nbsp;°C/decade, in reasonable agreement with surface trends.

Christy ''et al.'' (2007) find that the tropical temperature trends from [[radiosondes]] matches closest with his v5.2 UAH dataset.&lt;ref name="Christy2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christy |first=J.

Another important critique of the satellite record is its shortness&amp;mdash;adding a few years on to the record or picking a particular time frame can change the trends considerably.

Likewise, even though they began with the same data, each of the major research groups has interpreted it with different results. Most notably, Mears et al. at RSS find 0.193&amp;nbsp;°C/decade for lower troposphere up to July 2005, compared to +0.123&amp;nbsp;°C/decade found by UAH for the same period.

There are ongoing efforts to resolve these differences.  Some believe that much of the disparity may have been resolved by the three papers in Science, 11 August 2005, which pointed out errors in the UAH 5.1 record and the radiosonde record in the tropics.

==Stratospheric temperature trends==
The satellites also measure the lower stratospheric temperature{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and show a decline in stratospheric temperatures, interspersed by warmings related to volcanic eruptions. [[Global Warming]] theory suggests that the [[stratosphere]] should cool while the [[troposphere]] warms &lt;ref name="Clough 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clough |first=S.A. |authorlink= |author2=M.

However, the lower stratospheric cooling is mainly caused by the effects of [[ozone depletion]] with a possible contribution from increased stratospheric water vapor and greenhouse gases increase.&lt;ref name="Shine 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shine |first=Keith |author2=M.S.

The long term cooling in the lower stratosphere occurred in two downward steps in temperature both after the transient warming related to explosive volcanic eruptions of [[El Chichón]] and [[Mount Pinatubo]], this behavior of the global stratospheric temperature has been attributed to global ozone concentration variation in the two years following volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=David W.

Since 1996 the trend is slightly positive&lt;ref name="Liu 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Quanhua |authorlink= |author2=Fuzhong Weng|year=2009 |title= Recent Stratospheric Temperature Observed from Satellite Measurements|journal=SOLA|volume=5 |issue=|pages=53&amp;ndash;56|doi=10.2151/sola.2009-014 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sola/5/0/53/_pdf|accessdate=2010-02-15 |quote=|pmid=|bibcode=2009SOLA....5...53L}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to  ozone recover juxtaposed to a cooling trend of 0.1K/decade that is consistent with the predicted impact of increased greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2009"/&gt;

==Reconciliation of data with climate models==
[[General circulation model|Climate model]]s predict that as the surface warms, so should the global troposphere. Globally, the troposphere should warm about 1.2 times more than the surface; in the tropics, the troposphere should warm about 1.5 times more than the surface. For some time the only available satellite record was the UAH version, which (with early versions of the processing [[algorithm]]) showed a global cooling trend for its first decade. Since then, a longer record and a number of corrections to the processing have revised this picture: the UAH dataset has shown an overall warming trend since 1998, though less than the RSS version. In 2001, an extensive comparison and discussion of trends from different data sources and periods was given in the [[Third Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)  (section 2.2.4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm United Nations Environment Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112044011/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm |date=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed analysis produced by dozens of scientists as part of the US [[Climate Change Science Program]] (CCSP) identified and corrected errors in a variety of temperature observations, including the satellite data.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070423150153/http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-execsum.pdf CCSP SAP 1.1 Executive Summary] states:
:"Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human induced global warming. Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies."

The [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers] states:
:"New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR."

However, as detailed in [https://web.archive.org/web/20101224095341/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap5.pdf CCSP SAP 5.1 Understanding and Reconciling Differences], neither Regression models or other related techniques were reconcilable with observed data.  The use of fingerprinting techniques on data yielded that "Volcanic and human-caused fingerprints were not consistently identifiable in observed patterns of lapse rate change."  As such, issues with reconciling data and models remain.

A potentially serious inconsistency has been identified in the tropics, the area in which tropospheric amplification should be seen. Section 1.1 of the CCSP report says:

: "In the tropics, the agreement between models and observations depends on the time scale considered. For month-to-month and year-to-year variations, models and observations both show amplification (i.e., the month-to-month and year-to-year variations are larger aloft than at the surface). This is a consequence of relatively simple physics, the effects of the release of latent heat as air rises and condenses in clouds. The magnitude of this amplification is very similar in models and observations. On decadal and longer time scales, however, while almost all model simulations show greater warming aloft (reflecting the same physical processes that operate on the monthly and annual time scales), most observations show greater warming at the surface.

: "These results could arise either because “real world” amplification effects on short and long time scales are controlled by different physical mechanisms, and models fail to capture such behavior; or because non-climatic influences remaining in some or all of the observed tropospheric data sets lead to biased long-term trends; or a combination of these factors. The new evidence in this Report favors the second explanation."

The lower troposphere trend derived from UAH satellites (+0.128&amp;nbsp;°C/decade) is currently lower than both the GISS and Hadley Centre surface station network trends (+0.161 and +0.160&amp;nbsp;°C/decade respectively), while the RSS trend (+0.158&amp;nbsp;°C/decade) is similar. However, the expected trend in the lower troposphere, given the surface data, would be around 0.194&amp;nbsp;°C/decade, making the UAH and RSS trends 66% and 81% of the expected value respectively.

The '''Malthusian trap''' or '''population trap''' is a condition whereby excess population would stop growing due to shortage of food supply leading to starvation. It is named for [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], who suggested that while technological advances could increase a society's supply of resources, such as food, and thereby improve the standard of living, the resource abundance would enable [[population growth]], which would eventually bring the per capita supply of resources back to its original level.  Some economists contend that since the [[industrial revolution]], mankind has broken out of the trap.&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Galor |first=Oded |year=2005 |chapter=From Stagnation to Growth: Unified Growth Theory |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 |pages=171–293 |publisher=Elsevier |chapterurl=https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/grochp/1-04.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Gregory |year=2007 |title=A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-12135-2 |title-link=A Farewell to Alms }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the continuation of [[extreme poverty]] indicates that the Malthusian trap continues to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Zinkina &amp; [[Andrey Korotayev]].

==Malthus' theoretical argument==
Malthus argued that society has a natural propensity to increase its population, a propensity that causes population growth to be the best measure of the happiness of a people: "The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, Essay on the Principle of Population, Ch. VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:
{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798. ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'', Chapter II.}}

Malthus faced opposition from economists both during his life and since. A vocal critic several decades later was [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 |last=Engels |first=Fredrick |authorlink= |year=1892 |publisher= Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co |location= London |isbn= |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1844engels.html }} Engels wrote that poverty and poor living conditions in 1844 had largely disappeared.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0521808781 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence to support the theory===
Research indicates that technological superiority and higher land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living during the time period 1–1500 AD.&lt;ref name="Ashraf and Galor, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashraf |first=Quamrul |first2=Oded |last2=Galor |year=2011 |title=Dynamics and Stagnation in the Malthusian Epoch |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=101 |issue=5 |pages=2003–41 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.2003 |pmid=25506082 |pmc=4262154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars have reported on the lack of a significant trend of wages in various places over the world for very long stretches of time.&lt;ref name="Clark2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=R. C. |title=The Great Divergence in European Wages and Prices from the Middle Ages to the First World War |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=411–47 |year=2001 |doi=10.1006/exeh.2001.0775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Babylonia during the period 1800 to 1600 BC, for example, the daily wage for a common laborer was enough to buy about 15 pounds of wheat.  In Classical Athens in about 328 BC, the corresponding wage could buy about 24 pounds of wheat.  In England in 1800 AD the wage was about 13 pounds of wheat.&lt;ref name="Clark2007"/&gt;{{rp|50}} In spite of the technological developments across these societies, the daily wage hardly varied. In Britain between 1200 and 1800, only relatively minor fluctuations from the mean (less than a factor of two) in real wages occurred.  Following depopulation by the [[Black Death]] and other epidemics, real income in Britain peaked around 1450–1500 and began declining until the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] posits that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death throughout Europe had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making employers and landowners less well off while improving the economic prospects and living standards of workers. He says that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–93, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fogel]] published a study of lifespans and nutrition from about a century before Malthus to the 19th century that examined European birth and death records, military and other records of height and weight that found significant stunted height and low body weight indicative of chronic hunger and malnutrition.  He also found short lifespans that he attributed to chronic malnourishment which left people susceptible to disease.  Lifespans, height and weight began to steadily increase in the UK and France after 1750.  Fogel's findings are consistent with estimates of available food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Escape from Hunger and Premature Death, 1700–2100|last=Fogel |first=Robert W.|authorlink= Robert_Fogel|year=2004 |publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= London |isbn= 978-0-521-80878-1 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Malthusian view==
{{See also|Malthusianism}}
The rapid increase in the global population since 1900 exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns, whereby expansion of food supply has encouraged population growth. "Neo-Malthusianism" may be used as a label for those who are concerned that [[human overpopulation]] may increase [[resource depletion]] or [[environmental degradation]] to a degree that is not [[sustainability|sustainable]]. Many in [[environmentalism|environmental movements]] express concern over the potential dangers of population growth.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb |author1=Pierre Desrochers |author2=Christine Hoffbauer |journal=[[International Policy Network|The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=3 |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- maybe highlight in text that opinions are from fake journal from pressure group, no CiteSeerX cite --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, ecologist [[Garrett Hardin]] published an influential essay in ''Science'' that drew heavily from Malthusian theory.

==Theory that society has overcome the trap==
{{See also|Industrial Revolution#Causes|British Agricultural Revolution}}
The view that a "breakout" from the Malthusian trap has led to an era of sustained economic growth is explored by "[[unified growth theory]]".&lt;ref name="Galor (2005)" /&gt; One branch of unified growth theory is devoted to the interaction between human evolution and economic development. Some argue that natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and brought about the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Omer |last2=Moav |year=2002 |title=Natural Selection and The Origin of Economic Growth |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1133–91 |doi=10.1162/003355302320935007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.199.2634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers contend that a British breakout occurred due to technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role.&lt;ref&gt;Tepper, Alexander and Karol J. Borowiecki. Accounting for Breakout in Britain: The Industrial Revolution through a Malthusian Lens (2013). Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 639. Available at: https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fednsr/639.html&lt;/ref&gt; Economic historian [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] has argued, in his book ''[[A Farewell to Alms]]'', that a British breakout may have been caused by differences in reproduction rates among the rich and the poor (the rich were more likely to marry, tended to have more children, and, in a society where disease was rampant and childhood mortality at times approached 50%, upper-class children were more likely to survive to adulthood than poor children.) This in turn led to sustained "downward mobility": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.

{{globalize|2=Russia|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Novotroick IMG 6406.jpg|thumb|[[Novotroitsk]], a monotown in [[Orenburg Oblast]], Russia]]
A '''monotown''' (a [[calque]] from Russian [[:ru:wikt:моногород|моногород]], ''monogorod''; ''gorod'' meaning "town") is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city/town]] whose economy is dominated by a single industry or company. This means that most employments (except for service to residents like schools and shops) are by the main company.

==Russia==
The term ''monotown'' is especially often used in Russia, where the Soviet [[planned economy]] created hundreds of monotowns in supposedly rational locations, often in geographically inhospitable areas. The situation in many of Russia's monotowns is highly problematic: they are entirely dependent on the competitiveness of a single company or factory, very unflexible and based on Soviet-era economics and technologies.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/305499-1245838520910/rer_22_eng.pdf|title=Russian Economic Report, June 2010|publisher=World Bank|date=June 2010|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110112659/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/305499-1245838520910/rer_22_eng.pdf|archive-date=2010-11-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/opinion/17aron.html|title=Darkness on the Edge of Monotown|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-10-16|access-date=2018-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010060917/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/opinion/17aron.html|archive-date=2018-10-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most monotowns were built essentially as residential extensions of particular enterprises (so called "city-forming enterprises"), their population being either engaged in the city-forming enterprise's manufacturing process, or providing various services to the former group. The core workforce in monotowns was largely formed by the centralized workforce distribution system (people being assigned to an enterprise for a certain number of years after completing the education - which essentially replaced tuition payment, or transferred from other enterprises) rather than by spontaneous migration processes, as it was the case in less specialized towns. Combined, these factors led to narrow and inflexible economies and an immobile workforce, by the standards of the market economy newly introduced into the country in late 1980s - early 1990s.

By the time the city-forming enterprises had been privatized and / or liquidated, the workforce management system already ceased to exist, so the leftover workforce could not be transferred to other regions retaining the living conditions, as it was done during the Soviet era following the liquidation of a no longer needed enterprise. Monotown residents proved to be hesitant to move away on their own and seek work elsewhere as well, mostly because the state housing distribution system lied almost dead at the time, and very low market value of their real estate didn't let them count on minimally comfortable apartments in any other developed town (agricultural sector was and is even more depressive in most regions of Russia, making countryside largely unattractive for the town-dwellers).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===History===
According to a Russian government study conducted in 1999—2000, there were 467 cities and 332 smaller towns in Russia which could be classified as monotowns. The combined population of these towns was 25 million, or a sixth of the country's total population. The 900 monotown enterprises—most of them involved in heavy industries such as manufacturing, fuels, timber, pulp and metallurgy—accounted for more than 30% of industrial production.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;

The monotowns suffered greatly in the [[late-2000s recession]], leading to mass unemployment in the cities.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt; Having no other hope, people have only one option - to protest.

In one high-profile incident, in 2009 some 300 residents of the north-western town of [[Pikalyovo, Leningrad Oblast|Pikalyovo]] blocked a major highway to protest against large delays in the payments of wages.&lt;ref name="pikalevo1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090602/155146932.html|title=Protesters in northwest Russia block road over plant closures|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2009-06-02|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614123347/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090602/155146932.html|archive-date=2009-06-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] traveled to the city and ordered the owner of the city's dominant company [[BasEl Cement Pikalyovo]], [[Oleg Deripaska]] to pay over 41 million rubles ($1.3 million) of wage arrears to the city's residents. The sum was paid out and the situation in the city calmed down, but questions remained about the long-term viability of the Pikalyovo plants.&lt;ref name="pikalevo2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/business/20090604/155170638.html|title=Protesting workers in northwest Russia paid wage arrears|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2009-06-04|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127184023/http://en.rian.ru/business/20090604/155170638.html|archive-date=2011-11-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the official list of Russian monotowns includes 319 populated places.&lt;ref name="tass17"&gt;{{cite news |title=Список моногородов в России "заморожен" до конца 2018 года |url=https://tass.ru/ekonomika/3944436 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=ТАСС |date=16 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329221354/http://tass.ru/ekonomika/3944436 |archive-date=2018-03-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towns can be removed from the list, if the local economies are deemed to have become sufficiently diversified.&lt;ref name="tass17"/&gt; In late 2017, 14 million Russians lived in officially designated monotowns.&lt;ref name="ft17a"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia’s next revolution: how technology came to the mines |url=https://www.ft.com/content/addb7e2a-b90d-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=26 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207123313/https://www.ft.com/content/addb7e2a-b90d-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852 |archive-date=2018-02-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fund for the Development of Monotowns was established in 2014, to invest in infrastructure and promote economic diversification.&lt;ref name="ft16a"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia’s ‘monotowns’ face imminent collapse |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e8001869-3ce0-3b8c-93b0-36421acc60ed |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=6 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009055925/https://www.ft.com/content/e8001869-3ce0-3b8c-93b0-36421acc60ed |archive-date=2016-10-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monotown list is divided into categories, depending on the socioeconomic situation.&lt;ref name="shastitko16"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shastitko |first1=A. |last2=Fatikhova |first2=A. |title=Monotowns: A Quantitative Analysis |journal=Baltic Region |date=2016 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=4–19 |doi=10.5922/2079-8555-2016-2-1 |url=https://journals.kantiana.ru/upload/iblock/a79/Shastitko%20A.,%20Fatikhova_4-19.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602160109/https://journals.kantiana.ru/upload/iblock/a79/Shastitko%20A.,%20Fatikhova_4-19.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monotowns are not necessarily economically stagnant: [[Norilsk]] has an above average employment rate, as well as relatively high salaries.&lt;ref name="shastitko16"/&gt;

===Examples===
Russia's largest monotown is [[Tolyatti]], which has a population of 700,000. It is home to the large [[AvtoVAZ]] factory, which in late 2008 employed 106,000 people. AvtoVAZ is Russia's largest carmaker, accounting for 1% of the country's GDP.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;{{dated info|date=October 2018}} As of 2014, the AvtoVAZ is owned by Nissan-Renault, which uses even harsher workforce policies than the previous owner.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, the situation is somewhat aided by widespread of small-scale car parts producers and other small car-oriented enterprises in the region, which are providing many additional workplaces.

[[Dalnegorsk]], located in the [[Russian Far East]], is a monotown with a population of nearly 40,000 people. The town's economy is completely dominated by two mining and metallurgy companies: JSC [[Bor (enterprise)|Bor]] and JSC [[Dalpolimetal]], both subsidiaries of OOO UK Russian mining company (RGRK). They produce zinc and lead concentrates as well as boric acid colemanite.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010" /&gt;

==Soviet Union and other post-Soviet states==
The [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet planned economy]] aimed to establish industrial facilities in rational locations, based on military, political, bureaucratic and economic criteria. The goal was to maximise regional specialisation. The dominant enterprise was responsible not only for production, but for providing [[social services]] to the population, such as housing, child care, etc.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], most of the monotowns' dominant enterprises were privatised, and consequently many of them had gone bankrupt by the end of the 1990s, either deliberately (usually it was more profitable to sell the property of an enterprise than to keep it functioning) or due to uncompetitiveness, caused by the shrinkage of the home market outside the consumer goods sector, unrestricted import of low-cost industrial wares from China, Turkey or other countries and the lack of long-term investments by the private owners, who were for the most part interested in quick money rather than development or modernization.

Private owners also mostly refused to provide social services to the populations of monotowns, referring to such practice as being "economically inefficient" - however, the government's attempt to delegate the responsibility of providing social services from the companies to the newly created local municipalities was mostly a failure, as they lacked resources to complete the transformation.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt; That led to a radical decrease in quality of life in monotowns, which enjoyed higher-than-average wealth for the most part of the Soviet period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11172">The '''National Emissions Standards Act''', officially known as the '''Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act''' ({{USPL|89|272}}), is a 1965 amendment to the U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1963. The amendment set the first federal [[Automobile emissions control|vehicle emissions]] standards, beginning with the 1968 models. These standards were reductions from the 1963 emissions: 72% reduction for [[hydrocarbon]]s, 56% reduction for [[carbon monoxide]], and 100% reduction for crankcase hydrocarbons.  The impact the regulatory standards will have on air quality in the future, as well as the potential characteristics of the vehicle fleet can be analyzed with the use of [[roadway air dispersion model]]s.

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is a department specific to the Clean Air Act. Its purpose is to make sure the amount of air pollution emitted stays inside the standards set by the U.S. Each state is required to have a state implementation plan (SIPs) that clearly indicates how it will enforce the regulations of the Clean Air Act. The states have to create regulations of their own that also adhere to the guidelines of the U.S. regulations; in order to do so, they must hold hearings so the public can contribute ideas and provide feedback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/pdfs/peg.pdf The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act], U.S. EPA website, see pages 1-2 for explanation of the roles of the states and local governments as well as the role of the U.S. EPA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleaning up commonly found air pollutants==
The six common air pollutants of primary concern to the United States are particle pollution, [[ground-level ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide|sulfur oxides]], [[nitrogen oxides]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="Cleaning"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/cleanup.html Cleaning Up Commonly Found Air Pollutants], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These pollutants are detrimental to health, the environment, and a person's home and other belongings. The worst two of the six pollutants are particle pollution and ground-level ozone, which have to be regulated by the EPA. Particle pollution, or particle matter, consists of soot, smoke, and chemically formed "droplets".&lt;ref name="Cleaning"/&gt; These particles are very small and can bury themselves deep inside the lungs. Ground-level ozone is found in [[smog]] and can also negatively affect the lungs. Smog contains [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) and [[nitrogen oxides]] (NOx). VOCs come from cars burning gasoline, petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, etc., while NOx results from burning gasoline, coal, or oil.&lt;ref name="Cleaning"/&gt;

==Cars, trucks, buses, and non-road equipment==
Motor vehicles contribute a great deal to air pollution, so to reduce the amount of emissions released, the EPA placed restrictions on fuel and engine production. As a result, manufacturers are required to build cleaner engines and refiners are required to produce cleaner fuels. Gasoline used to include lead, which can cause damage to bodily functions and organs and sulfur was lowered over 90 percent in fuels because it doesn't allow a vehicle's [[catalytic converter]] to effectively clean up the exhaust.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/carstrucks.html Cars, Trucks, Buses, and "Nonroad" Equipment], U.S. EPA website. &lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most small cars, the majority of trucks, buses, and [[non-road equipment]] use diesel engines because they are more fuel efficient. However, they are also more harmful to the environment. In order to cut the emissions, the EPA issued rules to combine strict emissions standards for diesel engines and to lower sulfur diesel fuel.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"/&gt;

[[Alternative fuels]] such as natural gas, [[propane]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], electricity, and [[biodiesel]], are a major area of interest for the Clean Air Act. It is also important to find renewable fuels that can come from resources such as wood, waste paper, grasses, vegetable oils, and corn.&lt;ref name="Vehicles"/&gt;

==Interstate and international air pollution==
Air pollution is not contained and is carried by the wind all over the world. Industries contribute air pollution in the form of smog and [[haze]] in "downwind states".&lt;ref name="Interstate"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/interstate.html Interstate and International Air Pollution], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes pollution from "upwind states" blows into the downwind states, which can affect their air quality standards. These states can ask the EPA to enforce "a federal plan" to make sure that the standards are met. The Clean Air Act also requires that national parks maintain clear air; therefore, the EPA must collaborate with states to diminish the "regional haze" in national parks and wilderness areas.&lt;ref name="Interstate"/&gt;

==Reducing acid rain==
Acid precipitation comes in more forms than just rain. Snow, fog, mist, gas, and dust are also formed in the atmosphere and have the ability to become acid precipitation.&lt;ref name="Acid"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/acidrain.html Reducing Acid Rain], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These types of precipitation are formed when certain types of air pollutants mix with the moisture in the air to form an acid. Each type is  potentially dangerous to humans' health, can cause haze and problems in the environment, and can cause damage to people's properties. The two main pollutants that cause acid precipitation are [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Power plants that burn coal and "heavy oil" are accountable for over two-thirds of SO2 emissions annually in the U.S., while automobiles emit about fifty percent NOx and power plants emit about forty percent. The remaining percentages are from industrial and commercial boilers.&lt;ref name="Acid"/&gt; 

Any toxin is harmful to life on Earth. Acid rain and snow can increase the acidity in lakes and streams long enough to harm fish and other forms of life. Sulfur dioxide can be dangerous to children and the elderly by causing serious damage to lung tissue. In 1990, the Clean Air Act was changed to include a "nationwide approach" to lowering SO2 and NOx emissions. A cap was placed on the total SO2 emissions from electric power plants across the U.S.&lt;ref name="Acid"/&gt;

==Reducing toxic air pollutants==
Toxic air pollutants are the suspected cause of major illnesses and issues with reproductive problems. These pollutants stay in the environment for long periods, which can affect all living things and start a chain of negative events. In particular, smokestacks and automobiles are the two main sources of toxic air pollutants. When refueling, the gases turn into vapor that leak into the air. "Before the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, EPA regulated air toxics one chemical at a time." &lt;ref name="Toxic"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/toxics.html Reducing Toxic Air Pollutants], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA now regulates pollutants by categories of industries because they release more than one chemical at a time. Some of the categories are, chemical plants, [[incinerators]], dry cleaners, and manufacturers of wood furniture. Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, air toxics from large industries have already been reduced by 70 percent.&lt;ref name="Toxic"/&gt;

==Protecting the stratosphere ozone layer==
Ozone can be harmful if it is ground-level, but if it is in the [[stratosphere]], it protects the Earth from [[ultraviolet]] rays from the sun. The stratosphere blocks some of the light called ultraviolet B, which can cause skin cancer and eye damage. It can also damage plant life on land and in the ocean.&lt;ref name="Ozone"&gt;[http://epa.gov/air/caa/peg/stratozone.html Protecting the Stratospheric Ozone Layer], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main pollutants that are harmful to the stratosphere are called [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs). They come from aerosols such as hairspray, air conditioners, and some other types. They were banned in the 1970s. In the 1980s, scientists found that there were holes in the ozone around the South Pole. As a result, over 190 countries, including the United States, signed the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]]. This agreement is designated to eliminating chemicals that harm the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Ozone"/&gt; The 1990 Clean Air Act "phased out" the most harmful chemicals and in 1996, production of CFCs, [[halons (disambiguation)|halons]], and [[methyl chloroform]] ended in the United States. There are still holes in the ozone that will take approximately 60 years to close up because of the chemicals that are already in the stratosphere.&lt;ref name="Ozone"/&gt;

==Permits and enforcement==
Congress added an operating permit program to the 1990 Clean Air Act for larger industries and commercial sources that release toxins into the air.&lt;ref name="Permits"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/permits.html Permits and Enforcement], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; These permits have information about which pollutants are emitted, how much may be emitted, and what actions the person in charge is taking to minimize the pollution. Permits must also state plans to measure and report the air pollution produced. The EPA is also responsible for making sure each state and tribe abides by the permits.&lt;ref name="Permits"/&gt; For businesses that qualify for more than one thing under the Clean Air Act, operating permits are helpful because the information is all there. These permits tell them exactly what they need to do to prevent pollution. Now the EPA is more powerful in being able to enforce the rules instead of having to handle everything in court. The EPA can either "issue an order requiring the violator to comply, issue and administrative penalty order, or bring a civil judicial action".&lt;ref name="Permits"/&gt;

==Public participation==
Since the 1990 Clean Air Act, the public has the opportunity to give input on "how a law is carried out".&lt;ref name="Public"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/public.html Public Participation], U.S. EPA website&lt;/ref&gt; Hearings are held in different cities in the United States by the EPA. Anyone who attends is allowed to participate or written comments can be sent to the EPA. These hearings are open to the public when a "major rule" is about to be discussed.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt; The more public input is recorded, the better the outcome will be for communities around the country. Reports from the Clean Air Act are made available to the public and they include information about the amount of pollution that is emitted by industries and other sources.&lt;ref name="Public"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4016">'''Neurometrics''' is the science of measuring the underlying organization of the brain's electrical activity.  Certain brainwave frequencies are associated with general psychological processes.  [[EEG]]s are used to measure the [[Neural oscillation|brain wave]]s.

According to [[E. Roy John]], the pioneer in the field of neurometrics, neurometrics is

{{quote|"a method of quantitative EEG that provides a precise, reproducible estimate of the deviation of an individual record from normal.  This computer analysis makes it possible to detect and quantify abnormal brain organization, to give a quantitative definition of the severity of brain disease, and to identify subgroups of pathophysiological abnormalitites within groups of patients with similar clinical symptoms.  Reliable and meaningful results require an adequate amount of good quality raw data, correlated with age, transformed for [[normal distribution|Gaussian distributions]], and corrected for intercorrelations among measures.  Neurometric analysis is able to detect consistent patterns of abnormalities in patients with subtle cognitive dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders.  These analyses may also prove useful in determining therapy and monitoring its efficacy."&lt;ref&gt;(John, E. Roy.  "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/docdel/art901173492 Principles of Neurometrics]."  In ''American Journal of EEG Technology'' 1990. 30:251-266.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1977, Roy John and Robert Thatcher&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificartsfoundation.org/page/page/3529693.htm Robert Thatcher]&lt;/ref&gt; published one of the first texts in the field of neurometrics.  The text was entitled ''Neurometrics''. &lt;ref&gt;(John, E. Roy.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=GGlvKAAACAAJ&amp;dq=neurometrics&amp;ei=YO2hR9GAN4fCtAPa1ZSvCg  ''Neurometrics: Clinical Applications of Quantitative Electrophysiology''].  1977.  New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The field of Neurometrics began to expand significantly in the 1990s.  This was due in part to the advent of inexpensive methods of linking computers to traditional EEG devices.  This allowed researchers to transform analog EEG signals into digital signals for statistical analysis.  Leading researchers in the field included Frank Duffy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthgrades.com/directory_search/physician/profiles/dr-md-reports/dr-frank-duffy-md-f985a9c8.cfm Frank Duffy] &lt;/ref&gt; E. Roy John, and Robert Thatcher.  Between the 1980s and the present time, thousands of articles in the field of neurometrics have been published.

Entrepreneurs began to take notice of the potential of neurometrics in the late 1980s.  In 1991, [[Lexicor Medical Technology]] filed one of the first [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) class two filings in the field of Neurometric software and related EEG devices, called the NeuroSearch-24.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=78217 NeuroSearch-24]&lt;/ref&gt;

NxLink Ltd. built upon the Lexicor Medical Technology 510(k)s with their filing of the Neurometric Analysis System&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=111380 Neurometric Analysis System]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998. Robert Thatcher filed a 510(k) with the FDA on his Neuroguide Analysis System&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=15180 Neuroguide Analysis System]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004.  The Thatcher filing was then followed by an FDA filing by BRC Operations PTY Limited, with their BRC Software Product&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=17414 BRC Software Product]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005.

Each of these devices represented software which was capable of comparing a subject's EEG data to a normative database; the software also allows clinicians to measure the subject's variance from normal.  This technique promises to allow clinicians to evaluate various mental and psychiatric conditions.

'''New Science Projects''' is a [[blues punk]] band from [[Denton, Texas]]. They play a grungy, [[lo-fi]] styled [[punk rock]], and are known for their wildly eclectic, often bizarre make-up and on-stage mannerisms. They have been described as an "anti-house-disco-hipster band,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = DC9 in SPACE: New Science Projects | publisher = DC9 at Night | date = June 10, 2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Dallas Observer]] in an interview after the band's release of ''Poison Culture''; however, Jones refutes this, claiming he doesn't "want to position [himself] to run for political office at this time."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = DC9 in SPACE: New Science Projects | publisher = DC9 at Night | date = June 10, 2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band is significant member of both the local [[Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex]] music scene as well as the local punk scene. New Science Projects has toured throughout North Texas, including [[Mount Righteous]], [[Innards (band)|Innards]], and [[The Two Knights]]; they frequently play at [[1919 Hemphill]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where they are also set to release their album [[Bikini Salute]] in January,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = Calendar | publisher = 1919 Hemphill | date = January 23, 2011 | url =http://1919hemphill.org/calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been cited as "...A wild ride... like a Bob Dylan nightmare."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hogan | first = Josh | title = Album review: Bikini Salute by New Science Projects | publisher = Pegasus News | date = January 24, 2011 | url =http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2011/jan/24/album-review-bikini-salute-new-science-projects/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were nominated for Best Blues Act in the Dallas Observer's 2010 award series.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = McAnelly | first = Travis | title = Meet the New Science Projects | publisher = My Denton Music | date = November 11, 2010 | url =http://www.mydentonmusic.com/interviews.php?page=nsp-11.11.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Science Projects is known for their bizarre make-up, which depicts all of the band members as severely injured and bleeding. The reasoning behind this has never been answered with clarity. Dale Jones speaks on behalf of the rest of the band, and is notorious for his on-stage persona, including his thick, ambiguous, Eastern European accent, though Jones states that his stage persona is no specific character with any particular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sullivan | first = Dick | title = Why Dallas Needs New Science Projects, The Mad Man Troubadour | publisher = Front Row: D Magazine | date = July 21, 2010 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' mannerisms seem distant and apart from the present; while he is very charismatic, much of his banter is juxtaposed, with multiple conflicting topics being spoken about at any given time, while other speeches very frequently trail off before their conclusion. When asked about his persona, Jones merely replied, "I feel like it is me. So I don't know how I'd be anything else... Unless I was pretending. Which is not a bad idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = DC9 in SPACE: New Science Projects | publisher = DC9 at Night | date = June 10, 2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pars pro toto''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɑːr|z|_|p|r|əʊ|_|ˈ|t|əʊ|t|əʊ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pars_pro_toto|title=pars pro toto {{!}} Definition of pars pro toto in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|ˈpars proː ˈtoː.toː|lang}}), [[Latin]] for "a part (taken) for the whole",&lt;ref name="m-w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pars%20pro%20toto |title=pars pro toto - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[figure of speech]] where the name of a ''portion'' of an object, place, or concept represents its ''entirety''. It is distinct from a [[merism]], which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts; [[metonymy]], where an object, place, or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object, place, or concept; or [[synecdoche]], which can refer both to this and its inverse: the whole representing a part.

In the context of language, ''pars pro toto'' means that something is named after a part of it, or after a limited characteristic, in itself not necessarily representative for the whole.  For example, "glasses" is a ''pars pro toto'' name for something that consists of more than just two pieces of glass.
Examples of common ''pars pro toto'' usage in political geography include "[[Russia]]" or "[[Russian people|Russians]]", for the entire former [[Russian Empire]] or former [[Soviet Union]] or its people, [[China]] for [[People's Republic of China]], [[Holland]] for the [[Netherlands]], and, particularly in languages other than English, using the translation of "[[England]]" in that language for "[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]". Among English-speakers "[[Great Britain]]" or "Britain" is a common ''pars pro toto'' shorthand for the entire United Kingdom. [[Switzerland]]'s name (in German ''Schweiz'') comes from its central Canton of [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]].

The inverse of a ''pars pro toto'' is a ''[[totum pro parte]]'', in which the whole is used to describe a part, such as widespread use of "[[Americas|America]]" (which originally named the entire western hemisphere to place it geographically, with alliteration, alongside Asia, Africa, "Europa", and ultimately [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]]) in place of "[[United States of America]]", "United States" or "US".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blair Arts Ltd. |url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/totum_pro_parte.html |title=Online Dictionary of Language Terminology (ODLT) s.v. totum pro parte |publisher=ODLT |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term ''[[synecdoche]]'' is used for both, as well as similar metaphors, though in Greek it literally means "simultaneous understanding".

The '''phyllosphere''' is a term used in [[microbiology]] to refer to the total above-ground portions of plants as habitat for [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name=Last1955/&gt;
&lt;ref name=Ruinen1956/&gt; The phyllosphere can be further subdivided into the '''caulosphere''' (stems), '''phylloplane''' (leaves), '''anthosphere''' (flowers), and '''carposphere''' (fruits). The below-ground microbial habitats (i.e. the thin-volume of soil surrounding root or subterranean stem surfaces) are referred to as the [[rhizosphere]] and [[laimosphere]].
Most plants host diverse communities of microorganisms including [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[archaea]], and [[protists]] . Some are beneficial to the plant, others function as [[plant pathogen]]s and may damage the host plant or even kill it. However, the majority of microbial colonists on any given plant have no detectable effect on plant growth or function.

Research into the characteristics of microbial life in the phyllosphere is of great commercial importance to the agricultural industry for two reasons. First, understanding the survival of plant disease-causing bacteria and fungi is vital for developing new ways to control their spread. Second, there has been a recent{{When|date=September 2012}} rise in the number of food poisoning cases associated with fruit and vegetables contaminated with bacteria, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[E. coli O157:H7]]''. This is particularly true of fresh fruits and salads which are not cooked prior to consumption. Preventing these outbreaks by developing better decontamination strategies is important to protect public health. For microorganisms the phyllosphere can be considered a hostile environment however, since there is a limited availability of nutrients, strong sun irradiation and variation in water availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berlec|first=Aleš|date=2012-09-01|title=Novel techniques and findings in the study of plant microbiota: Search for plant probiotics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945212001070|journal=Plant Science|volume=193–194|pages=96–102|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2012.05.010|pmid=22794922}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindow|first=Steven E|last2=Leveau|first2=Johan H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6211">[[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]] is an important phenomenon in [[astronomy]]. 

==Stars==
The polarization of [[star#Radiation|starlight]] was first observed by the [[astronomer]]s [[William Hiltner]] and John S. Hall in 1949. Subsequently, [[Jesse Greenstein]] and [[Leverett Davis, Jr.]] developed theories allowing the use of polarization data to trace interstellar magnetic fields. 
Though the integrated [[thermal radiation]] of [[star]]s is not usually appreciably polarized at source, scattering by [[interstellar dust]] can impose polarization on starlight over long distances.  Net polarization at the source can occur if the [[photosphere]] itself is asymmetric, due to [[limb polarization]].  Plane polarization of starlight generated at the star itself is observed for [[Ap star]]s (peculiar A type stars).[https://web.archive.org/web/20040920073655/http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/eas/abs/2003/04/eas0928/eas0928.html]

==Sun==
Both [[circular polarization|circular]] and [[linear polarization]] of light from the Sun has been measured. Circular polarization is mainly due to transmission and absorption effects in strongly magnetic regions of the Sun's surface. Another mechanism that gives rise to circular polarization is the so-called "alignment-to-orientation mechanism". Continuum light is linearly polarized at different locations across the face of the Sun (limb polarization) though taken as a whole, this polarization cancels. Linear polarization in spectral lines is usually created by [[anisotropic scattering]] of photons on atoms and ions which can themselves be polarized by this interaction. The linearly polarized spectrum of the Sun is often called the [[second solar spectrum]]. [[Atomic polarization]] can be modified in weak magnetic fields by the [[Hanle effect]]. As a result, polarization of the scattered photons is also modified providing a diagnostics tool for understanding [[stellar magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name=Landi&gt;{{cite book |author=Egidio Landi Degl'Innocenti|title=Polarization in Spectral Lines|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|date=2004|isbn=1-4020-2414-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sources==
[[Image:Quasar 3C 286 as observed with ALMA.jpg|thumb|The polarization in the [[quasar]] [[3C 286]] measured with [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]]]]
Polarization is also present in radiation from [[coherent radiation|coherent]] astronomical sources due to the [[Zeeman effect]] (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol [[Astrophysical maser|masers]]).

The large radio lobes in [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and [[pulsar]] radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent) also show polarization. 

Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar [[magnetic field]] in our Galaxy as well as in radio galaxies via [[Faraday rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Cosmic microwave background==
The polarization of the [[cosmic microwave background#polarization|cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) is also being used to study the physics of the very [[early universe]].&lt;ref name="boyle"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=96|date=2006|pages=111301|first=Latham A.|last=Boyle|title=Inflationary predictions for scalar and tensor fluctuations reconsidered|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.111301|pmid=16605810|last2=Steinhardt|first2=PJ|last3=Turok|first3=N|issue=11|arxiv = astro-ph/0507455 |bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96k1301B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tegmark"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Max|last=Tegmark|title=What does inflation really predict? | doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2005/04/001|journal=JCAP|volume=0504|issue=4|pages=001|date=2005|arxiv=astro-ph/0410281|bibcode = 2005JCAP...04..001T }}&lt;/ref&gt; CMB exhibits 2 components of polarization: [[B-modes|B-mode]] (divergence-free like magnetic field) and [[B-modes|E-mode]] (curl-free gradient-only like electric field) polarization. The [[BICEP2]] telescope located at the South Pole helped in the detection of B-mode polarization in the CMB. The polarization modes of the CMB may provide more information about the influence of [[Gravitational Waves]] on the development of the early universe.

It has been suggested that astronomical sources of polarised light caused the [[chirality]] found in biological molecules on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=S. |date=1999 |title=Polarised starlight and the handedness of Life |journal=American Scientist |volume=97 |pages=336–43 |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |bibcode = 1999AmSci..87..336C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Projectnet'''  is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[database]] that contains descriptions of both ongoing and completed research projects that are being conducted on [[natural resources]] by prominent organizations in Finland.

Project registers are usually maintained by individual organizations, but from Projectnet one can search for project information from five different organizations at the same time. The organizations that produce information for Projectnet are [[Finnish Food Safety Authority]] ([[Evira]]), the [[Finnish Geodetic Institute|Finnish Geospatial Research Institute]] (FGI), the [[National Resources Institute Finland]] (Luke) as well as the [[Finnish Environment Institute]] (SYKE). Four faculties of the [[University of Helsinki]] are also involved in the Projectnet: Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy as well as the Viikki Campus Library of the [[Helsinki University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = User Guide of Projectnet|url = http://www.projectnet.fi/index.php?MIT=opaste&amp;mja=hankehaavi_eng&amp;taulu=hanke|website = www.projectnet.fi|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project descriptions in the Projectnet are presented in exactly the form that the information producers have written them. These descriptions are linked directly to the information producer's web page that often contains a more extensive project description. Projectnet doesn’t manipulate the produced project descriptions in any way but its directories are created by the basis of the data fields in these descriptions to help the information seekers to find relevant information. All changes in these projects as well as any new projects that have been initiated are stored in the organization's own register, database or web page and these changes are automatically updated to the Projectnet at agreed upon intervals.

The purpose of Projectnet is to improve the discoverability, availability and usability of scientific information within the field of natural resources. Project information is usually found in the publications that come out of different projects. While there are many publication databases in existence, Projectnet is the only extensive, multi-scientific project description database in Finland. As for new scientific projects, Projectnet is the first or even the only available information resource.

In particular, researchers, research sponsors, experts, research administration, decision-makers, organizations and communications professionals need information about different research projects. By using Projectnet it is possible to quickly discover what is being researched within the field of natural resources, who the researchers are and in which organizations they are conducting their research. It can be difficult for the information seeker to determine what would be the best place to find out about [[climate change]] or [[bioenergy]], since so many organizations are conducting research in these areas from many different perspectives. This is where Projectnet comes to the information seekers' aid.

Projectnet contains over 5000 project descriptions. The number of descriptions increases as new projects are being initiated. The aim of Projectnet is to get more data producers who are researching natural resources involved in its network.

==Background==

Projectnet was opened at the end of the year 2010, while the Finnish version Hankehaavi began in January 2008. Projectnet has been produced by the Ministry on Agriculture and Forestry in cooperation with the [[Viikki Campus Library]] and the representatives of the research organizations who provide the data. The Projectnet application has been designed and programmed by [[MI Tietorakenteet Oy]] (MI Information Structures Ltd).

Education has been identified as a common social vaccine against contracting HIV, resulting in the more educated less likely to be infected. Accurate information of health risks suggests a negative linear relationship between years of education and HIV infection rate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baker, David Multiple Effects of Education on Disease: The Intriguing Case of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General made a statement during 2011 [[World AIDS Day]], identifying education as one of the three primary concerns, and urging for it to become a full-fledged priority. By implementing educational policies, UNESCO aims to make sure all individuals, in and out of formal education, have access to comprehensive HIV education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/resources/online-materials/single-view/news/flying_the_flag_for_hiv_and_aids_education/#.UyITMvldUuc&lt;/ref&gt; Improving the education of HIV/AIDS has become a growing concern, with 1 in 4 students aged 16 and above stating they had learned nothing about HIV/AIDS in school during a Sex Education Forum survey in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncb.org.uk/media/333229/young_people_experiences_of_hiv_and_aids.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207183451/http://www.ncb.org.uk/media/333229/young_people_experiences_of_hiv_and_aids.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concerns are further stressed since learning about sexually transmitted diseases is the only aspect of sex education that is compulsory for all secondary schools in England and Wales.

==Availability of information==

Education is a strong factor in improving population health by building in individuals the capacity to process and understand risks related to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Adversely, poor information hinders individuals from analyzing their behavioural choices by masking potential health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pop.psu.edu/news/2012/the-causal-effect-of-education-on-population-dynamics |title=Population Research Institute |publisher=Pop.psu.edu |date=2017-08-10 |accessdate=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inadequate information becomes a risk factor for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The mischaracterization of HIV/AIDS as a homosexual disease has led higher status heterosexuals that participate in risky sexual behaviour to continue without considering the risk of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, Ryan; Wiseman, Alexander: The Impact of HIV/AIDS on Education Worldwide&lt;/ref&gt; Education is important in the growth of adolescent reasoning, as having less prior knowledge shows a compulsion to construct reality based on recent experiences.

Data analysis collected in Sydney, Australia in 2007 found that within 236 adults, age 20 to 65, respondents were concerned about risks of HIV/AIDS transmitted through casual contact, leading to disapproval of homosexuality and drug use. In contrast, highly educated respondents were shown to be less likely to overestimate the possibility of HIV transmission through casual contact compared to respondents with a lower level education.&lt;ref&gt;Hosseinzadeh, Hassan: Functional Analysis of HIV/AIDS Stigma: Consensus or Divergence?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudinal changes==

Negative attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS stem from misconceptions regarding the disease. Georgian sex workers were found to be highly lacking knowledge, with only 61% knowing that a healthy-looking person can be infected, and 44% thinking one can get HIV from a mosquito bite. Only 64% think that using condoms for every sexual act can reduce the risk of HIV.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The World Bank: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior Related To HIV/AIDS Among Transport Sector Workers: A Case Study of Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sex workers in Georgia who were interviewed regarding people living with HIV/AIDS were found to have negative attitudes towards infected individuals. Only 25% thought a teacher who is HIV-positive should be allowed to continue teaching, and only 25% would buy food from an infected vendor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stigma associated with those who have HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa prevents many from getting tested. The relation predicts, as formal education continues to change attitudes towards those living with HIV/AIDS, the reduction of stigma enhances prevention techniques.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Cognitive abilities==

As cognitive abilities are built, individuals become more motivated and develop a capacity to absorb more accurate information. Over half of English students agree that teaching about HIV/AIDS should start between 11 and 13 years old, while just under one third believe between 14 and 16 is the best age to learn about sexual education.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the introduction of partially accurate information in Sub-Saharan Africa led to a decline in HIV rates among more educated, suggesting they may have the greater cognitive skill required to sift through the various levels of accuracy and mount a more effective response.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Increased motivation needed to analyze personal risks and behavioural choices were increased by cognitive abilities enhanced by formal education, suggesting a direct correlation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The result in a shortage of teaching materials and inadequate capacities in the teaching of HIV and AIDS and life skills education.In addition, it was found that HIV and AIDS are highly stigmatized, colleges are ill equipped with health facilities, and national policies on condom use are ambiguous. The report presents a discussion of these and other issues, and makes policy and programmatic recommendations for strengthening the response of teacher training colleges to HIV and AIDS.
HIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries.The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital.Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there where 12 million Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.
By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.
At the household level, AIDS results in both the loss of income but also increased spending on healthcare. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households with an [[HIV/AIDS]] patient, spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households.&lt;ref name="WBank"&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.

==Critique==

Studies of the effectiveness of HIV education programs often rely on self-reported information about knowledge and behavior, leading to a possible social desirability bias if subjects report what they think the interviewer wants to think&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 
Encouraging Kenyan students to write essays on way of protecting oneself against HIV/AIDS led to increased self-reported use of condoms without an increase in self-reported sexual activity. There is no evidence to determine whether an increase in condom use by students corresponds to actual reduction in HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Early findings adversely identified formal education as a risk factor (with the more educated individuals being most likely to be infected). As wealthier individuals are usually more educated, the risk of many of these individuals was accompanied by the presence of formal wealth as a risk factor. Twenty years into the pandemic, education began to shift from risk factor to social vaccine.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7702">In [[mathematical optimization]] and related fields, '''relaxation''' is a [[mathematical model|modeling strategy]].  A relaxation is an [[approximation theory|approximation]] of a difficult problem by a nearby problem that is easier to solve. A solution of the relaxed problem provides information about the original problem.

For example, a [[linear programming]] relaxation of an [[integer programming]] problem  removes the integerality constraint and so allows non-integer rational solutions. A [[Lagrangian relaxation]] of a complicated problem in combinatorial optimization penalizes violations of some constraints, allowing an easier relaxed problem to be solved. Relaxation techniques complement or supplement [[branch and bound]] algorithms of combinatorial optimization; linear programming and Lagrangian relaxations are used to obtain bounds in branch-and-bound algorithms for integer programming.&lt;ref name="Geoff"&gt;{{harvtxt|Geoffrion|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modeling strategy of relaxation should not be confused with [[iterative method]]s of [[relaxation method|relaxation]],  such as [[successive over-relaxation]] (SOR); iterative methods of relaxation are used in solving problems in [[partial differential equation|differential equation]]s, [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least-squares]], and [[linear programming]].&lt;ref name="Murty"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murty|first=Katta&amp;nbsp;G.|authorlink=Katta G.

== Definition ==
A ''relaxation'' of the minimization problem

: &lt;math&gt;z = \min \{c(x) : x \in X \subseteq \mathbf{R}^{n}\}&lt;/math&gt;

is another minimization problem of the form

:&lt;math&gt;z_R = \min \{c_R(x) : x \in X_R \subseteq \mathbf{R}^{n}\}&lt;/math&gt;

with these two properties

# &lt;math&gt;X_R \supseteq X&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;c_R(x) \leq c(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;.

The first property states that the original problem's feasible domain is a subset of the relaxed problem's feasible domain. The second property states that the original problem's objective-function is greater than or equal to the relaxed problem's objective-function.&lt;ref name="Geoff"/&gt;

=== Properties===
If &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution of the original problem, then &lt;math&gt;x^* \in X \subseteq X_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z = c(x^*) \geq c_R(x^*)\geq z_R&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x^* \in X_R&lt;/math&gt; provides an upper bound on &lt;math&gt;z_R&lt;/math&gt;.

If in addition to the previous assumptions, &lt;math&gt;c_R(x)=c(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, the following holds: If an optimal solution for the relaxed problem is feasible for the original problem, then it is optimal for the original problem.&lt;ref name="Geoff"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13215">The term “School Brand”, similar to "brand" as it applies to traditional business applications, is any type of term, mark or insignia, which identifies one organization or product from another. These marks were intended to indicate an affiliation with a particular school, group, organization, trade, manufacturer, or maker.

== History ==

While “branding” has history as far back as 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE, in a period referred to as the [[Vedic Period]], “School Branding” however is a relatively new concept. Many universities and colleges, now operate in a businesslike market where students are “customers” and other schools are competition. To successfully compete, a school must develop and market its own brand that differentiates it from the thousands of other schools vying for students and funding. Although most have marketing budgets, schools are still climbing the learning curve when relating to effective branding.

According to Branding Strategy Insider, school branding surfaced in the early 1800s when a few sororities and fraternities literally branded their pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2006/08/history_of_bran.html/ |title=History of Branding - Brand Strategy Insider |publisher=Brandingstrategyinsider.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, tobacco and patent medicine companies began branding their products as a way to identify them and build buyer loyalty. Brand identity also helped protect the customer by holding companies more accountable for product quality. By the mid-1800s, branding became central to business strategy as consumer companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] began using it in their marketing.

Higher education waited over a century to follow the corporate world. According to University Business, schools adopted branding in the early 2000s, when they realized that higher learning had evolved into a marketplace of customers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitybusiness.com/article/have-college-brands-delivered-their-promise|title=Have College Brands Delivered on Their Promise?|author=Robert A. Sevier|publisher=UB University Business|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of for-profit and online universities created more choices for students, and those newer schools were aggressively marketing in corporate style. Students were becoming more diverse, and schools could no longer take demographics for granted. At the same time, schools ranging from elementary to colleges and universities, had to compete harder for government funding and private endowments. To meet the challenges, universities invested in market research, logos and other marketing efforts that often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

== Present situation ==

Today’s school branding goes a step further and identifies a school’s unique competitive advantage. As stated in the Gallup Business Journal, a brand promises what the student experience will be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/28081/building-brand-higher-education.aspx/ |title=Building Brand Higher Education - Gallup Business Journal |publisher=Businessjournal.gallup.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many school departments produce their own distinctive communications, which can muddy the message. Colleges are grappling with the fact that the message is only effective if the entire faculty and leadership commit as one voice to the brand promise.

Schools also need to communicate their brand in a way that resonates emotionally with students. When people feel a message, they are more likely to remember it and respond. Brandgarten advocates using archetypes in branding to focus the emotional message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandgarten.com/2012/05/07/branding-higher-education|title=Branding Higher Education|publisher=brandgarden|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a school that places a high value on community service might use the archetype of the caregiver to tell its story. Prospective students would hear the call to service in all of the college's communications and could decide whether it was a potential match. Prior to branding, the same college would have been lost among superficially similar schools.

One recent rebranding occurred when [[Beaver College]], in Pennsylvania, surveyed prospective students and discovered that 30 percent of people considering the university did not apply because of the name. As a result, Beaver College was rebranded as [[Arcadia University]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunzel|first1=David|title=Universities Sell Their Brands|journal=The Journal of Product and Brand Management|date=2007|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=152-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of need ==

[[Harvard University]], viewed as the college gold standard, relies on branding to help recruit students and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall |first=Kevin |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1361340/does-branding-pay-colleges-harvard-thinks-so/ |title=Does Branding Pay Off for Colleges? Harvard Thinks So |publisher=Fast Company |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university took a lesson from its own business school and has applied for trademarks to protect several taglines. According to Fast Company, Harvard has already won approval for the taglines "Ask what you can do" and "Lessons learned". Harvard has also taken the entrepreneurial step of licensing its name to an upscale clothing line, which helps with branding as well as its funding mission.

Although colleges may be fairly new to branding, Neuromarketing points out that they represent the longest-lived brands in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fri, Jul 17, 2009 Neuromarketing, Branding |url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/college-branding.htm/ |title=College Branding |publisher= Neuromarketing |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools exist for decades and even centuries and today have thousands of rivals. As baby boomers age out of the education market, the declining number of prospective students is increasing competition among schools. Schools have responded with glossy marketing campaigns but still lag in branding. Neuromarketing notes that much college marketing material portrays similar images of a pleasant campus filled with smiling professors and a diverse student body. Websites, brochures and even tours often leave students and their families no wiser as to what makes a particular school special.

The missing ingredient is brand development, as [[Columbia University]] discovered in recent years. According to Neuromarketing, Columbia branded itself as the only Ivy League school in New York City and began showcasing the Manhattan experience in its marketing materials. Student applications have since increased over the competition, and many applicants cited location as the reason they chose Columbia University. Administrators of Columbia University realized that name recognition alone was not enough to attract more of the right students, and its branding strategy paid off.

Even as schools compete for students, those students are learning to brand themselves in an effort to impress colleges. High school is the right time to start building a personal brand, advises Visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vizibility.net/blog/its-never-too-early-personal-branding-for-high-school-college-students/ |title=It’s Never Too Early - Personal Branding for High School &amp; College Students - Visibility |author=Adrian Maynard| publisher=Vizibility.net |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young students can take several steps to enhance their uniqueness, beginning with defining a niche that will serve as the core of their brand. To build the school brand, they can start a quality blog and network both online and offline about its subject. Additional help in for schools in building a brand can be found by extended resources to companies like VIP Branding, who specializes in school branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvillageconcerns.com/ |title=Specializing in School Branding - VIP Branding |publisher=Globalvillageconcerns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allocation of resources to expert branding companies, allows school administrators to focus their attention to the needs of the school. By the time these students are ready to apply for college, they will have an edge over those who left personal branding up to the admissions essay.

Today’s students shop with brand awareness, and schools need to have a compelling message in place to attract them. Online school stores, like the ones offered through the Varsity Shop Program, provide a new avenue for schools to market themselves and their brand, through specialty designed and branded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsityshop.com/ |title=Varsity Shop Program |publisher=varsityshop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although schools tends to be leery of corporate tactics, branding is an opportunity for them to define for themselves what makes them special. By doing so, schools enrich what they offer creating school spirit and student pride, helping students to carry that commitment and care onto higher education.

== Repercussions of improper use ==

While many school administrators, recognize the power of school branding, the lack of resources and funding have led to alternative solutions to professional branding. Logo infringement has increased through the years as a result of this acknowledged need for branding. Numerous schools across the United States are infringing upon trademarked logos without realizing they are in violation. The [[Sanford Herald]] notated a recent case with [[Lake Mary High School]] out of [[Florida]], was in such a case, when the school was given a cease and desist order to terminate the use of their ram logo because as their ram logo was too similar the [[Dodge Ram]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysanfordherald.com/view/full_story_obits/7668253/article-Lake-Mary-rallies-around-new-ram|title=Lake Mary rallies around a new ram|author=Rachel Delinski|publisher=The Sanford Herold|date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, logo infringement is accidental, but the resulting repercussions of using trademarked logos can lead to litigation, exorbitant fines, and can be disparaging on school morale.

In addition to logo infringement, the loss of brand identity is another resulting drawback to improper school branding. Unprofessionally designed logos or mascots, can lead to an undesired identity or a variety of versions, which can lead to brand confusion as notated in by Brand Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandempowerment.com/schools/school-challenges/brand-control/ |title=Brand Control |publisher=Brand Empowerment |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Mascot or Logo: The visual representation of the school that identifies the school brand.
*School Colors: Colors selected by the school as a form of recognition.
*Motto, catchphrase or tagline: [[Bishop Montgomery High School]], uses their motto “Seek Justice, Speak Truth, Serve with Honor” to promote school pride. The branding slogan is typically used the school or group within the school to create a memorable phrase summarizes the organizations character.
*Movement:  A trademarked logo, like the newest one designed for [[GlenOak High School]], has a forward motion of the eagle mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandempowerment.com/schools/success-stories/glenoak-high-school/ |title=2012 GlenOak High School Logo |publisher=Brandempowerment.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interlock or Interlocking Logo: Characterized by interlocking two or more letters to form an alternative logo or secondary mark.

== Benefits ==

*Increases school and student pride
*Provide discernible school identification and recognition
*Unifying school sports, clubs and booster clubs to a single identifiable mascot or logo
*Validates school mission and core values
*Builds trust and loyalty
*Aligns schools internal culture and external reputation

'''Single-photon emission computed tomography''' ('''SPECT''', or less commonly, '''SPET''') is a [[nuclear medicine]] [[tomography|tomographic]] imaging technique using [[gamma ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|SPECT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a [[gamma camera]] (that is, [[scintigraphy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A CdTe detector for hyperspectral SPECT imaging|publisher=IOP Journal of Instrumentation | doi=10.1088/1748-0221/7/08/P08027 | volume=7|journal=Journal of Instrumentation|page=P08027|year=2012|author=Scuffham J W}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is able to provide [[true 3D]] information. This information is typically presented as cross-sectional slices through the patient, but can be freely reformatted or manipulated as required.

The technique requires delivery of a gamma-emitting [[radioisotope]] (a [[radionuclide]]) into the patient, normally through injection into the bloodstream. On occasion, the radioisotope is a simple soluble dissolved ion, such as an  [[Isotopes of gallium|isotope of gallium]](III). Most of the time, though, a marker radioisotope is attached to a specific ligand to create a [[radioligand]], whose properties bind it to certain types of tissues. This marriage allows the combination of ligand and [[radiopharmaceutical]] to be carried and bound to a place of interest in the body, where the ligand concentration is seen by a gamma camera.

==Principles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:TEMP-Siemens.jpg|thumb|A Siemens brand SPECT scanner, consisting of two gamma cameras.]]
Instead of just "taking a picture of anatomical structures", a SPECT scan monitors level of biological activity at each place in the 3-D region analyzed. Emissions from the radionuclide indicate amounts of blood flow in the capillaries of the imaged regions.  In the same way that a plain [[Radiography|X-ray]] is a 2-dimensional (2-D) view of a 3-dimensional structure, the image obtained by a [[gamma camera]] is a 2-D view of 3-D distribution of a [[radionuclide]].

SPECT imaging is performed by using a gamma camera to acquire multiple 2-D images (also called [[graphical projection|projections]]), from multiple angles. A computer is then used to apply a [[tomographic reconstruction]] algorithm to the multiple projections, yielding a 3-D data set. This data set may then be manipulated to show thin slices along any chosen axis of the body, similar to those obtained from other tomographic techniques, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[X-ray computed tomography]] (X-ray CT), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

SPECT is similar to PET in its use of radioactive tracer material and detection of gamma rays. In contrast with PET, the tracers used in SPECT emit gamma radiation that is measured directly, whereas PET tracers emit positrons that annihilate with electrons up to a few millimeters away, causing two gamma photons to be emitted in opposite directions. A PET scanner detects these emissions "coincident" in time, which provides more radiation event localization information and, thus, higher spatial resolution images than SPECT (which has about 1&amp;nbsp;cm resolution). SPECT scans are significantly less expensive than PET scans, in part because they are able to use longer-lived and more easily obtained radioisotopes than PET.

Because SPECT acquisition is very similar to planar gamma camera imaging, the same [[Radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceuticals]] may be used. If a patient is examined in another type of nuclear medicine scan, but the images are non-diagnostic, it may be possible to proceed straight to SPECT by moving the patient to a SPECT instrument, or even by simply reconfiguring the camera for SPECT image acquisition while the patient remains on the table.

[[File:SPECT CT.JPG|thumb|left|SPECT machine performing a total body bone scan. The patient lies on a table that slides through the machine, while a pair of gamma cameras rotate around her.]]
To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every 3–6 degrees. In most cases, a full 360-degree rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds is typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.

Multi-headed gamma cameras can accelerate acquisition. For example, a dual-headed camera can be used with heads spaced 180 degrees apart, allowing two projections to be acquired simultaneously, with each head requiring 180 degrees of rotation. Triple-head cameras with 120-degree spacing are also used.

Cardiac [[gated acquisition (medical imaging)|gated acquisitions]] are possible with SPECT, just as with planar imaging techniques such as [[Radionuclide angiography|multi gated acquisition scan]] (MUGA). Triggered by [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]] (EKG) to obtain differential information about the heart in various parts of its cycle, gated myocardial SPECT can be used to obtain quantitative information about myocardial perfusion, thickness, and contractility of the myocardium during various parts of the cardiac cycle, and also to allow calculation of [[Ejection fraction|left ventricular ejection fraction]], stroke volume, and cardiac output.

==Application==
SPECT can be used to complement any gamma imaging study, where a true 3D representation can be helpful, such as tumor imaging, infection ([[leukocyte]]) imaging, thyroid imaging or [[bone scintigraphy]].

Because SPECT permits accurate localisation in 3D space, it can be used to provide information about localised function in internal organs, such as functional cardiac or brain imaging.

===Myocardial perfusion imaging===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{main article|Myocardial perfusion imaging}}
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a form of functional cardiac imaging, used for the diagnosis of [[ischemic heart disease]]. The underlying principle is that under conditions of stress, diseased [[myocardium]] receives less blood flow than normal myocardium. MPI is one of several types of [[cardiac stress test]].

A cardiac specific radiopharmaceutical is administered, e.g., &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-[[tetrofosmin]] (Myoview, GE healthcare), &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb) or [[Thallium-201]] chloride. Following this, the heart rate is raised to induce myocardial stress, either by exercise on a [[Treadmill#Exercise treadmills|treadmill]] or pharmacologically with [[adenosine]], [[dobutamine]], or [[dipyridamole]] ([[aminophylline]] can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole).

SPECT imaging performed after stress reveals the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical, and therefore the relative blood flow to the different regions of the myocardium. Diagnosis is made by comparing stress images to a further set of images obtained at rest which are normally acquired prior to the stress images.

MPI has been demonstrated to have an overall accuracy of about 83% ([[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]]: 85%; [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]: 72%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12468513|year=2002|last1=Elhendy|first1=A|last2=Bax|first2=JJ|last3=Poldermans|first3=D|title=Dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in coronary artery disease.|volume=43|issue=12|pages=1634–46|journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/43/12/1634.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is comparable with (or better than) other non-invasive tests for ischemic heart disease.

===Functional brain imaging===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{main article|Neuroimaging}}
Usually, the gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO]] (hexamethylpropylene amine oxime). [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] is a metastable [[nuclear isomer]] that emits gamma rays that can be detected by a gamma camera. Attaching it to HMPAO allows &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc to be taken up by brain tissue in a manner proportional to brain blood flow, in turn allowing [[cerebral blood flow]] to be assessed with the nuclear gamma camera.

Because blood flow in the brain is tightly coupled to local brain metabolism and energy use, the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO tracer (as well as the similar &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-EC tracer) is used to assess brain metabolism regionally, in an attempt to diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of [[dementia]]. Meta-analysis of many reported studies suggests that SPECT with this tracer is about 74% sensitive at diagnosing Alzheimer's disease vs. 81% sensitivity for clinical exam ([[cognitive test]]ing, etc.). More recent studies have shown the accuracy of SPECT in Alzheimer's diagnosis may be as high as 88%.&lt;ref name="pmid16785801"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonte FJ, Harris TS, Hynan LS, Bigio EH, White CL |title=Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in the differential diagnosis of the dementias with histopathologic confirmation |journal=Clin Nucl Med |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=376–8 |year=2006|pmid=16785801 |doi=10.1097/01.rlu.0000222736.81365.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In meta analysis, SPECT was superior to clinical exam and clinical criteria (91% vs. 70%) in being able to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementias.&lt;ref name="pmid15545324"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dougall NJ, Bruggink S, Ebmeier KP |title=Systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in dementia |journal=Am J Geriatr Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=554–70 |year=2004 |pmid=15545324 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajgp.12.6.554}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter ability relates to SPECT's imaging of local metabolism of the brain, in which the patchy loss of cortical metabolism seen in multiple strokes differs clearly from the more even or "smooth" loss of non-occipital cortical brain function typical of Alzheimer's disease. Another recent review article showed that multi-headed SPECT cameras with quantitative analysis result in an overall sensitivity of 84-89% and an overall specificity of 83-89% in cross sectional studies and sensitivity of 82-96% and specificity of 83-89% for longitudinal studies of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henderson|first=Theodore|title=The diagnosis and evaluation of dementia and mild cognitive impairment with emphasis on SPECT perfusion neuroimaging|journal=CNS Spectrums|date=December 2012|volume=17|issue=4|pages=188–89|doi=10.1017/S1092852912000636|pmid=22929226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO SPECT scanning competes with [[fludeoxyglucose]] (FDG) [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning of the brain, which works to assess regional brain glucose metabolism, to provide very similar information about local brain damage from many processes. SPECT is more widely available, because the radioisotope used  is longer-lasting and far less expensive in SPECT, and the gamma scanning equipment is less expensive as well. While &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is extracted from relatively simple [[technetium-99m generator]]s, which are delivered to hospitals and scanning centers weekly to supply fresh radioisotope, FDG PET relies on FDG, which is made in an expensive medical [[cyclotron]] and "hot-lab" (automated chemistry lab for radiopharmaceutical manufacture), and then   delivered immediately to scanning sites because of the natural short 110-minute half-life of [[Fluorine-18]].

===Applications in nuclear technology===
In the nuclear power sector, the SPECT technique can be applied to image radioisotope distributions in irradiated nuclear fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:164459/FULLTEXT01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the irradiation of nuclear fuel (e.g. uranium) with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, a wide array of gamma-emitting radionuclides are naturally produced in the fuel, such as fission products ([[cesium-137]], [[barium-140]] and [[europium-154]]) and activation products ([[chromium-51]] and [[cobalt-58]]). These may be imaged using SPECT in order to verify the presence of fuel rods in a stored fuel assembly for [[IAEA safeguards]] purposes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/25/037/25037535.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to validate predictions of core simulation codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.13182/NT05-A3632 | volume=151 | title=Nondestructive Experimental Determination of the Pin-Power Distribution in Nuclear Fuel Assemblies | year=2005 | journal=Nuclear Technology | pages=70–76 | author=Jacobsson Svärd Staffan, Håkansson Ane, Bäcklin Anders, Osifo Otasowie, Willman Christopher, Jansson Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to study the behavior of the nuclear fuel in normal operation,

==Reconstruction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Coded aperture mask (for gamma camera).jpg|thumb|[[Coded aperture]] mask for [[gamma camera]]]]
Reconstructed images typically have resolutions of 64&amp;times;64 or 128&amp;times;128 pixels, with the pixel sizes ranging from 3–6&amp;nbsp;mm. The number of projections acquired is chosen to be approximately equal to the width of the resulting images. In general, the resulting reconstructed images will be of lower resolution, have increased noise than planar images, and be susceptible to [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]].

Scanning is time consuming, and it is essential that there is no patient movement during the scan time. Movement can cause significant degradation of the reconstructed images, although movement compensation reconstruction techniques can help with this. A highly uneven distribution of radiopharmaceutical also has the potential to cause artifacts. A very intense area of activity (e.g., the bladder) can cause extensive streaking of the images and obscure neighboring areas of activity. This is a limitation of the [[filtered back projection]] reconstruction algorithm. [[Iterative reconstruction]] is an alternative algorithm that is growing in importance, as it is less sensitive to artifacts and can also correct for attenuation and depth dependent blurring. Furthermore, iterative algorithms can be made more efficacious using the [[Superiorization]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.3934/ipi.2014.8.223 | year=2014| volume=8 | vauthors = Luo,S, Zhou,T|title=Superiorization of EM algorithm and its application in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) | journal=Inverse Problems and Imaging | pages=88–97| arxiv=1209.6116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attenuation of the gamma rays within the patient can lead to significant underestimation of activity in deep tissues, compared to superficial tissues. Approximate correction is possible, based on relative position of the activity, and optimal correction is obtained with measured attenuation values. Modern SPECT equipment is available with an integrated X-ray CT scanner. As X-ray CT images are an attenuation map of the tissues, this data can be incorporated into the SPECT reconstruction to correct for attenuation. It also provides a precisely [[Image registration|registered]] CT image, which can provide additional anatomical information.

Scatter of the gamma rays as well as the random nature of gamma rays can also lead to the degradation of quality of SPECT images and cause loss of resolution. Scatter correction and resolution recovery are also applied to improve resolution of SPECT images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3134425_Three-dimensional_restoration_of_single_photon_emission_computed_tomography_images|title= D.

==SPECT/CT==
In some cases a SPECT gamma scanner may be built to operate with a [[x-ray computed tomography|conventional CT scanner]], with coregistration of images. As in [[PET-CT|PET/CT]], this allows location of tumors or tissues which may be seen on SPECT scintigraphy, but are difficult to locate precisely with regard to other anatomical structures. Such scans are most useful for tissues outside the brain, where location of tissues may be far more variable. For example, SPECT/CT may be used in [[sestamibi parathyroid scan]] applications, where the technique is useful in locating ectopic parathyroid adenomas which may not be in their usual locations in the thyroid gland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18997051 | doi=10.2967/jnumed.108.054858 | volume=49 | title=Preoperative 123I/99mTc-sestamibi subtraction SPECT and SPECT/CT in primary hyperparathyroidism | author=Neumann DR, Obuchowski NA, Difilippo FP | journal=J Nucl Med | pages=2012–7 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tennessee Ernie Ford 1957.JPG|thumb|[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s version of "Sixteen Tons" was a number-one hit in the United States.]]

"'''Sixteen Tons'''" is a song written by [[Merle Travis]] about a [[coal mining|coal miner]], based on life in coal mines in [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="ernieford.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/SIXTEENTONS.html |title=Sixteen Tons |website=Ernieford.com |date=1956-07-29 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merle Travis|Travis]] first recorded the song at the Radio Recorders Studio B in Hollywood, California on August 8, 1946. Cliffie Stone played bass on the recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2010/03/merle-travis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519095032/http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/2010/03/merle-travis.html |archivedate=May 19, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released in July 1947 by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] on Travis' album ''[[Folk Songs of the Hills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Billboard |date=June 28, 1947|title= Advance Record Releases| page= 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song became a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]].

The line "You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt" came from a letter written by Travis' brother John.&lt;ref name="ernieford.com"/&gt; Another line came from their father, a coal miner, who would say: "I can't afford to die. I owe my soul to the [[company store]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=LIFE |date=December 5, 1955 |title=You Load 16 Tons... Coal Mine Song Is a Gold Mine| page= 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1955 version recorded by [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] reached number one in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts,&lt;ref name=pc9/&gt; while another version by [[Frankie Laine]] 1956 was released only in Western Europe, where it gave Ford's version competition.

On March 25, 2015, Ford's version of the song was inducted into the [[National Recording Registry|Library of Congress's National Recording Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2015/15-041.html | title=National Recording Registry To "Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive" | work=the Library of Congress | date=25 March 2015 | accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
The sole authorship of "Sixteen Tons" is attributed to [[Merle Travis]] on all recordings&lt;ref name=pc9/&gt; beginning with Travis' own 1946 record and is registered with [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as a Merle Travis composition. [[George S. Davis]], a [[folk singer]] and songwriter who had been a Kentucky coal miner, claimed on a 1966 recording for [[Folkways Records]] to have written the song as "Nine-to-ten tons" in the 1930s;&lt;ref&gt;John Cohen, liner notes to the album ''George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Mining Men'' (Folkways FA 2343, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; he also at different times claimed to have written the song as "Twenty-One Tons".  There is no supporting evidence for Davis' claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.steynonline.com/4434/sixteen-tons|title=SIXTEEN TONS|first=Mark|last=Steyn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis' 1966 recording of his version of the song (with some slightly different lyrics and tune, but titled "Sixteen Tons") appears on the albums ''George Davis: When Kentucky Had No Union Men''&lt;ref&gt;Folkways FA 2343, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Classic Mountain Songs from Smithsonian''.&lt;ref&gt;Folkways Recordings ASIN B000S9DIHK, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Travis, the line "another day older and deeper in debt" from the chorus was a phrase often used by his father, a coal miner himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-travis |title=Full List of Inductees |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106031653/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-travis |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This and the line "I owe my soul to the [[company store]]" are a reference to the [[truck system]] and to [[debt bondage]]. Under this [[scrip]] system, workers were not paid cash; rather they were paid with non-transferable credit vouchers that could be exchanged only for goods sold at the company store. This made it impossible for workers to store up cash savings. Workers also usually lived in company-owned dormitories or houses, the rent for which was automatically deducted from their pay. In the United States the truck system and associated debt bondage persisted until the strikes of the newly formed [[United Mine Workers]] and affiliated [[labour union|unions]] forced an end to such practices.

[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] recorded "Sixteen Tons" in 1955 as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of his cover of the [[Moon Mullican]] standard "[[You Don't Have to Be a Baby to Cry]]". With Ford's snapping fingers and a unique clarinet-driven pop arrangement, it quickly became a million seller.&lt;ref name=pc9&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|9|2|Merle Travis &amp; Ernie Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hit [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[country music]] chart in November and held the No. 1 position for ten weeks, then crossed over and held the number 1 position on the pop music chart for eight weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Ace | last= Collins| year= 1996| title= The Stories Behind Country Music's All-time Greatest: 100 Songs| publisher= The Berkeley Publishing Group| location=New York| pages= 91–93| isbn=1-57297-072-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; besting the competing version by [[Johnny Desmond]].

==Structure==
Skills Development Scotland has a presence in most major towns across Scotland.

==The Big Plus==
The Big Plus is an awareness raising campaign in [[Scotland]] targeting adults who might be unable to achieve their aspirations due to a lack of literacy and/or numeracy skills. Formerly part of the Scottish University for Industry, it is now part of Skills Development Scotland.

Adults who respond to the media promotion are put in touch with a local learning provider where they are invited to participate in a program of personal, dedicated learning activities at a local centre. The program aims to help participants reach a level of skills that will enable them to actively engage, with confidence, in personal, family, community and work life. Learning programs are provided by Scottish [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]] and are free to resident applicants.

{{Network Science}}
A '''social network ''' is a [[social structure]] made up of a set of [[social]] actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] ties, and other [[Social relation|social interaction]]s between actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.&lt;ref name="WF94CH1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wasserman |first1=Stanley | author-link1= Stanley Wasserman|last2=Faust |first2=Katherine |year=1994 |title=Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications |isbn=9780521387071 |chapter=Social Network Analysis in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |pages=1–27 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of these structures uses [[social network analysis]] to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.

Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field which emerged from [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], [[statistics]], and [[graph theory]]. [[Georg Simmel]] authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott |first1=W.

Together with other [[complex network]]s, it forms part of the nascent field of [[network science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science |year=2009 |volume=323 |number=5916 |pages=892–895 |doi=10.1126/science.1165821 |pmid=19213908 |title=Network Analysis in the Social Sciences |first1=Stephen P. |last1=Borgatti |first2=Ajay |last2=Mehra |first3=Daniel J. |last3=Brass |first4=Giuseppe |last4=Labianca|bibcode=2009Sci...323..892B |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World |first1=David |last1=Easley |first2=Jon |last2=Kleinberg |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |chapter=Overview |pages=1–20 |isbn=978-0-521-19533-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Barabasi Albert model.gif|thumb|left|Evolution graph of a social network: [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási model]].]]

The social network is a [[Scientific theory|theoretical]] [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] useful in the [[social sciences]] to study relationships between individuals, [[social groups|groups]], [[formal organizations|organizations]], or even entire [[society|societies]] ([[social unit]]s, see [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation]]). The term is used to describe a [[social structure]] determined by such [[social interactions|interactions]]. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational.  An [[axiom]] of the social network approach to understanding [[social interaction]] is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that [[Agency (sociology)|individual agency]] is often ignored&lt;ref name="jscott"&gt;Scott, John P. (2000). ''Social Network Analysis: A Handbook'' (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; although this may not be the case in practice (see [[agent-based model]]ing). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, [[Network science|network analytics]] are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[information science]], [[organizational studies]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[sociolinguistics]].

==History==
In the late 1890s, both [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of [[social group]]s. Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag. (Translated, 1957 by Charles Price Loomis as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile (1893). ''De la division du travail social: étude sur l'organisation des sociétés supérieures'', Paris: F. Alcan. (Translated, 1964, by Lewis A. Coser as ''The Division of Labor in Society'', New York: Free Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Simmel]], writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg (1908). ''Soziologie'', Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently.&lt;ref name=jscott /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a historical overview of the development of social network analysis, see: {{cite book|authors=Carrington, Peter J. &amp; Scott, John|chapter=Introduction|title=The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis| publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84787-395-8|page=1|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2chSmLzClXgC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the diagram in {{cite book|author=Scott, John|title=Social Network Analysis: A Handbook|publisher=Sage|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7619-6339-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww3_bKcz6kgC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], in the 1930s, [[Jacob L. Moreno]] began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see [[sociometry]]). In [[anthropology]], the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] work of [[Bronislaw Malinowski]],&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw (1913). ''The Family Among the Australian Aborigines: A Sociological Study''.

F. Nadel]] codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, S. F. 1957. ''The Theory of Social Structure''. London: Cohen and West.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociology]], the early (1930s) work of [[Talcott Parsons]] set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949). ''The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of European Writers''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Talcott (1951). ''The Social System''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist [[Peter Blau]] provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on [[social exchange theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1956). ''Bureaucracy in Modern Society''. New York: Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1960). "A Theory of Social Integration". ''The American Journal of Sociology'', (65)6: 545–556, (May).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Peter (1964). ''Exchange and Power in Social Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist [[Harrison White]] and his students at the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Harvard University Department of Social Relations]]. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were [[Charles Tilly]], who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and [[Stanley Milgram]], who developed the "six degrees of separation" thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix14/sem-14-05.html |title=The Networked Individual: A Profile of Barry Wellman |author=Bernie Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Granovetter]]&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Granovetter | first1 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Introduction for the French Reader | url = | journal = Sociologica | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barry Wellman]]&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (1988). "Structural analysis: From method and metaphor to theory and substance". Pp. 19-61 in B. Wellman and S. D. Berkowitz (eds.) ''Social Structures: A Network Approach'', Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are among the former students of White who elaborated and championed the analysis of social networks.&lt;ref name="Introduction for the French Reader"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, Nicholas.

"Structural Analysis: From Method and Metaphor to Theory and Substance". pp. 19–61 in ''Social Structures: A Network Approach'', edited by Barry Wellman and S. D. Berkowitz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as [[Duncan J. Watts]], [[Albert-László Barabási]], [[Peter Bearman]], [[Nicholas A. Christakis]], [[James H. Fowler]], and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as "digital traces" regarding face-to-face networks.

[[File:Social Network Diagram (large).svg|right|thumb|Centrality]]
In general, social networks are [[self-organization|self-organizing]], [[emergence|emergent]], and [[social complexity|complex]], such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási and Duncan J. Watts (2006). ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks'' (Princeton Studies in Complexity). Oxford: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = Barry | year = 2008 | title = Review: The development of social network analysis: A study in the sociology of science | url = | journal = Contemporary Sociology | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 221–222 | doi=10.1177/009430610803700308}}&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Stanley Wasserman; Katherine|title=Social network analysis : methods and applications|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521382694|edition=Reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of, for example, all [[interpersonal relationships]] in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much [[Information theory|information]] as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.&lt;ref name="Kadu12"&gt;Kadushin, C. (2012). ''Understanding social networks: Theories, concepts, and findings''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Granovetter, M.|title= Network sampling: Some first steps| year=1976 |pages=1287–1303 |volume=81| issue=6 |journal= American Journal of Sociology | doi=10.1086/226224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although [[level of analysis|levels of analysis]] are not necessarily [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], there are three general levels into which networks may fall: [[Microsociology|micro-level]], [[wikt:meso-|meso-level]], and [[Macrosociology|macro-level]].

===Micro level===
At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, [[Snowball sampling|snowballing]] as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.

'''Dyadic level''': A [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on [[Structural functionalism|structure]] of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), [[social equality]], and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].

'''Triadic level''': Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a [[Triadic relation|triad]]. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as [[Independence number|balance]] and [[Vertex-transitive graph|transitivity]], as well as [[social equality]] and tendencies toward [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity/mutuality]].&lt;ref name="Kadu12"/&gt; In the [[balance theory]] of [[Fritz Heider]] the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous [[love triangle]] is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of [[signed graph]]s.

'''Actor level''': The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an "actor" or "ego". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, [[centrality]], [[wikt:prestige|prestige]] and roles such as [[isolates|isolates, liaisons]], and [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]].&lt;ref name="Jone11"/&gt; Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of [[psychology]] or [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], [[ethnographic]] [[kinship]] analysis or other [[genealogy|genealogical]] studies of relationships between individuals.

'''Subset level''': [[Subset]] levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] and reachability, [[cliques]], [[Cohesion (social policy)|cohesive]] subgroups, or other [[Group action (sociology)|group actions]] or [[Group behaviour|behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title="Graph Theoretical Approaches to Social Network Analysis". in Computational Complexity: Theory, Techniques, and Applications (Robert A. Meyers, ed.) | publisher=Springer | author=de Nooy, Wouter |year=2012 | pages=2864–2877 | isbn=978-1-4614-1800-9|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-1800-9_176| chapter=Social Network Analysis, Graph Theoretical Approaches to }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meso level===
In general, meso-level theories begin with a [[Sample population|population]] size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro-level networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedström | first1 = Peter | last2 = Sandell | first2 = Rickard | last3 = Stern | first3 = Charlotta | year = 2000 | title = Mesolevel Networks and the Diffusion of Social Movements: The Case of the Swedish Social Democratic Party | url = http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/hedstrom/ajs3.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 145–172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Social Red.jpg|thumb|right|Social network diagram, meso-level]]

'''Organizations''': Formal [[organizations]] are [[social group]]s that distribute tasks for a collective [[goal]].&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riketta | first1 = M. | last2 = Nienber | first2 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Multiple identities and work motivation: The role of perceived compatibility between nested organizational units | url = | journal = British Journal of Management | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = S61–77 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[Informal organization|informal]] relationships. Intra-organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi-autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a workgroup level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures.&lt;ref name="Riketta, M. 2007"/&gt;  Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirado|first=Hirokazu|last2=Christakis|first2=Nicholas A|title=Locally noisy autonomous agents improve global human coordination in network experiments|journal=Nature|volume=545|issue=7654|pages=370–374|doi=10.1038/nature22332|pmid=28516927|pmc=5912653|bibcode=2017Natur.545..370S|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randomly distributed networks''': [[Exponential random graph models]] of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]]-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] and [[Transitive set|transitivity]], and at the node-level, [[homophily]] and [[Attribute-value system|attribute]]-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about [[Dependency graph|dependencies]] among network ties. [[Parameter]]s are given in terms of the prevalence of small [[Induced subgraph|subgraph]] configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro-networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cranmer | first1 = Skyler J. | last2 = Desmarais | first2 = Bruce A. | year = 2011 | title = Inferential Network Analysis with Exponential Random Graph Models | url = | journal = Political Analysis | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 66–86 | doi=10.1093/pan/mpq037| citeseerx = 10.1.1.623.751 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scale-free network sample.png|thumb|right|Examples of a random network and a scale-free network. Each graph has 32 nodes and 32 links. Note the "hubs" (shaded) in the scale-free diagram (on the right).]]

'''Scale-free networks''': A [[scale-free network]] is a [[complex network|network]] whose [[degree distribution]] follows a [[power law]], at least [[asymptotic]]ally. In [[network theory]] a scale-free ideal network is a [[random network]] with a [[degree distribution]] that unravels the size distribution of social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moreira, André A., Demétrius R. Paula, Raimundo N. Costa Filho, José S. Andrade, Jr. |title=Competitive cluster growth in complex networks |year=2006 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.73.065101 |pmid=16906890 |journal=Physical Review E |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=065101 |arxiv=cond-mat/0603272 |bibcode=2006PhRvE..73f5101M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale-free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] with a [[Maximum degree|degree]] that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called "hubs", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the [[clustering coefficient]] distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a [[power law]].&lt;ref&gt;Barabási, Albert-László (2003). ''Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life''. New York: Plum.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási]] model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale-free network.

===Macro level===
Rather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as [[economic]] or other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfer]] interactions over a large [[Sample population|population]].

[[File:Diagram of a social network.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram: section of a large-scale social network]]

'''Large-scale networks''': [[Large-scale macroeconometric model|Large-scale network]] is a term somewhat synonymous with "macro-level" as used, primarily, in [[social science|social]] and [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] sciences, in [[economics]]. Originally, the term was used extensively in the [[computer sciences]] (see [[Network mapping#Large-scale mapping project|large-scale network mapping]]).

'''Complex networks''': Most larger social networks display features of [[social complexity]], which involves substantial non-trivial features of [[network topology]], with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, [[complexity science]], [[dynamical system]] and [[chaos theory]]), as do [[biological]], and [[Computer network|technological networks]]. Such [[complex network]] features include a heavy tail in the [[degree distribution]], a high [[clustering coefficient]], [[assortativity]] or disassortativity among vertices, [[community structure]] (see [[stochastic block model]]), and [[hierarchy|hierarchical structure]]. In the case of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency-directed]] networks these features also include [[Reciprocity in network|reciprocity]], triad significance profile (TSP, see [[network motif]]), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as [[lattice graph|lattices]] and [[random graph]]s, do not show these features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strogatz, Steven H.|year=2001|title=Exploring complex networks|journal=Nature|volume=410|pages=268–276|doi=10.1038/35065725|pmid=11258382|issue=6825|bibcode=2001Natur.410..268S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical links==

===Imported theories===
Various theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are [[Graph theory]], [[Balance theory]], [[Social comparison theory]], and more recently, the [[Social identity approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Kilduff, M., Tsai, W. |year=2003 |title= Social networks and organisations |publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous theories===
Few complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are [[role theory|Structural Role Theory]] and Heterophily Theory.

The basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called "the strength of weak ties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Granovetter, M. |year=1973 |title= The strength of weak ties |journal= American Journal of Sociology |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages= 1360–1380 |doi=10.1086/225469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural holes==
In the context of networks, [[social capital]] exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes and Good Ideas|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2004|doi=10.1086/421787|volume=110|issue=2|pages=349–399|citeseerx=10.1.1.388.2251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burt|first=Ronald|title=Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; Thus, a network that bridges [[structural holes]] will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt;

Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer [[Information theory|information]] benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters.&lt;ref name="Burt 1992"/&gt; For example, in [[Business networking|business network]]s, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of [[Interpersonal ties|weak ties]], which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment.

==Research clusters==

===Communication===
[[Communication Studies]] are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[information science]], [[biology]], [[political science]], and [[economics]] as well as [[rhetoric]], [[literary studies]], and [[semiotics]]. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network.

===Community===
In J.A. Barnes' day, a "[[community]]" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended "online" communities developed through [[telecommunications]] devices and [[social network services]]. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using [[network science]] methods. [[Community development]] studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods.

===Complex networks===
[[Complex networks]] require methods specific to modelling and interpreting [[social complexity]] and [[complex adaptive system]]s, including techniques of [[dynamic network analysis]].
Mechanisms such as [[Dual-phase evolution#social networks|Dual-phase evolution]] explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks.

===Criminal networks===
In [[criminology]] and [[urban sociology]], much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, Andrew Papachristos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papachristos |first=Andrew |year=2009 |title=Murder by Structure: Dominance Relations and the Social Structure of Gang Homicide |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=74–128 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.855304 |url=http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407094725/http://www.papachristos.org/Publications_2_files/ajs_final_version.pdf |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has studied gang murders as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength.

===Diffusion of innovations===
[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of ideas and innovations]] studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one [[culture]] and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become "early adopters" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation.

===Demography===
In [[demography]], the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents.

===Economic sociology===
The field of [[sociology]] focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, [[economic sociology]] considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through [[social capital]] and social "markets". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark (2005). "The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes". ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4134991 19(1): 33–50]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Analysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into [[health care analytics]], not only in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies but also in models of [[Health Communication|patient communication]] and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and [[health care systems|systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Judith and Bernice Pescosolido (2002). ''Social Networks and Health''. Boston, MA: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human ecology===
[[Human ecology]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], and natural [[ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Crona, Beatrice and Klaus Hubacek (eds.) (2010). [http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/view.php?sf=48 "Special Issue: Social network analysis in natural resource governance"]. ''Ecology and Society'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernstson, Henrich (2010). "Reading list: Using social network analysis (SNA) in social-ecological studies". [http://rs.resalliance.org/2010/11/03/reading-list-using-social-network-analysis-sna-in-social-ecological-studies/ ''Resilience Science'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and linguistics===
Studies of [[language]] and [[linguistics]], particularly [[evolutionary linguistics]], focus on the development of [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic forms]] and transfer of changes, [[Phonology|sounds]] or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in [[language shift]], as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire.

===Literary networks===
In the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anheier | first1 = H. K. | last2 = Romo | first2 = F. P. | year = 1995 | title = Forms of capital and social structure of fields: examining Bourdieu's social topography | url = | journal = American Journal of Sociology | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 859–903 | doi=10.1086/230603}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Nooy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Nooy | first1 = W | year = | title = Fields and networks: Correspondence analysis and social network analysis in the framework of Field Theory | url = | journal = Poetics | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 305–327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Senekal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Senekal | first1 = B. A. | year = 2012 | title = Die Afrikaanse literêre sisteem: ŉ Eksperimentele benadering met behulp van Sosiale-netwerk-analise (SNA) | url = | journal = LitNet Akademies | volume = 9 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of [[Even-Zohar]], can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using [[Computer graphics (computer science)|visualization]] from SNA.

===Organizational studies===
Research studies of [[Formal organization|formal]] or [[informal organization]] [[Social relation|relationships]], [[organizational communication]], [[economics]], [[economic sociology]], and other [[resource]] [[Transfer function|transfers]]. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many [[Interlocking directorate|informal connections]] that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Podolny | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Baron | first2 = J. N. | year = 1997 | title = Resources and relationships: Social networks and mobility in the workplace | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 62 | issue = 5| pages = 673–693 | doi=10.2307/2657354| jstor = 2657354 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.114.6822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intra-organizational networks have been found to affect [[organizational commitment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = J. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Exploring the role of social networks in affective organizational commitment: Network centrality, strength of ties, and structural holes | url = | journal = The American Review of Public Administration | volume = 41 | issue = 2| pages = 205–223 | doi=10.1177/0275074010373803}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[organizational identification]],&lt;ref name="Jone11"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = C. | last2 = Volpe | first2 = E.H. | year = 2011 | title = Organizational identification: Extending our understanding of social identities through social networks | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 413–434 | doi=10.1002/job.694}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organizational citizenship behavior|interpersonal citizenship behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowler | first1 = W.

===Social capital===
[[Social capital]] is a form of [[Capital (economics)|economic]] and [[cultural capital]] in which social networks are central, [[Stock and flow|transactions]] are marked by [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[cooperation]], and [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Agent (economics)|agents]] produce [[goods and services]] not mainly for themselves, but for a [[common good]].

Social capital is a sociological concept about the value of [[social relation]]s and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebastián|first=Valenzuela|author2=Namsu Park |author3=Kerk F. Kee |title=Is There Social Capital in a Social Network Site? Facebook Use and College Students' Life Satisfaction, Trust, and Participation|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2009|volume=14|issue=4|pages=875–901|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Connectivity in America: Changes in Adult Friendship Network Size from 2002 to 2007 |author1=Wang, Hua  |author2=Barry Wellman  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=American Behavioral Scientist | year=2010 | volume=53 | issue=8 | pages=1148–1169 | doi=10.1177/0002764209356247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.&lt;ref name="GaudeulGiannetti2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaudeul|first1=Alexia|last2=Giannetti|first2=Caterina|title=The role of reciprocation in social network formation, with an application to LiveJournal|journal=Social Networks|volume=35|issue=3|year=2013|pages=317–330|issn=03788733|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2013.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network position and benefits===
In many [[Formal organizations|organizations]], members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a "broker" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist [[John Stuart Mill]], writes, "it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves.... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John|title=Principles of Political Economy|year=1909|publisher=William J Ashley|location=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement.

A social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Heidi|author2=Eccles, Robert |title=Eden McCallum: A Network Based Consulting Firm|journal=Harvard Business School Review|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts.

There has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are "dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values" of such organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao, Zhixing; Tsui, Anne (2007). "When Brokers May Not Work: The Cultural Contingency of [http://iniciarsesionentrar.com/facebook/ Social] Capital in Chinese High-tech Firms". ''Administrative Science Quarterly''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm-wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted.&lt;ref name="Burt 2004"/&gt; Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career.

===Social media===
{{main article|Social media}}
[[Computer network]]s combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Encyclopedia of Media Effects|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi|date=2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118783764|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0170}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A relationship over a computerized [[social networking service]] can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a [[computer mediated communication]] context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of [[electronic commerce]], information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the "real" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Studying Online Social Networks | author=Garton, Laura, [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], and [[Barry Wellman]] | journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |date=23 June 2006 | volume=3 | issue=1 |pages = 0| doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.1997.tb00062.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social network analysis]] methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication.

In addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of [[social media]] has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Wei | last2 = Joseph | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Liu | first3 = Huan | last4 = Carley | first4 = Kathleen M. | year = 2016 | title = Exploring Characteristics of Suspended Users and Network Stability on Twitter | url = | journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the national organization, there are thirteen regional chapters throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Society for Industrial Archeology (SIA) | publisher = Society for Industrial Archeology | url = http://www.sia-web.org/about/ | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Since its founding in October 1971, SIA members have gathered at an annual conference, which also serves as the annual business meeting required by its bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hyde | first = Charles K. | title = The Birth of the SIA and Reminiscences by Some of its Founders | journal = [[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]] | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–16 | year = 1991 | jstor = 40968216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual conference is typically held each spring. The Fall Tour, a second annual gathering usually held in September or October, began in 1972. Both annual events feature visits to local industrial sites, both active and historical.  The conference additionally includes a day of paper sessions.  Industrial heritage study tours to other countries began in 1990 and occur on an irregular schedule.

SIA produces two official publications, the formal, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] ''[[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]]'' twice a year and the less formal quarterly ''Society for Industrial Archeology Newsletter (SIAN).''  The annual conference is typically accompanied by a custom guidebook profiling local industrial and cultural sites.  In addition, SIA produces occasional publications on special topics.

==Newsletter==
The ''Society for Industrial Archeology Newsletter (SIAN)'' ([[ISSN]] {{ISSN search link|0160-1067}}) is the Society's official [[newsletter]], published quarterly. ''SIAN'' publishes articles about recent events, summaries of the Society's annual conferences and fall tours, news about local chapters, brief abstracts of articles on industrial archeology-related subjects, and other notes and queries.

The first issue of ''SIAN'' was published in January 1972 and reported on the Society's founding. Volumes 1 through 9 consisted of six issues per calendar year, not including two special supplemental issues published in 1972. The current quarterly publication schedule with Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall issues began with Volume 10 in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SIA Newsletter |publisher=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.sia-web.org/publications/sia-newsletter/ |accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociology of philosophy''' is a subdivision of [[sociology]] that seeks to understand the influence of [[philosophy]] in the society, the social conditions in the intellectual activity and effects of philosophy, and the social configurations and processes of philosophical research. Sociology of philosophy, as an empirical sociological branch based on theory, was developed in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heidegren|first1=Carl-Göran|last2=Lundberg|first2=Henrik|title=Towards a Sociology of Philosophy|journal=Acta Sociologica|date=2010|volume=53|issue=1|pages=3–18|doi=10.1177/0001699309357831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spatial relation''',&lt;ref&gt;J Freeman (1975), "The modelling of spatial relations", Computer Graphics and Image Processing,  Elsevier. DOI: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0146-664X(75)80007-4 10.1016/S0146-664X(75)80007-4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;D. M. Mark and M. J. Egenhofer (1994), "Modeling Spatial Relations Between Lines and Regions: Combining Formal Mathematical Models and Human Subjects Testing". [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.25.9493&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies how some object is located in space in relation to some reference object. When the reference object is much bigger than the object to locate, the latter is often represented by a point. The reference object is often represented by a [[bounding box]]&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5 

Spatial Behaviour Modelling of Unauthorised Housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka | Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Anatomical terms of location|Anatomy]] it might be the case that a spatial relation is not fully applicable. Thus, the degree of applicability is defined which specifies from 0 till 100% how strongly a spatial relation holds. Often researchers concentrate on defining the applicability function for various spatial relations.

In [[spatial database]]s and [[Geospatial topology]] the ''spatial relations'' are used for ''spatial analysis'' and constraint specifications.

In [[cognitive development]] for walk and for catch objects, or [[Water-level task|for understand objects-behaviour]]; in [[Automated Guided Vehicle#Natural Features Navigation|robotic Natural Features Navigation]]; and many other areas, ''spatial relations'' plays a central role.

Commonly used types of ''spatial relations'' are: ''topological'', ''directional'' and ''distance'' relations.

== Topological relations ==
[[File:TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png|thumb|400px|Examples of topological spatial relations.]]
:&lt;small&gt;Main article [[DE-9IM#Spatial predicates|DE-9IM]].&lt;/small&gt;

The [[DE-9IM]] model expresses important ''space relations'' which are invariant to [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] transformations.

For any two spatial objects ''a'' and ''b'', that can be points, lines and/or polygonal areas, there are 9 relations derived from ''DE-9IM'':
{| class="wikitable"
!valign="top"|''Equals''
| ''a'' = ''b''&lt;br/&gt;Topologically [[Equality (relational operator)|equal]].  Also (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a'') ∧ (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b'')

|-
!valign="top"|''Disjoint''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ∅ &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' and ''b'' are disjoint, have no point in common. They form a set of  [[Disconnected (topology)#Disconnected spaces|disconnected]] geometries.

|-
!valign="middle"|''Intersects'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅

|-
!valign="top"|''Touches''
|(''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅) ∧ (''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; = ∅) &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' touches ''b'', they have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points.

|-
!valign="top"|''Contains''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b''

|-
!valign="top"|''Covers''
|''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b'' = ''b'' &lt;br/&gt; ''b'' lies in the interior of ''a'' (extends ''Contains''). Other definitions: "no points of ''b'' lie in the exterior of ''a''", or "Every point of ''b'' is a point of (the interior of) ''a''".

|-
!valign="middle"|''CoveredBy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
|''Covers(b,a)''

|-
!valign="top"|''Within'' 
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a''
|}

== Directional relations ==
Directional relations can again be differentiated into external directional relations and internal directional relations. An internal directional relation specifies where an object is located inside the reference object while an external relations specifies where the object is located outside of the reference objects.

*Examples for internal directional relations: left; on the back; athwart, abaft
*Examples for external directional relations: on the right of; behind; in front of, abeam, astern

== Distance relations ==
Distance relations specify how far is the object away from the reference object.
*Examples are: at; nearby; in the vicinity; far away

== Relations by class ==
Reference objects represented by a [[bounding box]] or another kind of "spatial envelope" that encloses its borders, can be denoted with the maximum number of [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] of this envelope:  &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Point (geometry)|punctual objects]], &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Line (geometry)|linear objects]], &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; for [[area|planar objects]], &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; for [[volume|volumetric objects]]. So, any object, in a [[2D geometric model|2D modeling]], can by  classified as ''point'', ''line'' or ''area'' according to its delimitation. Then, a ''type of spatial relation'' can be expressed by the class of the objects that participate in the relation:

* [[Spatial relation/point-point|point-point relations]]: ...
* [[Spatial relation/point-line|point-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/point-area|point-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-line|line-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-area|line-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/area-area|area-area relations]]:

More ''complex'' modeling schemas can represent an object as a composition of ''simple sub-objects''. Examples: represent in a [[astronomical map]] a star by a ''point'' and a [[binary star]] by ''two points'';  represent in [[geographical map]] a river with a ''line'', for its  [[river source|source]] [[stream]], and with an strip-''area'', for the rest of the river.  These schemas can use the above classes, uniform composition classes (''multi-point'', ''multi-line'' and ''multi-area'') and heterogeneous composition (''points''+''lines'' as "object of dimension 1", ''points''+''lines''+''areas'' as "object of dimension 2").

Two internal components of a ''complex object'' can express (the above) [[Binary operation|binary relations]] between them, and [[Ternary operation|ternary relations]], using the  whole object as a [[frame of reference]]. Some relations can be expressed by an abstract component, such the [[center of mass]] of the binary star, or a center line of the river.

== Temporal references ==
For human thinking, spatial relations include qualities like size, distance, volume, order, and, also, time:
{{Quotation|
Time is spatial: it requires understanding ordered sequences such as days of the week, months of the year, and seasons. A person with spatial difficulties may have problems understanding “yesterday,” “last week,” and “next month”. 
Time expressed digitally is just as spatial as time expressed by moving clock hands, but digital clocks remove the need to translate the hand position into numbers.
|Stockdale and Possin}}
Stockdale and Possin&lt;ref&gt;C. Stockdale and C. Possin (1998) [http://impactofspecialneeds.weebly.com/uploads/3/4/1/9/3419723/spatial.pdf Spatial Relations and Learning].&lt;/ref&gt;  discusses the many ways in which people with difficulty establishing spatial and temporal relationships can face problems in ordinary situations.

[[File:Starburst in a Dwarf Irregular Galaxy.jpg|thumb|Starburst in [[NGC 1569]] a Dwarf Irregular Galaxy ([[NASA]] photo).]]
A '''starburst''' is an astrophysical process that involves [[star formation]] occurring at a rate that is large compared to the rate that is typically observed. This starburst activity will consume the available interstellar gas supply over a timespan that is much shorter than the lifetime of the galaxy. For example, the nebula [[NGC 6334]] has a star formation rate estimated to be 3600 [[Solar Mass]]es per million years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physastro.iastate.edu/research/highlights/ngc-6334-mini-starburst-region|title=NGC 6334 – A Mini Starburst Region {{!}} Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy|website=www.physastro.iastate.edu|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the star formation rate of the entire [[Milky Way]] of about seven million [[solar mass]]es per million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first2=Barbara|last2=Whitney|title=The present-day star formation rate of the Milky-Way determined from Spitzer detected young stellar objects|date=2010|last1=Robitaille|first1=Thomas|arxiv=1001.3672|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/710/1/L11|volume=710|issue=1|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|pages=L11–L15|bibcode = 2010ApJ...710L..11R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high amount of star formation a starburst is usually accompanied by much higher gas pressure and a larger ratio of [[Hydrogen cyanide]] to [[Carbon monoxide]] [[Emission-line]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s than are usually observed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxies in the Universe|last2=Gallagher III|first2=John|date=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-67186-6|location=New York|page=289|last1=Sparke|first1=Linda|authorlink2=John Gallagher III}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:30 Doradus, Tarantula Nebula.jpg|thumb|[[Tarantula Nebula]], the largest starburst region in the local group.]]
Starburst can occur in entire galaxies or just regions of space. A starburst region is a region of space that is undergoing a large amount of star formation. For example, the [[Tarantula Nebula]] is a [[Nebula]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] which has one of the highest star formation rates in the [[Local Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lebouteiller|first=V.|last2=Bernard-Salas|first2=J.|last3=Brandl|first3=B.|last4=Whelan|first4=D.

Starburst regions can occur in different shapes, for example in [[Messier 94]] the inner ring is a star burst region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2004|title=The Inner Ring of NGC 4736: Star Formation on a Resonant Pattern|journal=[[Astronomical Journal]]|volume=127|issue=1|pages=58–74|bibcode=2004AJ....127...58M|doi=10.1086/380610|author=C.

Alfonso}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Messier 82]] has a starburst core of about 600 parsec in diameter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Starbursts are common during galaxy mergers such as the [[Antennae Galaxies]]. In the case of mergers the starburst can either be local or galaxy wide depending on the galaxies and how they are merging.

Each book has a different protagonist, but is set in the same futuristic era.

==Plot overview==
===''The Giver''===
{{Main article|The Giver}}
''The Giver'' is a 1993 American children's novel (generally young adult or older) set in a society that is at first presented as a utopian society but gradually appears more and more dystopian. The novel follows a boy, Jonas, through the twelfth and thirteenth years of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness," a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness in case the memories that others lack are ever needed to aid decisions. Jonas learns the truth about his Utopian society and struggles with its weight. The Community lacks any color, memory, climate, and terrain; that Sameness emphasizes the utopian qualities of the Community.

''The Giver'' won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 10 million copies. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, it is a part of many middle school reading lists, but it is also on many challenging book lists and appeared on the [[American Library Association]]'s list of most challenged books of the 1990s.

The novel forms a loose quartet with three other books set in the same future era: ''Gathering Blue'' (2000), ''Messenger'' (2004), and ''Son'' (2012).

===''Gathering Blue''===
{{Main article|Gathering Blue}}
''Gathering Blue'' is a 2000 children's dystopian novella. It is set in the same future time period and treats some of the same themes.

The central character, Kira, who has a deformed leg, is orphaned and must learn to survive in a society that normally leaves the weak or disabled exposed to die in the fields. Kira's father was apparently mauled by the Beasts at the Field. Kira's mother had died recently from an illness.

Since she is an orphan, Kira needs a reason for the Council of Edifice to keep her in the village, rather than send her to the Field, which is certain death at the hands of The Beast. Kira's mother used to do embroidery for the Council and taught Kira some of her talents. Kira's gift for embroidery convinces the Council to keep her around to mend and update a beautiful robe, which shows the history of their society. In the course of the book, she begins to learn the art of dyeing thread different colors from except for blue, which nobody in her community knows how to make. But only Annabella knows, Kira's mentor. She also learns more about the truth of her village and the terrible secrets it holds. She then finds her father, who tells the truth of what happened to him and about the Village he now lives in.

===''Messenger''===
{{Main article|Messenger (novel)}}
''Messenger'' takes place about eight years after the events of ''The Giver'' and about six years after the events of ''Gathering Blue''. Set in an isolated community, known simply as Village, it focuses on a boy, Matty, who serves as message-bearer through the ominous and lethal Forest, which surrounds the community. This book also tells of the fate of Jonas and Gabe, from 'The Giver''.

===''Son''===
{{Main article|Son (novel)}}
''Son'' follows Claire, the birth mother of Gabriel from ''The Giver'' and her journey to locate her son. Then she finds him.

==Film adaptation==
{{Main article|The Giver (film)}}
A film adaptation of the first book was produced by [[The Weinstein Company]] and [[Walden Media]]. It was released on August 15, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title='The Giver' Film Adaptation to Hit Theaters August 2014|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/giver-film-adaptation-hit-theaters-634759|accessdate=July 10, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred [[Jeff Bridges]] as The Giver, [[Brenton Thwaites]] as Jonas and [[Meryl Streep]] as the Chief Elder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bahr|first=Lindsey|title='The Giver': First Look at Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites in Lois Lowry's classic|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/23/the-giver-first-look/|accessdate=July 10, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism'''" is a well-known&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/fddde450-2521-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0&lt;/ref&gt; 1970 paper by economist [[George Akerlof]] which examines how the quality of goods traded in a market can degrade in the presence of [[information asymmetry]] between buyers and sellers, leaving only "lemons" behind. In American slang, a [[lemon (automobile)|lemon]] is a car that is found to be defective only after it has been bought.

Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a "peach") and a "lemon". Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a "peach" and "lemon" together (''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold "lemons" (since ''p''&lt;sub&gt;lemon&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;) and they will leave the market when they hold "peaches" (since ''p''&lt;sub&gt;peach&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;). Eventually, as enough sellers of "peaches" leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive [[feedback loop]].  

Thus the uninformed buyer's price creates an [[adverse selection]] problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse. 

Akerlof's paper shows how prices can determine the quality of goods traded on the market. Low prices drive away sellers of high-quality goods, leaving only lemons behind. In 2001, Akerlof, along with [[Michael Spence]], and [[Joseph Stiglitz]], jointly received the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], for their research on issues related to asymmetric information.

==The paper==

===Thesis===
[[File:Kovacs special 1968.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Ernie Kovacs]] in a comedic used car skit]]
Akerlof's paper uses the [[market (economics)|market]] for [[used car]]s as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty. A used car is one in which ownership is transferred from one person to another, after a period of use by its first owner and its inevitable wear and tear. There are good used cars ("peaches") and defective used cars ("lemons"), normally as a consequence of several not-always-traceable variables, such as the owner's driving style, quality and frequency of maintenance, and accident history. Because many important mechanical parts and other elements are hidden from view and not easily accessible for inspection, the buyer of a car does not know beforehand whether it is a peach or a lemon. So the buyer's best guess for a given car is that the car is of average quality; accordingly, he/she will be willing to pay for it only the price of a car of known average quality. This means that the owner of a carefully maintained, never-abused, good used car will be unable to get a high enough price to make selling that car worthwhile.

Therefore, owners of good cars will not place their cars on the used car market. The withdrawal of good cars reduces the average quality of cars on the market, causing buyers to revise downward their expectations for any given car. This, in turn, motivates the owners of moderately good cars not to sell, and so on. The result is that a market in which there is [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] with respect to quality shows characteristics similar to those described by [[Gresham's Law]]: the bad drives out the good. (Although Gresham's principle applies more specifically to exchange rates, modified analogies can be drawn.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phlips|first1=Louis|title=The Economics of Price Discrimination|date=June 30, 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521283949|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical abstract of the problem===
Akerlof considers a situation in which demand ''D'' for used cars depends on the cars price ''p'' and quality ''µ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''µ''(''p'') and the supply depends on price alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akerlof |first=George A. |authorlink= |year=1970 |title=The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=[http://www.econ.yale.edu/~dirkb/teach/pdf/akerlof/themarketforlemons.pdf 488–500.]|publisher=The MIT Press |doi=10.2307/1879431}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic equilibrium]] is given by ''S''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''D''(''p'',''µ'') and there are two groups of traders with utilities given by:

: &lt;math&gt;U_1 = M+\sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U_2 = M+\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{3}{2} x_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the consumption of goods other than automobiles, ''x'' the car's quality and ''n'' the number of automobiles. Let ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be income, demand and supply for group&amp;nbsp;''i''. Assuming that utilities are linear, that the traders are [[Von_Neumann–Morgenstern_utility_theorem|Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility]] maximizers and that the price of other ''M'' goods is unitary, the demand ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for cars is ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'' if ''μ''/''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, otherwise null. The demand ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'' if 3''μ''/''2''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''p'', otherwise null. Market demand is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;D(p,\mu)=\begin{cases} \left( Y_2+Y_1 \right)/p &amp; p &lt; \mu, \\ Y_2/p &amp; \mu &lt; p &lt; 3\mu/2, \\ 0 &amp; p &gt; 3\mu/2, \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Group 1 has ''N'' cars to sell with quality between 0 and 2 and group 2 has no cars to sell, therefore ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''pN''/2 and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. For a given price ''p'', average quality is ''p''/2, and therefore&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The market for used cars collapses when there is asymmetric information.

===Asymmetric information===
The paper by Akerlof describes how the interaction between quality heterogeneity and [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] can lead to the disappearance of a market where guarantees are indefinite. In this model, as quality is indistinguishable beforehand by the buyer (due to the asymmetry of information), incentives exist for the seller to pass off low-quality goods as higher-quality ones. The buyer, however, takes this incentive into consideration, and takes the quality of the goods to be uncertain. Only the average quality of the goods will be considered, which in turn will have the side effect that goods that are above average in terms of quality will be driven out of the market. This mechanism is repeated until a [[no-trade equilibrium]] is reached.

As a consequence of the mechanism described in this paper, markets may fail to exist altogether in certain situations involving quality uncertainty. Examples given in Akerlof's paper include the market for used cars, the dearth of formal credit markets in developing countries, and the difficulties that the elderly encounter in buying health insurance. However, not all players in a given market will follow the same rules or have the same aptitude of assessing quality. So there will always be a distinct advantage for some vendors to offer low-quality goods to the less-informed segment of a market that, on the whole, appears to be of reasonable quality and have reasonable guarantees of certainty. This is part of the basis for the idiom [[buyer beware]].

This is likely the basis for the idiom that an [[informed consumer]] is a better consumer. An example of this might be the subjective quality of fine food and wine. Individual consumers know best what they prefer to eat, and quality is almost always assessed in fine establishments by smell and taste before they pay. That is, if a customer in a fine establishment orders a lobster and the meat is not fresh, he can send the lobster back to the kitchen and refuse to pay for it. However, a definition of 'highest quality' for food eludes providers. Thus, a large variety of better-quality and higher-priced restaurants are supported.

===Impact on markets===
The article draws some conclusions about the cost of dishonesty in markets in general:

{{cquote|The cost of dishonesty, therefore, lies not only in the amount by which the purchaser is cheated; the cost also must include the loss incurred from driving legitimate business out of existence.}}

==Critical reception==
George E. Hoffer and Michael D. Pratt state that the “economic literature is divided on whether a lemons market actually exists in used vehicles”. The authors’ research supports the hypothesis that “known defects provisions”, used by US states (e.g., Wisconsin) to regulate used car sales, have been ineffectual, because the quality of used vehicles sold in these states is not significantly better than the vehicles in neighboring states without such consumer protection legislation.&lt;ref name="Hoffer1987"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Hoffer | first = George E. | authorlink = |author2=Pratt, Michael D. | year = 1987 | title = Used vehicles, lemons markets, and Used Car Rules: Some empirical evidence | journal = Journal of Consumer Policy | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 409–414 | doi = 10.1007/BF00411482 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the ''[[American Economic Review]]'' and the ''[[Review of Economic Studies]]'' rejected the paper for "triviality", while the reviewers for ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' rejected it as incorrect, arguing that, if this paper were correct, then no goods could be traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gans |first=Joshua S. |first2=George B. |last2=Shepherd |year=1994 |title=How Are the Mighty Fallen: Rejected Classic Articles by Leading Economists |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=165–179 |doi=10.1257/jep.8.1.165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only on the fourth attempt did the paper get published in ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/akerlof-article.html Writing the &lt;!--sic;the extra "the" is in the source--&gt; “The Market for ‘Lemons’”: A Personal and Interpretive Essay] by George A. Akerlof&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the paper is one of the most-cited papers in modern economic theory and most downloaded economic journal paper of all time in RePEC (more than 8,530 citations in academic papers as of May 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.de/scholar?cites=8622278700871890196&amp;as_sdt=5,24&amp;sciodt=0,24&amp;hl=en&amp;num=100 |title=Citations of Akerlof: The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |accessdate=2011-05-27 |work=[[Google Scholar]] |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has profoundly influenced virtually every field of economics, from industrial organisation and public finance to macroeconomics and contract theory.

===Criticism===
[[Libertarianism|Libertarians]], like William L. Anderson, oppose the regulatory approach proposed by the authors of the paper, observing that some used-car markets haven't broken down even without lemon legislation and that the lemon problem creates entrepreneurial opportunities for alternative marketplaces or customers' knowledgeable friends.&lt;ref&gt;Lemons and the Nobel Prize http://mises.org/library/lemons-and-nobel-prize&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions for a lemon market==
A lemon market will be produced by the following:

# Asymmetry of information, in which no buyers can accurately assess the value of a product through examination before sale is made and all sellers can more accurately assess the value of a product prior to sale
# An incentive exists for the seller to pass off a low-quality product as a higher-quality one
# Sellers have no credible disclosure technology (sellers with a great car have no way to disclose this credibly to buyers)
# Either a continuum of seller qualities exists or the average seller type is sufficiently low (buyers are sufficiently pessimistic about the seller's quality)
# Deficiency of ''effective'' public quality assurances (by reputation or regulation and/or of ''effective'' guarantees/warranties)

==Laws in the United States==
Five years after Akerlof's paper was published, the United States enacted a federal "lemon law" (the [[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]]) that protects citizens of all states. There are also state laws regarding "lemons" which vary by state and may not necessarily cover used or leased vehicles. The rights afforded to consumers by "lemon laws" may exceed the warranties expressed in purchase contracts. These state laws provide remedies to consumers for automobiles that repeatedly fail to meet certain standards of quality and performance. "Lemon law" is the common nickname for these laws, but each state has different names for the laws and acts, which may also cover more than just automobiles. In California and federal law, "Lemon Laws" cover anything mechanical.

The federal "lemon law" also provides that the warrantor may be obligated to pay the attorney fees of the party prevailng in a lemon {{Not a typo|law suit}}, as do most state lemon laws. If a car has to be repaired for the same defect four or more times and the problem is still occurring, the car may be deemed to be "a lemon". The defect must substantially hinder the vehicle's use, value, or safety. Purchasers who knowingly purchase a car in "as is" condition accept the defects and void their rights under the "lemon law".

'''''The World Trade Center Tapestry''''' was a large [[tapestry]] by [[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Royo]].  It was displayed in the lobby of [[2 World Trade Center]] (the South Tower) in [[New York City]] from 1974 until it was destroyed in 2001 by the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]].

Saul Wenegrat, former director of the art program for the [[Port Authority of New York]], had suggested to Miró that he could make a tapestry for the World Trade Center, but the artist declined as he would only make the work with his own hands but had no experience of making a tapestry.  However, after his daughter recovered from an accident in Spain, Miró agreed to make a tapestry for the hospital that had treated her as a token of his gratitude.  Having learned the technique from tapestry maker Josep Royo, Miró made several other tapestries with Royo, including one for the World Trade Center, ''Woman'' for the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]], and one for the [[Fundació Joan Miró]].

The work was an abstract design, with bright blocks of colour, red, green, blue and yellow, with black elements and a light brown background.  Made of wool and hemp, it measured {{convert|20|xx|35|ft|m}} and weighed 4&amp;nbsp;tonnes.  It was completed in 1973, and displayed at a retrospective at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris before being installed in New York in 1974.

He was a leading member of the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]], for whom the works of [[Freud]], [[Marx]], and [[Hegel]] were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the [[culture industry]], his writings—such as ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' (1951) and ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966)—strongly influenced the European [[New Left]].

Amidst the vogue enjoyed by [[existentialism]] and [[positivism]] in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of [[ontology]] and [[empiricism]] through studies of [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Husserl]]. As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] resulted in his studying composition with [[Alban Berg]] of the [[Second Viennese School]], Adorno's commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with [[Thomas Mann]] on the latter's novel ''[[Doctor Faustus (Thomas Mann novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'', while the two men lived in California as exiles during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Working for the newly relocated [[Institute for Social Research]], Adorno collaborated on influential studies of [[authoritarianism]], [[antisemitism]] and [[propaganda]] that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany.

Upon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with [[Karl Popper]] on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of [[Heidegger]]'s language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for [[the Holocaust]], and continued interventions into matters of public policy. As a writer of polemics in the tradition of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture. Adorno's posthumously published ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'', which he planned to dedicate to [[Samuel Beckett]], is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art which attempts to revoke the "fatal separation" of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion.

==Life and career==

===Early years: Frankfurt===
Theodor W. Adorno (alias: Theodor Adorno-Wiesengrund) was born as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on September 11, 1903, the only child of Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund (1870–1946) and Maria Calvelli-Adorno della Piana (1865–1952). His mother, a devout [[Catholic]] from [[Corsica]], was once a professional singer, while his father, an [[assimilated Jew]] who had [[Conversion to Christianity|converted]] to [[Protestantism]], ran a successful wine-export business. Proud of her origins, Maria wanted her son's paternal surname to be supplemented by the addition of her own name: Adorno. Thus his earliest publications carried the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno; upon his application for [[US citizenship]], his name was modified to Theodor W. Adorno.

His childhood was marked by the musical life provided by his mother and aunt: Maria was a singer who could boast of having performed in Vienna at the Imperial Court, while her sister, Agathe, who lived with them, had made a name for herself as both a singer and pianist. He was not only a precocious child but, as he recalled later in life, a child prodigy who could play pieces by [[Beethoven]] on the piano by the time he was twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of six, he attended the Deutschherren middle school before transferring to the Kaiser-Wilhelm [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], where he studied from 1913 to 1921. Prior to his graduation at the top of his class, Adorno was already swept up by the revolutionary mood of the time, as is evidenced by his reading of [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'' that year, as well as by his fascination with [[Ernst Bloch]]'s ''The Spirit of Utopia'', of which he would later write:
{{quote|Bloch's was a philosophy that could hold its head high before the most advanced literature; a philosophy that was not calibrated to the abominable resignation of methodology ... I took this motif so much as my own that I do not believe I have ever written anything without reference to it, either implicit or explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet Adorno's intellectual nonconformism was no less shaped by the repugnance he felt towards the nationalism which swept through the Reich during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Along with future collaborators like [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and Ernst Bloch, Adorno was profoundly disillusioned by the ease with which Germany's intellectual and spiritual leaders—among them [[Max Weber]], [[Max Scheler]], [[Georg Simmel]], as well as his friend [[Siegfried Kracauer]]—came out in support of the war. The younger generation's distrust for traditional knowledge arose from the way in which this tradition had discredited itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Oscar Wiesengrund's firm established close professional and personal ties with the factory of Karplus &amp; Herzberger in Berlin. The eldest daughter of the Karplus family, Margarete, or Gretel, moved in the intellectual circles of Berlin, where she was acquainted with Walter Benjamin, [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Ernst Bloch, each of whom Adorno would become familiar with during the mid-1920s; after fourteen years, Gretel and Theodor were married in 1937.

At the end of his schooldays, Adorno not only benefited from the rich concert offerings of Frankfurt—where one could hear performances of works by Schoenberg, [[Schreker]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Bartók]], [[Busoni]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and [[Hindemith]]—but also began studying music composition at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] while taking private lessons with well-respected composers [[Bernhard Sekles]] and Eduard Jung. At around the same time, he befriended Siegfried Kracauer, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]''{{'}}s literary editor, of whom he would later write:
{{quote|For years Kracauer read [Kant's] ''Critique of Pure Reason'' with me regularly on Saturday afternoons. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that I owe more to this reading than to my academic teachers ... Under his guidance I experienced the work from the beginning not as mere epistemology, not as an analysis of the conditions of scientifically valid judgments, but as a kind of coded text from which the historical situation of spirit could be read, with the vague expectation that in doing so one could acquire something of truth itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leaving gymnasium to study philosophy, psychology and sociology at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in Frankfurt, Adorno continued his readings with Kracauer, turning now to [[Hegel]] and [[Kierkegaard]], and began publishing concert reviews and pieces of music for distinguished journals like the ''Zeitschrift für Musik'', the ''Neue Blätter für Kunst und Literatur'' and later for the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''. In these articles, Adorno championed avant-garde music at the same time as he critiqued the failings of musical modernity, as in the case of Stravinsky's ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'', which he called in 1923 a "dismal Bohemian prank."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early writings, he was unequivocal in his condemnation of performances which either sought or pretended to achieve a transcendence which Adorno, in line with many intellectuals of the time, regarded as impossible: "No cathedral," he wrote, "can be built if no community desires one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the summer of 1924, Adorno received his doctorate with a study of [[Edmund Husserl]] under the direction of the unorthodox neo-Kantian [[Hans Cornelius]].  Before his graduation, Adorno had already met with his most important intellectual collaborators, [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]. Through Cornelius's seminars, Adorno met his future collaborator Max Horkheimer, through whom he was then introduced to [[Friedrich Pollock]].

===Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin===

During the summer of 1924, the Viennese composer [[Alban Berg]]'s "Three Fragments from [[Wozzeck]]", op. 7 premiered in Frankfurt, at which time Adorno introduced himself to Berg and both agreed the young philosopher and composer would study with Berg in Vienna. Upon moving to Vienna in February 1925, Adorno immersed himself in the musical culture which had grown up around Schoenberg: in addition to his twice-weekly sessions with Berg, Adorno continued his studies on piano with [[Eduard Steuermann]] and befriended the violinist [[Rudolf Kolisch]]. In Vienna, he attended public lectures of the satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] with Berg and met [[Lukács]], who had been living in Vienna after the failure of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Alban Berg, the man Adorno referred to as "my master and teacher", was among the most prescient of his young pupil's early friends:

{{quote|[I am] convinced that, in the sphere of the deepest understanding of music ... you are capable of supreme achievements and will undoubtedly fulfill this promise in the shape of great philosophical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After leaving Vienna, Adorno traveled through Italy, where he met with Kracauer, Benjamin, and the economist [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], with whom he developed a lasting friendship, before returning to Frankfurt. In December 1926 Adorno's "Two Pieces for String Quartet", op. 2 were performed in Vienna, which provided a welcome interruption from his preparations for the [[Habilitation]]. After writing the "Piano Pieces in strict twelve-tone technique", as well as songs later integrated into the ''Six Bagatelles for Voice and Piano'', op. 6, Adorno presented his [[Habilitation]] manuscript, ''The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of the Psyche'' (''Der Begriff des Unbewußten in der transzendentalen Seelenlehre''), to [[Hans Cornelius|Cornelius]] in November 1927. Cornelius advised Adorno to withdraw his application on the grounds that the manuscript was too close to his own way of thinking. In this manuscript, Adorno attempted to underline the epistemological status of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] as it emerged from [[Freud]]'s early writings. Against the function of the unconscious in both [[Nietzsche]] and [[Spengler]], Adorno argued that Freud's notion of the unconscious serves as a "sharp weapon ... against every attempt to create a metaphysics of the instincts and to deify full, organic nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undaunted by his academic prospects, Adorno threw himself once again into composition. In addition to publishing numerous  reviews of opera performances and concerts, Adorno's "Four Songs for Medium Voice and Piano", op. 3 was performed in Berlin in January 1929. Between 1928 and 1930 Adorno took on a greater role within the editorial committee of the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''. In a proposal for transforming the journal, Adorno sought to use ''Anbruch'' for championing radical modern music against what he called the "stabilized music" of [[Hans Pfitzner|Pfitzner]], the later [[Strauss]], as well as the [[neoclassicism]] of [[Stravinsky]] and [[Hindemith]]. During this period he published the essays "Night Music", "On Twelve-Tone Technique" and "Reaction and Progress". Yet his reservations about twelve-tone orthodoxy became steadily more pronounced: According to Adorno, [[twelve-tone technique]]'s use of [[atonality]] can no more be regarded as an authoritative canon than can [[tonality]] be relied on to provide instructions for the composer.

At this time, Adorno struck up a correspondence with the composer [[Ernst Krenek]], with whom he discussed problems of atonality and twelve-tone technique. In a letter of 1934 Adorno sounded a related criticism of Schoenberg:

{{quote|Twelve-tone technique alone is nothing but the principle of motivic elaboration and variation, as developed in the sonata, but elevated now to a comprehensive principle of construction, namely transformed into an ''a priori'' form and, by that token, detached from the surface of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
At this point Adorno reversed his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came second to the development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted [[Paul Tillich]]'s offer to present an Habilitation on [[Kierkegaard]], which Adorno eventually submitted under the title ''The Construction of the Aesthetic''. At the time, [[Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to [[Idealism]] and [[Hegel]]'s philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to [[Kierkegaard]], watchwords like "anxiety," "inwardness" and "leap"—instructive for [[Existentialism|existentialist philosophy]]—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the work proceeded—and [[Kierkegaard]]'s overcoming of [[Hegel]]'s idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to [[Alban Berg|Berg]] that he was writing without looking over his shoulder at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the ''[[venia legendi]]'' in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, [[Hitler]] seized dictatorial powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months after qualifying as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the [[Institute for Social Research]], an independent organization which had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, with the arrival of the literary scholar [[Leo Lowenthal]], social psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] and philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences. His lecture, "The Actuality of Philosophy," created a scandal. In it, Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program Horkheimer had laid out a year earlier, but challenged philosophy's very capacity for comprehending reality as such: "For the mind," Adorno announced, "is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]'s ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'' and preliminary sketches of the [[Arcades Project]], Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments which should be conducted "until they arrive at figurations in which the answers are legible, while the questions themselves vanish." Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might "construct keys before which reality springs open."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Horkheimer's taking up the directorship of the Institute, a new journal, ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'', was produced to publish the research of Institute members both before and after its relocation to the United States. Though Adorno was not himself an Institute member, the journal nevertheless published many of his essays, including "The Social Situation of Music" (1932), "On Jazz" (1936), "On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening" (1938) and "Fragments on Wagner" (1938). In his new role as social theorist, Adorno's philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of [[historical materialism]], as concepts like [[reification (Marxism)|reification]], [[false consciousness]] and [[ideology]] came to play an ever more prominent role in his work. At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent sociologist at the Institute, [[Karl Mannheim]], as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects—like "musical material"—as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of "value-free" sociology in favour of a form of ideology critique which held on to an idea of truth. Before his emigration in autumn 1934, Adorno began work on a ''Singspiel'' based on [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' entitled ''The Treasure of Indian Joe'', which he would, however, never complete; by the time he fled [[Hitler]]'s Germany Adorno had already written over a hundred opera or concert reviews and an additional fifty critiques of music composition.

As the [[Nazi]] party became the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Horkheimer's 1932 observation proved typical for his milieu: "Only one thing is certain", he wrote, "the irrationality of society has reached a point where only the gloomiest predictions have any plausibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September Adorno's right to teach was revoked; in March, as the [[swastika]] was run up the flag pole of town hall, the Institute's offices were searched by the Frankfurt criminal police. Adorno's house on Seeheimer Strasse was similarly searched in July and his application for membership in the Reich Chamber of Literature was denied on the grounds that membership was limited to "persons who belong to the German nation by profound ties of character and blood. As a non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]]," he was informed, "you are unable to feel and appreciate such an obligation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards Adorno was forced into fifteen years of exile.

===Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles===

After the possibility of transferring his [[habilitation]] to the [[University of Vienna]] came to nothing, Adorno considered relocating to Britain upon his father's suggestion.  With the help of the [[Academic Assistance Council]], Adorno registered as an advanced student at [[Merton College]], Oxford, in June 1934. During the next four years at Oxford, Adorno made repeated trips to Germany to see both his parents and Gretel, who was still working in Berlin. Under the direction of [[Gilbert Ryle]], Adorno worked on a dialectical critique of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]'s epistemology. By this time, the [[Institute for Social Research]] had relocated to New York City and began making overtures to Adorno. After months of strained relations, [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]] and Adorno reestablished their essential theoretical alliance during meetings in Paris. Adorno continued writing on music, publishing "The Form of the Phonograph Record" and "Crisis of Music Criticism" with the Viennese musical journal ''23'', "On Jazz" in the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', "Farewell to Jazz" in ''Europäische Revue''. Yet Adorno's attempts to break out of the sociology of music were, at this time, twice thwarted: neither the study of Mannheim he had been working on for years nor extracts from his study of Husserl were accepted by the ''Zeitschrift''. Impressed by Horkheimer's book of aphorisms, ''Dawn and Decline'', Adorno began working on his own book of aphorisms, what would later become ''Minima Moralia''. While at Oxford, Adorno suffered two great losses: his Aunt Agathe died in June 1935, while Alban Berg died in December of the same year. To the end of his life, Adorno never abandoned the hope of completing [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s unfinished [[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]].

At this time, Adorno was in intense correspondence with [[Walter Benjamin]] on the subject of the latter's ''[[Arcades Project]]''. After receiving an invitation from Horkheimer to visit the Institute in New York, Adorno sailed for New York on June 9, 1937 and stayed there for two weeks. While in New York, Max Horkheimer's essays "The Latest Attack on Metaphysics" and "Traditional and Critical Theory," which would soon become instructive for the Institute's self-understanding, were the subject of intense discussion. Soon after his return to Europe, Gretel moved to Britain, where she and Adorno were married on September 8, 1937; a little over a month later, Horkheimer telegrammed from New York with news of a position Adorno could take up with the [[Radio Project|Princeton Radio Project]], then under the directorship of the Austrian sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]]. Yet Adorno's work continued with studies of [[Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]] (published in 1939 as "Fragments on Wagner"), drafts of which he read to Benjamin during their final meeting, in December on the Italian Riviera. According to Benjamin, these drafts were astonishing for "the precision of their materialist deciphering," as well as the way in which "musical facts ... had been made socially transparent in a way that was completely new to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=237, 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Wagner study, the thesis later to characterize ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''—man's domination of nature—first emerges. Adorno sailed for New York on February 16, 1938. Soon after settling into his new home on Riverside Drive, Adorno met with Lazarsfeld in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to discuss the Project's plans for investigating the impact of broadcast music.

Although he was expected to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with [[data collection]] to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them. Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment:  "I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, "Music in Radio." Adorno was primarily interested in how the musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life. "The meaning of a Beethoven symphony," he wrote, "heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert-hall where people sit as if they were in church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essays published by the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', Adorno dealt with that atrophy of musical culture which had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—towards [[conformity|conformism]], trivialization and standardization—already present in the larger culture. Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the project. At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was duly left out. Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was nevertheless prolific, publishing "The Radio Symphony", "A Social Critique of Radio Music", and "On Popular Music", texts which, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are now found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's recent translation, ''Current of Music''. In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute.

In addition to helping with the ''Zeitschrift'', Adorno was expected to be the Institute's liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of [[Charles Baudelaire]] he hoped would serve as a model of the larger ''Arcades Project''. In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks which had become manifest through Benjamin's "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility]]". At around the same time Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on "dialectical logic", which would later become ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno's parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in [[Colombes]], their joint study could entertain few delusions about its practical effects. "In view of what is now threatening to engulf Europe," Horkheimer wrote, "our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a kind of message in a bottle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Søren Kierkegaard's doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing. After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets. In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism. On one side were those who supported [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]]'s thesis according to which [[National Socialism]] was a form of "[[monopoly capitalism|monopoly capital]]"; on the other were those who supported [[Friedrich Pollock]]'s "[[state capitalist]] theory." Horkheimer's contributions to this debate, in the form of the essays "The Authoritarian State", "The End of Reason", and "The Jews and Europe" served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic.

In November 1941 Adorno followed Horkheimer to what [[Thomas Mann]] called "German California",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up house in a [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of German émigrés which included [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Arnold Schoenberg. Adorno arrived with  a draft of his ''Philosophy of New Music'', a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music, which Adorno himself felt, while writing, was already a departure from the theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating. Horkheimer's reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: "If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, then I did on this occasion," he wrote after reading the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed itself from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment. First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as ''Philosophical Fragments'', the text would wait another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag. This "reflection on the destructive aspect of progress" proceeded through the chapters which treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the [[Marquis de Sade]], as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism.

With their joint work completed, the two turned their attention to studies on antisemitism and authoritarianism in collaboration with the [[Nevitt Sanford]]-led Public Opinion Study Group and the [[American Jewish Committee]]. In line with these studies, Adorno produced an analysis of the Californian radio preacher Martin Luther Thomas. Fascist propaganda of this sort, Adorno wrote, "simply takes people for what they are: genuine children of today's standardized mass culture who have been robbed to a great extent of their autonomy and spontaneity"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these labors, the 1950 study ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' was pioneering in its combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting and evaluating data as well as its development of the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]].

After the USA entered the war in 1941, the situation of the émigrés, now classed "[[enemy aliens]]", became increasingly restricted. Forbidden from leaving their homes between 8pm and 6am and prohibited from going more than five miles from their houses, émigrés like Adorno, who would not be naturalized until November 1943, were severely restricted in their movements.

In addition to the aphorisms which conclude ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as ''Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life''. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], treated issues like [[emigration]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[individuality]], as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and became friends with [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Hanns Eisler]], with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films. Additionally, Adorno assisted [[Thomas Mann]] on his novel ''[[Doktor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]'' after the latter asked for his help. "Would you be willing," Mann wrote, "to think through with me how the work—I mean Leverkühn's work—might look; how you would do it if you were in league with the Devil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 1949, Adorno left America for Europe just as ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' was being published. Before his return, Adorno had not only reached an agreement with a Tübingen publisher to print an expanded version of ''Philosophy of New Music'', but completed two compositions: ''Four Songs for Voice and Piano by Stefan George, op.7'', and ''Three Choruses for Female Voices from the Poems of Theodor Däubler, op. 8''.

===Post-war Europe===

====Return to Frankfurt University====
Upon his return, Adorno helped shape the political culture of West Germany. Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]], critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology, and teacher of music at the [[Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music]]. Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival,{{when|date=September 2012}} with seminars on "Kant's Transcendental Dialectic", aesthetics, Hegel, "Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge", and "The Concept of Knowledge". Adorno's surprise at his students' passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler's rule, the government re-employed people who had been active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to own up to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred. Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps. All the enthusiasm Adorno's students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of [[Max Frisch]], culture had become an "alibi" for the absence of political consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the foundations for what would come to be known as "The Frankfurt School" were soon laid: Horkheimer resumed his chair in social philosophy and the Institute for Social Research, rebuilt, became a lightning rod for critical thought.

====Essays on fascism====
Starting with his 1947 essay ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''Kenyan Review'' Vol.ix (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Adorno produced a series of influential works to describe psychological fascist traits. One of these works was ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950),&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, [http://ada.evergreen.edu/~arunc/texts/frankfurt/ap/politics.pdf ''Politics and Economics in the Interview Material''], ch.17&lt;/ref&gt; published as a contribution to the ''Studies in Prejudice'' performed by multiple research institutes in the US, and consisting of a '[[qualitative research|qualitative interpretation]]s' that uncovered the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] character of test persons through indirect questions.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The books have had a major influence on sociology and remain highly discussed and debated. In 1951 he continued on the topic with his essay ''Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda'', in which he said that "Psychological dispositions do not actually cause fascism; rather, fascism defines a psychological area which can be successfully exploited by the forces which promote it for entirely non-psychological reasons of self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Espen (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=X3L5R3kiOh4C&amp;pg=PA56 ''Adorno and the political''], pp.56–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Adorno participated in a group experiment, revealing residual National Socialist attitudes among the recently democratized Germans. He then published two influential essays, ''The Meaning of Working Through the Past'' (1959), and ''Education after Auschwitz'' (1966), in which he argued on the survival of the uneradicated [[National Socialism]] in the [[mind-set]]s and institutions of the post-1945 Germany, and that there is still a real risk that it could rise again.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer (2006) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, however, Jean Améry—who had been tortured at Auschwitz—would sharply object that Adorno, rather than addressing such political concerns, was exploiting Auschwitz for his metaphysical phantom "absolute negativity" ("absolute Negativität"), using a language intoxicated by itself ("von sich selber bis zur Selbstblendung entzückte Sprache").&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, 'Der Geist ist stets gestört', in: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' nr. 129 (7 June 2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public events====
In September 1951 Adorno returned to the United States for a six-week visit, during which he attended the opening of the Hacker Psychiatry Foundation in Beverly Hills, met [[Leo Lowenthal]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]] in New York and saw his mother for the last time. After stopping in Paris, where he met [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], [[Michel Leiris]] and [[René Leibowitz]], Adorno delivered a lecture entitled "The Present State of Empirical Social Research in Germany" at a conference on opinion research. Here he emphasized the importance of data collection and statistical evaluation while asserting that such empirical methods have only an auxiliary function and must lead to the formation of theories which would "raise the harsh facts to the level of consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Horkheimer as dean of the Arts Faculty, then rector of the university, responsibilities for the Institute's work fell upon Adorno. At the same time, however, Adorno renewed his musical work: with talks at the Kranichsteiner Musikgesellschaft, another in connection with a production of [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Leben des Orest]]'', and a seminar on "Criteria of New Music" at the Fifth International Summer Course for New Music at Kranichstein. Adorno also became increasingly involved with the publishing house of [[Peter Suhrkamp]], inducing the latter to publish Benjamin's ''Berlin Childhood Around 1900'', Kracauer's writings and a two-volume edition of Benjamin's writings. Adorno's own recently published ''Minima Moralia'' was not only well received in the press, but also met with great admiration from Thomas Mann, who wrote to Adorno from America in 1952:
{{quote|I have spent days attached to your book as if by a magnet. Every day brings new fascination ... concentrated nourishment. It is said that the companion star to Sirius, white in colour, is made of such dense material that a cubic inch of it would weigh a tonne here. This is why it has such an extremely powerful gravitational field; in this respect it is similar to your book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Yet Adorno was no less moved by other public events: protesting the publication of [[Heinrich Mann]]'s novel ''[[Professor Unrat]]'' with its film title, ''[[The Blue Angel]]''; declaring his sympathy with those who protested the scandal of big-game hunting and penning a defense of prostitutes.

====More essays on mass culture and literature====
Because Adorno's American citizenship would have been forfeited by the middle of 1952 had he continued to stay outside the country, he returned once again to [[Santa Monica]] to survey his prospects at the Hacker Foundation. While there he wrote a content analysis of [[Western astrology|newspaper horoscopes]] (now collected in ''The Stars Down to Earth''), and the essays "Television as Ideology" and "Prologue to Television"; even so, he was pleased when, at the end of ten months, he was enjoined to return as co-director of the Institute.

Back in Frankfurt, he renewed his academic duties and, from 1952 to 1954, completed three essays: "Notes on Kafka", "Valéry Proust Museum", and an essay on Schoenberg following the composer's death, all of which were included in the 1955 essay collection ''Prisms''. In response to the publication of [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Black Swan (Mann novella)|The Black Swan]]'', Adorno penned a long letter to the author, who then approved its publication in the literary journal ''Akzente''. A second collection of essays, ''Notes to Literature'', appeared in 1958. After meeting [[Samuel Beckett]] while delivering a series of lectures in Paris the same year, Adorno set to work on "Trying to Understand Endgame," which, along with studies of [[Proust]], [[Valéry]], and [[Balzac]], formed the central texts of the 1961 publication of the second volume of his ''Notes to Literature''. Adorno's entrance into literary discussions continued in his June 1963 lecture at the annual conference of the Hölderlin Society. At the Philosophers' Conference of October 1962 in Münster, at which Habermas wrote that Adorno was "A writer among bureaucrats", Adorno presented "Progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Zeitschrift'' was never revived, the Institute nevertheless published a series of important sociological books, including ''Sociologica'' (1955), a collection of essays, ''Gruppenexperiment'' (1955), ''Betriebsklima'', a study of work satisfaction among workers in Mannesmann, and ''Soziologische Exkurse'', a textbook-like anthology intended as an introductory work about the discipline.

====Public figure====
Throughout the fifties and sixties, Adorno became a [[public figure]], not simply through his books and essays, but also through his appearances in radio and newspapers. In talks, interviews and round-table discussions broadcast on Hessen Radio, South-West Radio and Radio Bremen, Adorno discussed topics as diverse as "The Administered World" (September 1950), "What is the Meaning of 'Working Through the Past?"' (February 1960) to "The Teaching Profession and its Taboos" (August 1965). Additionally, he frequently wrote for ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', ''Frankfurter Rundschau'' and the weekly ''Die Zeit''.

At the invitation of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno took part in the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958. Yet conflicts between the so-called [[Darmstadt school]], which included composers like [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]], soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, "The Aging of the New Music", where he argued that atonality's freedom was being restricted to serialism in much the same way as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique. With his friend [[Eduard Steuermann]], Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization. During this time Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously), but also published ''Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy'' in 1960. In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a "musique informelle", which would possess the ability "really and truly to be what it is, without the ideological pretense of being something else. Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-war German culture====
At the same time Adorno struck up relationships with contemporary German-language poets such as [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. Adorno's 1949 dictum—"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric"—posed the question of what German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in ''Negative Dialectics'', for example, he wrote that "Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream";  while in "Commitment," he wrote in 1962 that the dictum "expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature"—was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture. Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] as well as the film-maker [[Alexander Kluge]].

In 1963, Adorno was elected to the post of chairman of the German Sociological Society, where he presided over two important conferences: in 1964, on "Max Weber and Sociology" and in 1968 on "Late Capitalism or Industrial Society". A debate launched in 1961 by Adorno and [[Karl Popper]], later published as the ''[[Positivist Dispute in German Sociology]]'', arose out of disagreements at the 1959 14th German Sociology Conference in Berlin.

Adorno's critique of the dominant climate of post-war Germany was also directed against the pathos that had grown up around Heideggerianism, as practiced by writers like [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]], and which had subsequently seeped into public discourse. His 1964 publication of ''The Jargon of Authenticity'' took aim at the halo such writers had attached to words like "angst", "decision" and "leap". After seven years of work, Adorno completed ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' in 1966, after which, during the summer semester of 1967 and the winter semester of 1967–68, he offered regular philosophy seminars to discuss the book chapter by chapter. Among the students at these seminars were the Americans [[Angela Davis]] and Irving Wohlfarth. One objection which would soon take on ever greater importance, was that critical thought must adopt the standpoint of the oppressed, to which Adorno replied that negative dialectics was concerned "with the dissolution of standpoint thinking itself."

====Confrontations with students====
At the time of ''Negative Dialectics''{{'}} publication, the fragility of West German democracy led to increasing [[student protest]]s. Monopolistic trends in the media, an educational crisis in the universities, the Shah of Iran's 1967 state visit, German support for the war in Vietnam and the emergency laws combined to create a highly unstable situation. Like many of his students, Adorno too opposed the [[German Emergency Acts|emergency laws]], as well as the war in Vietnam, which, he said, proved the continued existence of the "world of torture that had begun in Auschwitz".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation only deteriorated with the police shooting of [[Benno Ohnesorg]] at a protest against the Shah's visit. This death, as well as the subsequent acquittal of the responsible officer, were both commented upon in Adorno's lectures. As politicization increased, rifts developed within both the Institute's relationship with its students as well as within the Institute itself. Soon Adorno himself would become an object of the students' ire. At the invitation of [[Peter Szondi]], Adorno was invited to the [[Free University of Berlin]] to give a lecture on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|Iphigenie in Tauris]]''. After a group of students marched to the lectern, unfurling a banner that read "Berlin's left-wing fascists greet Teddy the Classicist," a number of those present left the lecture in protest after Adorno refused to abandon his talk in favour of discussing his attitude on the current political situation. Adorno shortly thereafter participated in a meeting with the Berlin [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]] (SDS) and discussed "Student Unrest" with Szondi on West German Radio. But as 1968 progressed, Adorno became increasingly critical of the students' disruptions to university life. His isolation was only compounded by articles published in the magazine ''alternative'', which, following the lead of [[Hannah Arendt]]'s articles in ''Merkur'', claimed Adorno had subjected Benjamin to pressure during his years of exile in Berlin and compiled Benjamin's ''Writings'' and ''Letters'' with a great deal of bias. In response, Benjamin's longtime friend [[Gershom Scholem]], wrote to the editor of ''Merkur'' to express his disapproval of the "in part, shameful, not to say disgraceful" remarks by Arendt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between students and the West German state continued deteriorating. In spring 1968, a prominent SDS spokesman, [[Rudi Dutschke]], was gunned down in the streets; in response, massive demonstrations took place, directed in particular against the [[Springer Press]], which had led a campaign to vilify the students. An open appeal published in ''[[Die Zeit]]'', signed by Adorno, called for an inquiry into the social reasons that gave rise to this assassination attempt as well as an investigation into the Springer Press' manipulation of public opinion. At the same time, however, Adorno protested against disruptions of his own lectures and refused to express his solidarity with their political goals, maintaining instead his autonomy as a theoretician. Adorno rejected the so-called unity of theory and praxis advocated by the students and argued that the students' actions were premised upon a mistaken analysis of the situation. The building of barricades, he wrote to Marcuse, is "ridiculous against those who administer the bomb."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1968 Adorno went to Vienna for the publication of ''Alban Berg: Master of the Smallest Link''. Upon his return to Frankfurt, events prevented his concentrating upon the book on aesthetics he wished to write: "Valid student claims and dubious actions," he wrote to Marcuse, "are all so mixed up together that all productive work and even sensible thought are scarcely possible any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; After striking students threatened to strip the Institute's sociology seminar rooms of their furnishings and equipment, the police were brought in to close the building.

Adorno began writing an introduction to a collection of poetry by Rudolf Borchardt, which was connected with a talk entitled "Charmed Language," delivered in Zurich, followed by a talk on aesthetics in Paris where he met Beckett again. Beginning in October 1966, Adorno took up work on ''Aesthetic Theory''.  In June 1969 he completed ''Catchwords: Critical Models''. During the winter semester of 1968–69 Adorno was on sabbatical leave from the university and thus able to dedicate himself to the completion of his book of aesthetics.

For the summer semester Adorno planned a lecture course entitled "An Introduction to Dialectical Thinking," as well as a seminar on the dialectics of subject and object. But at the first lecture Adorno's attempt to open up the lecture and invite questions whenever they arose degenerated into a disruption from which he quickly fled: after a student wrote on the blackboard "If Adorno is left in peace, capitalism will never cease," three women students approached the lectern, bared their breasts and scattered flower petals over his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Adorno continued to resist blanket condemnations of the protest movement which would have only strengthened the conservative thesis according to which political irrationalism was the result of Adorno's teaching. After further disruptions to his lectures, Adorno canceled the lectures for the rest of the seminar, continuing only with his philosophy seminar. In the summer of 1969, weary from these activities, Adorno returned once again to [[Zermatt, Switzerland]], at the foot of Matterhorn to restore his strength. On August 6 he died of a heart attack.

==Theory==
{{Frankfurt School}}
Adorno's work sets out from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the recognition of what is primitive in ourselves and the world itself. Neither [[Picasso]]'s fascination with African sculpture nor [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]'s reduction of painting to its most elementary component—the line—is comprehensible outside this concern with [[primitivism]] Adorno shared with the century's most radical art. At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation and accelerating [[commodification]], sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming. According to Adorno, society's self-preservation had become indistinguishable from societally sanctioned self-sacrifice: of "primitive" peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy. Adorno's theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality which seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism. From this perspective, Adorno's writings on politics, philosophy, music and literature are a lifelong critique of the ways in which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation. According to Adorno's translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno's work thus consists in determining "how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durão|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in ''Negative Dialectics'', is nothing but "the law of doom thus far obeyed by history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2003|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its most basic, Adorno's thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law.

Adorno was chiefly influenced by [[Max Weber]]'s critique of [[disenchantment]], [[Georg Lukács]]'s Hegelian interpretation of Marxism, as well as [[Walter Benjamin]]'s philosophy of history. Adorno, along with the other major Frankfurt School theorists [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]], argued that advanced capitalism had managed to contain or liquidate the forces that would bring about its collapse and that the revolutionary moment, when it would have been possible to transform it into socialism, had passed. As he put it at the beginning of his ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966), philosophy is still necessary because the time to realise it was missed. Adorno argued that capitalism had become more entrenched through its attack on the objective basis of revolutionary consciousness and through liquidation of the individualism that had been the basis of critical consciousness. Adorno, as well as Horkheimer, critiqued all forms of [[positivism]] as responsible for [[technocracy]] and disenchantment and sought to produce a theory that both rejected positivism and avoided reinstating traditional [[metaphysics]]. Adorno and Horkheimer have been criticized for over-applying the term "positivism," especially in their interpretations of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]] as positivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 242–5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

Adorno criticized [[jazz]] and [[popular music]], viewing it as part of the [[culture industry]], that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it "aesthetically pleasing" and "agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. 'The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope' 2010, p.89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early essays for the Vienna-based journal ''Anbruch'', Adorno claimed that musical progress is proportional to the composer's ability to constructively deal with the possibilities and limitations contained within what Adorno called the "musical material." For Adorno, twelve-tone serialism constitutes a decisive, historically developed method of composition. The objective validity of composition, according to Adorno, rests with neither the composer's genius nor the work's conformity with prior standards, but with the way in which the work coherently expresses the dialectic of the material. In this sense, the contemporary absence of composers of the status of Bach or Beethoven is not the sign of musical regression; instead, new music is to be credited with laying bare aspects of the musical material previously repressed: The musical material's liberation from number, the harmonic series and tonal harmony. Thus, historical progress is achieved only by the composer who "submits to the work and seemingly does not undertake anything active except to follow where it leads." Because historical experience and social relations are embedded within this musical material, it is to the analysis of such material that the critic must turn. In the face of this radical liberation of the musical material, Adorno came to criticize those who, like Stravinsky, withdrew from this freedom by taking recourse to forms of the past as well as those who turned twelve-tone composition into a technique which dictated the rules of composition.

Adorno saw the culture industry as an arena in which critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture was identified as a reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. "Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=123}} The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that "the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods" but this is concealed under "the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arato|Gephart|1982|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive "add-ons" in order to keep the consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as ''pseudo-individualisation'' and the ''always-the-same''. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Adorno's analysis allowed for a critique of mass culture from the left which balanced the critique of popular culture from the right. From both perspectives—left and right—the nature of cultural production was felt to be at the root of social and moral problems resulting from the consumption of culture. However, while the critique from the right emphasized moral degeneracy ascribed to sexual and racial influences within popular culture, Adorno located the problem not with the content, but with the objective realities of the production of mass culture and its effects, e.g. as a form of [[reverse psychology]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thinkers influenced by Adorno believe that today's society has evolved in a direction foreseen by him, especially in regard to the past ([[Auschwitz]]), morals, or the Culture Industry. The latter has become a particularly productive, yet highly contested term in [[cultural studies]]. Many of Adorno's reflections on aesthetics and music have only just begun to be debated, as a collection of essays on the subject, many of which had not previously been translated into English, has only recently been collected and published as ''Essays on Music''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno's work in the years before his death was shaped by the idea of "negative dialectics", set out especially in his book of that title. A key notion in the work of the Frankfurt School since ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' had been the idea of thought becoming an instrument of domination that subsumes all objects under the control of the (dominant) subject, especially through the notion of identity, i.e. of identifying as real in nature and society only that which harmonized or fit with dominant concepts, and regarding as unreal or non-existent everything that did not. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Adorno's "negative dialectics" was an attempt to articulate a non-dominating thought that would recognize its limitations and accept the non-identity and reality of that which could not be subsumed under the subject's concepts. Indeed, Adorno sought to ground the critical bite of his sociological work in his critique of identity, which he took to be a reification in thought of the commodity form or exchange relation which always presumes a false identity between different things. The potential to criticise arises from the gap between the concept and the object, which can never go into the former without remainder. This gap, this non-identity in identity, was the secret to a critique of both material life and conceptual reflection. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Adorno's reputation as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death.  His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the [[Second Viennese School]] in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him to fall out of favour.  The distinguished American scholar [[Richard Taruskin]]&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard. ''The Oxford History of Western Music''. Oxford University Press, 2005, p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; declared Adorno to be "preposterously over-rated." The eminent pianist and critic [[Charles Rosen]] saw Adorno's book ''The Philosophy of New Music'' as "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (2000, p117) ''Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New''. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic [[Eric Hobsbawm]] saw Adorno's writings as containing "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz".&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric (1993, p. 300) ''The Jazz Scene'' . New York, Pantheon.&lt;/ref&gt; The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] saw Adorno as producing "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. 'The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope' 2010, p.89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive.  He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: "I have never been able to bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky." &lt;ref&gt;Letter of 5 December 1949, quoted in Stuckenschmidt, Arnold Schoenberg: His Life, World and Work, trans. H. Searle London: John Calder, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the scholar [[Slavoj Žižek]] has written a foreword to Adorno's ''In Search of Wagner'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor (2005). In Search of Wagner. London and New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt; where Žižek attributes an "emancipatory impulse" to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study."&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj. (2005). Foreword: Why Is Wagner Worth Saving? In: Adorno, Theodor. (2005). In Search of Wagner. London and New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The five components of recognition ====
Adorno states that a start to understand the recognition in respect of any particular song hit may be made by drafting a scheme which divides the experience of recognition into its different components. All the factors people enumerate are interwoven to a degree that would be impossible to separate from one another in reality. Adorno's scheme is directed towards the different objective elements involved in the experience of recognition, than the actual experience felt for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Popular Music|last = Adorno|first = Theodor|date = 1941|journal = Essays on Music|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist criticisms===
Adorno posits social totality as an automatic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=adorno |title=Theodor W. Adorno |last=Zuidervaart |first=Lambert}} According to Adorno, society and culture form a sociohistorical totality, such that the pursuit of freedom in society is inseparable from the pursuit of enlightenment in culture.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Horst Müller's ''Kritik der kritischen Theorie'' ("Critique of Critical Theory"), this assumption is consistent with Adorno's idea of society as a self-regulating system, from which one must escape (but from which nobody ''can'' escape). For him it was existent, but inhuman. Müller argues against the existence of such a system and claims that critical theory provides no practical solution for societal change. He concludes that [[Jürgen Habermas]], in particular, and the Frankfurt School in general, misconstrue Marx.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Standardization==
The phenomenon of standardization is "a concept used to characterize the formulaic products of capitalist-driven mass media and mass culture that appeal to the lowest common denominator in pursuit of maximum profit".{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=204}} According to Adorno we inhabit a media culture driven society which has product consumption as one of its main characteristics. Mass media is employed to deliver messages about products and services to consumers in order to convince these individuals to purchase the commodity they are advertising. Standardization consists of the production of large amounts of commodities to then pursue consumers in order to gain the maximum profit possible.

They do this, as mentioned above, by individualizing products to give the illusion to consumers that they are in fact purchasing a product or service that was specifically designed for them. Adorno highlights the issues created with the construction of popular music, where different samples of music used in the creation of today's chart-topping songs are put together in order to create, re-create, and modify numerous tracks by using the same variety of samples from one song to another. He makes a distinction between "Apologetic music" and "Critical music". Apologetic music is defined as the highly produced and promoted music of the "pop music" industry: music that is composed of variable parts and interchanged to create several different songs. "The social and psychological functions of popular music [are that it] acts like a social cement"{{sfn|Adorno|1990|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2015}}}} "to keep people obedient and subservient to the status quo of existing power structures."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=125}}

Serious music, according to Adorno, achieves excellence when its whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The example he gives is that of Beethoven's symphonies: "[his] greatness shows itself in the complete subordination of the accidentally private melodic elements to the form as a whole."{{sfn|Laughey|2010|loc=125}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}

Standardization not only refers to the products of the culture industry but to the consumers as well: many times every day consumers are bombarded by media advertising. Consumers are pushed and shoved into consuming products and services presented to them by the media system. The masses have become conditioned by the culture industry, which makes the impact of standardization much more important. By not realizing the impact of social media and commercial advertising, the individual is caught in a situation where conformity is the norm. "During consumption the masses become characterized by the commodities which they use and exchange among themselves."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=124}}

===Adorno's responses to his critics===
As a pioneer of a self-reflexive sociology who prefigured [[Bourdieu]]'s ability to factor in the effect of reflection on the societal object, Adorno realized that some criticism (including deliberate disruption of his classes in the 1960s) could never be answered in a dialogue between equals if, as he seems to have believed, what the naive ethnographer or sociologist thinks of a human essence is always changing over time.&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison of Adorno's and Bourdieu's rather divergent conceptions of reflexivity, see: Karakayali, Nedim.

==Adorno's sociological methods==

As Adorno believed that sociology needs to be self-reflective and self-critical, he also believed that the language the sociologist uses, like the language of the ordinary person, is a political construct in large measure that uses, often unreflectingly, concepts installed by dominant classes and social structures (such as our notion of "deviance" which includes both genuinely deviant individuals and "hustlers" operating below social norms because they lack the capital to operate above: for an analysis of this phenomenon, cf. [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s book ''The Weight of the World''). He felt that those at the top of the Institute needed to be the source primarily of theories for evaluation and empirical testing, as well as people who would process the "facts" discovered...including revising theories that were found to be false. For example, in an essay published in Germany on Adorno's return from the USA, and reprinted in the ''Critical Models'' essays collection ({{ISBN|0-231-07635-5}}), Adorno praised the [[egalitarianism]] and openness of US society  based on his sojourn in New York and the Los Angeles area between 1935 and 1955: "Characteristic for the life in America [...]is a moment of peacefulness, kindness and generosity". ("Dem amerikanischen Leben eignet [...] ein Moment von Friedlichkeit, Gutartigkeit und Großzügigkeit".)&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Stichworte. Kritische Modelle 2'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1969, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the clash of intellectual culture and Adorno's methods can be found in [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], the American sociologist for whom Adorno worked in the late 1930s after fleeing Hitler. As Rolf Wiggershaus recounts in ''The Frankfurt School, Its History, Theories and Political Significance'' (MIT 1995), Lazarsfeld was the director of a project, funded and inspired by David Sarnoff (the head of [[RCA]]), to discover both the sort of music that listeners of radio liked and ways to improve their "taste", so that RCA could profitably air more classical music. Lazarsfeld, however, had trouble both with the prose style of the work Adorno handed in and what Lazarsfeld thought was Adorno's "lack of discipline in ... presentation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiggershaus|1995|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno himself provided the following personal anecdote:

{{Quotation|What I mean by reified consciousness, I can illustrate—without elaborate philosophical contemplation—most simply with an American experience. Among the frequently changing colleagues which the Princeton Project provided me with, was a young lady. After a few days, she had gained confidence in me, and asked most kindly: "Dr Adorno, would you mind a personal question?". I said, "It depends on the question, but just go ahead", and she went on: "Please tell me: are you an extrovert or an introvert?". It was as if she, as a living being, already thought according to the model of multi-choice questions in questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Stichworte. Kritische Modelle'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1969, p. 122 (also cited in Friedemann Grenz, ''Adornos Philosophie in Grundbegriffen. Auflösung einiger Deutungsprobleme''. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1974, p. 43.).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Adorno translated into English==
While even German readers can find Adorno's work difficult to understand, an additional problem for English readers is that his German idiom is particularly difficult to translate into English. A similar difficulty of translation is true of [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]], and a number of other German philosophers and poets. As a result, some early translators tended toward over-literalness. In recent years, [[Edmund Jephcott]] and [[Stanford University Press]] have published new translations of some of Adorno's lectures and books, including ''Introduction to Sociology'', ''Problems of Moral Philosophy'' and his transcribed lectures on Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and Aristotle's "Metaphysics", and a new translation of the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''. Professor Henry Pickford, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, has translated many of Adorno's works such as "The Meaning of Working Through the Past." A new translation has also appeared of ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'' and the ''Philosophy of New Music'' by [[Robert Hullot-Kentor]], from the [[University of Minnesota Press]]. Hullot-Kentor is also currently working on a new translation of ''Negative Dialectics''. Adorno's correspondence with Alban Berg, ''Towards a Theory of Musical Reproduction'', and the letters to Adorno's parents, have been translated by [[Wieland Hoban]] and published by [[Polity Press]]. These fresh translations are slightly less literal in their rendering of German sentences and words, and are more accessible to English readers. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}  The Group Experiment, which had been unavailable to English readers, is now available in an accessible translation by Jeffrey K. Olick and Andrew J. Perrin on Harvard University Press, along with introductory material explaining its relation to the rest of Adorno's work and 20th-century public opinion research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19534">In [[science fiction]], '''uplift''' is a developmental process to transform a certain species of animals into more intelligent beings by other, already-intelligent beings. This is usually accomplished by cultural, technological, or evolutional interventions like [[Genetic engineering in science fiction|genetic engineering]] but any fictional or real process can be used. The earliest appearance of the concept is in [[H. G. Wells]]' 1896 novel ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=Keith M.|title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction in Literature|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently appears in [[David Brin]]'s ''[[Uplift Universe|Uplift series]]'' and other science fiction works.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JXnz9x9sO4C&amp;pg=PA850 |title=The Greenwood encyclopedia of science fiction and fantasy |volume=2 |author=David Langford |chapter=Uplift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The concept can be traced to [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'' (1896),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://web.syr.edu/~blbousfi/UPLIFTEX22.html FROM THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU TO LIVES OF THE MONSTER DOGS: UPLIFTED ANIMALS, WISH FULFILLMENT, AND ORIGINAL SIN &lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at web.syr.edu  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111202414/http://web.syr.edu/~blbousfi/UPLIFTEX22.html|date=January 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the titular scientist transforms animals into horrifying parodies of humans through surgery and psychological torment. The resulting animal-people obsessively recite the Law, a series of prohibitions against reversion to animal behaviors, with the haunting refrain of "Are we not men?" Wells' novel reflects Victorian concerns about [[vivisection]] and of the power of unrestrained scientific experimentation to do terrible harm.

Other early literary examples can be found in the following works:
* [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s "Johnny Black" stories (beginning with "[[The Command (short story)|The Command]]") about a black bear raised to human-level intelligence, published in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' from 1938-1940. 
* [[Olaf Stapledon]]'s ''[[Sirius (novel)|Sirius]]'' (1944) explores a dog with human intelligence. 
* In [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s ''[[Instrumentality of Mankind]]'' series "underpeople" are created from animals through unexplained technological means explicitly to be servants of humanity, and were often treated as less than slaves by the society that used them, until the laws were reformed in the story ''[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]'' (1962). However, Smith's characterizations of individual underpeople are frequently quite sympathetic, and one of his most memorable characters is C'Mell, the cat-woman who appears in ''[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]'' and in ''[[Norstrilia]]'' (1975).

David Brin has stated that his [[Uplift Universe]] was written at least in part in response to the common assumption in earlier science fiction such as Smith's work and ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'' that uplifted animals would, or even should, be treated as possessions rather than people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090325125822/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue25/interview.html David Brin&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.scifi.com&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a significant part of the conflict in the series revolves around the differing policies of Galactics and humans toward their client races. Galactic races traditionally hold their uplifted "clients" in a hundred-millennium-long [[indenture]], during which the "patrons" have extensive rights and claims over clients' lives and labor power. In contrast, humans have given their uplifted [[dolphin]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s near-equal [[civil rights]], with a few legal and economic disabilities related to their unfinished state.  A key scene in ''[[Startide Rising]]'' is a discussion between a self-aware computer (the Niss) and a leading human (Gillian) about how the events during their venture (and hence the novel's plot) relate to the morality of the Galactics' system of uplift.

'''Utopian socialism''' is a label used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Étienne Cabet]] and [[Robert Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html|title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism|publisher=Public Broadcasting System|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian socialism is often described as the presentation of visions and outlines for imaginary or futuristic ideal societies, with positive ideals being the main reason for moving society in such a direction. Later socialists and critics of utopian socialism viewed "utopian socialism" as not being grounded in actual material conditions of existing society and in some cases as reactionary. These visions of ideal societies competed with [[Marxist]]-inspired revolutionary social democratic movements.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0853457980|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label "utopian" by later socialists as a [[pejorative]] in order to imply ''naiveté'' and to dismiss their ideas as fanciful and unrealistic.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar school of thought that emerged in the early 20th century is [[ethical socialism]], which makes the case for socialism on moral grounds.

However, one key difference between utopian socialists and other socialists (including most [[anarchists]]) is that utopian socialists generally do not believe any form of class struggle or political revolution is necessary for socialism to emerge. Utopians believe that people of all classes can voluntarily adopt their plan for society if it is presented convincingly.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt; They feel their form of cooperative socialism can be established among like-minded people within the existing society and that their small communities can demonstrate the feasibility of their plan for society.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

== Definition ==
{{see also|Utopia}}
The thinkers identified as utopian socialist did not use the term "utopian" to refer to their ideas. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were the first thinkers to refer to them as "utopian", referring to all socialist ideas that simply presented a vision and distant goal of an ethically just society as utopian. This utopian mindset which held an integrated conception of the goal, the means to produce said goal and an understanding of the way that those means would inevitably be produced through examining social and economic phenomena can be contrasted with [[scientific socialism]], which has been likened to [[Taylorism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

This distinction was made clear in Engels' work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1892, part of an earlier publication, the ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' from 1878). Utopian socialists were seen as wanting to expand the principles of the French revolution in order to create a more "rational" society. Despite being labeled as utopian by later socialists, their aims were not always utopian and their values often included rigid support for the scientific method and the creation of a society based upon scientific understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 1)|author=Frederick Engels|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The term "utopian socialism" was introduced by Karl Marx in "For a Ruthless Criticism of Everything" in 1843 (and then developed in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in 1848), although shortly before its publication Marx had already attacked the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in ''[[The poverty of philosophy|Das Elend der Philosophie]]'' (originally written in French, 1847). The term was used by later socialist thinkers to describe early socialist or quasi-socialist intellectuals who created hypothetical visions of [[egalitarian]], [[communalist]], [[meritocratic]], or other notions of "perfect" societies without considering how these societies could be created or sustained.

In ''Das Elend der Philosophie'', English title ''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Marx criticized the [[Economics|economic]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] arguments of Proudhon set forth in ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]''. Marx accused Proudhon of wanting to rise above the [[bourgeoisie]]. In the history of Marx's thought and [[Marxism]], this work is pivotal in the distinction between the concepts of utopian socialism and what Marx and the Marxists claimed as scientific socialism.

Although utopian socialists shared few political, social, or economic perspectives, Marx and Engels argued that they shared certain intellectual characteristics. In ''The Communist Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich and Marx, Karl Heinrich. »Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei«. Edited by Sálvio M. Soares. MetaLibri, October 31, 2008, v1.0s.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels wrote: "The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favored. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see it in the best possible plan of the best possible state of society? Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, and endeavor, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel".

Marx and Engels used the term "scientific socialism" to describe the type of socialism they saw themselves developing. According to Engels, socialism was not "an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes{{spaced ndash}}the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Its task was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historical-economic succession of events from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung, and to discover in the economic conditions thus created the means of ending the conflict".

Critics have argued that utopian socialists who established experimental communities were in fact trying to apply the [[scientific method]] to human social organization and were therefore not utopian. For instance, [[Joshua Muravchik]] on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s definition of science as "the practice of experimentation, of hypothesis and test" argued that "Owen and Fourier and their followers were the real ‘scientific socialists.’ They hit upon the idea of socialism, and they tested it by attempting to form socialist communities". Muravchik further argued that in contrast Marx made untestable predictions about the future and that Marx's view that socialism would be created by impersonal historical forces may lead one to conclude that it is unnecessary to strive for socialism because it will happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publication/the-rise-and-fall-of-socialism/ The Rise and Fall of Socialism] Joshua Muravchik SPEECHES AEI Bradley Lecture Series Publication Date: February 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]] overtook utopian socialism in terms of intellectual development and number of adherents. At one time almost half the population of the world lived under regimes that claimed to be Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/marx.html|author=Steven Kreis|title=Karl Marx, 1818-1883|publisher=The History Guide|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currents like [[Saint-Simonianism]] and [[Fourierism]] attracted the interest of numerous later authors but failed to compete with the now dominant Marxist, Proudhonist, or Leninist schools on a political level. It has been noted that they exerted a significant influence on the emergence of new religious movements such as [[spiritualism]] and [[occult]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, Julian (2016). "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926 Socialist Religion and the Emergence of Occultism: A Genealogical Approach to Socialism and Secularization in 19th-Century France]."

''Aries'' 16/1, pp. 13–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and in practice ==
Perhaps the first utopian socialist was [[Thomas More]] (1478–1535), who wrote about an imaginary socialist society in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516. The contemporary definition of the English word "utopia" derives from this work and many aspects of More's description of Utopia were influenced by life in [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C.

[[File:Portrait of Robert Owen.png|thumb|[[Robert Owen]] was one of the founders of utopian socialism]]
[[File:Ehrerbietige Vorstellung und Einladung an meine lieben Mitmenschen.pdf|thumb|Utopian socialist pamphlet of Swiss social medical doctor [[Rudolf Sutermeister]] (1802–1868)]]
[[Saint-Simonianism]] was a [[France|French]] political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825). His ideas influenced [[Auguste Comte]] (who was, for a time, Saint-Simon's secretary), [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and many other thinkers and social theorists.

[[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858) was a successful Welsh businessman who devoted much of his profits to improving the lives of his employees. His reputation grew when he set up a textile factory in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]], co-funded by his teacher, the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] and introduced shorter working hours, schools for children and renovated housing. He wrote about his ideas in his book ''A New View of Society'' which was published in 1813 and ''An Explanation of the Cause of Distress which pervades the civilized parts of the world'' in 1823. He also set up an [[Owenite]] commune called [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in [[Indiana]]. This collapsed when one of his business partners ran off with all the profits. Owen's main contribution to socialist thought was the view that human social behavior is not fixed or absolute and that humans have the free will to organize themselves into any kind of society they wished.

[[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) rejected the [[industrial revolution]] altogether and thus the problems that arose with it, Fourier made various fanciful claims about the ideal world he envisioned. Despite some clearly non-socialist inclinations,{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} he contributed significantly even if indirectly to the socialist movement. His writings about turning work into play influenced the young Karl Marx and helped him devise his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]. Also a contributor to [[feminism]], Fourier invented the concept of ''[[phalanstère]]'', units of people based on a theory of passions and of their combination. Several colonies based on Fourier's ideas were founded in the United States by [[Albert Brisbane]] and [[Horace Greeley]].

[[Étienne Cabet]] (1788–1856), influenced by Robert Owen, published a book in 1840 entitled ''Travel and adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria'' in which he described an ideal [[communalist]] society. His attempts to form real socialist communities based on his ideas through the [[Icarians|Icarian movement]] did not survive, but one such community was the precursor of [[Corning, Iowa]]. Possibly inspired by [[Christianity]], he coined the word "communism" and influenced other thinkers, including Marx and Engels.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898) published ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in 1888, a utopian romance novel about a future socialist society. In Bellamy's utopia, property was held in common and money replaced with a system of equal credit for all. Valid for a year and non-transferable between individuals, credit expenditure was to be tracked via "credit-cards" (which bear no resemblance to modern credit cards which are tools of debt-finance). Labour was compulsory from age 21 to 40 and organised via various departments of an Industrial Army to which most citizens belonged. Working hours were to be cut drastically due to technological advances (including organisational). People were expected to be motivated by a Religion of Solidarity and criminal behavior was treated as a form of mental illness or "atavism". The book ranked as second or third best seller of its time (after ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ''Ben Hur''). In 1897, Bellamy published a sequel entitled ''Equality'' as a reply to his critics and which lacked the Industrial Army and other authoritarian aspects.

[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) published ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' in 1890, partly as a response to Bellamy's ''Looking Backwards'', which he equated with the socialism of Fabians such as Sydney Webb. Morris' vision of the future socialist society was centred around his concept of useful work as opposed to useless toil and the redemption of human labour. Morris believed that all work should be artistic, in the sense that the worker should find it both pleasurable and an outlet for creativity. Morris' conception of labour thus bears strong resemblance to Fourier's, while Bellamy's (the reduction of labour) is more akin to that of Saint-Simon or in aspects Marx.

The [[Brotherhood Church]] in Britain and the [[Life and Labor Commune]] in Russia were based on the [[Christian anarchist]] ideas of [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) and [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921) wrote about anarchist forms of socialism in their books. Proudhon wrote ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) and ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1847). Kropotkin wrote ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' (1892) and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'' (1912). Many of the anarchist collectives formed in [[Spain]], especially in [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]] were based on their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sam Dolgoff|authorlink=Sam Dolgoff|title=[[The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution, 1936–1939]]|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many participants in the historical [[kibbutz]] movement in [[Israel]] were motivated by utopian socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=From utopia to total institution in a single generation: the kibbutz and Bruderhof|author=Sheldon Goldenberg and Gerda R. Wekerle|journal=International Review of Modern Sociology|volume=2|issue=2|date=September 1972|pages=224–232|jstor=41420450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustin Souchy]] (1892–1984) spent most of his life investigating and participating in many kinds of socialist communities. Souchy wrote about his experiences in his autobiography ''Beware! Anarchist!''.

[[Behavioral psychologist]] [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) published ''[[Walden Two]]'' in 1948. The [[Twin Oaks Community]] was originally based on his ideas.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (born 1929) wrote about an impoverished anarchist society in her book ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' published in 1974 and in which the anarchists agree to leave their home planet and colonize a barely habitable moon in order to avoid a bloody revolution.

== Related concepts ==
Some communities of the modern [[intentional community]] movement, such as [[kibbutzim]], could be categorized as utopian socialist.

For example, religious sects whose members live communally such as the [[Hutterites]] or [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not usually called "utopian socialists", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1VwVSDBleUC&amp;pg=PA61|title=America's Economic Moralists: A History of Rival Ethics and Economics|author=Donald E. Frey|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2009|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classless modes of production in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are referred to as "[[primitive communism]]" by Marxists to stress their classless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/33429/Primitive+communism%3A+life+before+class+and+oppression|title=Primitive communism: life before class and oppression|publisher=Socialist Worker|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept is that of a socialist utopia, usually depicted in works of fiction as possible ways society can turn out to be in the future and often combined with notions of a technologically revolutionized economy.

A '''water-meadow''' (also '''water meadow''' or '''watermeadow''') is an area of [[grassland]] subject to controlled [[irrigation]] to increase [[agricultural productivity]].  Water-meadows were mainly used in Europe from the 16th to the early 20th centuries.  Working water-meadows have now largely disappeared, but the field patterns and water channels of derelict water-meadows remain common in areas where they were used, such as parts of [[Northern Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[England]].  Derelict water-meadows are often of importance as wetland wildlife habitats.

Water-meadows should not be confused with [[flood-meadow]]s, which are naturally covered in shallow water by seasonal [[flood]]ing from a [[river]].  "Water-meadow" is sometimes used more loosely to mean any level grassland beside a river.

==Types==
Two main types of water-meadow were used.

===Catchwork water-meadow===
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
These were used for fields on slopes, and relatively little engineering skill was required to construct them.  Water from a stream or spring was fed to the top of a sloping field, and gentle sloping terraces were formed along which the water could trickle in a zig-zag fashion down the field.  The water could be used again for fields lower down the slope.

===Bedwork water-meadow===
[[File:Flooded water-meadow.jpg|right|thumb|450px&lt;!-- Note: larger image size than normal, to show features referred to --&gt;|Flooded derelict [[#Bedwork water-meadow|bedwork water-meadow]] at [[Fordingbridge]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]].  Winter flooding has filled an old carrier channel along the crest of a ridge (running from right foreground to middle distance), and has also flooded the drainage channels (on left and into distance, where they join the river).  In use, water would have seeped from the carrier channel on the right, through the grass in the foreground into the drainage channel on the left, which would have been almost empty.]]''Bedwork'' or ''floated'' water-meadows were built on almost-level fields along broad river valleys, and required careful construction to ensure correct operation.

A [[leat]], called a ''main'', ''carrier'' or ''top carrier'', was used to divert water from the river and carry it down the valley at a gentler slope than the river, producing a [[hydrostatic head]] between the two.  Mains were often along the edge of the valley, each main supplying up to about {{Convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} of the valley.  The water from the main was used to supply many smaller carriers, on the crests of ridges built across the fields.  The channel on the crest of each ridge would overflow slowly down the sides (the ''panes'') of the ridge, the channel eventually tapering to an end at the tip of the ridge.  The seeping water would then be collected between the ridges, in ''drains'' or ''drawns'', these joining to form a ''bottom carrier'' or ''tail drain'' which returned the water to the river.  The ridges and the drains made an interlocking grid (like interlaced fingers), but the ridge-top channels and the drains did not connect directly.  A ''by-carrier'' took any water not needed for irrigation straight from the main back to the river.  The ridges varied in height depending on the available head &amp;ndash; usually from around {{Convert|10|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.  The pattern of carriers and drains was generally regular, but it was adapted to fit the natural topography of the ground and the locations of suitable places for the offtake and return of water.

The water flow was controlled by a system of ''hatches'' ([[sluice]] gates) and ''stops'' (small earth or wooden-board [[dam]]s).  Irrigation could be provided separately for each section of water-meadow.  Sometimes [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s took carriers over drains, and [[causeway]]s and [[culvert]]s provided access for [[wagon]]s.  The ''working'' or ''floating'' (irrigation) and maintenance of the water-meadow was done by a highly skilled craftsman called a ''drowner'' or ''waterman'', who was often employed by several adjacent farmers.

The terminology used for watermeadows varied considerably with locality and dialect.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Uses==
Water-meadow irrigation did not aim to flood the ground, but to keep it continuously damp &amp;ndash; a working water-meadow has no standing water.  Irrigation in early spring kept [[frost]]s off the ground and so allowed [[grass]] to grow several weeks earlier than otherwise, and in dry summer weather irrigation kept the grass growing.  It also allowed the ground to absorb any plant [[nutrient]]s or [[silt]] carried by the river water &amp;ndash; this fertilised the grassland, and incidentally also reduced [[eutrophication]] of the river water by [[nutrient pollution]].  The grass was used both for making [[hay]] and for [[grazing]] by [[livestock]] (usually [[cattle]] or [[sheep]]).

==Derelict water-meadows==
Former water-meadows are found along many river valleys, where the sluice gates, channels and field ridges may still be visible (however the ridges should not be confused with [[ridge and furrow]] topography, which is found on drier ground and has a very different origin in [[Tillage|arable farming]]).  The drains in a derelict water-meadow are generally clogged and wet, and most of the carrier channels are dry, with the smaller ones on the ridge-tops often invisible.  If any main carrier channels still flow, they usually connect permanently to the by-carriers.  The larger sluices may be concealed under the roots of trees (such as [[crack willow]]s), which have grown up from seedlings established in the brickwork.  The complex mixture of wet and drier ground often gives derelict water-meadows particularly high [[wetland]] [[biodiversity]].

==Working water-meadows==
Derelict water-meadows can be transformed into wildlife protection and conservation areas by repairing the irrigation, as is the case of [[Josefov Meadows]] in the Czech Republic. By imitating the natural river flooding which is rare in modern straightened and dammed rivers, a rich biodiversity can be restored and attract and sustain many rare and protected wetland species.

[[File:XASEdges.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Transitions that contribute to XAS edges]]
[[File:XASFig.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: Three regions of XAS data for the K-edge]]

'''X-ray [[absorption spectroscopy]]''' (XAS) is a widely used technique for determining the local geometric and/or electronic structure of matter. The experiment is usually performed at [[synchrotron radiation]] facilities, which provide intense and tunable [[X-ray]] beams. Samples can be in the gas-phase, solution, or as solids.

XAS data is obtained by tuning the [[photon]] energy, using a crystalline monochromator, to a range where [[core electron]]s can be excited ({{convert|0.1|-|100|keV|aJ|abbr=on|disp=comma}}). The edges are, in part, named by which core electron is excited: the [[principal quantum number]]s n = 1, 2, and 3, correspond to the K-, L-, and M-edges, respectively. For instance, excitation of a 1s electron occurs at the [[metal K-edge|K-edge]], while excitation of a 2s or 2p electron occurs at an [[metal L-edge|L-edge]] (Figure 1).

There are three main regions found on a spectrum generated by XAS data (Figure 2):
# The ''absorption threshold'' determined by the transition to the lowest unoccupied states: {{ordered list
 | list-style-type=lower-alpha
 | the states at the Fermi energy in metals giving a "rising edge" with an [[arc tangent]] shape; 
 | the [[exciton|bound core excitons]] in insulators with a [[Cauchy distribution|Lorentzian]]  line-shape (they occur in a pre-edge region at energies lower than the transitions to the lowest unoccupied level);
 }} 
# The X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure [[XANES]] introduced in 1980 and later in 1983 called also [[NEXAFS]] (Near-edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) which are dominated by core transitions to quasi bound states (multiple scattering resonances) for photoelectrons with kinetic energy in the range from 10 to 150 eV above the chemical potential, called "shape resonances" in molecular spectra since they are due to final states of short life-time degenerate with the continuum with the Fano line-shape. In this range multi-electron excitations and many-body final states in strongly correlated systems are relevant; 
# In the high kinetic energy range of the photoelectron the scattering cross-section with neighbor atoms is weak and the absorption spectra are dominated by [[EXAFS]] (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) where the scattering of the ejected [[photoelectron]] of neighboring atoms can be approximated by single scattering events. After it was shown in 1985 that multiple scattering theory can interpret both [[XANES]] and [[EXAFS]] the experimental analysis focusing on both regions is called [[XAFS]] [2].

XAS is a type of [[absorption spectroscopy]] from a core initial state with a well defined symmetry therefore the quantum mechanical [[selection rules]] select the symmetry of the final states in the continuum which usually are mixture of multiple components. The most intense features are due to electric-dipole allowed transitions (i.e. ''Δℓ'' = ± 1) to unoccupied final states. For example, the most intense features of a K-edge are due to core transitions from 1s → p-like final states, while the most intense features of the L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-edge are due to 2p → d-like final states.

XAS methodology can be broadly divided into four experimental categories that can give complementary results to each other: [[metal K-edge]], [[metal L-edge]], [[ligand K-edge]], and [[EXAFS]].

== Applications ==

XAS is a technique used in different scientific fields including [[Molecular physics|molecular]] and [[condensed matter physics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[earth science]], and [[biology]]. In particular, its unique sensitivity to the local structure, as compared to [[x-ray diffraction]], have been exploited for studying:
