      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15245">'''Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)''' is a term adopted by the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). It refers to Article 6 of the Convention’s original text (1992), focusing on six priority areas: education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and international cooperation on these issues. The implementation of all six areas has been identified as the pivotal factor for everyone to understand and participate in solving the complex challenges presented by [[climate change]]. The importance of ACE is reflected in other international frameworks such as the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs, 2015); the Global Action Programme for [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (GAP on ESD, 2014); the [[Aarhus Convention]] (2011); and the Bali Guidelines (2010).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246435e.pdf|title=Action for climate empowerment: Guidelines for accelerating solutions through education, training and public|last=UNESCO and UNFCCC|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UNFCCC|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3100-182-6|location=|pages=6, 14–18, 26, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACE calls on governments to develop and implement educational and public awareness programmes, train scientific, technical and managerial personnel, foster access to information, and promote public participation in addressing climate change and its effects. It also urges countries to cooperate in this process, by exchanging good practices and lessons learned, and strengthening national institutions. This wide scope of activities is guided by specific objectives that, together, are seen as crucial for effectively implementing climate adaptation and mitigation actions, and for achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Article 6 has been part of the UNFCCC since the Convention’s text was adopted on 9 May 1992. The importance of international cooperation in achieving Article 6 was emphasised in article 10(e) of the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto protocol]], adopted in 1997. In New Delhi, 2002, the eleventh [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] (COP 11) adopted the ‘New Delhi Work Programme’ (2002–2007) –to serve as a flexible framework for country-driven action on Article 6 in addressing the specific needs and circumstances of Parties, and reflecting their national priorities and initiatives. In 2007, COP 13 (in Bali) amended the New Delhi work programme and extended it for five years (2007-2012) and requested that regional workshops be organized by the UNFCCC secretariat as part of the review of the work programme, and to share lessons learned and best practices. Workshops were held in Europe (2009), Asia and the Pacific (2009), Small Island Developing States (2010), Africa (2010), and Latin America and the Caribbean (2010).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Doha, 2012, COP 18 adopted the eight-year Doha Work Programme on Article 6 of the UNFCCC (2012-2020). This programme invites Parties to designate and provide support, including technical and financial support, and access to information and materials to a National Focal Point for Article 6 of the UNFCCC. Furthermore, Parties agreed to organize an annual in-session Dialogue on Article 6 of the UNFCCC to present and enhance the relevant work. Since 2013, the annual Dialogue has provided a platform for Parties, representatives of relevant bodies established under the UNFCCC and relevant experts, practitioners and stakeholders to share their experiences and exchange ideas, best practices and lessons learned regarding the implementation of the Doha Work Programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 2015, at the 3rd annual dialogue on Article 6 in Bonn, it was decided that efforts related to the implementation of Article 6 would be referred to as Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE): a user-friendly, and unmistakable term for referring to Article 6 of the UNFCCC, as opposed to the very important Article 6 of the [[Paris Agreement]]. COP 20 In Lima, December 2014 adopted the ‘Lima Ministerial Declaration on Education and Awareness-raising’, reaffirming the importance of Article 6 of the UNFCCC in meeting its ultimate objective and in promoting climate-resilient [[sustainable development]]. In 2015 at COP 21 (Paris) governments agreed to cooperate in taking measures, as appropriate, to enhance climate change-related education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information, recognizing the importance of these steps to enhance actions under the [[Paris Agreement]]. In 2016, the 4th annual dialogue on ACE was held in Bonn and the intermediate review of the Doha Work Programme was completed. The final review of the Doha Work Programme will be carried out in 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
The 5th annual dialogue on ACE was held in Bonn on the 15 and 16 May with the topics 'education', 'training' and 'international cooperation'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/education_and_outreach/dialogues/items/10123.php 5th Dialogue on Action for Climate Empowerment] United Nations Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;

== The six elements of ACE ==
ACE addresses all six priority areas of Article 6: education, training, public awareness, public access to information, public participation, international cooperation. Education enables people to understand the causes and consequences of climate change, to make informed decisions and to take appropriate actions to address climate change.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016.

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco&lt;/nowiki&gt;. org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SC/pdf/Climate_Change_TF_Working_Docu- ment_09-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Training provides the technical skills and advanced knowledge needed to support the transition to green economies and sustainable, climate-resilient societies. Successful public awareness campaigns engage communities and individuals in the common effort needed to carry out national and international climate change policies. Ensuring public participation in decision-making and public access to information provides people with the tools and opportunities they need to play a more active role. These elements can all be strengthened through international cooperation. Governments and organizations can support each other with resources, ideas and inspiration for developing climate action programmes.&lt;ref&gt;UN CC:iNet. (n.d.)

== Guiding principles for ACE activities ==
Section B (14) of the Doha Work Programme provides guiding principles on the approach to and characteristics of ACE activities. While all 9 points listed in Section B (14) are important, it is pertinent to emphasize (d), adopting a gender and intergenerational approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== A gender approach ===
A gender approach means ensuring that climate actions are gender-responsive and promote women’s participation in decision-making. While women make up approximately 50% of the world population, in many countries women are less able to cope with – and are more exposed to – the adverse effects of climate change because they have lesser economic, political and legal clout.&lt;ref&gt;UNDP. 2013. ''Overview of linkages between gender and climate change.'' Overview of linkages between gender and climate change. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/&lt;/nowiki&gt; dam/undp/library/gender/Gender%20and%20Environment/PB1-AP-Overview-Gen- der-and-climate-change.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, supporting women’s empowerment and drawing on their experiences, knowledge and skills will make climate change responses more effective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Intergenerational ===
Intergenerational refers to engaging people of all ages in finding solutions for climate change, taking into special consideration the vulnerabilities of youth and the elderly, who have a reduced capacity to cope independently. Future generations are likely to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, yet they are also the least represented in current decisions on climate action.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;WRI. 2015. ''Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up''. World Resources Institute. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.wri.org/publication/building-climate-equity&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[world population]] is ageing very quickly. By 2050 approximately 1 in 5 people will be over the age of 60; the number of those aged 80 and older is expected to quadruple.&lt;ref&gt;UN DESA. 2002. ''World Population Ageing: 1950-2050''. United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to youth and the elderly, other vulnerable people such as women and traditionally marginalized groups (such as [[indigenous peoples]], [[ethnic minorities]] and people with disabilities) have limited capacity to engage in policy-making, and risk being overlooked if their needs are not explicitly included in planning. Formal decision-making structures strive to ensure the participation of those most vulnerable and least represented, recognizing that specialized efforts need to be invested in engaging vulnerable communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International frameworks related to ACE ==

=== Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ===
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goals}}

At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on 25 September 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets to end poverty, inequality and injustice, and tackle climate change by 2030. The SDGs build on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), eight anti-poverty targets that the world committed to achieving by 2015. The new SDGs, and the broader sustainability agenda, go much further than the MDGs. Three of the 17 goals and two associated targets have particular relevance for ACE: 
* '''Goal 4: Quality Education''': Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, and particularly Target 4.7: “By 2030 ensure all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including among others through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development.” 
* '''Goal 13: Climate Action''': Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, and particularly Target 13.3: “Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.” 
* '''Goal 16: Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies''', and particularly Target 16.10: “Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements” and Target 16.7: “Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (GAP on ESD) ===
{{See also|Education for sustainable development#Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (GAP on ESD)}}

The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development took place from 2005 to 2014, with the goal of emphasizing education in all its forms (formal, non-formal and informal) as an indispensable element for achieving sustainable development. In November 2014, as the official follow-up to the DESD, UNESCO launched the Global Action Programme (GAP) for ESD with the overall objective to scale up action on ESD worldwide. Due to its strong linkages with sustainable development, the GAP on ESD provides an excellent framework for understanding the types of education, training and public awareness initiatives conducive to enabling people of all ages to understand and implement solutions for solving the complex problems presented by climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Aarhus Convention ===
{{Main|Aarhus Convention}}

The Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) provides the main international framework regulating such matters. The Aarhus Convention grants public rights and imposes obligations on governmental authorities regarding, inter alia, public participation in environmental decision-making. In 2015, the Maastricht Recommendations on Promoting Effective Public Participation in Decision-making in Environmental Matters were published as a practical tool to improve public participation in environmental decision-making, including good practice recommendations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== UNEP Bali Guidelines on Principle 10 ===
In order to catalyze and accelerate action to implement Principle 10 of the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|Rio Declaration]], governments adopted the Guidelines for the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters at the 11th Special Session of the UNEP Governing Council/ Global Ministerial Environmental Forum in Bali, Indonesia. These voluntary guidelines demonstrate a willingness by governments to engage the public more thoroughly at all levels to protect and manage the environment and related resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview  ==
India’s [[rhetoric]] could be said to be a link between the [[West]] and [[East]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Rhetoric: An Historical and Cross-Cultural Introduction|last=Kennedy|first=George A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0195109333|location=New York|pages=171–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Greek [[sophist]]s, some Indian rhetors in the seventh century BCE held public debates on religion to the public’s amusement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Vedic verses]], composed over three thousand years ago, use similes, similar to [[ancient Greek poetry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Indian rhetoric utilizes systems of categorization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These categorizations appear in early Buddhist writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, India’s Hindu [[caste system]] led to differences in how member of different castes addressed each other, with people from lower castes referring to themselves in a derogatory manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, the [[Upanishads]], a collection of ancient Brahmin dialogues, place value in categorizing technical terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[History of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhist]] rhetoric places value in calm and humorous discourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nyanya Rhetoric ===
Lloyd (2007) has proposed [[Nyaya]]’s inclusion in the field of rhetorical studies, exploring its methods within their historical context, comparing its approach to the “traditional logical syllogism, and relating it to the contemporary perspectives [[Stephen Toulmin]], [[Kenneth Burke]], and [[Chaïm Perelman|Chaim Perelman]].”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Keith|date=2007|title=Rethinking Rhetoric from an Indian Perspective: Implications in the ‘Nyaya Sutra.’|url=|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=26|issue=4|page=365|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyaya is a [[Sanskrit]] word which means just or right and refers to “the science of right and wrong reasoning” (Radhakrishnan &amp; Moore, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;356).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=A Source Book in Indian Philosophy|last=Radhakrishnan|first=Sarvepalli|last2=Moore|first2=Charles Alexander|date=|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1957|isbn=|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sutra]] is also a Sanskrit word which means string or thread. Here Sutra refers to a collection of [[aphorism]] in the form of a manual. Each Sutra is a short rule usually consisted of one or two sentences. Example of a Sutra: “Reality is truth, and what is true is so, irrespective of whether we know it is, or are aware of that truth.” The [[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyaya Sutra]] is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Aksapada Gautama.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nyaya Sutras of Gotama|last=Vidyabhusana|first=M.M. Satisa Chandra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1930|isbn=8120807480|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the foundational text of the Nyaya School of Hindu Philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown. It is estimated that the text was composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zimmer (2013) has said that the text may have been composed by more one author, over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophies of India|last=Zimmer|first=Heinrich|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415462327|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishan and Moore (1957) placed its origin in the “third century BC…..though some of the contents of the Nyaya Sutra are certainly a post-Christian era” (p.&amp;nbsp;36).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Vidyabhushana|Vidyabhusana]] (1930) stated that the ancient school of Nyaya extended over a period of one thousand years, beginning with Gotama about 550 BC and ending with Vatsyayana about 400 AD.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''Nyaya'' provides significant insight into the Indian rhetoric.  Naya presents an argumentative approach that works a [[rhetor]] how to decide about any argument. In addition, it proposes a new approach of thinking of a cultural tradition which is different from the Western rhetoric. It also broadens the view of rhetoric and the relationship among human beings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  ''Nyaya'' proposes an enlightenment of reality which is associated with situations, time, and places. Toulmin emphasizes on the situational dimension of argumentative genre as the fundamental component of any rhetorical logic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the contrary, ''Nyaya'' views this situational rhetoric in a new way which offers context of practical arguments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[artificial intelligence]] research, the '''situated approach''' builds agents that are designed to behave effectively successfully in their environment. This requires designing AI "from the bottom-up" by focussing on the basic perceptual and motor skills required to survive. The situated approach gives a much lower priority to abstract reasoning or problem-solving skills.

The approach was originally proposed as an alternative to traditional approaches (that is, approaches popular before 1985 or so).
After several decades, classical [[AI]] technologies started to face intractable issues (e.g. combinatorial explosion) when confronted with real-world modeling problems. All approaches to address these issues focus on modeling intelligences situated in an environment. They have become known as the situated approach to AI.

==Emergence of a concept==

=== From traditional AI to Nouvelle AI===
During the late 1980s, the approach now known as '''Nouvelle AI''' (''Nouvelle'' means new in French) was pioneered at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] by [[Rodney Brooks]]. As opposed to classical or traditional [[artificial intelligence]], Nouvelle AI purposely avoided the traditional goal of modeling human-level performance, but rather tries to create systems with intelligence at the level of insects, closer to real-world robots. But eventually, at least at [[MIT]] new AI did lead to an attempt for humanoid AI in [[Cog (project)|the Cog Project]].

===From Nouvelle AI to behavior-based and situated AI===
The conceptual shift introduced by nouvelle AI flourished in the robotics area, given way to '''behavior-based artificial intelligence''' (BBAI), a [[methodology]] for developing [[AI]] based on a modular decomposition of intelligence. It was made famous by [[Rodney Brooks]]: his [[subsumption architecture]] was one of the earliest attempts to describe a mechanism for developing BBAI. It is extremely popular in [[robotics]] and to a lesser extent to implement [[Intelligent agent|intelligent virtual agents]] because it allows the successful creation of real-time dynamic systems that can run in complex environments.  For example, it underlies the intelligence of the [[Sony]], [[Aibo]] and many [[RoboCup]] robot teams.

Realizing that in fact all these approaches were aiming at building not an abstract intelligence, but rather an intelligence '''situated''' in a given environment, they have come to be known as the situated approach. In fact, this approach stems out from early insights of [[Alan Turing]], describing the need to build machines equipped with sense organs to learn directly from the real-world instead of focusing on abstract activities, such as playing chess.{{Relevance-inline|This theory certainly has been put forward by philosophers long before Turing. There is no need to compete who formulated a vague idea first.}}

==Definitions==
Classically, a software entity is defined as a simulated element, able to act on itself and on its environment, and which has an internal representation of itself and of the outside world. An entity can communicate with other entities, and its behavior is the consequence of its perceptions, its representations, and its interactions with the other entities.

===AI loop===
Simulating entities in a virtual environment requires simulating the entire process that goes from a perception of the environment, or more generally from a stimulus, to an action on the environment. This process is called the AI loop and technology used to simulate it can be subdivided in two categories. ''Sensorimotor or low-level'' AI deals with either the perception problem (what is perceived?) or the animation problem (how are actions executed?). ''Decisional or high-level'' AI deals with the action selection problem (what is the most appropriate action in response to a given perception, i.e. what is the most appropriate behavior?).

===Traditional or symbolic AI===
There are two main approaches in decisional AI. The vast majority of the technologies available on the market, such as [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning algorithms]], [[finite state machines]] (FSA), or [[expert systems]], are based on the '''traditional or symbolic''' AI approach. Its main characteristics are:
* It is '''top-down''': it subdivides, in a recursive manner, a given problem into a series of sub-problems that are supposedly easier to solve.
* It is '''knowledge-based''': it relies on a symbolic description of the world, such as a set of rules.

However, the limits of traditional AI, which goal is to build systems that mimic human intelligence, are well-known: inevitably, a [[combinatorial explosion]] of the number of rules occurs due to the complexity of the environment. In fact, it is impossible to predict all the situations that will be encountered by an autonomous entity.

===Situated or behavioral AI===
In order to address these issues, another approach to decisional AI, also known as '''situated or behavioral''' AI, has been proposed. It does not attempt to model systems that produce deductive reasoning processes, but rather systems that '''behave realistically in their environment'''. The main characteristics of this approach are the following:
* It is '''bottom-up''': it relies on elementary behaviors, which can be combined to implement more complex behaviors.
* It is '''behavior-based''': it does not rely on a symbolic description of the environment, but rather on a model of the interactions of the entities with their environment.

The goal of situated AI is to model entities that are autonomous in their environment. This is achieved thanks to both the intrinsic robustness of the control architecture, and its adaptation capabilities to unforeseen situations.

===Situated agents===
In [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]], the term '''situated''' refers to an [[Intelligent agent|agent]] which is [[embedded systems|embedded]] in an environment. The term ''situated'' is commonly used to refer to [[robot]]s, but some researchers argue that [[software]] agents can also be situated if:

* they exist in a [[dynamical system|dynamic]] (rapidly changing) environment, which
* they can [[wikt:manipulate|manipulate]] or change through their actions, and which
* they can [[sense]] or [[Perception|perceive]].

Examples might include web-based agents, which can alter data or trigger processes (such as purchases) over the Internet, or virtual-reality bots which inhabit and change virtual worlds, such as [[Second Life]].

Being situated is generally considered to be part of being [[Embodied embedded cognition|embodied]], but it is useful to consider each perspective individually.  The situated perspective emphasizes that intelligent behavior derives from the environment and the agent's [[interaction]]s with it. The nature of these interactions are defined by an agent's embodiment.

==Implementation principles==

=== Modular decomposition===
The most important attribute of a system driven by situated AI is that the intelligence is controlled by a set of independent semi-[[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] modules. In the original systems, each module was actually a separate [[peripheral|device]] or was at least conceived of as running on its own [[Process (computing)|processing]] [[thread (computer science)|thread]]. Generally, though, the modules are just [[abstraction]]s. In this respect, situated AI may be seen as a [[software engineering]] approach to AI, perhaps akin to [[object-oriented programming|object oriented design]].

Situated AI is often associated with [[reactive planning]], but the two are not synonymous. Brooks advocated an extreme version of [[cognitive minimalism]] which required initially that the behavior modules were [[finite state machines]] and thus contained no conventional [[memory]] or [[learning]]. This is associated with reactive AI because reactive AI requires reacting to the current state of the world, not to an [[Intelligent agent|agent]]'s memory or preconception of that world. However, learning is obviously key to realistic [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]], so this constraint has been relaxed, though not entirely abandoned.

===Action selection mechanism===
The situated AI community has presented several solutions to modeling decision-making processes, also known as action selection mechanisms. The first attempt to solve this problem goes back to ''subsumption architectures'',&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, R. (1986). A robust layered control system for a mobile robot. IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation 2(1):14-23.&lt;/ref&gt; which were in fact more an implementation technique than an algorithm. However, this attempt paved the way to several others, in particular the ''free-flow hierarchies''&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt J. and Payton D (1989). A fine-grained alternative to the subsumption architecture for mobile robot control. In: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks 2:317-324.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''activation networks''.&lt;ref&gt;Maes P. (1989). How to do the right thing. Technical Report AIM-1180, MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison of the structure and performances of these two mechanisms demonstrated the advantage of using ''free-flow hierarchies'' in solving the action selection problem.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell T. (1993). Computational mechanisms for action selection. PhD, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyrrell T (1993). The use of hierarchies for action selection. Adaptive Behavior 1(4):387-420.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''motor schemas''&lt;ref&gt;Arkin R. Motor schema based navigation for a mobile robot: an approach to programming by behavior. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 264-271, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''process description languages''&lt;ref&gt;Steels, L. (1993). Building agents with autonomous behavior systems. In: The artificial route to artificial intelligence. Building situated embodied agents. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt; are two other approaches that have been used with success for autonomous robots.

The ACTC is located in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. The five members of the ACTC are:
*[[Augsburg University]]
*[[Hamline University]]
*[[Macalester College]]
*[[St. Catherine University]]
*[[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]]

The ACTC was officially incorporated in 1975 in order to share and enrich academic offerings for the students of the five institutions. The consortium continues to promote student exchange between its member campuses and to develop and share academic programs. The opportunity for cross-registration makes possible a range and depth of course offerings and majors unavailable at any single institution.

According to the ACTC's official website (see link below), "this partnership combines the benefits of our campuses' small, liberal arts atmospheres with the diverse opportunities of a large university. Students enrolled at one institution are able to experience the strengths and benefits of each school."

'''Buy Nothing Day''' ('''BND''') is an international day of protest against [[consumerism]]. In North America, the United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden, Buy Nothing Day is held the day after U.S. [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], concurrent to [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]; elsewhere, it is held the following day, which is the last Saturday in November.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/internetnews/story/0,7369,402170,00.html Buy Nothing Day]"''The Guardian.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"&gt;"[http://abillionpeople.org/buy-nothing-day/ Buy Nothing Day]"''Adbusters.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Buy Nothing Day was founded in [[Vancouver]] by artist Ted Dave&lt;ref&gt;Crook, Barbara. "Can you say bye to buying 1 day a year?" ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''. September 25, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently promoted by ''[[Adbusters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/11/40142 Click Here to Buy Nothing]. Joanna Glasner. [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']], November 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; based in Canada.

The first Buy Nothing Day was organized in Canada in September 1992 "as a day for society to examine the issue of overconsumption." In 1997, it was moved to the Friday after American Thanksgiving, also called [[Black Friday (shopping)|"Black Friday"]], which is one of the ten busiest shopping days in the United States. In 2000, some advertisements by ''Adbusters'' promoting Buy Nothing Day were denied advertising time by almost all major television networks except for [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"/&gt; Soon, campaigns started appearing in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Austria, Germany, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enkopfridag.se/1998.php|title=1998, köp-inget-dagen|publisher=En köpfri dag|language=Swedish|author=Jonas Lindkvist|date=1998|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation now includes more than 65 nations.

==Activities==
[[File:Buy Nothing Day trolley (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Buy Nothing Day sign attached to a Walmart shopping trolley by an activist]]
Various gatherings and forms of protest have been used on Buy Nothing Day to draw attention to the problem of [[overconsumption]]:
* Credit card cut-up: Participants stand in a shopping mall, shopping center, or store with a pair of scissors and a poster that advertises help for people who want to put an end to mounting debt and extortionate interest rates with one simple cut. Namely, by destroying their credit card by cutting it with the scissors.
* Free, non-commercial street parties
* [[Sit-in]]
* [[Zombie walk]]: Participant "zombies" wander around shopping malls or other consumer havens with a blank stare. When asked what they are doing, participants describe Buy Nothing Day.
* Whirl-mart: Participants silently steer their shopping carts around a shopping mall or store in a long, baffling conga line without putting anything in the carts or actually making any purchases.
* Public protests
* Wildcat General Strike: A strategy used for the 2009 Buy Nothing Day where participants not only do not buy anything for twenty-four hours but also keep their lights, televisions, computers and other non-essential appliances turned off, their cars parked, and their phones turned off or unplugged from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}
* Buy Nothing Day hike: Rather than celebrating consumerism by shopping, participants celebrate The Earth and nature.
* Buy Nothing + [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]]: As the monthly Critical Mass bicycle ride often falls on this day or near, rides in some cities acknowledge and celebrate Buy Nothing Day.
* Buy Nothing Day paddle along the San Francisco waterfront: This event is promoted by the Bay Area Sea Kayakers to kayak along the notoriously consumptive San Francisco waterfront.
* The Buy Nothing Coat Exchange: began in Rhode Island and became part of the Buy Nothing Day some twenty years ago. Coupling the two events was the brainchild of Greg Gerritt, an expert in environmental studies and long term activist in consumerism and global warming. Similar Winter Coat Exchanges take place on Buy Nothing Day in Kentucky, Utah and Oregon. Coats are collected throughout the month of November from anyone who wants to donate and brought to various locations within each state. On the day after Thanksgiving, many opt out of the Black Friday madness to donate and/or volunteer. On that day, anyone who needs a winter coat is welcome to exchange one or just take one. The lines in Providence RI form early and are long which punctuates the need that is prevalent in many cities and towns. The combination of the two events has become a welcomed tradition in RI.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==
While critics of the day charge that Buy Nothing Day simply causes participants to buy the next day,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thetyee.ca/Views/2006/11/24/BND/ Why I Shop on Buy Nothing Day], TheTyee.ca, November 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters states that it "isn't just about changing your habits for one day" but "about starting a lasting lifestyle commitment to consuming less and producing less [[waste]]."{{cite quote|date=November 2018}}

Other campaigns, such as Shift Your Shopping, attempt to redirect spending away from corporate chains and online giants toward locally owned, community-based businesses as a means to combat consumerism. Even some independent business advocates, such as the [[American Independent Business Alliance]], recognize "Black Friday" frenzy does little for independent businesses and instead encourage people to consider giving gifts but not necessarily "things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Gifts Don't Have to Be "Stuff"|url=http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff|publisher=American Independent Business Alliance|archivedate=October 17, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017183448/http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaming==
[[Adbusters]] in 2011 renamed the event Occupy Xmas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://occupyxmas.net/ Occupy Xmas], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231142336/http://www.occupyxmas.net/ |date=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Occupy movement]].  Buy Nothing Day was first joined with Adbuster's [[Buy Nothing Christmas]] campaign.  Shortly thereafter, Lauren Bercovitch, the production manager at Adbusters Media Foundation publicly embraced the principles of Occupy Xmas, advocating "something as simple as buying locally—going out and putting money into your local economy—or making your Christmas presents".&lt;ref&gt;[https://thefulcrum.ca/news/an-occupied-christmas/ An interview with Lauren Bercovitch]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the central message of Occupy X-mas and Occupy Christmas differed in that Occupy X-Mas called for a "buy nothing Christmas" and Occupy Christmas called for support of local economy, artists, and craftspeople in holiday shopping.  The union of these ideologies calls for a Buy Nothing Day to kick off a season of supporting local economy and family.

'''Challenger Center for Space Science Education''' is a [[United States]] 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] headquartered in [[Washington, DC]]. It was founded in 1986 by the families of the astronauts who died in the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] on January 28, 1986.

The organization offers dynamic, hands-on exploration and discovery opportunities to students around the world. These programs equip students with the knowledge, confidence, and skills that will help better our national social and economic well-being.

Challenger Learning Centers give students the chance to become astronauts and engineers and solve real-world problems as they share the thrill of discovery on missions through the Solar System. Using space simulation and role-playing strategies, students bring their classroom studies to life and cultivate the skills needed for future success.

'''Church history''' or '''ecclesiastical history''' as an [[academic discipline]] studies the [[history of Christianity]] and the way the [[Christian Church]] has developed since its inception. 

[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]] defined church history as "the spiritual side of the history of civilized people ever since our Master's coming".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]], ''Early Church History to A.D. 313'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A. M. Renwick, however, defines it as an account of the Church's success and failure in carrying out Christ's [[Great Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Renwick and [[Allan Harman|A. M. Harman]], ''The Story of the Church'' (3rd ed.), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Renwick suggests a fourfold division of church history into [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary activity]], [[Ecclesiastical polity|church organization]], [[Christian theology|doctrine]] and "the effect on human life".

Church history is often, but not always, studied from a Christian perspective. Writers from different Christian traditions will often highlight people and events particularly relevant to their own [[denominational]] history. Catholic and Orthodox writers often highlight the achievements of the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]], while [[evangelical]] historians may focus on the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Great Awakening]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13438">'''Computational cognition''' (sometimes referred to as '''computational cognitive science''' or '''computational psychology''') is the study of the [[computation]]al basis of [[education|learning]] and [[inference]] by [[mathematical model]]ing, [[computer simulation]], and [[behaviorism|behavioral]] experiments. In psychology, it is an approach which develops computational models based on experimental results. It seeks to understand the basis behind the human method of [[information processing|processing of information]]. Early on computational cognitive scientists sought to bring back and create a scientific form of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano’s]] psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, C., &amp; Sokal, Michael M.|first=|date=2000|title=Dispelling the "Mystery" of Computational Cognitive Science|url=|journal=History of Psychology|volume=3 | issue = 1 |pages=62–66|via=|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.3.1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==
{{Main article|Artificial intelligence}}
There are two main purposes for the productions of artificial intelligence: to produce intelligent behaviors regardless of the quality of the results, and to model after intelligent behaviors found in nature.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;  In the beginning of its existence, there was no need for artificial intelligence to emulate the same behavior as human cognition. Until 1960s, economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] attempted to formalize human problem-solving skills by using the results of psychological studies to develop programs that implement the same problem-solving techniques as people would. Their works laid the foundation for [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]] and computational cognition, and even some advancements for [[cognitive science]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="Haugeland"/&gt;

The field of symbolic AI is based on the [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]] by Simon and Newell, which states that expressing aspects of cognitive intelligence can be achieved through the manipulation of [[Physical symbol system|symbols]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt; However, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] focused more on the initial purpose of artificial intelligence, which is to breakdown the essence of logical and abstract reasoning regardless of whether or not human employs the same mechanism.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;

Over the next decades, the progress made in artificial intelligence started to be focused more on developing logic-based and knowledge-based programs, veering away from the original purpose of symbolic AI. Researchers started to believe that artificial intelligence may never be able to imitate some intricate processes of human cognition like [[Machine perception|perception]] or [[Machine learning|learning]]. A chief failing of AI is not being able to achieve a complete likeness to human cognition due to the lack of emotion and the impossibility of implementing it into an AI. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Megill|first=J.|date=2014|title=Emotion, cognition and artificial intelligence.|url=|journal=Minds And Machines|volume=24 | issue = 2 |pages=189–199|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-013-9320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;They began to take a “sub-symbolic” approach to create intelligence without specifically representing that knowledge. This movement led to the emerging discipline of [[computational model]]ing, [[connectionism]], and [[computational intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt;

==Computational modeling==
{{Main article|Computational model}}
As it contributes more to the understanding of human cognition than artificial intelligence, computational cognitive modeling emerged from the need to define various cognition functionalities (like motivation, emotion, or perception) by representing them in computational models of mechanisms and processes.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt; Computational models study [[complex system]]s through the use of specific algorithms and extensive [[computational resource]]s, or variables, to produce [[computer simulation]].&lt;ref name="Simulations"/&gt; Simulation is achieved by adjusting the variables, changing one alone or even combining them together, to observe the effect on the outcomes. The results help experimenters make predictions about what would happen in the real system if those similar changes were to occur. &lt;ref&gt; Sun, R. (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

When computational models attempt to mimic human cognitive functioning, all the details of the function must be known for them to transfer and display properly through the models, allowing researchers to thoroughly understand and test an existing theory because no variables are vague and all variables are modifiable. Consider a [[Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model|model of memory built by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968]], it showed how rehearsal leads to long-term memory, where the information being rehearsed would be stored. Despite the advancement it made in revealing the function of memory, this model fails to provide answers to crucial questions like: how much information can be rehearsed at a time? How long does it take for information to transfer from rehearsal to long-term memory? Similarly, other computational models raise more questions about cognition than they answer, making their contributions much less significant for the understanding of human cognition than other cognitive approaches.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; An additional shortcoming of computational modeling is its reported lack of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo Echavarria|first=R.|date=2009|title=Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science.|url=|journal=Minds and Machines|volume=19 | issue = 2 |pages=181–197|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-009-9155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]] in his ACT-R uses the functions of computational models and the findings of cognitive science. Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational is based on the theory that the brain consists of several modules which perform specialized functions separate of each other.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; The ACT-R model is classified as a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|symbolic]] approach to cognitive science.&lt;ref name="Polk"/&gt;

==Connectionist network==
{{Main article|Connectionism}}
Another approach which deals more with the semantic content of cognitive science is connectionism or neural network modeling. Connectionism relies on the idea that the brain consists of simple units or nodes and the behavioral response comes primarily from the layers of connections between the nodes and not from the environmental stimulus itself.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt;

Connectionist network differs from computational modeling specifically because of two functions: [[Neural backpropagation|neural back-propagation]] and [[Parallel processing (psychology)|parallel-processing]]. Neural back-propagation is a method utilized by connectionist network to show evidence of learning. After a connectionist network produce a response, the stimulated results are compared to real-life situational results. The feedback provided by the backward propagation of errors would be used to improve accuracy for the network’s subsequent responses.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The second function, parallel-processing, stemmed from the belief that knowledge and perception are not limited to specific modules but rather are distributed throughout the cognitive networks. The present of parallel distributed processing has been shown in psychological demonstrations like the [[Stroop effect]], where the brain seems to be analyzing the perception of color and meaning of language at the same time.&lt;ref name="Rumelhart"/&gt; However, this theoretical approach has been continually disproved because the two cognitive functions for color-perception and word-forming are operating separately and simultaneously, not parallel of each other.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

The field of cognition may have benefitted from the use of connectionist network but because of the completed system, setting up the neural network models can be quite a tedious task and the results may be less interpretable than the system they are trying to model. Therefore, the results can be used as evidence for broad theory of cognition without explaining the particular process happening within the cognitive function. Other disadvantages of connectionism lie in the research methods it employs or hypothesis it tests, which has been proven inaccurate or ineffective often, taking connectionist models further from an accurate representation of how the brain functions. These issues cause neural network models to be ineffective on studying higher forms of information-processing, and hinder connectionism from advancing the general understanding of human cognition.&lt;ref name="Garson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15933">The '''decline effect''' may occur when scientific claims receive decreasing support over time. The term was first described by parapsychologist [[Joseph Banks Rhine]] in the 1930s to describe the disappearing of [[extrasensory perception]] (ESP) of psychic experiments conducted by Rhine over the course of study or time. In its more general term, Cronbach, in his review article of science "Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology" referred to the phenomenon as "generalizations decay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0076829| title = Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology| journal = American Psychologist| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 116–127| year = 1975| last1 = Cronbach | first1 = L. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was once again used in a 2010 article by [[Jonah Lehrer]] published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="Lehrer"&gt;{{Cite web | author = Jonah_Lehrer | title = The Truth Wears Off | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer | publisher = The New Yorker | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

In his article, Lehrer gives several examples where the decline effect is allegedly showing. In the first example, the development of second generation anti-psychotic drugs, reveals that the first tests had demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the subjects' psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt; However, after repeating tests this effect declined and in the end it was not possible to document that these drugs had any better effect than the first generation anti-psychotics.

A well-known example of the decline effect can be seen in early experiments conducted by Professor [[Jonathan Schooler]] examining the effects of verbalization on non-verbal cognition. In an initial series of studies Schooler found evidence that verbal rehearsal of previously seen faces or colors markedly impaired subsequent recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is referred to as ''[[verbal overshadowing]]''. Although verbal overshadowing effects have been repeatedly observed by Schooler, as well as other researchers, they have also proven to be somewhat challenging to replicate.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chin |first=J. M. |last2=Schooler |first2=J. W. |year=2009 |title=Why do words hurt? content, process, and criterion shift accounts of verbal overshadowing |journal=European Journal of Cognitive Psychology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=396–413 |doi=10.1080/09541440701728623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schooler&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbal overshadowing effects in a variety of domains were initially easy to find, but then became increasingly difficult to replicate indicating a decline effect in the phenomenon. Schooler has now become one of the more prominent researchers examining the decline effect. He has argued that addressing the decline effect may require a major revision to the scientific process whereby scientists log their protocols before conducting their research and then, regardless of outcome, report their findings in an open access repository (such as Brain Nosek's "Project Implicit").&lt;ref&gt;http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/&lt;/ref&gt; Schooler is currently working with the Fetzer Foundation to organize a major meeting of scientists from various disciplines to consider alternative accounts of the decline effect and approaches for rigorously addressing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/1047840X.2012.705246| title = Modernizing Science: Comments on Nosek and Bar-Anan (2012)| journal = Psychological Inquiry| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 281–284| year = 2012| last1 = Mooneyham | first1 = B. W. | last2 = Franklin | first2 = M. S. | last3 = Mrazek | first3 = M. D. | last4 = Schooler | first4 = J. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Danish zoologist Anders Møller discovered a connection between symmetry and sexual preference of female birds in nature. This sparked a huge interest in the topic and a lot of follow-up research was published. In three years following the original discovery, 90% of studies confirmed Møller's hypothesis. However, the same outcome was published in just four out of eight research papers in 1995, and only a third in next three years.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2"&gt;{{Cite news | author = Jonah Lehrer | title = The Mysterious Decline Effect | url = https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/12/the-mysterious-decline-effect | publisher = Wired | date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==

One of the explanations of the effect is [[regression to the mean|regression toward the mean]] (this is a statistical phenomenon happening when a variable is extreme on the first experiments and by later experiments tend to regress towards average), although this does not explain why sequential results decline in a linear fashion, rather than fluctuating about the true mean as would be expected.&lt;ref name=schooler/&gt;

Another reason may be the [[publication bias]]: scientists and scientific journals prefer to publish positive results of experiments and tests over null results, especially with new ideas.&lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;  As a result, the journals may refuse to publish papers that do not prove that the idea works. Later, when an idea is accepted, journals may refuse to publish papers that support it.

In the debate that followed the original article, Lehrer answered some of the questions by claiming that scientific observations might be shaped by one's expectations and desires, sometimes even unconsciously, thus creating a bias towards the desired outcome.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt;

A significant factor contributing to the decline effect can also be the sample size of the scientific research, since smaller sample size is very likely to give more extreme results, suggesting a significant breakthrough, but also a higher probability of an error. Typical examples of this effect are the opinion polls, where those including a larger number of people are closer to reality than those with a small pool of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Allen Paulos | authorlink = John Allen Paulos | title = The decline effect and why scientific 'Truth' so often turns out wrong | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WhosCounting/decline-effect-scientific-truth-turns-wrong/story?id=12510202 | publisher = ABC News | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion would not appear to account for the observed decrease over time regardless of sample size. Researcher [[John Ioannidis]] offers some explanation. He states that early research is usually small and more prone to highly positive results supporting the original idea, including early confirmatory studies. Later, as larger studies are being made, they often show regression to the mean and a failure to repeat the early exaggerated results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J. P.

A 2012 report by National Public Radio's show "On The Media"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Brooke Gladstone |title=The 'Decline Effect' and Scientific Truth |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/jun/29/decline-effect-and-scientific-truth/ |publisher=NPR On The Media |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704061146/http://www.onthemedia.org/2012/jun/29/decline-effect-and-scientific-truth/ |archivedate=2012-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; covered scientists who are exploring another option: that the act of observing the universe changes the universe, and that repeated measurement might actually be rendering earlier results invalid. In other words, antipsychotic drugs ''did'' work originally, but the more we measured their effectiveness, the more the laws governing those drugs changed so they ceased to be effective. Science fiction author [[Geoff Ryman]] explores this idea and its possible ramifications further in his 2012 short story &lt;u&gt;What We Found&lt;/u&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Geoff Ryman | title = The Year's Best Science Fiction | url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Years-Best-Science-Fiction/dp/1250003547 | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novelette]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Mike Addelman | title = Ryman wins one of world’s top science fiction prizes | url = http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=8297 | publisher = University of Manchester | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contesting views==

Several commenters have contested Jonah Lehrer's view of the decline effect being a problematic side of the phenomenon, as presented in his ''New Yorker'' article. "The decline effect is troubling because it reminds us how difficult it is to prove anything. We like to pretend that our experiments define the truth for us. But that's often not the case. Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe." &lt;ref name="Lehrer" /&gt;

[[Steven Novella]] also challenges Lehrer's view of the decline effect, arguing that Lehrer is concentrating on new discoveries on the cutting edge of scientific research and applying the conclusions to all areas of science. Novella points out that most of the examples used by Lehrer come from medicine, psychology and ecology, scientific fields most influenced by a complex human aspect and that there is not much evidence of the decline effect in other areas of science, such as physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Steven Novella | title = The Decline Effect | url = http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2580/ | publisher = Neurologicablog | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist, [[Paul Zachary Myers]], is also contesting Lehrer's view on the decline effect being a surprising phenomenon in science, claiming that: "This isn't surprising at all. It's what we expect, and there are many very good reasons for the shift." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Paul Zachary Myers |title=Science is not dead |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/science_is_not_dead.php |publisher=Scienceblogs |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303224843/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/science_is_not_dead.php |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehrer's statements about the difficulty of proving anything and publication bias find support from [[Jerry A. Coyne]]. Coyne holds that in the fields of genetics and evolutionary biology, almost no research is replicated and there is a premium motivation offered for publishing positive results of research studies. However, he also contests Lehrer's approach of applying conclusions on all fields of science, stating that in physics, chemistry or molecular biology, previous results are constantly repeated by others in order to progress in their own research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Jerry Allen Coyne | title = Why Evolution is True | url = http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/the-decline-effect-can-we-demonstrate-anything-in-science/ | publisher = Wordpress | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

One concern that some &lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;{{Cite web | author = John Horgan | title = The truth we'll doubt: Does the decline effect mean that all science is "truthy"? | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=the-truth-well-doubt-does-the-decli-2010-12-13 | publisher = Scientific America | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have expressed is that Lehrer's article may further fuel people's skepticism about academic science. It was long believed that Lehrer's article originally hinted that academic science is not as rigid as people would like to believe. It is especially the article's ending that has upset many scientists and led to broad criticism of the article. Lehrer ends the article by saying: "Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe." This has upset scientists in the scientific community. Many have written back to Lehrer and questioned his agenda. Some have characterized Lehrer's assertion as "absurd", while others claiming that Lehrer is trying to use publication bias as an excuse for not believing in anything.&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt;

As an answer to the many comments Lehrer received upon publishing the article, Lehrer published a comment on his blog, The Frontal Cortex,&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt; where he denied that he was implicitly questioning science and scientific methods in any way. In the same blog comment, Lehrer stated that he was not questioning fundamental scientific theories such as the theory of evolution by natural selection and global warming by calling them "two of the most robust and widely tested theories of modern science".

A further clarification was published as a follow-up note in ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="Lehrer2" /&gt; In this note, entitled "More Thoughts on the Decline Effect", Lehrer tries mainly to answer the critics by giving examples where scientific research has both failed and succeeded. As an example, Lehrer uses [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[commencement speech]] at Caltech in 1974 as a starting point. In his commencement speech, Feynman used [[Robert Millikan]]'s and [[Harvey Fletcher]]'s [[oil drop experiment]] to measure the charge of an electron to illustrate how selective reporting can bias scientific results. On the other hand, Feynman finds solace in the fact that other scientists will repeat other scientists' experiments and hence, the truth will win out in the end.

Lehrer once again uses the follow-up note to deny that his original intention was to support people denying well verified scientific theories such as natural selection and climate change. Instead, he wishes that "we'd spend more time considering the value of second-generation antipsychotics or the verity of the latest gene-association study". In the other parts of the follow-up note, Lehrer briefly discusses some of the creative feedback he has received in order to reduce publication bias. He does not give explicit support to any specific idea. The follow-up article ends with Lehrer once again stating that the decline effect is a problem in today's science, but that science will eventually find a tool to deal with the problem.

'''Dirty Sanchez''' is a purported [[Human sexual activity|sex act]] where [[feces]] are purposely smeared onto a partner's upper lip. Sex-advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] says the act is completely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do the Santorum|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14422|last=Savage|first=Dan|date=2003-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Bouldrey]] in ''Dirty Words: A Literary Encyclopedia of Sex'' says the act is an urban legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Words: A Literary Encyclopedia of Sex|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2008|isbn=1-59691-474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]'' says, "This appears to have been contrived with the intention to provoke shock rather than actually as a practice, although, no doubt, some have or will experiment."&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;Partridge, Eric; Dalzell, Tom; Victor, Terry (2006).

Columnist [[Gustavo Arellano]] of ''[[¡Ask a Mexican!]]'' contends the term evokes the stereotypical mustache of a Mexican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ask a Mexican|first=Gustavo|last=Arellano|pages=67|year=2007|isbn=1-4165-4002-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the sex act entered British gay [[Cant (language)|cant]] [[Polari]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang|last=Baker|first=Paul|year=2004|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|pages=109|isbn=0-8264-7343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
American heavy metal band [[Steel Panther]] mentioned Dirty Sanchez in their song titled "The Shocker" from their album ''[[Feel the Steel]]'' (2009). Another band, [[Sleazy RoXxX]], recorded a song called "Dirty Sanchez" as the opener for their album ''[[Topless Suicide]]''' (2016).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Proper Condom Use]]" (2001), the Filthy Sanchez is noted as a sexual act, among several other allusive terms for sexual acts. "Hot Karl" was also mentioned.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

A 2004 advertisement for [[Unilever]]'s Seedy Sanchez [[Pot Noodle]] featured a [[Mariachi]] band singing a song filled with [[double entendre]]s about their noodles and the sex act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuxbnWuP6wM|title=Pot Noodle Ad – Seedy   Also seen in scary movie 4  Sanchez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pot Noodle continues innuendo in new TV ad|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/Campaign/News/204400/Pot-Noodle-continues-innuendo-new-TV-ad/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630110053/http://www.brandrepublic.com/Campaign/News/204400/Pot-Noodle-continues-innuendo-new-TV-ad/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-06-30|publisher=Brand Republic|date=2004-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movie ''[[Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story]]'' (2004), after their victory over the girl scout troop, they{{who|date=November 2018}} meet White Goodman and his team in a bar called "The Dirty Sanchez".  The side of the building shows a woman with a moustache holding a beer.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

It was mentioned in the film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' (2005) along with [[rusty trombone]] by Mooj after learning Andy is a virgin.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In 2006, [[Dustin Diamond]] directed and released his own sex tape ''Screeched – Saved by the smell'' (2006), which was marketed as depicting Diamond performing the sex act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2006-09-27/gossip/18343532_1_tape-alice-cooper-glam|title=Porn Star's Name May Ring A 'Bell'|publisher=New York Daily News|date=2006-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2006/10/screech-sex-tape-guest-stars-revealed/|title=Screech Sex Tape "Guest Stars" Revealed|publisher=The Hollywood Gossip|date=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's marketer [[David Hans Schmidt]] appeared on the ''[[Howard Stern Show]]'' in October 2006, and Stern confirmed the act was performed in the film.&lt;ref name="Stern2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1160539200|title=The Howard Stern Show for October 11, 2006|date=2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has ruled that the term is actionably indecent. [[WXYT-FM|WKRK-FM]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], has twice been fined for using the term on air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2003/FCC-03-71A1.html|title=NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE

==Basic models: linear regression==
A basic tool for econometrics is the [[multiple linear regression]] model.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model" /&gt; In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greene, William|title=Econometric Analysis|date=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780273753568|pages=47–48|edition=7th|chapter=Chapter 1: Econometrics | quote = Ultimately, all of these will require a common set of tools, including, for example, the multiple regression model, the use of moment conditions for estimation, instrumental variables (IV) and maximum likelihood estimation. With that in mind, the organization of this book is as follows: The first half of the text develops fundamental results that are common to all the applications. The concept of multiple regression and the linear regression model in particular constitutes the underlying platform of most modeling, even if the linear model itself is not ultimately used as the empirical specification.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualised as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables.

[[File:Okuns law differences 1948 to mid 2011.png|thumb|right|Okun's law representing the relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate. The fitted line is found using regression analysis.]]

For example, consider [[Okun's law]], which relates GDP growth to the unemployment rate. This relationship is represented in a linear regression where the change in unemployment rate (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\ \text{Unemployment}&lt;/math&gt;) is a function of an intercept (&lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt;), a given value of GDP growth multiplied by a slope coefficient &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; and an error term, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\ \text {Unemployment} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Growth} + \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;

The unknown parameters &lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; can be estimated.  Here &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; is estimated to be −1.77 and &lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt; is estimated to be 0.83. This means that if GDP growth increased by one percentage point, the unemployment rate would be predicted to drop by 1.77 points.  The model could then be tested for [[statistical significance]] as to whether an increase in growth is associated with a decrease in the unemployment, as [[hypothesis test|hypothesized]]. If the estimate of &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; were not significantly different from 0, the test would fail to find evidence that changes in the growth rate and unemployment rate were related. The variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (unemployment) as a function of the independent variable (GDP growth) is given in [[polynomial least squares]].

==Theory==
{{see also|Estimation theory}}
Econometric theory uses [[statistical theory]] and [[mathematical statistics]] to evaluate and develop econometric methods.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – mathematical statistics and statistical theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wooldridge Econometrics – mathematical statistics" /&gt; Econometricians try to find [[estimator]]s that have desirable statistical properties including [[Bias of an estimator|unbiasedness]], [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]], and [[Consistent estimator|consistency]]. An estimator is unbiased if its expected value is the true value of the parameter; it is consistent if it converges to the true value as the sample size gets larger, and it is efficient if the estimator has lower standard error than other unbiased estimators for a given sample size. [[Ordinary least squares]] (OLS) is often used for estimation since it provides the BLUE or "best linear unbiased estimator" (where "best" means most efficient, unbiased estimator) given the [[Gauss-Markov (disambiguation)|Gauss-Markov]] assumptions. When these assumptions are violated or other statistical properties are desired, other estimation techniques such as [[maximum likelihood estimation]], [[generalized method of moments]], or [[generalized least squares]] are used. [[Bayes estimator|Estimators that incorporate prior beliefs]] are advocated by those who favour [[Bayesian statistics]] over traditional, classical or [[Frequentist probability|"frequentist" approaches]].

==Methods==
{{Main|Methodology of econometrics}}

''Applied econometrics'' uses theoretical econometrics and real-world [[economic data|data]] for assessing economic theories, developing [[econometric model]]s, analysing [[economic history]], and [[economic forecast|forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Granger]] (2008). "forecasting,"
''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_F000161&amp;edition=current&amp;q=forecast&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518001935/http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_F000161&amp;edition=current&amp;q=forecast&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 |date=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Econometrics may use standard [[statistical model]]s to study economic questions, but most often they are with [[observational study|observational]] data, rather than in [[experiment|controlled experiments]].&lt;ref name=Introductory_econometrics&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |date=2013 |title=Introductory Econometrics, A modern approach |url= |location= |publisher=South-Western, Cengage learning |page= |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the design of observational studies in econometrics is similar to the design of studies in other observational disciplines, such as astronomy, epidemiology, sociology and political science. Analysis of data from an observational study is guided by the study protocol, although [[exploratory data analysis]] may be useful for generating new hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Wold|Herman O. Wold]] (1969). "Econometrics as Pioneering in Nonexperimental Model Building," ''Econometrica'', 37(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1912787 369]-381.&lt;/ref&gt; Economics often analyses systems of equations and inequalities, such as [[supply and demand]] hypothesized to be in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]]. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].  Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.

One of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].&lt;/ref&gt; Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]]. Econometricians often seek illuminating [[natural experiment]]s in the absence of evidence from controlled experiments. Observational data may be subject to [[omitted-variable bias]] and a list of other problems that must be addressed using causal analysis of simultaneous-equation models.&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Leamer (2008). "specification problems in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231333/http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to natural experiments, [[Quasi-experiment|quasi-experimental methods]] have been used increasingly commonly by econometricians since the 1980s, in order to credibly identify causal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Angrist |first1=Joshua D |last2=Pischke |first2=Jörn-Steffen |title=The Credibility Revolution in Empirical Economics: How Better Research Design is Taking the Con out of Econometrics |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=May 2010 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=3–30 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.3 |url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.2.3 |issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A simple example of a relationship in econometrics from the field of [[labour economics]] is:

:&lt;math&gt; \ln(\text{wage}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{years of education}) + \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;

This example assumes that the [[natural logarithm]] of a person's wage is a linear function of the number of years of education that person has acquired. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; measures the increase in the natural log of the wage attributable to one more year of education. The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable representing all other factors that may have direct influence on wage. The econometric goal is to estimate the parameters, &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 \mbox{ and } \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; under specific assumptions about the random variable &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with years of education, then the equation can be estimated with [[linear regression|ordinary least squares]].

If the researcher could randomly assign people to different levels of education, the data set thus generated would allow estimation of the effect of changes in years of education on wages. In reality, those experiments cannot be conducted. Instead, the econometrician observes the years of education of and the wages paid to people who differ along many dimensions. Given this kind of data, the estimated coefficient on Years of Education in the equation above reflects both the effect of education on wages and the effect of other variables on wages, if those other variables were correlated with education. For example, people born in certain places may have higher wages and higher levels of education. Unless the econometrician controls for place of birth in the above equation, the effect of birthplace on wages may be falsely attributed to the effect of education on wages.

The most obvious way to control for birthplace is to include a measure of the effect of birthplace in the equation above. Exclusion of birthplace, together with the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with education produces a misspecified model. Another technique is to include in the equation additional set of measured covariates which are not instrumental variables, yet render &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; identifiable.&lt;ref name=pearl00&gt;{{cite book |first=Judea |last=Pearl |year=2000 |title=Causality: Model, Reasoning, and Inference |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521773628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of econometric methods used to study this problem were provided by [[David Card|Card]] (1999).&lt;ref name=Card:00&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Card |year=1999 |chapter=The Causal Effect of Education on Earning |editor-last=Ashenfelter |editor-first=O. |editor2-last=Card |editor2-first=D. |title=Handbook of Labor Economics |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |pages=1801–1863 |isbn=0444822895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and criticisms==
{{see also|Criticisms of econometrics}}

Like other forms of statistical analysis, badly specified econometric models may show a [[spurious relationship]] where two variables are correlated but causally unrelated. In a study of the use of econometrics in major economics journals, [[Deidre McCloskey|McCloskey]] concluded that some economists report [[p-value]]s (following the [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisherian]] tradition of [[tests of significance]] of point [[null hypothesis|null-hypotheses]]) and neglect concerns of [[type II error]]s; some economists fail to report estimates of the size of effects (apart from [[statistical significance]]) and to discuss their economic importance. She also argues that some economists also fail to use economic reasoning for [[model selection]], especially for deciding which variables to include in a regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Loss Function has been mislaid: the Rhetoric of Significance Tests|last=McCloskey|journal=American Economic Review|date=May 1985|volume=75|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Ziliak|Stephen T. Ziliak]] and [[Deirdre McCloskey|Deirdre N. McCloskey]] (2004). "Size Matters: The Standard Error of Regressions in the ''American Economic Review''," ''Journal of Socio-economics'', 33(5), pp. [http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/Ziliak/doc/Size%20Matters%20Journal%20of%20Socio-Economics%20Ziliak%20and%20McCloskey.pdf 527-46] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625163446/http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/Ziliak/doc/Size%20Matters%20Journal%20of%20Socio-Economics%20Ziliak%20and%20McCloskey.pdf |date=25 June 2010 }} (press '''+''').&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, economic variables cannot be experimentally manipulated as treatments randomly assigned to subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leamer|first=Edward|title=Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics|journal=American Economic Review|date=March 1983|volume=73|issue=1|page=34|jstor=1803924}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, economists rely on [[observational studies]], often using data sets with many strongly associated [[covariate]]s, resulting in enormous numbers of models with similar explanatory ability but different covariates and regression estimates. Regarding the plurality of models compatible with observational data-sets, [[Edward Leamer]] urged that "professionals ... properly withhold belief until an inference can be shown to be adequately insensitive to the choice of assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leamer|first=Edward|title=Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics|journal=American Economic Review|date=March 1983|volume=73|issue=1|page=43|jstor=1803924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=April 2008}}

'''Ecophagy''' is a term coined by [[Robert Freitas]] that means the literal consumption of an [[ecosystem]]. It derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "οικος" (oikos) or  [[Late Latin]] "oeco-", which refers to a "house" or "household", and the Greek "φᾰγεῖν" (phagein), "to eat".

Freitas used the term to describe a scenario involving [[molecular nanotechnology]] gone awry. In this situation (called the [[grey goo]] scenario) out-of-control [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating nanorobots]] consume entire ecosystems, resulting in global ecophagy.&lt;br/&gt;
However, the word "ecophagy" is now applied more generally in reference to any event{{dubious|date=April 2012}}—nuclear war, the spread of [[monoculture]], massive species extinctions—that might fundamentally alter the planet. Scholars suggest that these events might result in [[ecological collapse|ecocide]] in that they would undermine the capacity of the Earth's biological population to repair itself. Others suggest that more mundane and less spectacular events—the [[human overpopulation|unrelenting growth of the human population]], the steady transformation of the natural world by human beings—will eventually result in a planet that is considerably less vibrant, and one that is, apart from humans, essentially lifeless. These people believe that the current human trajectory puts us on a path that will eventually lead to ecophagy.
In the paper in which Freitas coined the term he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Freitas]], (2000) ''Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the earliest-recognized and best-known danger of molecular nanotechnology is the risk that self-replicating nanorobots capable of functioning autonomously in the natural environment could quickly convert that natural environment (e.g., "biomass") into replicas of themselves (e.g., "nanomass") on a global basis, a scenario usually referred to as the "grey goo problem" but perhaps more properly termed "global ecophagy".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[religious studies]] and [[folkloristics]], '''folk religion''', '''popular religion''', or '''vernacular religion''' comprises various forms and expressions of [[religion]] that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of [[organized religion]]. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed '''popular belief''', it consists of [[ethnic]] or regional [[religion|religious]] customs under the umbrella of a [[religion]], but outside official [[doctrine]] and practices.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowman | first=Marion |editor-first=Steven| editor-last=Sutcliffe |title=Religion: empirical studies |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2004 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Chapter 1: Phenomenology, Fieldwork, and Folk Religion |isbn=0-7546-4158-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU2BSj4dcHMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22folk+religion%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "folk religion" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects.  The first is the religious dimension of [[folk culture]], or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of [[syncretism]]s between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and [[Roman Catholicism]] that led to the development of [[Vodun]] and [[Santería]], and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.

[[Chinese folk religion]], folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the [[clergy]] of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious [[worship]], do not belong to a [[church body|church]] or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of [[faith]] in a particular [[creed]], to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children [[baptism|baptised]].&lt;ref name="Bowman"/&gt;

==Definition==
In ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] characterized "folk religion" as either "religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems" or "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."{{sfn|Bowker|2003}}

[[Don Yoder]] argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The first was a perspective rooted in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of [[indigenous American]] and [[indigenous African|African]] communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}

Yoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was "the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as [[superstition]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=13}} The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the "folk interpretation and expression of religion". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in [[witchcraft]], he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of "folk [[religiosity]]", thereby defining folk religion as "the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}} His fifth and final definition represented a "practical working definition" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as "the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=14}}

Yoder described "folk religion" as existing "in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=11}}

Alternately, the sociologist of religion [[Matthias Zic Varul]] defined "folk religion" as "the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence".{{sfn|Varul|2015|p=449}}

===Historical development===

In Europe the study of "folk religion" emerged from the study of ''religiöse Volkskund'', a German term which was used in reference to "the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=2}} This term was first employed by a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] preacher, [[Paul Drews]], in a 1901 article that he published which was titled "''Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie''". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=2&amp;ndash;3}} Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of [[folkloristics]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of ''religiöse Volkskund'' had been produced by the folklorists [[Josef Weigert]], [[Werner Boette]], and [[Max Rumpf]], all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} Over the coming decades, [[Georg Schreiber]] established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in [[Munich]] while a similar department was established in [[Salzburg]] by [[Hanns Koren]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were [[Heinrich Schauert]] and [[Rudolf Kriss]], the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}} Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as [[pilgrimage]] and the use of [[shrines]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}}

In the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The pioneer in this field was Redfield, whose 1930 book ''Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village'' contrasted and examined the relationship between "folk religion" and "official religion" in a peasant community.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term "folk religion" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German ''Volksreligion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of [[Joshua Trachtenberg]]'s 1939 work ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of [[comparative religion]], appearing in the titles of [[Ichiro Hori]]'s ''Folk Religion in Japan'', [[Martin Nilsson]]'s ''Greek Folk Religion'', and [[Charles Miller Leslie|Charles Leslie]]'s reader, the ''Anthropology of Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as [[John Messenger]]'s at [[Indiana University]] and [[Don Yoder]]'s at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}}
Although the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of [[theology]] and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=6}} He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=9}}

The term "folk religion" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=4}}

===Problems and critique===

Yoder noted that one problem with the use of the term "folk religion" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term "religion" in reference solely to [[organized religion]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion [[Émile Durkheim]], who insisted that "religion" was organized in order to contrast it with "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term "folk belief" over "folk religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}}

A second problem with the use of "folk religion" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the [[sociology of religion]], used the term as a synonym for [[ethnic religion]] (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a "universal religion" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}} Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.{{sfn|Bock|1966|p=204}}

The folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of "folk religion", as well as related terms like "popular religion" and "unofficial religion", by scholars, does "an extreme disservice" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because &amp;ndash; in his opinion &amp;ndash; such terms are "residualistic, [and] derogatory".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=38}} He argued that using such terminology implies that there is "a pure element" to religion "which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=39}} As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use "vernacular religion" as an alternative.{{sfn|Primiano|1995|pp=41&amp;ndash;42}} Defining this term, Primiano stated that "vernacular religion" is, "by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=44}}

Kapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it "mistaken" and arguing that switching from "folk religion" to "vernacular religion" results in the scholar "picking up a different selection of things from the world".{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=9}} He cautioned that both terms were "ideological and semantic load[ed]" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}

==Chinese folk religion==
[[Chinese folk religion]] or Shenism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GBdX2ELnkXQC&amp;pg=PA21 |title= Reinventing Chinese Syncretic Religion: Shenism |publisher= Google |date = 2007-02-23 |accessdate= 2011-11-20|isbn= 9789812308658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen | title = How we came to ‘pai shen’ | publisher = Straits times | date = 2009-09-07 | accessdate = 2011-11-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111207225051/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/9/7/how-we-came-to-pai-shen/ | archivedate = 2011-12-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9MmNaNebFD8C&amp;pg=PA198 |title = Religious Diversity in Singapore |publisher = Google |date = 2001-09-11 | accessdate =2011-11-20|isbn = 9789812307545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are labels used to describe the collection of [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in [[China]] and among [[Han Chinese]] ethnic groups up to the present day. Shenism describes [[Chinese mythology]] and includes the worship of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' ([[spirit]], [[Deity|god]], [[awareness]], [[consciousness]]) which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], [[Taizu (disambiguation)|Taizu]] or clan deities, [[city god]]s, [[national god|national deities]], [[culture hero]]es and [[demigod]]s, [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[veneration of the dead|ancestors]]. "Shenism" as a term was first published by AJA Elliot in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = High beam | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-126163460.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with [[Taoism]], since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a branch of Shenism, since it sprang out of folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous.  With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Religion | year = 2011 | title = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folk religion is one of the [[major religious groups|major religious traditions in the world]]. In [[People's Republic of China|China]] more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chartsbin.com/view/sgx |title=Chinese Folk Religion Adherents by Country |publisher=Charts bin |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate = 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Islam==
{{further |Islamic mythology|Druze|Alevi|Alawi|Kebatinan|Abangan|Adat}}
Folk Islam is an [[umbrella term]] used to collectively describe forms of [[Islam]] that incorporate native folk beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook|first= Chris|title = Spirituality and Psychiatry| publisher= [[RCPsych]] Publications | year = 2009 | page = 242 | isbn = 978-1-904671-71-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Folk Islam has been described as the Islam of the "urban poor, country people, and tribes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ridgeon | first = Lloyd | title =Major World Religions: From Their Origins To The Present | publisher =[[Routledge]]|year=2003|page=280|isbn = 978-0-415-29796-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] or "High" Islam (Gellner, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Sinisa Malesevic | last= Malešević| first = Siniša | title = Ernest Gellner and Contemporary Social Thought|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|page=189|isbn = 978-0-521-70941-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism]] and Sufi concepts are often integrated into Folk Islam.

Various practices and beliefs have been identified with the concept of "folk Islam". They include the following:
* belief in traditional magic systems and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] rituals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Masud| first= Muhammad Khalid |title = Islam and Modernity: Key Issues and Debates| publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year= 2009 | page = 138 | isbn = 978-0-7486-3793-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Makris | first =JP |title= Islam in the Middle East: A Living Tradition |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=2006|page=49|isbn = 978-1-4051-1603-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk Judaism==
In one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg, 1939, Forgotten Books, Preface, pg xxvii&lt;/ref&gt; This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.

Later studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in ''hibbut ha-qever''  (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical [[aggadah]] and was then further developed by the kabbalists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Edited by Adele Berlin,  Oxford University Press, 2011, pg 344,&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Raphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'',
by Victor D. Sanua, pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element,&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 27&lt;/ref&gt; which he sees in the goddess [[Asherah]], the [[Shekhinah]], the [[Matronit]], and [[Lilith]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Writer Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]], or [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]], i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune.  He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and [[halakah]], magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life.  He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the [[Baal Shem|ba'al shem]] of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century.  These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and [[herbal medicine]] to bring harm to enemies, and  success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Liebman]] has written that the essence of the folk religion of American Jews is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding  that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of  dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the [[Passover seder]], social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 152&lt;/ref&gt; Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, ''The Ambivalent American Jew'' (1973) and ''American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation''.

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], folk religion is often contrasted with [[elite religion]]. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error.&lt;ref&gt;Leibman, Charles. "The Religion of the American Jew". ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept is [[lived religion]], the study of religion as practiced by believers.

[[File:Helix of sustainability.png|left|thumb|The helix of sustainability - the [[Carbon cycle]] ideal for manufacture and use]][[File:Recycle001.svg|thumb|left|The international [[recycling symbol]] - not nature identical.]]

The '''helix of sustainability''' is a concept coined to help manufacturing industry move to more sustainable practices by mapping its models of raw material use and reuse onto those of nature.The environmental benefits of the use crop origin sustainable materials have been assumed to be self-evident, but as the debate on [[food vs fuel]] shows, the whole product life cycle must be examined in the light of social and environmental effects in addition to technical suitability and profitability. 

The helix of sustainability&lt;ref&gt;"Nature’s way – sustainable polymers and composites" K Kirwan, N Tucker, MR Johnson, Materials World, Vol. 11, No. 10, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirwan, K., "Life’s Work", Engineering, Vol. 246, No.3, pp. 30-31, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, N., Kirwan, K., Jacobs, D., Johnson, M., "Addressing the Polymer Waste Mountain – the helix of sustainability and the flowering cell phone", Third International Workshop on Green Composites, March 16–17, 2005, Shin-Daigaku Kaikan of the Imadegawa Campus, Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept created as a representation of the [[Systems thinking|total systems approach]] to gain full advantage from manufacturing with [[Sustainable|sustainable materials]], particularly [[biopolymers]] and [[biocomposite]]s. In 2004 the concept was presented by Professor John Wood, then Chair of the Materials Foresight Panel at a [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] event hosted by the then Secretary of State for Industry ([[Jacqui Smith]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Opportunities in Horticulture: A Proposal for Academic Posts in WMG", WMG Report, David Mullins, 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year it was also used in the [[European Science Foundation]] exploratory workshop on environmentally friendly composites.&lt;ref&gt;"Environmentally Friendly European Composites Workshop", K Kirwan, N Tucker, M Johnson, C Halstead, D Jacobs, Report, European Science Foundation, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

The advantages of working with crop origin raw materials are readily observed if the social and environmental impacts are considered as well as monetary cost (the [[Triple bottom line]]), and the helix of sustainability helps to demonstrate this. For the full potential of biopolymers to be realised it is essential that attention is paid to every aspect of the manufacturing process from design (how to cope with the incertainties in properties associated with crop origin materials?), manufacture (can existing technologies be used?), through to end-of-life (can the redundant article be fed back into the materials cycle?).    
The entire supply chain must be considered because decisions taken at the design stage have significant effects right through the life of an article. Low cost assembly techniques (e.g. snap-fits) may make dismantling or repair uneconomical. However, if say, an easy-to-dismantle car is built, will there be any effect on the ability of the vehicle to absorb energy in a crash? At an even more fundamental level, what will be the social and environmental of the change in crop growing patterns. This low environmental impact approach to manufacturing is seen as an extension of [[waste reduction]] techniques such as [[lean manufacturing]]. 

Conventional [[Recycling|cycles of use and reuse]] are circular. Consider the mechanical recovery of conventional [[polymers]]. A complex [[infrastructure]] is needed to recover the material at the end of an article's useful life. At the end of an article's life - say a [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] carbonated drink bottle, the article must be separated from the waste stream, either by the consumer who throws it away, or by manual labour at the rubbish dump. It must then be transported to some facility to be reprocessed (using more labour and energy) back into a raw material. The [[Plastics extrusion|heat and shear forces]] associated with the process of remanufacture tends to produce material with slightly degraded properties compared to the original material.

For sustainable material articles there is not such a great requirement for a dedicated recovery infrastructure. If a [[Litter|litter lout]] throws a crop origin [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] article on the ground, it will ultimately biodegrade into [[humus]], water, and non-fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If the article is placed into a [[compostable]] waste stream, the humus can then be used as fertiliser for the next generation of crops, there is also no requirement to sort  biopolymer articles as there is with fossil polymer recycling. Note difference between [[landfill]] and [[compost]] - the limited biological activity in landfill is slow, and mostly [[Wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] resulting in the production of [[methane]], whereas [[composting]] is a rapid [[Decomposition|aerobic]] process resulting in humus, water and non-fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The energy bill for breaking down biodegradables into the fundamental building block molecules, and then reassembling them into usable raw materials is large, but is  uses direct solar energy rather than metered electricity. There is also no loss of properties with successive journeys through the cycle.

The '''Heptateuch''' (seven containers) is a name sometimes given to the first seven books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The seven books are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]]. The first four of these are sometimes called the Tetrateuch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY8CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;vq=Tetrateuch&amp;dq=Old%20Testament%20Interpretation%20Mays%20Peterson%20Richards&amp;pg=PA36#v=snippet&amp;q=Tetrateuch&amp;f=false |title=Old Testament Interpretation: Past, Present And Future |chapter=The Formation of the Pentateuch |first=David L. |last=Petersen |editor1-first=James Luther |editor1-last=Mays |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Petersen |editor3-first=Kent H. |editor3-last=Richards |page=36 |year=1995 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first five are commonly known as the [[Torah]] or the [[Pentateuch]], the first six as the [[Hexateuch]]. With the addition of the [[Book of Ruth]], it becomes the [[Octateuch]]. The "Enneateuch" is the Heptateuch plus the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Kings]] (each pair of books counted as one, and not including the Book of Ruth).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] produced a piece called ''Questions on the Heptateuch''. [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] produced an [[Old English language|Old English]] version of the Heptateuch.

The '''Human Terrain System''' ('''HTS''') was a [[United States Army]], [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)]] support program employing personnel from the social science disciplines – such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], regional studies, and [[linguistics]] – to provide military commanders and staff with an understanding of the local population (i.e. the "human terrain") in the regions in which they are deployed.&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|authorlink=Maximilian Forte|title=The Human Terrain System and Anthropology: A Review of Ongoing Public Debates|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2011|volume=113|issue=1|pages=149–153|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

The concept of HTS was first developed in a paper by [[Montgomery McFate]] and Andrea Jackson in 2005,&lt;ref name=McFate&amp;Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Andrea Jackson|title=An Organizational Solution for DODs Cultural Knowledge Needs|journal=Military Review|date=July–August 2005|pages=18–21|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/mcfate2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed a pilot version of the project as a response to "identified gaps in [US military] commanders' and staffs' understanding of the local population and culture", such as became particularly visible during the US invasion of [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Steve Fondacaro|title=Reflections on the Human Terrain System During the First Four Years|journal=Prism|date=September 2011|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/reflections-human-terrain-system.html|publisher=NDU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;  HTS was subsequently launched as a [[proof-of-concept]] program, run by the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC), in February 2007, with five HTS teams deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; Since 2007, HTS has grown from a program with five deployed teams and a $20 million two-year budget to one with 31 deployed teams and a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; HTS became a permanent US Army program in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

Ever since its launch, HTS has been surrounded by controversy.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fattahi|first=Kambiz|title=US Army enlists anthropologists|publisher=BBC News|date= 16 October 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/americas/7042090.stm|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schactman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title='Human Terrain' Chief Ousted|publisher=Wired|date=15 June 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/human-terrain-chief-ousted/#more-26041|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the program initially received positive coverage in the US media, it quickly became the subject of heavy criticism – particularly from anthropologists, but also from journalists, military officials and HTS personnel and former personnel.&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; Most notably, on 31 October 2007, the Executive Board of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise" that conflicted with the AAA's Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf American Anthropological Association’s Executive Board Statement on the Human Terrain System Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101015936/http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }} American Anthropological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAstatement&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=Statement on HTS|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/statement-on-HTS.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; Following the publication of a report on HTS by the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) in 2009,&lt;ref name=Glenn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenn|first=David|title=Program to Embed Anthropologists with Military Lacks Ethical Standards, Report says|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=3 December 2009|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Program-to-Embed/49344/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Panel Criticizes Military's Use of Embedded Anthropologists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/arts/04anthro.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AAA released a further statement of disapproval, which they re-iterated in 2012 after rumours that the controversy had died down.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name=C41SR&gt;{{cite news|last=Albro|first=Robert|title=Comment: Do No Harm|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR02/304250001/Commentary-8216-Do-no-harm-8217-?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell|accessdate=16 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=April 2012|author2= Gusterson, Hugh|agency=Defense News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program evolved into a mechanism for supporting security force assistance. The program ended operations on September 30, 2014.

==Background==
In the most immediate sense, HTS was developed as a response to concerns about mismanagement of US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, in particular, to the negative effects of recognized "deficiencies" in US military "cultural understanding" of these countries. In 2006 the Human Terrain System was launched by the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Roberto|title=Human Terrain: Past, Present and Future Applications|journal=Anthropology Today|date=February 2008|volume=24|issue=1|pages=21–26|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8322.2008.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fawcett&gt;{{cite web|last=Fawcett|first=Grant S.|title=Cultural Understanding in Counterinsurgency: Analysis of the Human Terrain System|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA505497|publisher=Army Command and General Staff Coll Fort Leavenworth KS School of Advanced Military Studies|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, military analysts and academics have also suggested earlier historical contexts for the program's development.

===CORDS: a US military precedent===
A number of military officials have invoked [[Civil Operations and Rural Development Support]] (CORDS) – a counterinsurgency program developed by the US military during the [[Vietnam war]] – as a precedent for HTS.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilon|first=Juliana Geran|title=Cultural Intelligence for Winning the Peace|year=2009|publisher=[[The Institute of World Politics]] Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-9824888-0-7|pages=|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}}&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Carol|title=Military Culture and Education|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409407577|pages=29–38 [32]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=56HiId0a84QC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=CORDS+vietnam+Human+Terrain+system+military#v=onepage&amp;q=CORDS%20vietnam%20Human%20Terrain%20system%20military&amp;f=false|editor=Douglass Higbee|accessdate=21 June 2012|chapter=Combat Ethnography}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a foundational article on HTS, a group of military analysts, Kipp ''et al'', described the program as "a CORDS for the 21st Century".&lt;ref name=Kipp&gt;{{cite web|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA457490|publisher=Defense Technology Information Center (DTIC)|accessdate=18 June 2012|author2=Lester Grau |author3=Karl Prinslow |author4=Don Smith |date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KippB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century (full document)|journal=Military Review|date=September–October 2006|pages=8–15|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA457490|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|volume=4|issue=11|date=September–October 2006|url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their article appraised CORDS as a successful and effective program that was "premised on a belief that the war would ultimately be won or lost not on the battlefield, but in the struggle for the loyalty of the people". Kipp ''et al'' contended that the only major problems with the CORDS program were that it lacked adequate [[Reachback#Defense usage|reachback]] facilities and that it "was started too late and ended too soon".  As such, they argued that it provided "many important lessons" to "guide" the development of HTS as an "effective cultural intelligence program" that could "support tactical and operational-level commanders today".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} By contrast, critics of HTS have drawn attention to the fact that, in Vietnam, CORDS was run in conjunction with the [[Phoenix Program]], which used information gathered through CORDS in its effort to "neutralize" (by means of assassination, infiltration and capture) supporters of the [[Viet Cong]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalesInterview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency, Anthropology and Disciplinary Complicity|journal=Counterpunch|date=3 February 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/02/03/counterinsurgency-anthropology-and-disciplinary-complicity/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the concept of "human terrain"===
The concept of "human terrain" has been defined in military documents pertaining to HTS as "the human population in the operational environment ... as defined and characterized by sociocultural, anthropologic and ethnographic data and other non-geographical information".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|15}} According to Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]], and one of the most vocal critics of HTS), this concept can be traced back to a 1968 report by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities|House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) about "the perceived threat of the [[Black Panthers]] and other militant groups".&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt; He argues that the concept gradually gained in popularity and usage, in the military and elsewhere, through the writing of military officials, such as [[Ralph Peters]], and pundits, such as [[Max Boot]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

===History of anthropological engagement with the military===
Commentators on HTS have also drawn attention to the long history of anthropological involvement in military operations in the US and Europe, though for different reasons.  In a 2005 article, [[Montgomery McFate]] (HTS's Senior Social Scientist from 2007 to 2010, and an anthropologist by training) argued that anthropology was born as a "warfighting discipline", having served in its early history as "the handmaiden of colonialism".&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|title=Anthropology and counterinsurgency: the strange history of their curious relationship|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2005|url=http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813124239/http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that anthropology had retreated "into the Ivory Tower" following the Vietnam war, and contended that anthropologists should become involved in developing "military applications of cultural knowledge". [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of anthropology and sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) also noted that anthropology and warfare have "merged" many times before, but argued that the difference with HTS was that the program had been "clearly identified" as involving activities that betrayed "basic ethical standards for protecting the interests and well-being of studied populations".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain Systems, Anthropologists and the War in Afghanistan|journal=Counterpunch|date=1 December 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/12/01/human-terrain-systems-anthropologists-and-the-war-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil L Whitehead]] (Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]) likewise argued that the "collaboration" between anthropological theory and colonial practice was "nothing new", but went on to suggest that this history – and particularly recent developments such as HTS and the [[Minerva Initiative]] – should prompt a critical re-assessment and transformation of anthropological methodology.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|title=Ethnography, Torture and the Human Terrain / Terror Systems|journal=Fast Capitalism|year=2009|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/5_2/Whitehead5_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "cultural turn" in the US Army===
A number of commentators on HTS have described the program as part of a "[[cultural turn]]" in US military policy, particularly pertaining to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Derek|title=The Rush to the Intimate: Counterinsurgency and the Cultural Turn|journal=Radical Philosophy|date=July–August 2008|volume=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jager&gt;{{cite book|last=Jager|first=Sheila Miyoshi| authorlink = Sheila Miyoshi Jager| title=On the Uses of Cultural Knowledge|year=2007|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute|location=Washington|isbn=1-58487-330-2|pages=v|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub817.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Jonathon|title=A kinder, gentler counter-terrorism: counter-insurgency, human security and the War on Terror|journal=Security Dialogue|date=February 2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=25–26|doi=10.1177/0967010610393390|url=http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/42/1/21.abstract|publisher=Sage|format=([[PDF]]), Restricted Access.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gusterson2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Anthropology and Global Counterinsurgency|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-42994-6|pages=279–298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=du5kcfUuL9oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=cultural+turn+in+the+u+s+army#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20turn%20in%20the%20war%20on%20terror&amp;f=false|editor=John Kelly|chapter=The Cultural Turn in the War on Terror|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zehfuss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zehfuss|first=Maja|title=Culturally sensitive war?

== History and recent developments ==

===Chronological history of developments in HTS===
The beginnings of HTS can be traced to a pilot proposal for a "Pentagon Office of Operational Cultural Knowledge", published in 2005 by Montgomery McFate and Andrea Jackson.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2005, the [[Foreign Military Studies Office]] (FMSO) initiated an HTS pilot project (named Cultural Operations Research – Human Terrain System, or COR-HTS), which was headed up by Captain Don Smith, and housed at the Training and Doctrine Command in [[Fort Leavenworth]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  The pilot lasted until August 2006.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2006, [[Colonel]] Steve Fondacaro (retired) was hired by TRADOC to transition the pilot into an active program.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;  In October 2006, Jacob Kipp and colleagues outlined the Human Terrain System in an official FMSO public press release.&lt;ref name=Kipp /&gt;

HTS began recruiting in early 2007.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In February 2007, the first team was deployed to Afghanistan. Further teams were deployed to Iraq in the summer of that year.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  Originally, HTS project leaders McFate and Fondacaro had planned for the program to run at a small scale (five teams: two in Afghanistan, three in Iraq) for two years.&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;  However, in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from Central Command issued in April 2007, calling for an HTS Team in every Army Brigade and Marine Corps Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;CENTCOM JUONS dated 7 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Defense Secretary]], [[Robert M. Gates]], authorized a $40 million expansion of the program in September 2007.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Adam, "Odyssey Took Man From Campus to Combat", ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' ([[Associated Press]]), 8 March 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The JUONS demanded a 420 per cent expansion of HTS, from the existing five teams to twenty-six teams divided between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; McFate and Fondacaro referred to this as a "catastrophic success", meaning that "while the boost from the DOD ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) was gratifying, fulfilling the mandate would stretch a new organization to the limit".&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;

Following the public statement of disapproval from the AAA, and significant media coverage of the controversy surrounding HTS, the [[United States Congress]] issued an order for an independent assessment of HTS to be undertaken by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in September 2009.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; In May 2010, the [[House Armed Services Committee]] (HASC) temporarily limited the Army's funding obligation towards the program while this assessment was completed. The CNA report, which contained the results of interviews with 19 out of 71 commanders supported by HTS,&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA /&gt; was completed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=CNAR&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Yvette|title=Congressionally Directed Assessment of the Human Terrain System|url=http://openanthropology.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/gettrdoc.pdf|publisher=CNA|accessdate=20 June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently published on the [[Defense Technical Information Center]] (DTIC) website in February 2011, but withdrawn from the website shortly after.&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA&gt;{{cite web|last=Anon|title=Retracted Center for Naval Analyses Assessment of Human Terrain System|publisher=Public Intelligence|date=7 March 2011|url=http://publicintelligence.net/retracted-center-for-naval-analyses-assessment-of-the-human-terrain-system|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, HTS was approved by the US Army and became a permanent Army program.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; In June 2010, [[Maxie McFarland]], the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence at TRADOC, terminated Fondacaro's temporary position as HTS Program Manager.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberger2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title='Human Terrain' hits rocky ground|journal=Nature|date=22 June 2010|volume=465|issue=993|doi=10.1038/465993a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100622/full/465993a.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|pages=993|pmid=20577178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonel Sharon Hamilton was appointed as his replacement. McFate also left HTS in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

On 8 March 2011, the Center for Complex Operations at the [[National Defense University]] hosted a conference titled Inter-agency Human Terrain Program and Requirements.&lt;ref name=CCO&gt;{{cite web|last=Centre for Complex Operations|title=CCO Event: Interagency Human Terrain Programs and Requirements|date=8 March 2011|url=http://ccoportal.org/event/2011/cco-event-interagency-human-terrain-programs-and-requirements|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center stated that the aims of the conference were to "improve understanding of human terrain information and analysis and of how it is currently being used"; to discuss the "effectiveness" of HTS; and to discuss ethical and legal issues associated with the program.&lt;ref name=CCO /&gt; In June 2011, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] requested and launched a pilot HTS program.&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Army HQ|journal=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin|title=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin: Human Terrain System|date=October–December 2011|volume=37|issue=4|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2011_04.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2012|publisher=US Army Military Intelligence Center of Excellence|id=PB 34-11-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In December 2011, Colonel Hamilton reported that the US Central Command had issued a requirement for an increase of 9 HTS teams in Afghanistan by summer 2012, to bring the total number of teams in Afghanistan up to 31.&lt;ref name=Bertuca&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertuca|first=Tony|title=Army increasing number of Human Terrain Teams; advising allies|url=http://defensenewsstand.com/NewsStand-General/The-INSIDER-Free-Article/army-increasing-number-of-human-terrain-teams-advising-allies/menu-id-720.html|publisher=Inside Washington Publishers|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, HTS officials began prioritizing HTS involvement in "Phase Zero" or, in other words, the earliest, "prevention of conflict" stage of a military campaign.&lt;ref name=McFate2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodges&gt;{{cite news|last=Hodges|first=Jim|title=Cover Story: US Army's Human Terrain Experts May Help Defuse Future Conflicts|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120322/C4ISR02/303220015/Cover-Story-U-S-Army-8217-s-Human-Terrain-Experts-May-Help-Defuse-Future-Conflicts|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, ''Defense News'' reported that the Director of HTS, Colonel Sharon Hamilton, had been "working on a plan" to expand the use of HTS into other regions such as Africa and Latin America, and was considering whether HTS personnel could be deployed in Mexico to support military counter-narcotic work.&lt;ref name=DNanti-drug&gt;{{cite news|last=Iannotta|first=Ben|title=New tool eyed by U.S. for anti-drug war|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR01/304250006/New-tool-eyed-by-U-S-anti-drug-war|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Defense News|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schactman 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Que Curioso!

As part of the ongoing drawdown from Afghanistan in 2013–2014, the Army programmed HTS funding to drop proportionately, eliminating human terrain teams as units were removed from [[Theater (warfare)|theater]]. By September 2014, all HTS teams and personnel had been withdrawn from Afghanistan. Contract and personnel support to the program ceased at the end of the month, effectively ending the program's operations as of 1 October 2014. However, money was still allocated for the program in FY 2015.

===Notable operations===

====Operation Khyber====
During a 15-day operation in the late summer of 2007, 500 [[Afghan army|Afghan]] and 500 US soldiers were deployed to clear an estimated 200 to 250 Taliban insurgents out of [[Paktia Province]], secure southeastern Afghanistan's most important road, and halt a string of [[suicide attacks]] on US troops and local governors. During the operation, an HTS anthropologist, Tracy St. Benoit,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} identified an unusually high concentration of widows in poverty, creating pressure on their sons to join the well-paid insurgents.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Scott|title=US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=7 September 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing St. Benoit's advice, US officers developed a job training program for the widows.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; She also interpreted the beheading of a local tribal elder as an effort to divide and weaken the [[Zadran (Pashtun tribe)|Zadran]], rather than as a more general attempt at intimidation. As a result, Afghan and US officials focused on uniting the Zadran, one of southeastern Afghanistan's most powerful [[tribe]]s, as a way of hindering the Taliban's operations in the area.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

====Operation Maiwand====
800 Afghan soldiers, 400 US soldiers and 200 Afghan policemen took part in Operation Maiwand, in which Afghan soldiers raided houses of suspected militants.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;''International Herald Tribune'', [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php Afghan army plans, executes first big operation, taking step forward in US exit strategy], 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094440/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' reported that in one [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] village, [[Kuz Khadokhel]], the Human Terrain Team (HTT) made it possible for negotiator Captain Aaron White to understand [[body language]] in the context of the culture, to identify leaders during negotiations, and to reinforce a perception of leadership by not conferring with fellow officers and by demonstrating good faith through projects facilitated by the Ghazni [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT), which included roads, a visit by the PRT's [[field hospital|mobile medical clinic]], the construction of a deep well for irrigation, and the beginnings of a road to Afghanistan's main [[Highway 1 (Afghanistan)|Highway 1]].&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt;

===Deaths===
[[Michael V. Bhatia]], a member of HTT AF1, was killed along with two other soldiers by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED (Improvised Explosive Device)]] while riding in a [[Humvee]] in [[Khost]], Afghanistan in May 2008.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geller|first=Adam|title=Professor Pays Ultimate Price in Country He Loved|newspaper=''[[Arizona Republic]]''|publisher=([[Associated Press]])|date=9 March 2009|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/03/08/20090308dangerous-onlinePART2.html|page=1|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geller /&gt;

Nicole Suveges, a member of HTT IZ3, was killed on 24 June 2008, along with 11 other soldiers, Iraqi government officials and United States Embassy personnel when a bomb exploded at the District Council building in [[Sadr City]].&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name="hts.army" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SuevgesCNN&gt;{{cite news|title=American Grad Student Dies in Iraq|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/06/26/iraq.american.death/|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=CNN News|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2008, HTS member Paula Loyd was fatally injured whilst surveying the village of [[Chehel Gazi]] with a US Army platoon. She was doused with gasoline disguised in a jar of cooking oil and lit on fire by Abdul Salam, an Afghan national. Loyd was severely burned over 60 percent of her body.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|110}} Salam was captured by Don. M Ayala (another member of HTS) and other US Army personnel almost immediately after the attack, as he tried to escape.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|112}} About ten minutes later, after learning of the severity of Loyd's injuries, Ayala shot Salam in the head, killing him instantly. Loyd, 36, died at [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] in [[San Antonio]] on 7 January 2009.&lt;ref name="hts.army"&gt;[http://hts.army.mil/htsImageSliderMemoriam.aspx HTS Memoriam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818025311/http://hts.army.mil/htsImageSliderMemoriam.aspx |date=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in federal court in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] in February 2009.

===End of the HTS===
With the end of major American presences in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a shift towards electronic data collection, the need for HTS became less apparent.  On 30 September 2014, funding ended for the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/06/29/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-human-terrain-system/ The Rise and Fall of the Human Terrain System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and organizational structure==
[[File:Human terrain teams.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Human Terrain Team at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|An HTS senior seminar leader provides feedback to Human Terrain Teams at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in May 2010]]

=== Role of HTS in the US Army ===
HTS is defined as an "intelligence enabling capability",&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;{{rp|1}} and is categorized as "Intelligence support activity".&lt;ref name=HTSFAQs&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – FAQs|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsFAQ.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the HTS website, the aim of the program is to "provide sociocultural teams to commanders and staff" in the US Army in order to "improve the understanding of the local population", and to "apply this understanding to the [[Military Decision Making Process]] (MDMP)".&lt;ref name="HTS website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Terrain System|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/Default.aspx|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also argues that the program was designed to address an identified "operational need" in the US Army for "sociocultural support".&lt;ref name=HTSBackground&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – Background|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsAboutBackground.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTS components===
HTS has two main components: an institutional component referred to as the "Army Enduring Base", and an operational component referred to as "Deployed Teams".&lt;ref name=HTSComp&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS Components|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsComponentsDeployed.aspx|work=HTS website|publisher=www.army.mil|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both components include numerous sub-divisions.

====Army Enduring Base====

=====Project Office=====
The Project Office is based in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and is composed of the Director, the Deputy Director, and Project staff (including human resources, social scientists, knowledge management, and [[information technology]] (IT) teams).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Reachback Research Center (RRC)=====
The RRC is a [[Contiguous United States#CONUS and OCONUS|Continental United States (CONUS)]]-based research and analysis program that provides support to deployed HTTs, HTATs, and TCEs.  It is made up of a combination of social scientists, military analysts and civilian analysts who are organized into teams that specialize in research in a particular geographical region.  RRC personnel are responsible for supplying information from [[Open-source intelligence|open source]] and classified sources to deployed HTS teams, and for continuously updating HTS databases.&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====HTS training=====
HTS training is based at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in [[Kansas]]. Training focuses on field research methods, staff planning and procedures, and equipment training.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

====Deployed teams====

=====Human Terrain Teams (HTT)=====
Human Terrain Teams (HTT) work at the brigade or regimental level of the US Army. They undertake research among the local population, and represent that population (referred to as the "human terrain") in the various stages of military operations: planning, preparation, execution, and assessment.&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Human Terrain Teams contain 5–6 members and consist of a Team Leader, who is a principal adviser and is responsible for the entire team; one or two Social Scientists, who are responsible for conducting and managing ethnographic and social-science research for the brigade staff's area of operations; one Research Manager, who is responsible for integrating the HTT's research into their military unit's intelligence collection effort and interacting with other agencies and organizations; and one or two Human Terrain Analysts, who have specific local knowledge and act as the primary human terrain data researcher.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|149–50}}&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=Monte|title=Cultural advisers give US teams an edge|journal=Stars and Stripes|date=28 June 2007|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/cultural-advisers-give-u-s-teams-an-edge-1.65900|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt; HTTs are responsible for providing a constantly updated, user-friendly ethnographic and socio-cultural database of the area of operations that comprises data maps showing specific ethnographic or cultural features; raising points on cultural or ethnographic issues of specific concern to the unit commander; and sustaining a connection with RRC.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

=====Human Terrain Analysis Teams (HTAT)=====
Human Terrain and Analysis Teams provide support to echelons of the US Army that are above brigade or regimental level (e.g., [[Division (military)|division]] or regional command).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;  They form a part of the Commander's staff and are responsible for analyzing the information provided by HTTs in order to support the Commander's Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt; HTATs are made up of one Team Leader, one or two Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Coordination Elements (TCE)=====
TCEs are made up of a mixture of military and civilian staff. They are responsible for providing sociocultural support to the military staff and commanders of a particular operational region or theater.  A TCE comprises one Team Leader, three Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Support Office (TSO)=====
TSOs are responsible for providing administrative and logistics support to HTTs in a particular operational region or theater.  They are made up of one Theater Support Officer and a variably-sized support team.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Social Science Research and Analysis (SSRA)=====
SSRA is responsible for liaising with indigenous polling organizations and [[Small and medium enterprises|small or medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) in order to gather data and information from the local population.  This information is then passed on to the TCE.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

===Methods===
The HTS program focuses on mapping the "human terrain" (i.e. the local population in an area in which military are deployed). In order to do this, HTTs create databases of information about local leaders, tribes or social groups, political disputes, economic issues, and social problems. This information is then analyzed by HTATs, used to advise military staff and commanders, and used to inform the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR" /&gt; Collected data is compiled and stored in a larger archive in order to be accessible for the military and other government agencies.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

===Equipment===
HTS has developed the MAP-HT Toolkit, an integrated software suite provided to HTTs for data visualization and reporting.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"/&gt;  This includes software for mapping (of the spatial distribution of social groups, for example), and for producing link charts (of power structures and social networks in informal economies, for example) and timelines.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna|title=The Culture Warriors|newspaper=US News and World Report|date=30 November 2007|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/iraq/2007/11/30/the-pentagon-deploys-social-scientists-to-help-understand-iraqs-human-terrain.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components in the toolkit include: ANTHROPAC, UCINET, Axis PRO, [[i2 Limited|i2]] [[Analyst's Notebook]], and TerraExplorer, a 3D earth visualization application provided by Skyline Software Systems.

===Funding===
The initial funding for the Human Terrain System came from the [[Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization]] (JIEDDO).&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=John|authorlink=John Stanton (journalist)|title=General David Patraeus' Favorite Mushroom: Inside the U.S. Army's Human Terrain System|year=2009|publisher=Wiseman Publishing|location=|isbn=978-90-8963-019-3|pages=189|oclc=677926603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} The JIEDDO funding of $20 million, granted in the summer 2006, supported the pilot HTS project from mid-2006 to 2007.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; Following the Central Command JUONS request for the major and rapid expansion of HTS in April 2007, the Defense Secretary approved a $40 million expansion of HTS to be funded by the Department of Defense (DOD).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;  DOD provided HTS funding until 2009 when funding responsibilities were assumed by Army [[Staff (military)#Continental Staff System|G2]] (i.e., the Army's Military Intelligence budget).&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt; In 2009 it was reported that the annual budget for the program was $143 million.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Caryl|title=Human Terrain Teams|journal=Foreign Policy|date=8 September 2009|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/08/reality_check_human_terrain_teams?page=0,0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 the HASC temporarily limited the funding obligation to HTS until the Army submitted an assessment of the program that addressed concerns that had been raised.&lt;ref name=Forte2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian|title=Human Terrain System Criticized by US Congress|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/2010/05/21/human-terrain-system-criticized-by-u-s-congress/|publisher=zeroanthropology.net|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, McFate stated that HTS had a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

==Public debate: praise, criticism and controversy==

===Praise and support===

====US government officials====
In a speech in 2008, [[Robert Gates]] (US Defense Secretary) praised HTS, saying that although the program had experienced early "teething problems" the "net effect" of HTS efforts was often "less violence across the board, with fewer hardships and casualties among civilians as a result".&lt;ref name=Jaschik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|title=A Pentagon Olive Branch to Academe|journal=Inside Higher Ed|date=16 April 2008|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/16/minerva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 article on HTS in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[David Rohde]], an American journalist who has twice won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], reported that one of the first HTTs to be deployed in Afghanistan had received "lavish" praise from officers for "helping them see the situation from an Afghan perspective and allowing them to cut back on combat operations".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He wrote that HTS had also been praised by Afghan and Western civilian officials in the area, although they had been "cautious about predicting long term success".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Rohde also cited Colonel David Woods (Commander of the 4th Squadron of the [[73rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|73rd Cavalry Regiment]]) as having remarked: "Call it what you want, it works ... It works in helping you define the problems, not just the symptoms."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In a statement to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2008, Colonel Martin Schweitzer, Commander of the 4th [[Brigade Combat Team]] of the [[82nd Airborne Division]], claimed that HTS capabilities had reduced his unit's "kinetic operations" in Afghanistan by 60–70 per cent within a year.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer&gt;{{cite web|last=Schweitzer|first=Martin P.|title=Statement of Colonel Martin P.

The US media has reported a number of positive review from HTS employees.  In 2008, ''World Politics Review'' ran a feature article on David Matsuda (a former professor of anthropology at [[California State University]]) who described HTS as "the chance to change the nature of warfare, the chance to anthropologize the military – and not the other way around – the chance to lessen casualties, avoid conflict, take people through the post-conflict to peace".&lt;ref name=McLeary&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeary|first=Paul|title=Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/2774/human-terrain-teams?page=2|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=World Politics Review|date=14 October 2008|format=.

====In the media====
In 2006, [[George Packer]], author of ''The Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq'' and ''New Yorker'' magazine staff writer, wrote an article about the increasing use of social science in US military operations and the early trials of the HTS program. He reflected: "At a moment when the Bush Administration has run out of ideas and lost control, it could turn away from its "war on terror" and follow a different path – one that is right under its nose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Packer|first=George|title=Knowing the Enemy|newspaper=New Yorker (magazine)|date=18 December 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/12/18/061218fa_fact2#ixzz1bytdTVKw|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a (mainly critical) book about HTS entitled ''David Petraeus's Favorite Mushroom: Inside the US Army's Human Terrain System'' (2009), [[John Stanton (journalist)|John Stanton]] stated that HTS had been successful in advising a US military unit in Iraq on proper mealtime etiquette, i.e., not only how to properly eat, but also the gestures during the meal, and especially how to observe the Ramadan feast.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

===Criticism and controversy===

====American Anthropological Association====
{{quote box
 |title = |quote = When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic features of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.|source = —CEAUSSIC, Final Report on HTS (2009)|align = right|width = 30%|border = 1px|fontsize = 88%|bgcolor = |style = |title_bg = |title_fnt = |tstyle = |qalign = |qstyle = |salign = |sstyle =}}

On 31 October 2007, the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise".&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAstatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; The statement argued that HTS personnel would have responsibilities to the U.S military working in war zones that would conflict with anthropologists' duty, as outlined in the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 1), to "do no harm to those they study".&lt;ref name=AAAstatement /&gt; It further maintained that, working in a war zone, HTS personnel would be unable to ensure the "voluntary informed consent (without coercion)" of those whom they communicate with, as is also required by the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 4).&lt;ref name=AAAstatement/&gt;

In December 2008, the AAA Executive Board followed up their initial statement of disapproval by asking the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) to thoroughly review the HTS program.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; CEAUSSIC's "Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain Proof-of-Concept System" was released in December 2009.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR&gt;{{cite book|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |year=2009|publisher=AAA|url=https://www.box.com/shared/kg8t2cop82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |date=14 October 2009|url=http://www.policyscience.net/CEAUSSIC_HTS_Final_Report.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEAUSSIC's 74-page report argued that the "goals" and "basic identity" of HTS were characterized by "confusion", and that the program was designed to simultaneously perform multiple tasks that were "potentially irreconcilable"; e.g., serving as research function whilst also operating as "a source of intelligence" and a "tactical function in counterinsurgency warfare".&lt;ref name=Glenn /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It added that this confusion would make it unclear to anthropologists whether they could follow the Code of Ethics or not.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; The commission further maintained that HTS personnel would be unable to "maintain reliable control" over the information they collected, and that there was a "significant likelihood" that HTS data would be used "as part of military intelligence", which would place "researchers and their counterparts in the field in harm's way".&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It also noted that if HTS were a research organization, "it would be required to comply with federal law for subject protection" and suggested that it was "unusual" that the program had avoided oversight by an [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB).&lt;ref name=Zehfuss /&gt; In conclusion, the report stated: "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic features of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology". It recommended that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with [[Anthropology|anthropological]] disciplinary ethics and practice.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICreport&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=CEAUSSIC Releases Final Report on Army HTS Program|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/CEAUSSIC-Releases-Final-Report-on-Army-HTS-Program.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the AAA restated their disapproval of the HTS program after a cover story article in [[C4ISR Journal|''C4ISR'']] (a ''[[Defense News]]'' publication) claimed that "the controversy ha[d] cooled" and that HTS would have a recruiter at the annual AAA meeting in November that year.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name="C41SR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAblog&gt;{{cite web|last=AAA blog|title=Anthropologists and the Human Terrain System|url=http://blog.aaanet.org/2012/04/25/anthropologists-and-the-human-terrain-system/|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAA denied both claims.&lt;ref name=C41SR /&gt;

====Anthropologists====
In 2007, the [[Network of Concerned Anthropologists]] (NCA) was founded by a group of anthropologists, largely in response to the HTS program.&lt;ref name=JacksonMIT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Jean|title=Anthropologists Express Concern Over Government Plan to Support Military Research|journal=MIT Faculty Newsletter|date=May–June 2008|volume=20|issue=1|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/205/jackson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite&gt;{{cite web|last=Network of Concerned Anthropologists|title=NCA website|url=https://sites.google.com/site/concernedanthropologists/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Network wrote an "Anthropologists' Statement on the Human Terrain System Program" to the [[United States House of Representatives]], which was signed by over 700 anthropologists.&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Do Professional Ethics Matter in War?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=March 2010|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/do-professional-ethics-matter-war|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement called for Congress to halt governmental support to HTS and cancel plans for its expansion, giving the following reasons: "There is no evidence that HTS is effective"; "HTS is dangerous and reckless"; "HTS wastes taxpayers money"; "HTS is unethical for anthropologists and other social scientists".&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite /&gt;

Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]]), [[Hugh Gusterson]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[George Mason University]]), and [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) – three of the founding members of NCA – have all written numerous articles criticizing HTS as an effort to "weaponize anthropology". In a 2010 article, Gusterson wrote of the program: "The Pentagon seems to have decided that anthropology is to the war on terror what physics was to the [[cold war]]".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;  He criticized HTS for performing "drive-by research" as well as violating disciplinary ethics, arguing that the AAA Code of Ethics is comparable to the [[Hippocratic oath]]: "Asking an anthropologist to gather intelligence that may lead to someone's death or imprisonment ... is like asking an army doctor to kill a wounded insurgent".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Flintoff&gt;{{cite web|last=Flintoff|first=Corey|title=Marines Tap Social Sciences in Afghan War Effort|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125502485|publisher=NPR|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Price has described HTS as part of a "[[neocolonialism|neocolonial]]" mission.&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; "Human Terrain System", he maintained, "is not some neutral humanitarian project, it is an arm of the US military and it is part of the military's mission to occupy and destroy opposition to US goals and objectives ... HTS's goal is a gentler form of domination".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; In an article in ''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]'' in April 2009, Price disputed Colonel Schweitzer's claims that HTS had reduced kinetic action by 60–70%, reporting that his efforts to track the studies (via the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]) on which these statistics were based resulted in Schweitzer's admission that there were no such studies and that the statistics were a "loose estimate".&lt;ref name=counterpunch.com /&gt;  In the same article, Price also criticized the coverage of HTS in the US media and published a list of ten fundamental issues that reporters needed to address.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency's free ride|journal=Counterpunch|date=7 April 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.com/price04072009.html |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026015533/http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/04/07/counterinsurgency-s-free-ride/ |archivedate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper from 2009, [[Neil L Whitehead]], Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], questioned whether HTS can work in the way that it is promoted to do.  Drawing on anthropological studies of warfare that demonstrate the socially transformative effects of warfare and military action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=R. Brain|title=War in the Tribal Zone: Expanding States and Indigenous Warfare|year=2000|publisher=School of American Research Press|isbn=0933452802|author2=Neil L. Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead argued that the practice of anthropology becomes "highly problematic" in a situation where anthropology is being deployed to report on "the very phenomenon it is a part of changing, whether consciously or not".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt; He therefore suggested that ethical objections to HTS are not limited to the anthropologist's potential violation of their duty of confidentiality and responsibility to their informants, but also include the questionable "ethical responsibility" of those anthropologists and military planners "erroneously" promoting HTS as being able to work in ways that "in all likelihood" cannot actually work, thereby "endangering anthropologists and soldiers alike".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt;

Other anthropologists who have criticized HTS include [[Marshall Sahlins]], who describes HTS as "manipulating local culture, imposing [our government's objectives] on them, transforming anthropologists into spies, and putting people you work with [in the locale] at risk"; and Maximilian Forte, who has published numerous articles on HTS in academic journals and on internet websites.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobsen&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobsen|first=Kurt|title=Are we there just to help the Army aim better?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/may/13/internationaleducationnews.highereducation|accessdate=24 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteZA&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|title=Max Forte|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/about-the-bloggers/max-forte/|publisher=Zeroanthropology.net|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military officials and former HTS personnel====
In 2009, Major Ben Connable ([[Marine Corps]]) published an article in ''[[Military Review]]'' which argued that HTS was "undermining" the US Army's "cultural competence".&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Connable&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connable|first=Ben|title=All our Eggs in a Broken Basket: How the Human Terrain System is Undermining Sustainable Military Cultural Competence|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2009|pages=57–64|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20090430_art010.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former HTS personnel have also criticized the program. In 2007, social scientist Zenia Helbig was fired from HTS after raising concerns that the program was disorganized and provided insufficient region-specific training.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title=Military Research: The Pentagon's Culture Wars|journal=Nature|date=October 2001|volume=455|pages=583–585|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081001/full/455583a.html|doi=10.1038/455583a|accessdate=25 June 2012|issue=7213|pmid=18833247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SchactmanZH&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Army Social Scientists Calm Afghanistan, Make Enemies at Home|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/11/human_terrain?currentPage=1|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HelbigAAA&gt;{{cite news|last=Helbig|first=Zenia|title=Personal Perspective on HTS: Address to AAA Conference (.doc)|url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/files/aaa_helbig_hts.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2012|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Matt Tompkins, an HTT Leader, remarked that defense contractors supporting HTS were not providing sufficient training or staffing, and that the social scientists on his team lacked region-specific expertise.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012 /&gt; After resigning from the program in 2010, John Allison criticized HTS for its doctrinal inflexibility and lack of openness to anthropological perspectives and suggestions for improvement.&lt;ref name=Price2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain System Dissenter Resigns, Tells Inside Story of Training's Heart of Darkness|journal=Counterpunch|date=15 February 2010|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2010/02/15/human-terrain-systems-dissenter-resigns-tells-inside-story-of-training-s-heart-of-darkness/|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NDU Study====
In June 2013, a team of four researchers from the US [[National Defense University]] in Washington, DC published an in-depth assessment of HTS and the HTTs in Afghanistan, entitled ''Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare''.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=Christopher|last2=Orton|first2=James Douglas|last3=Davies|first3=Michael C.|last4=Pikulsky|first4=Theodore T.|title=Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare|year=2013|publisher=Institute of World Politics Press|location=|isbn=978-0988864207}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first publicly released book with a history of the program as well as an assessment of the teams in the field. The study's conclusions were also published in ''Joint Force Quarterly'' in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Christopher|title=The Way Ahead for Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=739537|publisher=NDU Press|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study emerged from the [[Project for National Security Reform]] and its flagship assessment of the US national security system, [[Forging a New Shield]]. The study interviewed 87 individuals in a total of 105 interviews. The participants were principally team members, with commanders (primarily Brigade- and Task Force-level commanders) being the core variable able to define effectiveness of the team under their command. HTS program managers, knowledgeable defense-related persons, and some Iraq team members were interviewed.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|157}} In researching the program's history, the study's authors found that the relationship between HTS and the Army's [[Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) was one of the primary reasons for the problems within the program. Decisions made about HTS by TRADOC, such as new personnel contracts, had a negative impact on the program. However, the lack of a theory of performance in the beginning by HTS, and the lack of continual assessments of the teams in the field by HTS, meant that the program managers lacked the knowledge to train and deploy effective HTTs.

The authors also point out that the study's assessments strongly agree with the conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at [[West Point]], the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] (CNA), and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited the effectiveness of the teams in the field. Yet, all agree that a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|175–176}}

The NDU study was different in that it categorized the commanders' assessments according to basic concepts of "Cultural Awareness" (Description), "Cultural Understanding" (Explanation), and "Cultural Intelligence" (Prediction). It was found that most commanders only found and used their HTTs at the first level, Awareness. Some of the better performing HTTs could offer Understanding. Only a few HTTs, the very high performing teams with highly effective individuals, held a strong sense of teamwork and were commanded by culturally aware units and commanders. If commanders did not care about cultural issues, which did occur in some cases, the team would have no impact regardless of the team's effectiveness in other circumstances.

Finally, the nature of the intelligence architecture in Afghanistan was seen as the issue that had the biggest impact on HTT performance. Because the intelligence architecture did not value sociocultural knowledge and was not built to provide it, HTTs themselves had to be the ground sensors, a role they had not been designed to fulfill. HTTs were intended to be the aggregators of knowledge at the Brigade level to synthesize information to commanders directly. If HTTs had been built to be the sensors, they would have had to be multiplied in size and number many times over. By utilizing the HTTs as the primary interviewers and data analysts, their effectiveness was constrained. Since HTT members had relatively short tours (9–12 months), and would usually have a new Brigade arrive in the middle of their tour, their effectiveness was further reduced by their constant need to train new units on area features. The NDU team concluded that had soldiers themselves been the primary sensors on the ground, as recommended in LTG [[Michael T. Flynn]]'s ''Fixing Intel'' monograph, HTTs would have better been able to perform the role they were originally intended to serve.&lt;ref name="Flynnbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flly|first1=Michael T.|last2=Pottinger|first2=Matthew|last3=Batchelor|first3=Paul D.|title=Fixing Intel|year=2010|publisher=Center for a New American Security|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NDU book ends by suggesting that HTS be turned over to the [[U.S. Army Special Operations Command]] (USASOC). There were a number of reasons the team suggested USASOC would be a better fit for HTS: TRADOC had been a prime cause of multiple programmatic problems for HTS throughout its history; the US military has a history of intentionally forgetting and deinstitutionalizing cultural programs; and the future operating environment would be utilizing Special Operations forces to a greater degree than regular Army/Marines units.

====In the media====
[[Ann Marlowe]] wrote a piece about HTS for the ''Weekly Standard'' in November 2007, stating that "there are some things the Army needs in Afghanistan, but more academics are not at the top of the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marlowe|first=Ann|title=Anthropology Goes to War|newspaper=The Weekly Standard (magazine)|date=26 November 2007|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/15464 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web. 24 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;   The spectrum provides the idea that sexuality/identity is loosely identifiable by specific means or measurements. The human sexuality spectrum contradicts sexuality binaries.

Sexuality and gender roles have primarily been based on biological and anatomical basis. Gender is generally legally based on the sex organs that the individual has, in most countries of the world if not all. Under the human sexuality spectrum system, sexuality and gender roles are found on the spectrum, the spectrum accounts for any minor variations that can be found in any given person. This system is found to be useful for many who do not like to be limited to a label. Many people find themselves deviating from a strict label. The pressure to place a label on a person’s sexual or gender preferences causes stress for the person who may not fit on one of societies provided labels.

It cannot be certain if people sit on one point of the spectrum their entire life or if they move over time. Research does suggest that sexuality can move along the spectrum at any given point in a person’s lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The idea or hypothesis of sexual fluidity accounts for this.

==Commonly labeled sexualities==
[[Heterosexuality]] - The attraction of a person to only people of the opposite gender. This is commonly labelled as “straight”.

[[Bisexuality]] - The attraction of a person to two or more genders. Usually, but not necessarily, both female and male. Attraction to each gender is not necessarily always equal. 

[[Homosexuality]] - The attraction of a person to only people of the same gender. There are different labels for males and females who identify with this term.

[[Gay]] - Same as above, although usually used for men.

[[Lesbian]] - Females with an attraction to only the same gender.

[[Queer]] - umbrella term for someone whom belongs in neither of the binary genders. (See ‘non-binary’)

[[Asexuality|Asexual]] - Someone who has no sexual attraction towards any particular gender or group. 

[[Aromantic]] - Someone who does not experience romantic love or attraction. 

[[Pansexual]] - Someone who is attracted to people regardless of their gender, attraction to all genders. Can also be known as omnisexual.

[[Polysexual]] - Someone who is attracted to more than one gender and/or form of gender expression, but not all.

==Kinsey scale==
A heterosexual to homosexual rating scale produced by [[Alfred Kinsey]] along with his colleagues Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin in 1948. The scale was developed as part of a theory that people did not necessarily only fit in an extreme view of the heterosexual or homosexual sexuality binary. 
The scale ranges on a 0-6 scale from exclusively heterosexual (0) to exclusively homosexual (6) with five steps in between. The chart is a basic scale depicting sexuality solely based on male and female attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kinseyinstitute.org/research/publications/kinsey-scale.php|title=Prevalance of Homosexuality study|website=kinseyinstitute.org|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem with the [[Kinsey scale]] is that it does not account for a lot of the sexualities that fall under the idea of queer nor does it account for gender identities. The scale is extremely linear with only a limited number of systematic steps and it only has two extremes. The scale is also based on a self-evaluation which is indefinite and subject to change over time. Because of this, Kinsey believed that we should develop a way to assign a position on the scale at each point in the person’s life.
The human sexuality spectrum is more effective in how it depicts smoother transitions in between sexualities. The human sexuality spectrum can also include gender roles. The Kinsey scale has the human sexuality spectrum beat in how it provides a numerical scale for its users. The Kinsey scale provides measurable data which the human sexuality spectrum is not able to do.

==Idea / theory of sexual fluidity==
Sexuality lies on a spectrum but the theory of sexual fluidity allows for the idea of variation over time. Kinsey supported this by finding evidence in his research that people seem to find their sexuality can change over time. The idea of sexual fluidity is that sexuality does not necessarily stay in one place on the spectrum. It can vary over time depending on situations. Someone’s perceived sexuality may not always fit who the person ends up being attracted to. Sexuality can bend and flow and end up surprising a person. The idea of sexual fluidity is a theory though as there is no way to prove sexuality is fluid. What can be said is that there is research based evidence of people deviating from their perceived sexuality. This supports the idea of the human sexuality spectrum as it provides evidence that sexuality does not necessarily fit on an extreme but can be found at any point in between. It is impossible to prove whether the person’s sexuality changed or if their sexuality was different than they thought all along. This theory suggests that not all gay people are born gay.

[[File:IFO institute.JPG|thumb|350px|The main building of the Ifo institute in Munich. Address: Poschinger Straße 5.]]
The '''Ifo Institute for Economic Research''' is a [[Munich]]-based research institution. Ifo is an acronym from '''I'''nformation and '''Fo'''rschung (research). As one of Germany's largest economic think-tanks, it analyses economic policy and is widely known for its monthly [[Ifo Business Climate Index]] for Germany. Its research output is significant: about a quarter of the articles published by German research institutes in international journals in economics in 2006 were from Ifo researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Handelsblatt: ''[https://www.handelsblatt.com/news/Default.aspx?_p=302030&amp;_t=ft&amp;_b=1291044 Forschungsleistung der Institute: Ifo hat die Nase deutlich vorn]'', 9. Juli 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] ranking, it is also Germany's most influential economics research institute.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bernau: ''[http://blogs.faz.net/fazit/2017/11/01/muenchener-institut-und-universitaet-sind-einflussreich-9342/ Münchener Institut und Universität sind einflussreich]'', FAZ Fazit, 1 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
According to its by-laws, the aim of the Ifo Institute is to conduct empirical research in the fields of economics and social science, and to supply data, information and research results in economics and economic policy. The results of Ifo’s work are made accessible to the general public and should – according to Ifo’s by-laws – support decision-making in academia, business, politics and administration.

* Supplying the public with economic data. The Institute organizes seminars and presentations by and for its own researchers and other economists. The well-known Ifo Business Climate Index is Ifo’s most prominent instrument for business cycle analyses. With its DICE database the Ifo Institute offers cross-country comparisons of systematic information on institutions and regulations. The Institute also publishes a number of journals in economics.
* Generating its own data (e.g. Ifo Business Climate Index) via its corporate surveys.
* Providing policy advice to influential public agencies, especially to federal and state ministries in Germany.
* Developing models to simulate the effects of market intervention in the economy.
* Research in economics. : Ifo’s research prior to 1999 was heavily geared towards its advisory function. Following the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Council a stronger university orientation was followed as of 1999. As a research organisation the Ifo Institute cooperates closely with many German universities, especially with the [[University of Munich]] (LMU), as well as with numerous domestic and foreign research institutes.
* The Institute has a branch in Dresden, which focuses on analysis of economic developments in Saxony and the other new states.

== Structure ==
The Ifo Institute is a registered society with the sole purpose of non-profit, economic and social research. Its by-laws constitute the legal foundation of the society. Ifo’s main organs are the Annual General Meeting, the Executive Board, the Ifo Administrative Council, the Board of Trustees and the Scientific Advisory Council. The Chairman of the Executive Board is also described in the by-laws as the Institute’s President. Alongside the President, the Executive Board may also have one to two further members. The Administrative Council supervises the Executive Board. It consists of two members from the Board of Trustees, two members from the University of Munich, a federal government representative, a Bavarian State government representative, the Chairman of the Scientific Administrative Council and further members who are elected by the Annual General Meeting. The aim of the Board of Trustees, as stated in the by-laws, is to support the Executive Board in fulfilling the society’s aims. According to Ifo’s by-laws, the Board of Trustees should have, “at least 20 members from academia, business, politics, trade unions and administration”.

Around two thirds of the Ifo Institute’s financing currently comes from public funds (in the form of joint research funding from the government and the Länder via the [[Leibniz Association]]), while around one third comes from the proceeds of third-party funded projects, which are mainly commissioned by public sector clients (“scientific policy advisory work”). Research for the private sector is relatively insignificant

The Ifo Institute is an institute “at the University of Munich”, which reflects its close links with the university.

The Dresden branch of Ifo is mainly financed by grants from the Free State of Saxony (as well as by a small amount of third-party funds).

== Staff ==
The Ifo Institute currently employs about 193 people, approximately half of whom are researchers.  The current Ifo president is [[Clemens Fuest]].

== History ==
The Ifo Institute was founded in 1949 as the '''I'''nformations- und '''Fo'''rschungsstelle (Ifo – Information and Research branch) für Wirtschaftsbeobachtung (for economic monitoring) with funds from the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior. In 1993 the Ifo Institute opened a branch in Dresden to analyse the economic integration of both parts of reunified Germany. Under the presidency of Hans-Werner Sinn, Ifo became an Institute “at” the University of Munich [[University of Munich]] (LMU), which was reflected in its expanded name (which was changed to "Ifo Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich") and its close cooperation with the [[Center for Economic Studies]] (CES), also headed by Sinn.

==Report on the German economy==
The '''Ifo Institute''' participates in the twice yearly (spring and autumn) joint analysis of the state of the German and world economy, the so-called ''Gemeinschaftsdiagnose''. &lt;ref&gt;German government Web site [https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2017/20170412-zypries-gemeinschaftsdiagnose-stellt-deutscher-wirtschaft-gutes-zeugnis-aus.html Bundeswirtschaftsministerium Online {{De icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The other institutes are:
[[Institut für Weltwirtschaft]] (IfW) in [[Kiel]]; [[Halle Institute for Economic Research|Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung]] (IWH) in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]; and [[Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung]] (RWI) in [[Essen]].

== Evaluation ==
At its meeting of 2 November 2009 the Joint Science Conference (GWK - Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz) of the German federal and state governments decided to re-classify and fund the Ifo Institute as a “primarily research institution”. For over a decade prior to this point the Ifo Institute was jointly funded by the federal government and the Länder as an “institution that primarily conducts scientific infrastructure tasks” (as a service institution). In taking this decision, the GWK followed the recommendation of the Leibniz Association Senate of 4 March 2009.

After an extensive evaluation by an international commission of experts in 2006, the Senate of the Leibniz Association had already acknowledged that the Ifo Institute showed: “good, and in some areas very good to excellent achievements in economics research and policy advisory work”. This positive assessment was qualified by the Senate’s criticism of Ifo’s services, which were partly described as: “not corresponding to the latest research, especially with regard to their methodological foundations”.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz Gemeinschaft Referat Evaluierung (Hrsg.): "Leibniz-Senat verabschiedet positive Förderempfehlungen zu fünf Leibniz-Einrichtungen", Pressemitteilung E8/2006 vom 15. Juni 2006, als PDF-Datei aufzurufen auf der WGL-Seite [http://www.wgl.de/?nid=pmeva&amp;nidap= Pressemitteilungen]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 the Senate came to the conclusion that the Ifo Institute had addressed these shortcomings.

In its 2006 report the evaluation commission also described CESifo GmbH, the joint subsidiary of the LMU and the Ifo Institute, as a “great institution for knowledge transfer and international cooperation.”

== Publications ==
According to a study cited by the ''Handelsblatt'', the Ifo Institute was the economics think-tank with the highest number of publications in Germany in 2006. In the ''Handelsblatt'' ranking of economists under the age of 40 years, Ifo ranked top among all of the economics institutes and faculties in German-speaking countries in 2011. In the RePEc ranking of research performance, disregarding age, the Ifo Institute ranked third among Germany’s economics research institutes and faculties. The list below features Ifo's main publications:

==Cultural festival==

IISER Mohali's first cultural festival (Conoscenza) was held in 2012. Spread over three days, a Parliamentary Debate and numerous quizzes were the main events. A workshop on 'science writing' was also organised.

The next year, Conoscenza was replaced by a full-fledged cultural festival- Insomnia. Apart from parliamentary debate and quizzing, the availability of a large auditorium enabled the organisation of events related to music, dance and dramatics.

Insomnia is planned to be held every year; Insomnia 2014 was held between 4 and 6 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insomnia2014.com/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325102931/http://www.insomnia2014.com/ |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insomnia 2015 was held on 27–29 March 2015 and many many cultural, quizzing and gaming contests were the key features of the event and most importantly the theme of Insomnia 2015 was "GO GREEN".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-insomnia.net/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315161420/http://www.i-insomnia.net/ |date=15 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insomnia 2016 was held from 4–6 March 2016 and saw an attendance of participants and audience from colleges like ISB, IIT's, NIT's, Panjab University, PEC and lot more.&lt;ref&gt;http://insomniacx.in&lt;/ref&gt; Parikrama - The Band performed at the event to a huge crowd.

The past sponsors for INSOMNIA include brands like Hero, Mediacomm, Canara Bank, SBI etc.

Insomnia 2017 was held on 24–26 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://insomniafest.xyz&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guthrie Govan]], Mohini Dey and Gino Banks performed on the night of 24 February 2017.

==National Science Day celebrations==
[[National Science Day]] celebrations on 28 February are a regular feature at IISER Mohali, every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iisermohali.ac.in/scienceday2014/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629025012/http://iisermohali.ac.in/scienceday2014/index.html |date=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invitations are sent to schools in  [[Mohali]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Panchkula]] and nearby areas. 
The focus of the day is on science and mathematics demonstrations prepared by IISER Mohali students and faculty members. A large number of schools send teams for inter-school competitions such as science quizzes, group discussions, treasure hunt, junkyard wars, poster presentation held on this day. Other non-competitive events such as documentary screening, anti-superstition demonstrations, atc. are also held. The day usually ends with a 'panel discussion' in which the school students ask science-related questions to a panel of faculty members of IISER Mohali. 
Since 2015, the Science Day celebrations have been shifted to 27 September, IISER Mohali's Foundation Day, as this date is more convenient for school students in the region.

==Opportunity Cell==
The Opportunity Cell was first proposed by the Student Representative Council, in October 2011 as a joint student-faculty
body to provide guidance to students about research and job opportunities. In the year 2012−13, the opportunity cell established a summer
research and internship programme with [[National Centre for Biological Sciences]] (NCBS), Bangalore, Connexios Life sciences &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connexios.com/ |title=Connexios Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd |website=Connexios.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucid Software Limited (Lucid). It also organised various seminars such as 
"Alternative Careers in Science", "Research Opportunities at [[University of St Andrews]]" etc. Currently the cell disseminates information about
summer research programmes, PhD positions and research oriented jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iisermohali.ac.in/OppCell_f1-master/public/index.php/home |title=Home &amp;#124; Opportunity Cell |website=Iisermohali.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==
Two editions of IISER Mohali's magazine ("Manthan") have been published so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iisermmag.wordpress.com/ |title=iisermmag &amp;#124; eManthan: IISER Mohali Online Magazine |website=Iisermmag.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9109">'''Interaction theory''' (IT) is an approach to questions about [[social cognition]], or how one understands other people, that focuses on bodily behaviors and environmental contexts rather than on mental processes.  IT argues against two other contemporary approaches to social cognition (or what is sometimes called ‘[[theory of mind]]’), namely [[theory theory]] (TT) and [[Simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]] (ST).  For TT and ST, the primary way of understanding others is by means of ‘mindreading’ or ‘mentalizing’ – processes that depend on either theoretical inference from [[folk psychology]], or simulation.  In contrast, for IT, the minds of others are understood primarily through our embodied interactive relations.  IT draws on interdisciplinary studies and appeals to evidence developed in [[developmental psychology]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)]], and [[neuroscience]].

== Origins ==

According to Michael et al (2013),&lt;ref&gt;Michael, J., Christiansen, W., and Overgaard, S. (2013). Mindreading as social expertise. Synthese. DOI 10.1007/s11229-013-0295-z&lt;/ref&gt; “The recent surge of interactionist approaches to social cognition can be traced back to [[Shaun Gallagher]]’s proposal for a new approach to social cognition, which he labeled ‘interaction theory’.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. (2001). The practice of mind: Theory, simulation, or primary interaction?  Journal of Consciousness Studies, 8 (5–7): 83–107&lt;/ref&gt; Gallagher argued that mainstream mindreading approaches neglect the interactive contexts in which social cognition is embedded, and thereby overlook embodied and extended processes that are engaged in interactions, and which are important components of social cognition.”  The basic ideas of IT can be traced back to the work of Colwyn Trevarthen&lt;ref&gt;Trevarthen, C. B. 1979. Communication and cooperation in early infancy: A description of primary intersubjectivity. In M. Bullowa (ed.), Before Speech.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who coined the term ‘primary intersubjectivity’ to refer to early developing sensory-motor processes of interaction between infants and caregivers.  Other work in developmental psychology by [[Daniel Stern (psychologist)]], [[Andrew N. Meltzoff]], [[Peter Hobson]], Vasu Reddy, and others, provides important evidence for the role of interaction in social cognition.  Similar insights can be found earlier in the work of the phenomenologists, like [[Max Scheler]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].   IT has also motivated a rethinking in the methods for studying social cognition in neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;Schilbach, L.,Timmermans, B., Reddy, V., Costal, A., Schlicht, T. and Vogeley, K. 2013. Toward a second-person neuroscience. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 36(4): 393-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary and secondary intersubjectivity ==

[[Colwyn Trevarthen]]&lt;ref&gt;Trevarthen, C. B. 1979. Communication and cooperation in early infancy: A description of primary intersubjectivity. In M. Bullowa (ed.), Before Speech.  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; coined the term ‘primary [[intersubjectivity]]’ to refer to early developing sensory-motor processes of interaction between infants and there caregivers.  Important cues for understanding others are provided by their facial expressions, bodily posture and movements, gestures, actions, and in processes of neonate imitation, proto-conversations, gaze following and affective attunement. "In most intersubjective situations, that is, in situations of social interaction, we have a direct perceptual understanding of another person’s intentions because their intentions are explicitly expressed in their embodied actions and their expressive behaviors. This understanding does not require us to postulate or infer a belief or a desire hidden away in the other person’s mind. What we might reflectively or abstractly call their belief or desire is expressed directly in their actions and behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. &amp; Hutto, D. (2008). Understanding others through Primary Interaction and Narrative Practice. In T. Zlatev, T. Racine, C. Sinha, &amp; E. Itkonen, The Shared Mind: Perspectives on Intersubjectivity (pp. 17–38). Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime during the first year of life infants also start to enter into [[joint attention]] situations and begin to pay attention to how others act and what they do with objects in everyday contexts, and this also provides a way to understand their intentions and contextualized actions.  This is referred to as ‘secondary intersubjectivity’, which highlights the fact that interactions often take place in cooperative contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Trevarthen, C. and Hubley, P. 1978. Secondary intersubjectivity: Confidence, confiding and acts of meaning in the first year. In A. Lock (ed.), Action, Gesture and Symbol: The Emergence of Language (pp. 183-229). London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  During most interactions, intentions are apparent based upon the pragmatic context of the situation in which they are occurring. We can instantly see what the other “intends” or “wants” based upon their actions and the current context; we do not need to infer their intentions as if they are hidden away. There is a “shared world” that we live in where we intuitively and instinctively perceive others as minded beings like ourselves.

== Direct perception ==

Interaction theory supports the notion of the direct perception of the other's intentions and emotions during intersubjective encounters. Gallagher&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. (2005). How the Body Shapes the Mind.  Oxford: Oxford University Press/Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. 2008. Direct perception in the intersubjective context.  Consciousness and Cognition 17: 535–543&lt;/ref&gt; argues that most of what we need for our understanding of others is based on our interactions and perceptions, and that very little mindreading occurs or is required in our day-to-day interactions. Rather than first perceiving another’s actions and then inferring the meaning of their actions (as in TT), the intended meaning is perceptible in the other person’s movements and contextualized actions.  Differences in a person’s intentions show up as differences in perceptible kinematic properties of action movements.&lt;ref&gt;Becchio C., Manera V., Sartori L., Cavallo A., Castiello U. (2012). Grasping intentions: from thought experiments to empirical evidence. Frontiers of Human Neuroscience, 6, 117&lt;/ref&gt;  A person’s emotions are not only expressed on their faces and in their postures and gestures, but these perceptible embodied aspects help to constitute what the emotion is. Mental states (like intentions and emotions) are therefore not hidden away from view, they are, IT claims, in fact, and at least in part, bodily states that are apparent in the action movements that constitute them. For example, as phenomenologists from [[Max Scheler]] to [[Dan Zahavi]] point out, upon seeing an angry face an observer does not first see a face that is contorted into a scowl and then infer that the target is angry. The anger is immediately apparent on the face of the other.  The overwhelming majority of interactions in our daily lives are face-to-face so it makes sense that our primary way of understanding one another is from a second-person perspective rather than from the detached, theoretical, third-person perspective described by TT and ST.

== Narrative competency ==

In addition to primary and secondary intersubjectivity, and the contributing dynamics of interaction itself to the social cognitive process,&lt;ref&gt;De Jaegher, H., Di Paolo, E. &amp; Gallagher, S. (2010). Can social interaction constitute social cognition? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 14 (10), 441-447&lt;/ref&gt; IT proposes that more nuanced and sophisticated understandings of others are based, not primarily on folk psychological theory or the use of simulation, but on the implicit and explicit uses of narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, S. &amp; Hutto, D. (2008). Understanding others through primary interaction and narrative practice. In T. Zlatev, T. Racine, C. Sinha, &amp; E. Itkonen, The Shared Mind: Perspectives on Intersubjectivity (pp. 17–38). Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutto, D. Folk Psychological Narratives: The Sociocultural Basis of Understanding Reasons. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;  IT builds on the notion that the pervasiveness of narratives in most cultures, from the earliest nursery rhymes to the performances of theater, film, and television, expose us to a variety of characters, situations, and reasons for acting in certain ways.  These, combined with personal narratives, provide the background knowledge that allows us to implicitly frame the actions of others in understandable narratives, providing a fallible and revisable sense of what the other is up to.

'''Language arts''' (also known as [[English language|English]] language arts) is the study and improvement of the arts of language. Traditionally, the primary divisions in language arts are [[literature]] and language, where language in this case refers to both [[linguistics]], and specific [[language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The Road to [[Middle-earth|Middle-Earth]]", T. A. Shippey&lt;/ref&gt; Language arts instruction typically consists of a combination of [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] (composition), [[speaking]], and listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.com/reference/article/components-language-arts-curriculum/|title=The Four Components of the Language Arts Curriculum  {{!}} Education.com|website=www.education.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools, language arts is taught alongside [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[social studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://teach.com/what/teachers-know/english-and-language-arts/|title=English and Language Arts Teacher|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reading==
[[Reading (process)|Reading]], by definition, is the ability and knowledge of a language that allows comprehension by grasping the meaning of written or printed characters, words, or sentences. Reading involves a wide variety of print and non-print texts that helps a reader gain an understanding of the material that is being read. Reading of texts that are often included in educational curriculum include [[fiction]], [[nonfiction]], classic, and also contemporary works. Reading goes beyond calling words to understanding the information presented in a written or a visual context.

==Composition==
Composition is defined as the combination of distinct parts or elements to form a whole and the manner in which these elements are combined or related.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=composition|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/composition|journal=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following are examples of composing in language arts:
* The art or act of composing a [[literary]] work (i.e. novels, speeches, poems)
* A short [[essay]], especially one written as an academic exercise. An essay is a short literary composition on a particular [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or subject, usually in [[prose]] and generally analytic, speculative, or interpretative. There are many types of short essays, including:
**[[Five-paragraph essay]]
**Argumentative essay
**Cause and effect essay
**Comparative essay

Compositions may also include:
* [[Narrative]] essays
* [[Expository]] essays
* [[Persuasive]] essays
* [[Technical writing]] essays
* [[Research]] essays
* [[Book|Books]]
* [[Vignette (literature)|Vignettes]] 
* [[Poetry|Poems]]

== Speaking ==
Oration and live delivery are often key components of language arts programs. This can include through dramatic interpretation, speeches, oral interpretation of poetry, and the like. Speaking is a valuable way to enhance concepts of persuasion, and develop linguistic skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/study-tips/five-reasons-speaking-english-great-way-learn/|title=Five reasons why speaking English is a great way to learn it|website=englishlive.ef.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Listening ==
Listening can be considered the basis for development of speaking, reading, and writing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.com/reference/article/language-arts/|title=The Language Arts {{!}} Education.com|website=www.education.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the act of understanding spoken language, and is often paired with speaking.

'''''Law and the Modern Mind''''' is a 1930 book by [[Jerome Frank]] which argued that [[judicial decision]]s were more influenced by psychological factors than by objective legal premises.

Frank, then a legal academic, published the book after having undergone six months of [[psychoanalysis]]. In it, he argued against the "basic legal myth" that judges never make law but simply deduce legal conclusions from premises that are clear, certain, and substantially unchanging. Drawing on psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jean Piaget]], Frank proposed that judicial decisions were motivated primarily by the influence of psychological factors on the individual judge.&lt;ref name="Volkomer"&gt;Walter E. Volkomer, "Frank, Jerome N.", in Roger K. Newman, ed., ''The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law'' (2009), p. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his judicial hero, Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]], Frank urged judges and legal scholars to acknowledge openly the gaps and uncertainties in the law, and to think of law pragmatically as a tool for human betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Frank, ''Law and the Modern Mind''. New York: Anchor Books, 1963, pp. 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; The book "dropped like a bombshell on the legal and academic world",&lt;ref name="Volkomer"/&gt; quickly becoming "a jurisprudential bestseller" which "was widely noticed as well as criticized".&lt;ref&gt;Lon Luvois Fuller, Thomas W. Bechtler, ''Law in a Social Context: Liber Amicorum Honouring Professor Lon L. Fuller'' (1978), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raimundo Madrazo - La Toilette.jpg|thumb|''A Lady's maid'', by [[Raimundo Madrazo]] c. 1890–1900]]
[[File:ModelC5 1912.jpg|thumb|A maid cleaning in [[Denmark]] in 1912.]]
A '''maid''', or '''housemaid''' or '''maidservant''', is a female [[domestic worker]]. Although now usually found only in the most wealthy of [[households]], in the [[Victorian era]] domestic service was the second largest category of employment in England and Wales, after agricultural work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/census.html|title=Occupations: census returns for 1851, 1861 and 1871|work=victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Maids were once part of an elaborate hierarchy in [[great house]]s, where the [[retinue]] of servants stretched up to the housekeeper and butler, responsible for female and male employees respectively. The word "maid" itself is short for "maiden", meaning a girl or unmarried young woman or virgin. Domestic workers, particularly those low in the hierarchy, such as maids and [[footmen]], were expected to remain unmarried while in service,&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essay XI''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus, ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt; and even highest-ranking workers such as butlers could be dismissed for marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1320949/Downstairs-Downton-Abbey-How-real-servants-worked-14-hour-days-maids-confined-virgin-quarters.html|title=Downstairs at Downton: How the real servants worked 14-hour days and the maids were confined to 'virgin quarters'|date=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victorian England, all middle class families would have "help", but for most small households, this would be only one employee, the maid of all work, often known colloquially as "the girl".

Historically many maids suffered from [[Prepatellar bursitis]], an inflammation of the [[Prepatellar bursa]] caused by long periods spent on the knees for purposes of scrubbing and fire-lighting, leading to the condition attracting the colloquial name of "Housemaid's Knee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://patient.info/health/housemaids-knee-prepatellar-bursitis|title = Housemaid's Knee (Prepatellar Bursitis)|work = Patient.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{See also|Foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong}}

In the contemporary [[Western world]], comparatively few households can afford live-in domestic help, usually relying on [[cleaner]]s, employed directly or through an agency ([[Maid service]]). Today a single maid may be the only [[domestic worker]] that upper-middle class households employ, as was historically the case. 

In less developed nations, various factors ensure a labour source for domestic work: very large differences in the income of urban and rural households, widespread poverty, fewer educated women, and limited opportunities for the employment of less educated women.

Maids perform typical domestic chores such as laundry, ironing, cleaning the house, grocery shopping, cooking, and caring for household pets. They may also [[child care|take care of children]], although there are more specific occupations for this, such as [[nanny]]. In some poor countries, maids take care of the elderly and people with disabilities. Many maids are required by their employers to wear a [[uniform]].

Legislation in many countries makes certain living conditions, working hours, or minimum wage a requirement of domestic service. Nonetheless, the work of a maid has always been hard, involving a full day, and extensive duties.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} 

==Types==
[[File:Joshua Reynolds - George Clive and his Family with an Indian Maid - WGA19338.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Clive (died 1779)|George Clive]] and his family with an Indian maid, painted 1765. As she appears to be caring for the child, she may be an ''[[Amah (occupation)|ayah]]''.]]
Maids traditionally have a fixed position in the hierarchy of the large households, and although there is overlap between definitions (dependent on the size of the household) the positions themselves would typically be rigidly adhered to. The usual classifications of maid in a large household are:

* [[Lady's maid]]: a senior servant who reported directly to the [[lady]] of the house, but ranked beneath the [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|Housekeeper]], and accompanied her lady on travel. She took care of her mistress's clothes and hair, and sometimes served as confidante. 
* House-maid or housemaid: a generic term for maids whose function was chiefly "above stairs", and were usually a little older, and better paid. Where a household included multiple housemaids the roles were often sub-divided as below.
** Head house-maid: the senior house maid, reporting to the Housekeeper. (Also called "House parlour maid" in an establishment with only one or two upstairs maids).
** Parlour maid: they cleaned and tidied reception rooms and living areas by morning, and often served refreshments at [[afternoon tea]], and sometimes also dinner. They tidied studies and libraries, and (with footmen) answered bells calling for service.&lt;ref&gt;A Parlour Maid's timetable is summarised [http://chestofbooks.com/food/household/Woman-Encyclopaedia-1/Parlourmaid-s-Time-Table.html in this webpage] extract from a book.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Chamber maid: they cleaned and maintained the bedrooms, ensured fires were lit in fireplaces, and supplied hot water.
** Laundry maid: they maintained bedding and towels. They also washed, dried, and ironed clothes for the whole household, including the servants.
** Under house parlour maid: the general deputy to the house parlour maid in a small establishment which had only two upstairs maids.
* [[Nursemaid|Nursery maid]]: also an "upstairs maid", but one who worked in the children's nursery, maintaining fires, cleanliness, and good order. Reported to the [[Nanny]] rather than the Housekeeper.
* [[Kitchen maid (domestic worker)|Kitchen maid]]: a "below stairs" maid who reported to the Cook, and assisted in running the kitchens.
** Head kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed, the "head kitchen maid" was effectively a [[line cook|deputy to the cook]], engaged largely in the plainer and simpler cooking (sometimes cooking the servants' meals).
** Under kitchen maid: where multiple kitchen maids were employed these were the staff who prepared vegetables, peeled potatoes, and assisted in presentation of finished cooking for serving.
* [[Scullery maid]]: the lowest grade of "below stairs" maid, reporting to the cook, the scullery maids were responsible for washing cutlery, crockery, and glassware, and scrubbing kitchen floors, as well as monitoring ovens while kitchen maids ate their own supper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlifestyle.org/?cat=14|title=Victorian Life Style|work=victorianlifestyle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Between maid]]: roughly equivalent in status to scullery maids, and often paid less, the between maids in a large household waited on the senior servants ([[butler]], [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], and [[Cook (domestic worker)|cook]]) and were therefore answerable to all three department heads, often leading to friction in their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwardfamily.com/victorian_servants.htm|title=ourwardfamily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes known by the name 'tweeny'.
* [[Still room maid]]: a junior maid employed in the [[still room]]; as the work involved the supply of alcohol, cosmetics, medicines, and cooking ingredients across all departments of the house, the still room maids were part of the "between staff", jointly answerable to all three department heads.

In more modest households a single '''maid-of-all-work''' or '''skivvy''' was often the only staff. It is possible this word originates from the Italian for slave ("schiavo"—"owned person").

==In popular culture==
One of the most in-depth and enduring representations of the lives of several types of maid was seen in the 1970s television drama ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)|Upstairs, Downstairs]]'', set in [[England]] between 1903 and 1936. Another representation of the lives of maids is seen nowadays in ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', set in England between 1912 and 1926.

==In Middle East countries==
{{See also|Migrant workers in the Gulf region|Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia}}

Foreign women are employed in Middle East and African countries ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Somalia]], [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Nigeria]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) and others) in large numbers to work as maids and domestic servants and are often vulnerable to sexual abuse, violence and poor living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/07/07/if-i-am-not-human/abuses-against-asian-domestic-workers-saudi-arabia|title="As If I Am Not Human" - Abuses against Asian Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia|date=7 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/saudi-arabia-treatment-foreign-workers |date=13 January 2013| title=Saudi Arabia's treatment of foreign workers under fire after beheading of Sri Lankan maid |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanrightswatch1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Human Rights Watch |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=printdoc&amp;amp;docid=412ef32a4| title='Bad Dreams:' Exploitation and Abuse of Migrant Workers in Saudi Arabia |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date= 14 July 2004 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martinus Willem Beijerinck''' (16 March 1851 – 1 January 1931) was a Dutch [[microbiologist]] and [[botanist]]. He is often considered one of the founders of [[history of virology|virology]] and [[environmental microbiology]]. In spite of his numerous pioneering and seminal contributions to science in general, he was never awarded the [[Nobel Prize]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Amsterdam]], Beijerinck studied at the Technical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of Chemical Engineer in 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the [[University of Leiden]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Chung |first1 = K. T. |last2 = Ferris |first2 = D.

At the time, Delft, then a [[List of institutions using the term "institute of technology" or "polytechnic"|Polytechnic]], did not have the right to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now [[Wageningen University]]) and later at the ''Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft'' ([[Delft]] [[Institute of technology#Belgium and the Netherlands|Polytechnic]], currently [[Delft University of Technology]]) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of [[biology]]. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, [[Robert Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur]], because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease.

In 1885 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001421 |title=Martinus Willem Beijerinck (1851 - 1931) |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific contributions==
He is considered one of the founders of [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Lustig |first1 = Alice |last2 = Levine |first2 = Arnold J. | title = One Hundred Years of Virology | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 66 | issue = 8 | pages = 4629–4631 | year = 1992 |location = Washington, D.C.| pmc=241285 | pmid=1629947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bos| first1 = L. | year = 1995 | title = The Embryonic Beginning of Virology: Unbiased Thinking and Dogmatic Stagnation | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 140 | pages = 613–619 | doi=10.1007/bf01718437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Zaitlin| first = Milton | editor1-last = Kung| editor1-first = S.

W. | title = Über ein Contagium vivum fluidum als Ursache der Fleckenkrankheit der Tabaksblätter | journal = Verhandelingen der Koninklijke akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam | volume = 65 | pages = 1–22 | year = 1898 | language = German}} Translated into English in Johnson, J., Ed. (1942) ''Phytopathological classics.'' (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 33–52 (St. Paul, Minnesota)&lt;/ref&gt;

His results were in accordance with the similar observation made by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Iwanowski | first = D. | title = Über die Mosaikkrankheit der Tabakspflanze | journal = Bulletin Scientifique publié par l'Académie Impériale des Sciences de Saint-Pétersbourg |series=Nouvelle Série III'' | volume = 35 | pages = 67–70 | location = St. Petersburg | year = 1892 | language = German, Russian}} Translated into English in Johnson, J., Ed. (1942) ''Phytopathological classics'' (St. Paul, Minnesota: American Phytopathological Society) No. 7, pp. 27–-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Ivanovsky before him and [[Adolf Mayer]], predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent, however he concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new [[pathogen]] ''[[virus]]'' to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it "''[[contagium vivum fluidum]]''" (contagious living fluid). It was not until the first crystals of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) obtained by [[Wendell Stanley]] in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first X-ray crystallographic analysis of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate.

Beijerinck also discovered [[nitrogen fixation]],&lt;ref&gt;Beijerinck, M.W, 1901, ''Über oligonitrophile Mikroben, Centralblatt für Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene, Abteilung II, Vol 7'', pp. 561–582&lt;/ref&gt; the process by which diatomic [[nitrogen]] gas is converted to [[ammonium]] ions and becomes available to plants. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside [[root nodules]] of certain plants ([[legume]]s). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to [[soil]] fertility and [[agriculture]], Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of [[symbiosis]] between [[plants]] and [[bacteria]].

Beijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reduction]], a form of [[anaerobic respiration]]. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of [[biogeochemical cycles]]. ''[[Spirillum|Spirillum desulfuricans]]'', now known as ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bacterio.net/desulfovibrio.html |title=Genus ''Desulfovibrio'' |last1=Jean |first1=Euzeby |date= |website= |publisher=[[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck.

Beijerinck invented the [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying [[microbe]]s from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial ecology idea that "everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects", which was stated by [[Lourens Baas Becking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Wit R, Bouvier T. |title=Everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects; what did Baas Becking and Beijerinck really say? |journal=Environmental Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=755–758 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01017.x |pmid=16584487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Bass-Becking |first=Lourens G.M.|year=1934 |location=[[The Hague]]| publisher=W.P. Van Stockum &amp; Zoon |title=Geobiologie of inleiding tot de milieukunde }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Beijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations. He was also known for his [[ascetic]] lifestyle and his view of science and [[marriage]] being incompatible. His low popularity with his students and their parents periodically depressed him, as he very much loved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom.

==Recognition==
[[Beijerinckia]] (a genus of bacteria), [[Beijerinckiaceae]] (a family of [[Rhizobiales]]), and [[Beijerinck (crater)]] are named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33900">In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''maximum sustainable yield''' or '''MSY''' is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period.  Fundamental to the notion of [[sustainable harvest]], the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely.  Under the assumption of [[logistic function|logistic growth]], resource limitation does not constrain individuals' reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small.  At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the [[carrying capacity]], individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate.  At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals.  Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity.  At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero.  The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the [[optimum sustainable yield]] and [[maximum economic yield]].

MSY is extensively used for [[fisheries management]]. Unlike the logistic ([[Milner Baily Schaefer|Schaefer]]) model,&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSY has been refined in most modern fisheries models and occurs at around 30% &lt;ref name ="Thorpe"&gt;Thorpe 2015&lt;/ref&gt; of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

However, the approach has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and has led to the devastating collapse of many fisheries. As a simple calculation, it ignores the size and age of the animal being taken, its reproductive status, and it focuses solely on the species in question, ignoring the damage to the ecosystem caused by the designated level of exploitation and the issue of bycatch. Among [[Conservation biology|conservation biologists]] it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.&lt;ref name=Epitaph&gt;Larkin PA (1977) [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0ZITmBnzlDUJ:fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~gsd/595e/docs/22.%2520Larkin_Epitaph_Max_Sust_Yield.pdf+Larkin+1977+%22An+epitaph+for+the+concept+of+maximum+sustained+yield%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;sig=AHIEtbSBFh-w5xzWiBK7rnHSLBmolsfaWA "An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Transactions of the American Fisheries Society'', '''106''': 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;[[Carl Walters|Walters C]] and Maguire J (1996) "Lessons for stock assessment from the northern cod collapse", ''Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries'', '''6''':125–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of MSY as a fisheries management strategy developed in [[Belmar, New Jersey|Belmar]], [[New Jersey]], in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="Russell1931"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=E. S.|title=Some theoretical Considerations on the "Overfishing" Problem|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=6|issue=1|year=1931|pages=3–20|issn=1054-3139|doi=10.1093/icesjms/6.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjort et al 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham1935"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=M.|title=Modern Theory of Exploiting a Fishery, and Application to North Sea Trawling|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=10|issue=3|year=1935|pages=264–274|issn=1054-3139|doi=10.1093/icesjms/10.3.264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It increased in popularity in the 1950s with the advent of surplus-production models with explicitly estimate MSY.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;  As an apparently simple and logical management goal, combined with the lack of other simple management goals of the time, MSY was adopted as the primary management goal by several international organizations (e.g., [[International Whaling Commission|IWC]], [[Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission|IATTC]],&lt;ref&gt;IATTC, Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas|ICCAT]], [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization|ICNAF]]), and individual countries.&lt;ref name="Mace"&gt;Mace 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1949 and 1955, the U.S. maneuvered to have MSY declared the goal of international fisheries management (Johnson 2007).  The international MSY treaty that was eventually adopted in 1955 gave foreign fleets the right to fish off any coast. Nations that wanted to exclude foreign boats had to first prove that its fish were overfished.&lt;ref name="Botsford"&gt;Botsford et al 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

As experience was gained with the model, it became apparent to some researchers that it lacked the capability to deal with the real world operational complexities and the influence of [[Trophic level|trophic]] and other interactions. In 1977, [[Peter Anthony Larkin|Peter Larkin]] wrote its epitaph, challenging the goal of maximum sustained yield on several grounds: It put populations at too much risk; it did not account for spatial variability in productivity; it did not account for species other than the focus of the fishery; it considered only the benefits, not the costs, of fishing; and it was sensitive to political pressure.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larkin|first1=P. A.|title=An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield|journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society|volume=106|issue=1|year=1977|pages=1–11|issn=0002-8487|doi=10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106&lt;1:AEFTCO&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, none of these criticisms was aimed at sustainability as a goal. The first one noted that seeking the absolute MSY with uncertain parameters was risky. The rest point out that the goal of MSY was not holistic; it left out too many relevant features.&lt;ref name="Botsford"/&gt;

Some managers began to use more conservative quota recommendations, but the influence of the MSY model for [[fisheries management]] still prevailed. Even while the scientific community was beginning to question the appropriateness and effectiveness of MSY as a management goal,&lt;ref name="Larkin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sissenwine 1978&lt;/ref&gt; it was incorporated into the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea]], thus ensuring its integration into national and international fisheries acts and laws.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt; According to Walters and Maguire, an ‘‘institutional juggernaut had been set in motion’’, climaxing in the early 1990s with the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of northern cod]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters and Maguire, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modelling MSY ==

=== Population growth ===
{{see also|Population growth}}

The key assumption behind all [[sustainable harvest]]ing models such as MSY is that populations of organisms grow and replace themselves – that is, they are renewable resources.  Additionally it is assumed that because the growth rates, survival rates, and reproductive rates increase when harvesting reduces [[population density]],&lt;ref name="Russell1931"/&gt; they produce a surplus of biomass that can be harvested.  Otherwise, [[sustainable harvest]] would not be possible.

Another assumption of renewable resource harvesting is that populations of [[organisms]] do not continue to grow indefinitely; they reach an equilibrium population size, which occurs when the number of individuals matches the resources available to the population (i.e., assume classic [[logistic function|logistic growth]]).  At this equilibrium population size, called the [[carrying capacity]], the population remains at a stable size.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998, pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:logisticpopulationgrowth2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1]]

The logistic model (or [[logistic function]]) is a function that is used to describe bounded [[population growth]] under the previous two assumptions.  The [[logistic function]] is bounded at both extremes: when there are not individuals to reproduce, and when there is an equilibrium number of individuals (i.e., at [[carrying capacity]]).  Under the logistic model, population growth rate between these two limits is most often assumed to be [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] (Figure 1).  There is scientific evidence that some populations do grow in a logistic fashion towards a stable equilibrium – a commonly cited example is the [[logistic growth]] of [[yeast]].

The equation describing logistic growth is:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; N_{t} = \frac{K}{1 + \frac{K-N_0}{N_0} e^{-rt}}&lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.1)

The parameter values are:
:: &lt;math&gt; N_{t}&lt;/math&gt;=The population size at time t

:: &lt;math&gt; K&lt;/math&gt;=The carrying capacity of the population

:: &lt;math&gt; N_{0}&lt;/math&gt;= The population size at time zero

:: &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;= the intrinsic rate of population increase (the rate at which the population grows when it is very small)

From the logistic function, the population size at any point can be calculated as long as &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; N_{0}&lt;/math&gt; are known.

[[Image:growthratevs.populationsize.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2]]

Differentiating equation 1.1 give an expression for how the rate of population increases as N increases.  At first, the population growth rate is fast, but it begins to slow as the population grows until it levels off to the maximum growth rate, after which it begins to decrease (figure 2).

The equation for figure 2 is the differential of equation 1.1 ([[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst's]] 1838 [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|growth model]]):&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r N \left(1 - \frac {N}{K} \right)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.2)

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; can be understood as the change in population (N) with respect to a change in time (t).  Equation 1.2 is the usual way in which logistic growth is represented mathematically and has several important features.  First, at very low population sizes, the value of &lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{K}&lt;/math&gt; is small, so the population growth rate is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt; rN&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the population is growing exponentially at a rate r (the intrinsic rate of population increase).  Despite this, the population growth rate is very low (low values on the y-axis of figure 2) because, even though each individual is reproducing at a high rate, there are few reproducing individuals present.  Conversely, when the population is large the value of &lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{K}&lt;/math&gt; approaches 1 effectively reducing the terms inside the brackets of equation 1.2 to zero.  The effect is that the population growth rate is again very low, because either each individual is hardly reproducing or mortality rates are high.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   As a result of these two extremes, the population growth rate is maximum at an intermediate population or half the carrying capacity (&lt;math&gt;N= \frac{K}{2}&lt;/math&gt;).

=== MSY model ===

[[Image:harvestingrates.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3]]

The simplest way to model harvesting is to modify the logistic equation so that a certain number of individuals is continuously removed:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - H &lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.3)

Where H represents the number of individuals being removed from the population – that is, the harvesting rate.  When H is constant, the population will be at equilibrium when the number of individuals being removed is equal to the population growth rate (figure 3). The equilibrium population size under a particular harvesting regime can be found when the population is not growing – that is, when &lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This occurs when the population growth rate is the same as the harvest rate:

:: &lt;math&gt; rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) = H &lt;/math&gt;

Figure 3 shows how growth rate varies with population density.  For low densities (far from carrying capacity), there is little addition (or "recruitment") to the population, simply because there are few organisms to give birth.  At high densities, though, there is intense competition for resources, and growth rate is again low because the death rate is high.  In between these two extremes, the population growth rate rises to a maximum value (&lt;math&gt; N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt;).   This maximum point represents the maximum number of individuals that can be added to a population by natural processes.  If more individuals than this are removed from the population, the population is at risk for decline to extinction.&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;Jennings et al 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum number that can be harvested in a sustainable manner, called the maximum sustainable yield, is given by this maximum point.

Figure 3 also shows several possible values for the harvesting rate, H.  At &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;, there are two possible population equilibrium points: a low population size (&lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt;) and a high one (&lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt;).  At &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, a slightly higher harvest rate, however there is only one equilibrium point (at &lt;math&gt; N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt;), which is the population size that produces the maximum growth rate.  With logistic growth, this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, is where the population size is half the carrying capacity (or &lt;math&gt; N = \frac{K}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). The maximum sustainable yield is the largest yield that can be taken from a population at equilibrium.
In figure 3, if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is higher than &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, the harvesting would exceed the population's capacity to replace itself at any population size (&lt;math&gt; H_3&lt;/math&gt; in figure 3).  Because harvesting rate is higher than the population growth rate at all values of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, this rate of harvesting is not sustainable.

An important feature of the MSY model is how harvested populations respond to environmental fluctuations or illegal offtake.  Consider a population at &lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt; harvested at a constant harvest level &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;.  If the population falls (due to a bad winter or illegal harvest) this will ease density-dependent population regulation and increase yield, moving the population back to &lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt;, a stable equilibrium.  In this case, a negative feedback loop creates stability.  The lower equilibrium point for the constant harvest level &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; is not stable however; a population crash or illegal harvesting will decrease population yield farther below the current harvest level, creating a [[positive feedback]] loop leading to extinction.  Harvesting at &lt;math&gt;N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt; is also potentially unstable.  A small decrease in the population can lead to a positive feedback loop and extinction if the harvesting regime (&lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;) is not reduced.  Thus, some consider harvesting at MSY to be unsafe on ecological and economic grounds.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"&gt;Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  The MSY model itself can be modified to harvest a certain percentage of the population or with constant effort constraints rather than an actual number, thereby avoiding some of its instabilities.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

The MSY equilibrium point is semi-stable – a small increase in population size is compensated for, a small decrease to extinction if H is not decreased.  Harvesting at MSY is therefore dangerous because it is on a knife-edge – any small population decline leads to a positive feedback, with the population declining rapidly to extinction if the number of harvested stays the same.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;

The formula for maximum sustained harvest (&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) is one-fourth the maximum population or carrying capacity (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) times the intrinsic rate of growth (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Bolden and Robinson 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of MSY often holds for age-structured populations as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=William J.|date=1980-01-01|title=Optimum Age-Specific Harvesting in a Nonlinear Population Model|jstor=2556112|journal=Biometrics|volume=36|issue=4|pages=579–593|doi=10.2307/2556112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculations can be more complicated, and the results often depend on whether density dependence occurs in the larval stage (often modeled as density dependent reproduction) and/or other life stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=2HjvNbzWuTMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=%22Optimal+Control+of+Age-structured+Populations+in+Economy,+Demography,+and+the+Environment&amp;ots=mCg54KPuRi&amp;sig=eWk-Pz7XeB7WxXHUVeLywWMWais#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Optimal%20Control%20of%20Age-structured%20Populations%20in%20Economy,%20Demography,%20and%20the%20Environment&amp;f=false|title=Optimal Control of Age-structured Populations in Economy, Demography, and the Environment|last=Boucekkine|first=Raouf|last2=Hritonenko|first2=Natali|last3=Yatsenko|first3=Yuri|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136920935|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that if density dependence only acts on larva, then there is an optimal life stage (size or age class) to harvest, with no harvest of all other life stages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Hence the optimal strategy is to harvest this most valuable life-stage at MSY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getz|first=Wayne M.|date=1980-01-01|title=The ultimate-sustainable-yield problem in nonlinear age-structured populations|url=https://www.mysciencework.com/publication/show/157dcc9f75a6172a154d8c9da5c7e7bb|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|language=en|volume=48|issue=3-4|pages=279–292|doi=10.1016/0025-5564(80)90062-0|issn=0025-5564|access-date=2017-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203111733/https://www.mysciencework.com/publication/show/157dcc9f75a6172a154d8c9da5c7e7bb|archive-date=2017-02-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in age and stage-structured models, a constant MSY does not always exist. In such cases, cyclic harvest is optimal where the yield and resource fluctuate in size, through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Optimal Harvesting of Age-structured Fish Populations|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.5950/0738-1360-24.2.147|journal=Marine Resource Economics|language=en-US|doi=10.5950/0738-1360-24.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, environmental stochasticity interacts with demographically structured populations in fundamentally different ways than for unstructured populations when determining optimal harvest. In fact, the optimal biomass to be left in the ocean, when fished at MSY, can be either higher or lower than in analogous deterministic models, depending on the details of the density dependent recruitment function, if stage-structure is also included in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Conrad|first2=Jon M.|date=2015-11-01|title=Optimal escapement in stage-structured fisheries with environmental stochasticity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556415001753?np=y&amp;npKey=61e2ba84d62d6ab3316edbcaf02be9915419c89c51d6d0bdd1d49e9d1b8c7355|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|volume=269|pages=76–85|doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2015.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications of MSY model ===
Starting to harvest a previously unharvested population will always lead to a decrease in the population size.   That is, it is impossible for a harvested population to remain at its original carrying capacity.  Instead, the population will either stabilize at a new lower equilibrium size or, if the harvesting rate is too high, decline to zero.

The reason why populations can be sustainably harvested is that they exhibit a density-dependent response.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt; This means that at any population size below K, the population is producing a surplus yield that is available for harvesting without reducing population size. Density dependence is the regulator process that allows the population to return to equilibrium after a perturbation.  The logistic equation assumes that density dependence takes the form of negative feedback.&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;

If a constant number of individuals is harvested from a population at a level greater than the MSY, the population will decline to extinction.  Harvesting below the MSY level leads to a stable equilibrium population if the starting population is above the unstable equilibrium population size.

=== Uses of MSY ===
MSY has been especially influential in the management of renewable biological resources such as commercially important fish and wildlife.  In fisheries terms, '''maximum sustainable yield''' (MSY) is the largest average catch that can be captured from a stock under existing environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (NRC). 1998. Improving Fish Stock Assessments. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; MSY aims at a balance between too much and too little harvest to keep the population at some intermediate abundance with a maximum replacement rate.

Relating to MSY, the [[maximum economic yield]] (MEY) is the level of catch that provides the maximum net economic benefits or profits to society.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). 1996. OUr Living Oceans: Report on the Status of U.S. Living Marine Resources 1995. NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS0F/SPO-19. NMFS, Silver Springs, Md.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[optimum sustainable yield]], MEY is usually less than MSY.

=== Limitations of MSY approach ===
Although it is widely practiced by state and federal government agencies regulating wildlife, forests, and fishing, MSY has come under heavy criticism by ecologists and others from both theoretical and practical reasons.&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;  The concept of maximum sustainable yield is not always easy to apply in practice.  Estimation problems arise due to poor assumptions in some models and lack of reliability of the data.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;Townsend et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologists, for example, do not always have enough data to make a clear determination of the population's size and growth rate.  Calculating the point at which a population begins to slow from competition is also very difficult.  The concept of MSY also tends to treat all individuals in the population as identical, thereby ignoring all aspects of population structure such as size or age classes and their differential rates of growth, survival, and reproduction.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

As a management goal, the static interpretation of MSY (i.e., MSY as a fixed catch that can be taken year after year) is generally not appropriate because it ignores the fact that fish populations undergo natural fluctuations (i.e., MSY treats the environment as unvarying) in abundance and will usually ultimately become severely depleted under a constant-catch strategy.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;  Thus, most fisheries scientists now interpret MSY in a more dynamic sense as the [[maximum average yield]] (MAY) obtained by applying a specific harvesting strategy to a fluctuating resource.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt; Or as an optimal "escapement strategy", where escapement means the amount of fish that must remain in the ocean [rather than the amount of fish that can be harvested]. An escapement strategy is often the optimal strategy for maximizing expected yield of a harvested, stochastically fluctuating population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=William J|date=1979-12-01|title=Optimal escapement levels in stochastic and deterministic harvesting models|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0095069679900147|journal=Journal of Environmental Economics and Management|volume=6|issue=4|pages=350–363|doi=10.1016/0095-0696(79)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the limitations of MSY, does not mean it performs worse than humans using their best intuitive judgment. Experiments using students in natural resource management classes suggest that people using their past experience, intuition, and best judgement to manage a fishery generate far less long term yield compared to a computer using an MSY calculation, even when that calculation comes from incorrect population dynamic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|date=2016-07-01|title=Human judgment vs. quantitative models for the management of ecological resources|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-1295/abstract|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1553–1565|doi=10.1890/15-1295|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orange roughy ====
{{see also|Orange roughy}}
An example of errors in estimating the [[population dynamics]] of a species occurred within the New Zealand [[Orange roughy]] fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the [[orange roughy]] lived a long time and had [[k-selection|bred slowly]] (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Overfishing ==
{{see also|Overfishing}}
All around the world, from the arctic to the tropics, there is a crisis in the world's fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5800/787.short sciencemag.org Worm, Boris, ''et. a;.'' "Impacts of Biodiversity Loss on Ocean Ecosystem Services," ''Science'', 3 November 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Until fairly recently it was assumed that our marine resources were limitless.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In recent years however, an accelerating decline has been observed in the productivity of many important fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Christy and Scott 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisheries which have been devastated in recent times include (but are not limited to) the great whale fisheries, the Grand Bank fisheries of the western Atlantic, and the Peruvian anchovy fishery.&lt;ref name="Clark 1973"&gt;Clark 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent assessments by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the state of the world's fisheries indicate a levelling off of landings in the 1990s, at about 100 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources, FAO Technical Paper 335 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the composition of global catches has changed.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  As fishers deplete larger, long-lived predatory fish species such as cod, tuna, shark, and snapper, they move down to the next level – to species that tend to be smaller, shorter-lived, and less valuable.&lt;ref name="Pauly1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pauly|first1=D.|title=Fishing Down Marine Food Webs|journal=Science|volume=279|issue=5352|year=1998|pages=860–863|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.279.5352.860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overfishing is a classic example of the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref name="Clark 1973"/&gt;

== Optimum sustainable yield ==
{{see also|Optimum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the [[Level of Effort|level of effort]] (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.
In [[environmental science]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.

In [[semiotics]], a '''modality''' is a particular way in which [[information]] is to be [[Encode (semiotics)|encoded]] for presentation to humans, i.e. to the type of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] and to the status of reality ascribed to or claimed by a sign, text, or genre. It is more closely associated with the semiotics of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] (1839–1914) than [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) because [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] is conceived as an effect of a set of signs. In the Peircean model, a reference is made to an ''object'' when the sign (or ''representamen'') is interpreted recursively by another sign (which becomes its ''[[interpretant]]''), a conception of meaning that does in fact imply a classification of sign types.

==Discussion of sign-type==
The [[psychology of perception]] suggests the existence of a common cognitive system that treats all or most sensorily conveyed meanings in the same way.{{fact | date = January 2017 | reason = Unclear and un-cited.}} If all signs must also be objects of perception, there is every reason to believe that their modality will determine at least part of their nature. Thus, the sensory modalities will be [[visual]], [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]], [[Touch|tactile]], [[olfactory]], [[gustatory]], [[kinesthetic]], etc. A list of sign types would include: [[writing]], [[symbol]], index, [[image]], [[map]], [[graphics|graph]], [[diagram]], etc. Some combinations of signs can be multi-modal, i.e. different types of signs grouped together for effect. But the distinction between a ''medium'' and a modality should be clarified: 
*''text'' is a medium for presenting the modality of natural language; 
*''image'' is both a medium and a modality;
*''music'' is a modality for the auditory media.
So, the ''modality'' refers to a certain type of information and/or the representation format in which information is stored. The ''medium'' is the means whereby this information is delivered to the senses of the interpreter. Natural language is the primary modality, having many invariant properties across the auditory media as spoken language, the visual media as written language, the tactile media as [[Braille]], and kinetic media as [[sign language]]. When meaning is conveyed by spoken language, it is converted into sound waves broadcast by the speaker and received by another's ears. Yet this [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] cannot be divorced from the visual evidence of the speaker's manner and [[gestures]], and the general awareness of the physical location and its possible [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] significance. Similarly, meaning that is contained in a visual form cannot be divorced from the [[iconicity]] and implications of the form. If handwritten, is the writing neat or does it evidence emotion in its style. What type of paper is used, what colour ink, what kind of writing instrument: all such questions are relevant to an interpretation of the significance of what is represented. But images are distinguishable from natural language. For [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–80), language functions with relatively determinate meanings whereas images "say" nothing. Nevertheless, there is a [[rhetoric]] for arranging the parts that are to signify, and an emerging, if not yet generally accepted, [[syntax]] that articulates their parts and binds them into an effective whole.  Rhetorician Thomas Rosteck defined rhetoric "as the use of language and other symbolic systems to make sense of our experiences, construct our personal and collective identities, produce meaning, and prompt action in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rhetorical Theory: An Introduction|last = Borchers|first = Timothy|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = 978-1-57766-731-5|location = Belmont, CA|pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2268">'''Music Medals''' are [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|QCA]]-accredited music assessments and teaching resources offered by the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]] and aimed at younger learners. They are available to all schools and Music Services that register as Music Medals Partners.

There are five progressive levels available - Copper, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. 
 
Music Medals are distinct from [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music#Graded_Exams|Graded Music Exams]] in that there are no external examiners involved and the initial assessment is made by the teacher. All assessments are video recorded and submitted to the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]] for moderation.

==Assessment==

A Music Medals assessment is divided into three sections which are performed consecutively by the candidate. Each component of the assessment focuses on different aspects of the candidate's skills.

===Components===

* '''Ensemble'''. The candidate plays an individual line in an [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] piece for two, three or four players. Ensemble playing provides experience of the skills of leading, interaction, listening and blending with others.
* '''Solo'''. The candidate plays one piece from the [[solo (music)|solo]] repertoire list for his or her instrument and Medal.
* '''Option'''. The candidate selects and undertakes one Option test from a choice of four (Call &amp; Response, Make a Tune, Question &amp; Answer or Sight-Reading). The tests are aimed at helping candidates develop sound musicianship skills.

Candidates are awarded one of three attainment categories - '''Excellent''', '''Pass''' or '''Working Towards''' - depending on the quality of their performances across all three Music Medal components.

==Publications==

The Music Medals scheme is supported by specifically commissioned [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] repertoire and group-teaching publications.

The '''Institute of Physics (IOP) of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|Інститут фізики Національної академії наук України}}) founded in 1926 is the oldest research institution of physical science within the Academy. Being on the path of both infrastructure development and research diversification for more than 80 years, the Institute has eventually originated five more specialized research institutions.

Currently, the Institute employs more than 300 researchers (together with two Full Members and eight Corresponding Members of the NASU) and around 200 peoples of supporting personnel. It has more than 20 scientific units (including the state-of-the-art Femtosecond Laser Complex) which are grouped around four research programs

Traditionally, the Institute is focused on fundamental research. At the same time, applied research on cryogenics, LC displays, laser systems, pyroelectric detectors, biophysics and plasma technologies strengthen the Institute's activities.

The IOP is consistently ranked at the top of national academic institutions ranking. Besides, international reputation of IOP is growing constantly as prominent scientists from the Institute expand their activity to leading foreign research centers and universities.

==History==
The origin of the Institute of Physics is dated back to 1921, when the Kyiv Regional Department of Education established the Physics research laboratory. The following year, it was transformed into the Kyiv Science-Research Department of Physics at [[Kyiv Polytechnic Institute]].
The separate entity was established in 1929, when the Department was transformed into the Science-Research Institute of Physics of the People's Commissariat of Education of the Ukrainian SSR. It was eventually renamed as the Institute of Physics of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. In 2009, the Institute celebrated its 80th anniversary.

Academician O.G. Goldman was the founder and the first director of the Institute, which has 20 employees in 1929, including 6 scientists and 10 graduate students. In the first years of existence, the Institute was mainly focused on the training of young scientists and finding its own areas of specialization. Many people who successfully defended their phd theses in that time then became famous scientists. Among them: academicians [[V.Ye. Lashkaryov]], [[Solomon Isaakovich Pekar|S.I. Pekar]] and V.P. Linnik, associate members of the Academy of Sciences N.D. Morgulis and P.G. Borzyak, doctors of science M.D. Gabovich, O.G. Miselyuk and others.
In 1938, the Institute has 3 major research specializations:
Semiconductor physics (heads O.G. Goldman, V.Ye. Lashkaryov since 1939);
Physics of electronic and electrovacuum processes (head N.D. Morgulis);
X-ray physics of metals (head S.D. Gertsriken)

Before the Soviet Union was attacked by Germany in 1941, the Institute employed 122 persons, including 36 scientists and 7 graduate students. The Institute has also experimental workshops with qualified staff and state-of-the-art equipment. ''Ukrainian physical notes'', a journal, was published between 1929 and 1936.

During [[World War II]], the Institute was relocated in Ufa. Academician [[Aleksandr Leipunskii|A.I. Leipunskii]] (he was the director between 1943 and 1949) and professor G.D. Latyshev from Ukrainian Physical-Technical Institute entered its management team. The focus of the research is directed towards military applications.

After the war, the Institute was quickly restored. In 1953, new buildings for laboratories, production and housing were brought into service on Nauky avenue near the Golosiyivskyi forest.

Some new areas of research activity were developed. Among them: nuclear physics (heads: A.I. Leipunskii and then M.V. Pasichnik), physics of crystals (academician A.F. Prikhot’ko), theoretical physics (academician O.S. Davydov and S.I. Pekar). Electrostatic generator, cyclotron laboratory, and nuclear reactor were put into operation in 1947, 1956, and 1960, correspondingly.

Some specialized research institutes originate from the Institute of Physics. In 1945, on the basis of Diffusion Process Department the Laboratory of Metal Physics was organized, which become the Institute of Metallophysics in 1955. On the basis of the Semiconductor Department, the Institute of Semiconductors was established in 1960. Then, the Institute for Theoretical Physics was established in 1966 from the Department of Elementary Particles. In 1970, some departments were transformed into the [[Institute for Nuclear Research of NASU|Institute for Nuclear Research]] of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. And the Institute of Applied Optics was created on the basis of Optical Quantum Electronics Department.

As a result of such organizational transformations, many famous scientists moved to the new Institutions of the Academy of Sciences. But the Institute of Physics also developed significantly and did not lose its leadership. In the 1960s, new areas such quantum electronics, holography, nonlinear optics, pyroelectronics were developed. The Institute made significant contribution to some fields in physics, such as nuclear physics, semiconductor physics, solid state physics, liquid crystals, quantum electronics, plasma physics, and others. Its scientists received certificates for 5 discoveries – more than any other institution in Ukraine. Moreover, scientists of the Institute were awarded the [[Lenin Prize]], 4 State Prizes of the USSR, and 18 State Prizes of Ukraine in physics.

In 1979, the Institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for its large-scale success in the development of physical science and training the highly qualified personnel.

Due to the unique architecture of the main building of the Institute and painting on its dome made by honoured Ukrainian artist [[M.A. Storozhenko]], the main building of the Institute was recognized to have a significant historical value and listed among other monuments of architecture, history, and art.

==Core research directions==

===Condensed matter and soft matter physics===

The main focus is on the optical and spectroscopic investigations of [[composite material]]s, [[molecular crystal]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[liquid crystal]]s. The properties of [[exciton]]s and other [[quasiparticle]]s are also studied, as well as quantum-dimensional structures. Research interests extend to [[high-temperature superconductivity]], magnetic phenomena such as [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]], [[magnetostriction]], and [[magnetooptics]], as well as optical and magnetic phenomena  in semimagnetic semiconductors. Investigations of defects, both radiation and technological, in semiconductors are of high fundamental and practical importance, as well as developments of radiation techniques for machining semiconductor materials for [[microelectronics]]. Studies of biological systems, phototransformation in [[biomolecule]]s, laser photochemistry and spectroscopy of biomolecules.

===Nanophysics and nanoelectronics===
Such investigations began in the middle of the 1960s, when the Physical Electronics Department started studying discontinuous films and discovered the effect of cold electronic emission from such structures. Now, most of the departments work with nanoscale systems to investigate their optical, magnetic, transport, and photoelectric properties. Research activity is also directed to improving the methods for synthesis of nanoscale objects.

===Laser physics, nonlinear and singular optics, and holography===
The Institute continues investigating the physics gas lasers, solid-state lasers and dye lasers. Also, scientific interest expand to investigations of nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductor crystals, molecular crystals and liquid crystals, photorefractive materials, polymers, organic molecules, and photopolymer materials for holography and information recording. Many research projects involve nonlinear [[laser spectroscopy]] with ultrahigh resolution, photoacoustic laser spectroscopy and microscopy, or aimed at creating new methods for laser manipulation of free atom particles. There are some traditional research areas, such as [[holography|dynamic holography]], multi-beam optics, speckle fields and holographic correlation methods for laser beam transformation. Also, new investigations in [[singular optics]] are conducted.

===Surface physics, emission and plasma electronics===
Investigations of small particles and their ensembles are conducted. Optical and emission properties of discontinuous films, physical phenomena in adsorbed films, gas and metal adsorption on solid state surfaces, electronic emission, atom structure and phase transitions in two-dimensional systems, characteristics of ordered thin-film molecular systems, solid state plasma phenomena, hot charge carriers and self-organization effects in semiconductors, and phonon transportation in semiconductors are studied.

Physics of ion-beam plasma, plasmodynamics and plasma kinetics are studied. Recently, new highly efficient plasma technologies and devices were created on the basis of fundamental investigations. They include high-current plasma lenses, devices for surface cleaning and coating, plasma sterilizers of medical equipment and materials.

==History==
NARSS is an outgrowth of [[Remote Sensing Center]], established in 1971 as an American-Egyptian joint project, they were affiliated with the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology. In 1994 the authority was established as an organization under the State Ministry of Scientific Research to promote the use of state of the art [[space technology]] for the development of the country and introducing High Tech capabilities to [[regional planning]] and other applications.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narss.sci.eg/about|title=About NARSS|access-date=October 27, 2016|website=National Authority for Remote Sensing &amp; Space Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NARSS includes two major sectors: Remote Sensing and [[Space science|Space Sciences]]. The sector of remote sensing works on the use of data provided by [[earth observation satellite]]s and various airborne sensors to produce maps and spatial data for the evaluation and monitoring of [[natural resource]]s, natural hazards and management environmental. The sector of space sciences is concerned with the development of sensors for earth observation to be mounted on satellites and with all the problems involved with monitoring communication with satellites and retrieving the information for processing, and ultimately on launching an Egyptian remote sensing satellite.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Facilities==

Both the headquarters and the New Cairo space control station are located in Cairo. The receiving station is located in Aswan.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Satellites==
[[EgyptSat 1]] was a remote sensing satellite that was launched on 17 April 2007 at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].

The '''National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology''', also known as NIMBB, is a research institute of the [[University of the Philippines]]. It has four branches which are located in [[UP Diliman]] (NIMBB-Diliman), [[UP Los Baños]] (BIOTECH-UPLB), [[UP Manila]] (National Institutes of Health-IMBB/BIOTECH-UP Manila) and [[UP Visayas]] (NIMBB-UP Visayas/BIOTECH-UP Visayas).

BIOTECH laboratories are accredited and recognized by Environmental Management Bureau, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Bureau of Food and Drugs, Department of Health, and Bureau of Animal Industry.

==Research and Extension Programs==

Research and Extension at BIOTECH covers five main areas:

===Agriculture and Forest Biotechnology===
The [[Agriculture]] and [[Forestry]] [[Biotechnology]] Program is the country's incubator of agribiotechnology researches on biofertilizers, microbial biodiversity for reforestation and agricultural waste treatment.

===Biotechnology Program for Food, Feeds and Specialty Products===
[[File:Uplb biotech bldg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Headquarters of the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology in Los Baños, Laguna]]
BIOTECH discovers and upgrades technologies to produce high value foods, feeds, additives, specialty products, and develops efficient detection kits to ensure quality and safety. The program explores sources, properties and application of [[functional food]]s such as nutraceuticals, probiotics from GRAS Lactic Acid Bacteria and yeast.

Nutraceuticals are the functional foods such as omega-3, 6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids from structured lipids like coconut and local seed oil. The institute also intensifies improvement, application and commercialization of existing [[DNA]]-based detection kits and industrial [[enzymes]].

===Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery Program===
Bioinformatics and Drug Discovery Program applies modern and conventional scientific techniques to discover pharmaceutically-important compounds produced from local isolates and to develop plant cell culture systems as a source of high-value secondary metabolites (drugs). The program uses bioinformatics, computational software, and tissue culture technology for the identification and mass production of identified novel compounds. Continuing efforts are exerted to promote and commercialize BioVac-HS and BioVac-FC, the vaccines against Pasteurella multocida which causes fatal hemorrhagic septicemia and fowl cholera, respectively.

===Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology===
Industrial and Environmental Biotechnology searches for cost-effective and renewable fuel sources to help lessen the impact of oil price increases. The program focuses on the discovery and development of robust microorganisms to improve biofuel production. It also develops biological binders or biosurfactant,biopolymers,and heat-resistant enzymes,for wastes degradation and bioremediation.

===Communication and Technology Utilization===
Communication and Technology Utilization Program packages BIOTECH information and facilitates its proactive exchange among the scientists-researchers and Institute clients. The program also embarks on various technology transfer and commercialization approaches. Among its services include biotechnology promotion, training and internship, product and technology marketing, database management and communication support services.

It modifies and standardizes analytical methods for applications to specific samples, as well as develops new analytical techniques.

The laboratory implements and maintains a high quality system based on ISO 17025 guidelines for laboratory competence. CASL is accredited/recognized by the Environmental Management Bureau, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Bureau of Food and Drugs, Department of Health, and Bureau of Animal Industry.

===Electron Microscopy Service Laboratory (EMSL)===
The EMSL contains transmission and scanning [[electron microscope]]s. This laboratory provides structure analysis of biological and non-biological samples by light photomicroscopy and the ultra-structure analysis of samples by scanning and transmission electron microscopy.

===Enzyme Laboratory (EL)===
The EL offers services to determine the different [[enzyme]] activities or samples for [[food]], feeds and other industrial applications. Enzyme assay indicates the effectiveness of a given enzyme to a specific substrate and serves as a quality control tool.

It also accepts contract researches on the production and application of industrial enzymes.

===Fermentation Engineering and Service Laboratory (FESL)===
The FESL provides technical support for optimizing upstream process parameters through R&amp;D collaboration, as well as optimizing product recovery and downstream process parameters.

===National Immunological Testing Laboratory (NITL)===
The NITL is the diagnostic center for the rapid detection of mycotoxins and [[plant]], [[food]], and [[Fodder|feed]] [[pathogens]]. The laboratory can determine the concentrations of the mycotoxins, aflatoxin B1 and M1, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, fumonisin and red tide toxins to as low as 5 ppb.

'''New media studies''' is a relatively young academic discipline that explores the intersections of computing, science, the humanities, and the visual and performing arts. [[Janet Murray]], a prominent researcher in the discipline, describes this intersection as "a single new medium of representation, the digital medium, formed by the braided interplay of technical invention and cultural expression at the end of the 20th century". The main factor in defining [[new media]] is the role the Internet plays; new media is effortlessly spread instantly. The category of new media is occupied by devices connected to the Internet, an example being a smartphone or tablet. Television and cinemas are commonly thought of as new media but are ruled out since the invention was before the time of the internet.

New media studies examines ideas and insights on media from communication theorists, programmers, educators, and technologists. Among others, the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]] is viewed as one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. McLuhan’s slogan, "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls attention to the intrinsic effect of communications media.

A program in new media studies may incorporate lessons, classes, and topics within [[communication]], [[journalism]], [[computer science]], [[Computer programming|programming]], [[graphic design]], [[web design]], [[human-computer interaction]], [[media theory]], [[linguistics]], [[information science]], and other related fields. 

New media studies is the academic discipline which examines how our relationship with media has changed with the onset of global connectivity and the popularity of digital and user generated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life|jstor=10.1086/596645|website=Chicago Journals|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media studies seeks to connect [[computer sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=Culture Software|url=http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/070-cultural-software/67-article-2011.pdf|website=manovich.net|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and innovations in [[new media]] with [[social sciences]] and the [[philosophy of technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Janet H.|title=Toward a Cultural Theory of Gaming|url=http://homes.lmc.gatech.edu/~murray/PC0403_Murray.pdf|website=Georgia Tech|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|accessdate=9 October 2015|ref=Toward a Cultural Theory of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Major figures ===
[[Marshall McLuhan]] is known in the study of media theory for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]" in its effect in communication in media. The medium affects how the media is delivered by the person and how the other person is receiving that media, while the characteristics of the medium effects the content in its delivery. McLuhan’s work challenged how media changed in the post-modern era which can also relate to present day use of media and its medium. Interface is defined as the common boundary of 2 bodies, spaces, or phases. Other Major works that also invoke his standpoint in the study of New Media including:

* ''[[The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951) - Which includes many short essays that analyze forms of media such as advertising, or newspaper in relation to society.
* ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) - In this book, McLuhan Writes about technology like the printing press or electronic media changing how people share stories in their day-to-day lives.

[[Lev Manovich]] has written books on the topic of new media, and according to his personal page "has appeared on the top 25 people shaping the Future of Design,"  He has published nine different books regarding the topic of new media. Manovich believes in the five general principles of new media, as he discusses in his 2001 book, ''The Language of New Media'' they are:

* Numerical Representation: essentially means that "all new media objects can be described mathematically and can be manipulated via algorithms."&lt;ref name = "Sorapure"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Priniciples of New Media: Or, Playing Lev Manovich|url = http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/coverweb/sorapure/|website = Kairos|accessdate = 2016-01-05|last = Sorapure|first = Madeleine|issn = 1521-2300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modularity: are "elements can that be independently modified and reused in other works".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Automation: "Automation is seen in computer programs that allow users to create or modify media objects using templates or algorithms".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Variability:  is "a new media object is not something fixed once and for all, but something that can exist in different, potentially infinite versions".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Transcoding: Designates the blend of computer and culture, of "traditional ways in which human culture modeled the world and the computer's own means of representing it".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
[[Henry Jenkins]] came up with the convergence culture in the field on new media studies: "By convergence, I mean the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted."

[[Janet Murray]] is a professor at the School of Literature, Media, and Communications at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Murray is also a part of several design projects such as; a digital edition of the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] classic, [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]. Janet works exclusively as a member of Georgia Tech's experimental game lab. Janet is also the author of the book ''Hamlet on the Holodeck; The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace''. Along with this book, she is also a guest writer in ''The New Media Reader,'' where she is credited for writing one of the two introductions in the book called, ''Inventing the Medium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inventing the Medium|url = https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/inventing-medium|website = MIT Press|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hamlet on the Holodeck; The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inventing the Digital Medium: An Interview with Janet Murray (Part One)|url = http://henryjenkins.org/2012/02/an_interview_with_janet_murray.html|website = henryjenkins.org|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray asks whether the computer can provide the basis for an expressive narrative form. The book acts as a textbook. It is designed to help designers in training develop a greater sense of understanding towards digital media. This book is also a theory of media change over the years. It really goes into depth on the relationship between technology and culture. Murray has ideas with a unique spin on them. She offers new thoughts and theories on new media studies, and this is what led to her being such a successful author.&lt;ref&gt;http://henryjenkins.org/2006/06/welcome_to_convergence_culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of technology ==
In an article from the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI), there was a study involving a virtual reality environment that simulated ATM training for persons with acquired brain injury. Their conclusion of this study proves that virtual reality can be a useful tool in which it could easily be accessed online. Basically this helped conveniently providing training opportunities almost anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Usability of a virtual reality environment simulating an automated teller machine for assessing and training persons with acquired brain injury|journal = Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date = 2010-04-30|issn = 1743-0003|pmc = 2881048|pmid = 20429955|pages = 19|volume = 7|doi = 10.1186/1743-0003-7-19|first = Kenneth NK|last = Fong|first2 = Kathy YY|last2 = Chow|first3 = Bianca CH|last3 = Chan|first4 = Kino CK|last4 = Lam|first5 = Jeff CK|last5 = Lee|first6 = Teresa HY|last6 = Li|first7 = Elaine WH|last7 = Yan|first8 = Asta TY|last8 = Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book called ''Critical Terms for Media Studies'', the author illustrates his take on new media in technology: "technology---a focus on the mechanical aspects of media and the way that innovations and inventions transform the condition of both individual and social experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Critical Terms for Media Studies, the introduction|url = http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/532554.html|website = www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
* Strategies vs Tactics - The term strategies refers to the methods a producer intended for their creation to be used. The term tactics is referring to the ways individuals actually utilize a creation, regardless of the creators intentions, in order to make it more useful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life: From Mass Consumption to Mass Cultural Production?|jstor = 10.1086/596645|journal = Critical Inquiry|date = 2009-01-01|pages = 319–331|volume = 35|issue = 2|doi = 10.1086/596645|first = By|last = Lev Manovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wiktionary:hypermediated|Hypermediated]] - Hypermediation is a concept in new media studies that refers to a form of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediate mediation] in which media is connected in a very close way.  Mediation, in this sense, deals with using indirect sources to create a direct connection between different types of media.  This process is often done by the use of [[HTML|hypertext]] and through the [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/networked Networked] approach to new media.  An example of hypermediation would be an online shopper who buys a particular item, then in turn gets links to related items, then articles related to those items etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hypermediated?|url = https://www.englishforums.com/English/Hypermediated/nwpnn/post.htm|website = www.englishforums.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hypermediation: Commerce as Clickstream|url = http://www.nicholascarr.com/?page_id=134|website = Nicholas Carr|accessdate = 2015-10-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Web 2.0]] - Web 2.0 is the concept of websites geared toward content created by users. Web 2.0 allows the web to be used as a platform. It also enables the users to control their own data. [[Tim O'Reilly]] and Dale Dougherty invented the phrase Web 2.0 at the Media Conference in 2004. Some examples of Web 2.0 are [[AdSense|Google AdSense]], Flickr, [[BitTorrent]], [[Napster]] and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html retrieved 2015-10-08&lt;/ref&gt;
*Networking is a term that defines the transformation of old media to new media through communication that enables users to produce or compute material of their own on the internet.  It's a medium that consists of blogs, emails, and social media networks which allows more global connections to reach many to share ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lister et al.

*Commodification of Experience - The packaging of human experience in some form to be sold back to the consumer. This is a common term in study of the role new media plays. An example of the top-down ideal.

{{nihongo3|"serve (foods) on the female body"|女体盛り|'''Nyotaimori'''}}, often referred to as '''"body sushi"''', is the Japanese practice of serving [[sashimi]] or [[sushi]] from the naked body of a woman.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bindel|first=Julie|title='I am about to eat sushi off a naked woman's body' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/12/nyotaimori-eating-sushi-naked-woman|publisher=The Guardian|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo3||男体盛り|'''Nantaimori'''}} refers to the same practice using a [[male model]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} 

The Japanese practice of ''nyotaimori'' – serving sushi on a naked body – is said to have its origins in the samurai period in Japan.&lt;ref name=Waves&gt;[http://www.insidevancouver.ca/2014/09/06/naked-sushi-makes-waves-in-vancouver/ "Naked Sushi Makes Waves in Vancouver"], ''Inside Vancouver'', 6 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of chef Mike Keenan, "The naked sushi idea began during the samurai period in Japan. It was a subculture to the [[geisha]]s. It would take place in a geisha house as a celebration after a victorious battle."&lt;ref name=Plate&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Naked+Sushi+touch+plate/10161213/story.html "Naked Sushi: Eat but don't touch the plate"],  ''Vancouver Sun'', 30 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures==
In traditional ''nyotaimori'', the model is generally expected to lie still at all times and not talk with guests. The sushi is placed on sanitized leaves on the model's body to prevent skin-to-fish contact and on sufficiently flat areas of the body off which the sushi will not roll. ''Nyotaimori'' is considered an art form.&lt;ref name=Waves/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://supervancouver.com/naked-sushi-vancouver/ "Your Fantasy Of Eating Sushi Off A Naked Woman In Vancouver Is Now A Reality"], SuperVancouver&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually champagne and sake are served in naked sushi restaurants. Guests must be respectful and observe the strictest decorum. Talking with the models is highly discouraged. Inappropriate gestures or comments are not tolerated and diners can only pick up sushi with chopsticks, although rules in some restaurants are less strict. For example, in some restaurants guests can nibble nori rolls off nipples if they choose.&lt;ref name=Waves/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2184672/Diners-pay-500-eat-sushi-NUDE-MODELS-Florida-restaurant.html "Naked ambition: Diners pay $500 to eat sushi off NUDE MODELS at Florida restaurant"] ''Daily Mail'', 6 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2014/08/naked-sushi-now-vancouver/ "Naked Sushi Now in Vancouver"], ''VanCity Buzz'', 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Practical atheism''' is the view that one should live their life with disregard towards a god. Practical atheism does not reject or accept claims about god.&lt;ref name =ZofiaJ&gt;{{citation

Apatheism sees the god question as irrelevant while practical atheism does not. Since practical atheism doesn't address the god claim one can be both a theist and a practical atheist.

==Forms==
Philosopher, [[Zofia Zdybicka]] lists four forms of practical atheism.&lt;ref name =ZofiaJ/&gt;
*Where one is not guided by religious principles
*Where one has a lack of interest in matters related to a god or gods
*Ignorance of the concept of a god 
*Where one excludes a god or gods from intellectual pursuits and practical action at the individual or social level

==History==
Historically, practical atheism was considered by some people to be associated with moral failure, willful ignorance, and impiety. Those considered practical atheists were said to behave as though God, ethics, and social responsibility did not exist.

According to the French Catholic philosopher [[Étienne Borne]], "Practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of God, but complete godlessness of action; it is a moral evil, implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Borne|first=Étienne|title=Atheism|year=1961|publisher=New York: Hawthorn Books|isbn=0-415-04727-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to [[Voltaire]], French philosopher Denis Diderot wrote: "It is very important not to mistake [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]] for [[parsley]]; but not at all so to believe or not in God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herrick |first=Jim |title=Against the Faith |year=1985 |pages=75 |location=London |publisher=Glover &amp; Blair |isbn=0-906681-09-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prodromus''' ('forerunner' or 'precursor') aka '''prodrome''' is a term used in the [[natural sciences]] to describe a preliminary publication intended as the basis for a later, more comprehensive work.

It is also a medical term used for a [[premonitory]] symptom, that is, a symptom indicating the onset of a disease.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', published 1913 by C. &amp; G. Merriam Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers'' (2007, Saunders)&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the word is from the 19th century: via French from New Latin prodromus, from Greek prodromos forerunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Dictionary|title=Collins Dictionary|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/prodrome|website=http://www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable prodromi were ''[[Prodromus Entomology]]'', ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]'', ''[[Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis]]'' and [[Nicolas Steno]]'s ''De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus'', one of the early treatises attempting to explain the occurrence of fossils in solid rock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9372">{{About|government action. [[Policy]], both public and private, is a broader concept. The article on [[public policy doctrine]] discusses the use of the phrase 'public policy' in legal doctrine}}
{{Politics|expanded=Policy}}

'''Public policy''' is the principled guide to action taken by the administrative [[Executive (government)|executive branches]] of the [[State (polity)|state]] with regard to a class of issues, in a manner consistent with [[law]] and [[Institution|institutional customs]]. 

==Overview==
The foundation of public policy is composed of national constitutional laws and regulations. Further substrates include both [[judicial]] interpretations and [[regulations]] which are generally authorized by legislation. Public policy is considered strong when it solves problems efficiently and effectively, serves and supports governmental institutions and policies, and encourages active citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Characteristics of Successful Public Policy|url=http://publicadmin.norwich.edu/characteristics-of-successful-public-policy/|website=Norwich University Public Administration|publisher=Norwich University Public Administration|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars define public policy as a system of "courses of action, [[regulation|regulatory]] measures, [[law]]s, and [[funding]] priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/policy/definition.shtml Kilpatrick, Dean, "Definitions of Public Policy and Law"]&lt;/ref&gt; Public policy is commonly embodied in "constitutions, legislative acts, and judicial decisions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1368469 Schuster II, W. Michael, "For the Greater Good: The Use of Public Policy Considerations in Confirming Chapter 11 Plans of Reorganization"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], this concept refers not only to the result of policies, but more broadly to the [[decision-making]] and [[analysis]] of governmental decisions. As an [[academic discipline]], public policy is studied by professors and students at [[public policy schools]] of major [[universities]] throughout the country.  The U.S. professional association of public policy practitioners, researchers, scholars, and students is the [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]].

==Government actions and process==
Public policy making can be characterized as a dynamic, complex, and interactive system through which public problems are identified and countered by creating new public policy or by reforming existing public policy.&lt;ref name="Analysing Public Policy"&gt;{{cite book|last=John|first=Peter|title=Analysing Public Policy|year=1998|publisher=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public problems can originate in endless ways and require different policy responses (such as regulations, subsidies, Import quota|quotas, and laws) on the local, national, or international level.&lt;ref name="Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharkansky|first=Ira|author2=R. Hofferbert |title=Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy|journal=The American Political Science Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public policy making is a continuous process that has many feedback loops. Verification and program evaluation are essential to the functioning of this system.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thei|first=Geurts|author2=Be Informed |title=Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The public problems that influence public policy making can be of economic, social, or political nature.&lt;ref name="Public Policy Process"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Public Policy Process|year=2005|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each system is influenced by different public problems and issues, and has different stakeholders; as such, each requires different public policy.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

In public policy making, numerous individuals, corporations, non-profit organizations and interest groups compete and collaborate to influence policymakers to act in a particular way.&lt;ref name="Kilpatrick"&gt;Kilpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

The large set of actors in the public policy process, such as politicians, civil servants, lobbyists, domain experts, and industry or sector representatives, use a variety of tactics and tools to advance their aims, including advocating their positions publicly, attempting to educate supporters and opponents, and mobilizing allies on a particular issue.&lt;ref name="Dimensions of State Politics, Economics, and Public Policy"/&gt; 

Many actors can be important in the public policy process, but government officials ultimately choose public policy in response to the public issue or problem at hand. In doing so, government officials are expected to meet public sector ethics and take the needs of all project stakeholder|stakeholders into account.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

Since societies have changed in the past decades, the public policy making system changed too. In the 2010s, public policy making is increasingly goal-oriented, aiming for measurable results and goals, and decision-centric, focusing on decisions that must be taken immediately.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt; 

Furthermore, mass communications and technological changes such as the widespread availability of the Internet have caused the public policy system to become more complex and interconnected.&lt;ref name="The Process and Effects of mass communication"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schramm|first=Wilbur|title=The Process and Effects of mass communication|date=165|isbn=0252001974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes pose new challenges to the current public policy systems and pressures leaders to evolve to remain effective and efficient.&lt;ref name="Public Policy: The 21st Century Perspective"/&gt;

==Academic discipline==
{{Main|Policy Studies}}

As an academic discipline, public policy brings in elements of many [[social science]] fields and concepts, including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[political economy]], [[social policy]], [[program evaluation]], [[policy analysis]], and [[public management]], all as applied to problems of governmental administration, management, and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pellissery|first=Sony|title= Public Policy |journal=The SAGE Encyclopedia of World Poverty|year=2015|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the study of public policy is distinct from political science or economics, in its focus on the application of theory to practice.  While the majority of [[public policy degrees]] are [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] degrees, there are several universities that offer undergraduate education in public policy.

Traditionally, the academic field of public policy focused on [[domestic policy]]. However, the wave of [[economic globalization]] that occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries created a need for a subset of public policy that focused on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gppi.net/fileadmin/gppi/Global_Public_Policy_Foreign_Affairs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many traditional public policy schools had to adjust their curricula to better suit this new policy landscape, as well as develop entirely new curricula altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. "Global public policy, transnational policy communities, and their networks." Policy studies journal 36, no. 1 (2008): 19-38&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rabindra Chitravali''''' is a 2011 four-volume set of books by art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]] that contains paintings of [[Rabindranth Tagore]]. These include about 1700 paintings in the Rabindra Bhavana and [[Kala Bhavana]] collections of [[Visva-Bharati]], [[Santiniketan]]; and more than 300 paintings in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] and the collections at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata; [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi and Bangalore; and [[Indian Museum]], Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/rabindra_chitravali.html |title= Pratikshan :: Rabindra Chitravali |publisher=Pratikshanbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Tagore-paintings-glow-on-his-150th-birth-anniversary/Article1-541584.aspx |title=Tagore paintings glow on his 150th birth anniversary |publisher=''Hindustan Times'' |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421080810/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Tagore-paintings-glow-on-his-150th-birth-anniversary/Article1-541584.aspx |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
R. Siva Kumar said that reproducing the works in print was important in making them accessible to the public, as "The ink used in the originals is not very durable. The paintings can’t be left in the open for long".&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"/&gt;

In a review for the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], [[Cambridge Journals]], W. Andrew Robinson called the reproductions of "unparalleled quality" and said the four volumes cover almost all of Tagore's existing work, though some works are missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andrew-robinson.org/uploads/REVIEW_OF_PAINTINGS_OF_TAGORE.pdf Review of Book]by Andrew Robinson, Royal Asiatic Society {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224721/http://andrew-robinson.org/uploads/REVIEW_OF_PAINTINGS_OF_TAGORE.pdf# |date=17 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rococo''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|oʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|k|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ}}), less commonly '''roccoco''', or "'''Late Baroque'''", was a highly ornamental and theatrical style of decoration which combined asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted molding, and [[trompe l'oeil]] frescoes to create the illusions of surprise, motion and drama. It first appeared in France and Italy in the 1730s and spread to Central Europe in the 1750s and 1760s.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/video-rococ-writing-table|title=What is Rococo?|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}}&lt;ref&gt;"Rococo" Larousse Encyclopedia online &lt;/ref&gt; It is often described as the final expression of the [[Baroque]] movement.{{Sfn|Owens|2014|page=92}}

The Rococo style began in France in the first part of the 18th century in the reign of [[Louis Quinze|Louis XV]]  as a reaction against the more formal and geometric [[Style Louis XIV]]. It was known as the ''style [[rocaille]]'', or ''rocaille style''.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=136}} It soon spread other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Bavaria, Austria, other parts of Germany, and Russia. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware and glassware, painting,  music, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/506448/Rococo-style |title=Rococo style (design) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Zwiefalten 28 04 2011 23.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Integrated rococo carving, [[stucco]] and [[fresco]] at [[Zwiefalten Abbey]] (1739–45)]] 
The word ''rococo'' was first used in 1835 in France, as a humorous variation of the word ''rocaille'' or a combination of ''rocaille'' and ''[[baroque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary On-Line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monique Wagner, ''From Gaul to De Gaulle: An Outline of French Civilization.'' Peter Lang, 2005, p. 139. {{ISBN|0-8204-2277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rocaille was originally a method of decoration, using pebbles, seashells and cement, which was often used to decorate grottoes and fountains since the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Larousse dictionary on-line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Stokstad, ed. Art History. 4th ed. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 17th and early 18th century it became the term for a kind of decorative motif or ornament that appeared in the late [[Style Louis XIV]], in the form of a seashell interlaced with [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves. In 1736 the designer and jeweler Jean Mondon published the ''Premier Livre de forme rocquaille et cartel'',  a collection of designs for ornaments of furniture and interior decoration. It was the first appearance in print of the term  "rocaille" to designate the style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'', p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;   The carved or molded seashell motif was combined with palm leaves or twisting vines to decorate doorways, furniture, wall panels and other architectural elements.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier''(2006) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the term was used to describe architecture or music which was excessively ornamental.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html Ancien Regime Rococo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411162829/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html |date=11 April 2018 }}. Bc.edu. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007210702/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c17th-mid19th/rococo.htm Rococo – Rococo Art]. Huntfor.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the mid-19th century, the term has been accepted by [[art historians]]. While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style, Rococo is now often considered as a distinct period in the development of [[European art]].

==Characteristics==
&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

Rococo featured exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}}

The style often integrated painting, molded stucco, and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that the those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where cherubs and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included included stucco,  either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods; lacquered wood in the Japanese style, and ornament of gilded bronze. The intent was to create an impression of surprise, awe and wonder on first view.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

==France==
{{See also|Rocaille|Louis Quinze}}
The  ''[[Rocaille]]'' style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign [[Louis XV]], and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Lovreglio, Aurélia and Anne, ''Dictionnaire des Mobiliers et des Objets d'art'', Le Robert, Paris, 2006, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;  The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests.  The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in [[Hôtel de Soubise]] in Paris, designed by [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] (1735–40). The characteristics of French Rococo included exceptional artistry, especially in the complex frames made for mirrors and paintings, which sculpted in plaster and often gilded; and the use of vegetal forms (vines, leaves, flowers) intertwined in complex designs.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|pp. 92-93}}   The furniture also featured sinuous curves and vegetal designs. The leading furniture designers and craftsmen in the style included [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]], [[Charles Cressent]], and [[Nicolas Pineau]].{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=382}}&lt;ref name="Kleiner2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&amp;pg=PA587|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|pages=583–584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rocaille style lasted in France until the mid-18th century, and while it became more curving and vegetal, it never achieved the extravagant exuberance of the Rococo in Bavaria, Austria and Italy. The discoveries of Roman antiquities beginning in 1738 at [[Herculanum]] and especially at [[Pompeii]] in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant neo-classicism.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Italy==
Artists in Italy, particularly [[Venice]], also produced an exuberant rococo style.  Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille, but with a particular Venetian variation; the pieces were painted, often with landscapes or flowers or scenes from [[Guardi]] or other painters, or [[Chinoiserie]], against a blue or green background, matching the colours of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] of painters whose work decorated the salons. Notable decorative painters included [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos, and [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] who painted the ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] in the [[illusionistic ceiling painting|quadraturo]] manner, giving the illusion of three dimensions. Tiepelo travelled to Germany with his son during 1752–1754, decorating the ceilings of the [[Würzburg Residence]], one of the major landmarks of the Bavarian rococo.  An earlier celebrated Venetian painter was [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]], who painted several notable church ceilings. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

The Venetian Rococo also featured exceptional glassware, particularly [[Murano glass]], often engraved and coloured, which was exported across Europe. Works included multicolour chandeliers and mirrors with extremely ornate frames. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Southern Germany and Russia==
The Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and central Europe from the 1730s until the 1770s. It was first introduced from France through the publications and works of French architects and decorators, including the sculptor [[Claude III Audran]], the interior designer [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], the sculptor Jean Mondon, and the draftsman and engraver [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Lepautre]]. Their work had an important influence on the German Rococo style.&lt;ref&gt;De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts décoratifs'' (1977), pp. 354–355&lt;/ref&gt; 

German architects adapted the Rococo style but made it far more asymmetric and loaded with more ornate decoration than the French original.  The German style was characterized by an explosion of forms that cascaded down the walls. It featured molding formed into curves and counter-curves, twisting and turning patterns, ceilings and walls with no right angles, and stucco foliage which seemed to be creeping up the walls and across the ceiling. The decoration was often gilded or silvered to give it contrast with the white or pale pastel walls.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=150-153}}

The Belgian-born architect and designer [[François de Cuvilliés]] was one of the first to create a Rococo building in Germany, with the pavilion of [[Amalienburg]] in Munich, (1734-1739), inspired by the pavilions of the  [[Trianon]] and [[Marly]] in France. It was built as a hunting lodge, with a platform on the roof for shooting pheasants.  The Hall of Mirrors in the interior, by the painter and stucco sculptor [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], was far more exuberant than any French Rococo.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another notable example of the early German Rococo is [[Würzburg Residence]] (1737–1744) constructed for the Prince-Bishop of Wurzburg by [[Balthasar Neumann]].   Neumann had traveled to Paris and consulted with the French rocaille decorative artists [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Robert de Cotte]].  While the exterior was in more sober Baroque style,  the interior, particularly the stairways and ceilings, was much lighter and decorative. The Prince-Bishop imported the Italian Rococo painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] in 1750–53 to create a mural over the top of the three-level ceremonial stairway. &lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; B.M. Field ''The Worlds Greatest Architecture:  Past and Present, Regency House Publishing Ltd, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann described the interior of the residence as  "a theater of light".  The stairway was also the central element in a residence Neumann  built at the [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl|Augustusburg Palace in Brühl]] (1743–1748).  In that building the stairway led the visitors up through a stucco fantasy of paintings, sculpture, ironwork and decoration, with surprising views at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1740s and 1750s, a number of notable pilgrimage churches were constructed in [[Bavaria]], with interiors decorated in a distinctive variant of the rococo style. One of the most notable examples is the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754) designed by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]].   Like most of the Bavarian pilgrimage churches, the exterior is very simple, with pastel walls, and little ornament.  Entering the church the visitor encounters an astonishing theater of movement and light.  It features an oval-shaped  sanctuary, and  a deambulatory in the same form, filling in the church with light from all sides.  The white walls contrasted with columns of blue and pink stucco in the choir, and the domed ceiling surrounded by plaster angels below a dome representing the heavens crowded with colorful Biblical figures.  Other notable pilgrimage churches include the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743–1772).{{Sfn|Ducher|1988| page=152}}{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|pp. 89–94}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Johann Michael Fischer]] was the architect of [[Ottobeuren Abbey]] (1748–1766), another Bavarian Rococo landmark. The church features, like much of the rococo architecture in Germany,  a remarkable contrast between the regularity of the facade and the overabundance of decoration in the interior.&lt;ref name="Demartini 2006 pp. 222"/&gt;

The Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] was another admirer of the Rococo; The Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace in the palace complex of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]] near Saint Petersburg, designed by the Italian [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]],  is an example of the Russian Rococo.

==Britain==
In Great Britain, rococo was called the "French taste"  and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe. although its influence was felt in such areas as silverwork, porcelain, and silks. [[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not mentioning rococo by name, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rococo was slow in arriving in England. Before entering the Rococo, British furniture for a time followed the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Palladian]] model under designer [[William Kent]], who designed for Lord Burlington and other important patrons of the arts. Kent travelled to Italy with Lord Burlington between 1712 and 1720, and brought back many models and ideas from Palladio.  He designed the furniture for [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1732), Lord Burlington's [[Chiswick House]] (1729), London, Thomas Coke's [[Holkham Hall]], Norfolk, Robert Walpole's pile at [[Houghton Hall|Houghton]], for [[Devonshire House]] in London, and at Rousham.{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=382}}

[[Mahogany]] made its appearance in England in about 1720, and immediately became popular for furniture, along with [[walnut]] wood. The Rococo began to make an appearance in England between 1740 and 1750. The furniture of [[Thomas Chippendale]] was the closest to the Rococo style,  In 1754 he published "Gentleman's and Cabinet-makers' directory", a catalog of designs for rococo, ''chinoiserie'' and even Gothic furniture, which achieved wide popularity, going through three editions.  Unlike French designers, Chippendale did not employ marquetry or inlays in his furniture.  The predominant designer of inlaid furniture were Vile and Cob, the cabinet-makers for King George III.  Another important figure in British furniture was [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], who in 1761,  very late in the period, published a catalog of Roroco furniture designs.  These include furnishings based on rather fantastic Chinese and Indian motifs, including a canopy bed crowned by a Chinese pagoda (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}

Other notable figures in the British Rococo included the silversmith Charles Friedrich Kandler.

==Decline and end==
The art of [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and other painters of the period, with its emphasis on decorative mythology and gallantry, soon inspired a reaction, and a demand for more "noble" themes.  While the Rococo continued in Germany and Austria, the French Academy in Rome began to teach the classic style. This was confirmed by the nomination of [[Le Troy]] as director of the Academy in 1738, and then in 1751 by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].

[[Madame de Pompadour]], the mistress of Louis XV contributed to the decline of the Rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named director general of the King's Buildings. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting and architecture.{{sfn|Cabanne|1988|p. 106}}

The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]]. In Germany, late 18th-century Rococo was ridiculed as ''Zopf und Perücke'' ("pigtail and periwig"), and this phase is sometimes referred to as ''Zopfstil''. Rococo remained popular in the provinces and in Italy, until the second phase of neoclassicism, "[[Empire style]]", arrived with Napoleonic governments and swept Rococo away.

==Furniture and decoration==
The ornamental style called ''[[rocaille]]'' emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of [[Louis XV]];  the style was also called ''[[Louis Quinze]]''.  Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance. On the walls of new Paris salons, the twisting and winding designs, usually made of gilded or painted stucco, wound around the doorways and mirrors like vines.  One of the earliest examples was the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1704–05), with its famous oval salon decorated with paintings by Boucher, and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=102}}

The best known French furniture designer of the period was [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]] (1695–1750), who was also a sculptor, painter. and goldsmith for the royal household. He held the title of official designer to the Chamber and Cabinet of Louis XV.  His work is well known today because of the enormous number of engravings made of his work which popularized the style throughout Europe. He designed works for the royal families of Poland and Portugal.

Italy was another place where the Rococo flourished, both in its early and later phases.  Craftsmen in Rome, Milan and Venice all produced lavishly decorated furniture and decorative items.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The sculpted decoration included fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage, carved in wood. The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls. The Commodes, or chests, which had first appeared under Louis XIV, were richly decorated with rocaille ornament made of gilded bronze. They were made by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] and also featured marquetry of different-coloured woods, sometimes placed in checkerboard cubic patterns, made with light and dark woods.  The period also saw the arrival of [[Chinoiserie]], often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes, called ''falcon de Chine'' of ''Vernis Martin'', after the ebenist who introduced the technique to France. [[Ormolu]], or gilded bronze, was used by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]]. Latz made a particularly ornate clock mounted atop a cartonnier for [[Frederick the Great]] for his palace in [[Potsdam]]. Pieces of [[Chinese export porcelain|imported Chinese porcelain]] were often mounted in [[ormolu]] (gilded bronze) rococo settings for display on tables or consoles in salons. Other craftsmen imitated the [[Japanese lacquer|Japanese art of lacquered furniture]], and produced commodes with Japanese motifs.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}

[[Great Britain|British]] Rococo tended to be more restrained. Thomas Chippendale's furniture designs kept the curves and feel, but stopped short of the French heights of whimsy. The most successful exponent of British Rococo was probably [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], a gifted carver and furniture designer working in London in the mid-18th century.

==Painting==
Elements of the ''Rocaille'' style appeared in the work of some French painters, including a taste for the picturesque in details; curves and counter-curves; and dissymmetry which replaced the movement of the baroque with exuberance, though the French ''rocaille'' never reached the extravagance of the Germanic rococo.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  The leading proponent was [[Antoine Watteau]], particularly in [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717), [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]], in a genre called ''[[Fête galante|Fête Galante]]''  depicting scenes of young nobles gathered together to celebrate in a pastoral setting.  Watteau died in 1721 at the age of thirty-seven, but his work continued to have influence through the rest of the century. The ''Pilgrimage to Cythera'' painting was purchased by [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia in 1752 or 1765 to decorate his palace of [[Charlottenberg]] in Berlin.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}

The successor of Watteau and the ''Féte Galante'' in decorative painting was [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770), the favorite painter of [[Madame de Pompadour]].  His work included the sensual ''Toilette de Venus'' (1746), which became one of the best known examples of the style.  Boucher participated in all of the genres of the time, designing tapestries, models for porcelain sculpture, set decorations for the Paris opera and ''opera-comique'', and decor for the Fair of Saint-Laurent.  {{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other important painters of the ''Fête Galante'' style included [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pater]].  The style particularly influenced [[François Lemoyne]], who painted the lavish decoration of the ceiling of the Salon of Hercules at the [[Palace of Versailles]], completed in 1735.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}  Paintings with fétes gallant and mythological themes by Boucher, [[Pierre-Charles Trémolières]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] decorated the famous salon of the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris (1735–40).{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other Rococo painters include: [[Jean François de Troy]] (1679–1752), [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]] (1685–1745), his two sons [[Louis-Michel van Loo]] (1707–1771) and [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] (1719–1795), his younger brother [[Charles-André van Loo]] (1705–1765), and [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1690–1743).

In Austria and Southern Germany, Italian painting had the largest effect on the Rococo style.  The Venetian painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], assisted by his son, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]],  was invited to paint frescoes for the [[Würzburg Residence]] (1720–1744).  The most prominent painter of Bavarian rococo churches was [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], who painted the ceiling of the [[Wieskirche]] (1745–1754)

==Sculpture and porcelain==

Religious sculpture followed the Italian baroque style, as exemplified in the theatrical altarpiece of the Karlskirche in Vienna.  However, much of Rococo sculpture was lighter and offered more movement than the classical style of Louis XIV.  It was encouraged in particular by [[Madame de Pompadour]], mistress of Louis XV, who commissioned many works for her chateaux and gardens. The sculptor [[Edmé Bouchardon]] represented [[Cupid]] engaged in carving his darts of love from the club of [[Hercules]] Rococo style—the demigod is transformed into the soft child, the bone-shattering club becomes the heart-scathing arrows, just as [[marble]] is so freely replaced by [[stucco]]. [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) was another leading French sculptor during the period.  The French sculptors, [[Jean-Louis Lemoyne]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], [[Louis-Simon Boizot]], [[Michel Clodion]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle|Pigalle]]  were also active.  In Italy, [[Antonio Corradini]] was among the leading sculptors of the Rococo style.  A Venetian, he travelled around Europe, working for [[Peter the Great]] in St. Petersburg, for the imperial courts in Austria and Naples. He preferred sentimental themes and made several skilled works of women with faces covered by veils, one of which is now in the [[Louvre]].

A new form of small-scale sculpture appeared, the [[porcelain]] figure, or small group of figures, initially replacing sugar sculptures on grand dining room tables, but soon popular for placing on mantelpieces and furniture.  The number of European factories grew steadily through the century, and some made porcelain that the expanding middle classes could afford. The amount of colourful [[overglaze decoration]] used on them also increased.  They were usually modelled by artists who had trained in sculpture. Common subjects included figures from the [[commedia dell'arte]], city street vendors, lovers and figures in fashionable clothes, and pairs of birds.  

[[Johann Joachim Kändler]] was the most important modeller of [[Meissen porcelain]], the earliest European factory, which remained the most important until about 1760.  The Swiss-born German sculptor [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] produced a wide variety of colourful figures for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in Bavaria, which were sold throughout Europe.  The French sculptor [[Étienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716–1791) followed this example.  While also making large-scale works, he became director of the [[Sevres Porcelain]] manufactory and produced small-scale works, usually about love and gaiety, for production in series.

==Music==
A Rococo period existed in [[music history]], although it is not as well known as the earlier Baroque and later Classical forms. The Rococo music style itself developed out of baroque music both in France, where the new style was referred to as [[Galante music|''style galante'']] ("gallant" or "elegant" style), and in Germany, where it was referred to as ''empfindsamer Stil'' ("sensitive style"). It can be characterized as light, intimate music with extremely elaborate and refined forms of [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]]. Exemplars include [[Jean Philippe Rameau]], [[Louis-Claude Daquin]] and [[François Couperin]] in France; in Germany, the style's main proponents were [[C. P. E. Bach]] and [[Johann Christian Bach]], two sons of the renowned [[J.S. Bach]].

In the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred, primarily against its perceived overuse of ornamentation and decoration. Led by [[C.P.E. Bach]] (an accomplished Rococo composer in his own right), [[Domenico Scarlatti]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], this reaction ushered in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. By the early 19th century, Catholic opinion had turned against the suitability of the style for ecclesiastical contexts because it was "in no way conducive to sentiments of devotion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13106a.htm Rococo Style – Catholic Encyclopedia]. Newadvent.org (1912-02-01). Retrieved on 2014-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian composer of the Romantic era [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] wrote The [[Variations on a Rococo Theme]], Op. 33, for cello and orchestra in 1877. Although the theme is not Rococo in origin, it is written in Rococo style.

== Fashion ==
[[File:Sackbackgown.jpg|thumb|Sack-back gown and petticoat, 1775-1780 V&amp;A Museum no. T.180&amp;A-1965]]
Rococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration. Women’s fashion of the seventeenth-century was contrasted by the fashion of the eighteenth-century, which was ornate and sophisticated, the true style of Rococo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fashion: A history from the 18th to the 20th century|last=Fukui, A., &amp; Suoh, T.|first=|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These fashions spread beyond the royal court into the salons and cafés of the ascendant bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historyofeuropeanfashion.wordpress.com/category/baroquerococo-1650-1800/|title=Posts about Baroque/Rococo 1650-1800 on History of Costume|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exuberant, playful, elegant style of decoration and design that we now know to be ‘Rococo’ was then known as ‘''le style rocaille’, ‘le style moderne’, ‘le gout’.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rococo: The continuing curve, 1730-2008|last=Coffin|first=S.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A style that appeared in the early eighteenth-century was the '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''robe volante''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a flowing gown, that became popular towards the end of King Louis XIV’s reign. This gown had the features of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour palate was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style, transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/09-10/daily-life-france-fashion-marie-antoinette/|title=Marie Antoinette's Style Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as trims. Shortly after the typical women’s Rococo gown was introduced, ''robe à la Françoise,'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a gown with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers.

The ''Watteau pleats'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who painted the details of the gowns down to the stiches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy. Later, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'pannier'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' and ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'mantua''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' became fashionable around 1718, they were wide hoops under the dress to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.8 metres) in diameter,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18sil/hd_18sil.htm|title=Eighteenth-Century Silhouette and Support|last=Glasscock|first=J.|date=|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as '''guardainfante','' initially designed to hide the pregnant stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called ''‘a la turque’.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This was made popular by Louis XV’s mistress, Madame Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles Andre Van Loo, to paint her as a Turkish sultana.  
''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''
In the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the '''polonaise''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', with inspiration taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen, which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the ''‘robe a l’anglais’'', which included elements inspired by the males’ fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the 'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat.

Accessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">The '''Scientific temper''' is a way of life (defined in this context as an individual and social process of thinking and acting) which uses the [[scientific method]] and which may, consequently, include questioning, [[observation|observing]] [[physical body|physical]] [[reality]], [[experiment|testing]], [[hypothesis|hypothesizing]], analysing, and communicating (not necessarily in that order). "Scientific temper" describes an attitude which involves the application of [[logic]]. Discussion, argument and analysis are vital parts of scientific temper. Elements of fairness, equality and democracy are built into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/seta/2005/09/22/stories/2005092200211700.htm|title=Scientific temper and the argumentative Indian |publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2007-09-25|location=Chennai, India|date=2005-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] was the first to use the phrase in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahanti|first1=Subodh|title=A Perspective on Scientific Temper in India|journal=Journal of Scientific Temper|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–62|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/article/view/1099}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later gave a descriptive explanation:
{{quote|"[What is needed] is the scientific approach, the adventurous and yet critical temper of science, the search for [[truth]] and new [[knowledge]], the refusal to accept anything without testing and trial, the capacity to change previous conclusions in the face of new evidence, the reliance on observed fact and not on pre-conceived [[theory]], the hard discipline of the mind—all this is necessary, not merely for the application of science but for life itself and the solution of its many problems."&amp;nbsp;—[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (1946) ''[[The Discovery of India]]'', p. 512}}

Nehru wrote that the scientific temper goes beyond the domains to which science is conventionally understood to be limited to, and deals also with the consideration of ultimate purposes, [[aesthetics|beauty]], goodness and truth. Nehru also contended that the scientific temper is the opposite of the method of religion, which relies on emotion and intuition and is (mis)applied "to everything in life, even to those things which are capable of intellectual inquiry and observation." While religion tends to close the mind and produce "[[Social tolerance|intolerance]], [[credulity]] and [[superstition]], emotionalism and irrationalism", and "a temper of a dependent, unfree person", a scientific temper "is the temper of a [[freedom|free]] man". He also indicated that the scientific temper goes beyond [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and fosters creativity and progress. He envisioned that the spread of scientific temper would be accompanied by a shrinking of the domain of [[religion]], and "the exciting adventure of fresh and never ceasing discoveries, of new panoramas opening out and new ways of living, adding to [life's] fullness and ever making it richer and more complete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jawaharlal |last=1Nehru |title=The Discovery of India |edition= Centenary |publisher=Oxford: University Press |year=1989 |page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehru states (that) "It is science alone that can solve the problems of [[malnutrition|hunger]] and [[poverty in India|poverty]], of insanitation and [[literacy in India|illiteracy]], of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kar|first1=Devi|title=THE NEED TO FOSTER A SCIENTIFIC TEMPER|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120821/jsp/opinion/story_15874879.jsp#.VJeYScFcBg|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis and development of the idea of the scientific temper is connected to ideas expressed earlier by [[Charles Darwin]] when he said, "[F]reedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=Darwin Correspondence Project|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/entry-12757|work=Darwin, C. R. to Aveling, E. B. 13 Oct 1880|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Karl Marx]] when he said, "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions."

"To develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform" is one of the [[Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India|fundamental duties]] of the people of the [[Republic of India]], according to the [[Constitution of India]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite book| title = Introduction to the Constitution of India| last = Basu| first = Durga Das| year = 1993| edition = 15th| place = New Delhi| publisher = [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall of India]]| isbn = 81-203-0839-5| page = 131| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of India]], through the National Council for Science and Technology Communication, dedicated the 28 February [[National Science Day]] of 2014 to the theme "Fostering Scientific Temper" to spread Nehru's vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keshavamurthy|first1=H.R.|title=Fostering Scientific Temper is Fundamental to Innovation and Progress|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/efeatures.aspx?relid=104309|publisher=Press Information Bureau, India|accessdate=22 December 2014|date=27 February 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources]] launched the scholarly serial ''Journal of Scientific Temper'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Journal of Scientific Temper''|url=http://op.niscair.res.in/index.php/JST/index|publisher=NISCAIR, India|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Solar Cookers International won an [[Ashden Award]] in 2002 for their work with solar cookers in [[Kenya]]. In August 2006, '''SCI''' was the winner of the World Renewable Energy Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reiaward.com|title=Renewable Energy Awards 2018|website=www.reiaward.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Solar Cookers International was founded in 1987 as Solar Box Cookers International. Two American women described as American's serious solar cooker promoters in the 1970s, Barbara Kerr and Sherry Cole partnered with other supporters to form this organization.&lt;ref name="CNN 2009-Apr-09"&gt;{{ cite web | title = Inventor turns cardboard boxes into eco-friendly oven | date = 2009-04-09 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/09/solar.oven.global.warming/index.html | publisher = CNN International | accessdate = 2009-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCI produced and distributed manuals describing construction and use of solar box style cookers. They became advocates of how solar cooking could be incorporated into development and relief agency programs. SCI's role evolved into networking with other solar cooking organizations worldwide. They hosted forums for dialog including co-sponsoring three international solar cooking conferences with the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], US, in 1992, the [[National University of Costa Rica]] in 1994 and the [[deemed university]], Coimbatore, India in 1997.&lt;ref name="SCI:History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.solarcookers.org/about/history.html| publisher=Solar Cookers International| accessdate=2009-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCI also administered a series of solar cooking field projects. Since 1995, SCI has managed or co-managed solar cooking projects in the [[Districts of Kenya|Nyakach]] district, [[Kenya]]; in the [[Kakuma|Kakuma refugee camp]], Kenya; in the Aisha refugee camp, [[Ethiopia]]; in various communities, [[Zimbabwe]]; and in [[Dadaab]] refugee camp, Kenya.

SCI supported the development of the CooKit, a mass-producible, foldable solar cooker in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Simple Panel Cooker that Feeds Tens of Thousands Daily|url=http://toolsofsurvival.com/blog/the-simple-panel-cooker-that-feeds-tens-of-thousands-daily/|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When removed from the water, if the wax has melted and moved to the bottom of the tube (as in the tube on the right), then the water has reached pasteurization temperature during heating]]

SCI was instrumental in the formation of the Solar Cookers International Network, which is an association of approximately 500 non-governmental organizations and government agencies, manufacturers, and individuals promoting solar cooking throughout the world. The Solar Cookers International Network wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarcooking.org|title=Solar Cooking|website=solarcooking.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes over 1700 articles categorized by country, individual, NGO, manufacturer, and solar cooker designs. Also included is information regarding related technologies such as heat-retention cooking, water [[pasteurization]], solar [[food processing]], solar [[food drying]], solar [[autoclave|autoclaving]], and solar [[canning]]. The Network maintains a [[wiki]]-based website] that allows the network members to share information and experiences at http://solarcooking.org.

SCI has hosted regional and international solar cooking conferences, most recently the Solar Cookers International Conference held in Granada Spain in 2006. SCI publishes ''Solar Cooker Review'' three times a year.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== CooKit ===

SCI developed the ''CooKit'' as an adaptation of a cooker designed by Dr. Roger Bernard in France. The cooker consists of a foil-lined cardboard reflector with a dark pot inside a plastic bag. This simple mechanism converts hundreds of watts of sunlight into heat and can cook one or two pots of food at a time.

SCI has set up local production of this cooker in Nairobi, Kenya and in Sacramento, California. The CooKit is used in many solar cooking projects around the world.

Cardboard, aluminium foil, and plastic bags for well over 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi Refugee Camp and Touloum Refugee Camps in [[Chad]] by the combined efforts of the [[Jewish World Watch]], the Dutch foundation [[KoZon]], and SCI. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased [[Arabic gum]],&lt;ref name="CNN.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/12/solar.darfur/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Solar lifeline saves Darfur women | publisher = CNN.com |accessdate=2008-03-06 |format= |work= | date=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use them for midday and evening meals. The goal of this project was to reduce the [[Darfur]]i women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to a high risk of being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journaltimes.com/nucleus/index.php?itemid=12999|title=Sides, Phyllis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Space in landscape design''' refers to theories about the meaning and [[nature]] of [[space]] as a [[volume]] and as an element of [[design]]. The concept of space as the fundamental medium of [[landscape design]] grew from debates tied to [[modernism]], [[contemporary art]], Asian art and design as seen in the [[Japanese garden]], and [[architecture]].

==Europe==
[[Elizabeth K. Meyer]] cites [[Claude-Henri Watelet|Claude-Henri Watelet's]] ''Essay on Gardens'' (1774) as perhaps the first reference to space in garden/architectural theory.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, lecture notes: "The Spatial medium of modernism between open space and figural space/Kiley's articulated spaces and multivalent landscapes: abstract modern grid and contextual response/The grid, the bosque, the allée. Planted form as spatial device".&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] in 1918 wrote "Space Composition in Architecture", which directly linked [[painting]] and [[gardens]] as arts involved in the creation of space.

The origins of modern northern European thought is a German [[aesthetic philosophy]] of the 1890s. By the 1920s,  [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theories of relativity were replacing [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton's]] conception of universal space. Practitioners such as [[Fletcher Steele]], [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], and [[Dan Kiley]] began to write and design through a vocabulary of lines, volumes, masses and planes in an attempt to replace the prevalent debate, centered around ideas of the formal and informal, with one that would more closely align their field with the [[fine art]]s.

According to [[Adrian Forty]],&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Forty, ''Words and Building: A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture'' (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2000), 256-275.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[space]]" in relation to design was all but meaningless until the 1890s. At that time two schools began to develop. Viennese [[Gottfried Semper]] in 1880 developed an [[architectural theory]] based the idea that the first impulse of [[architecture]] was the enclosure of space. [[Camillo Sitte]] extended Semper's ideas to exterior spaces in his ''City Planning According to Artistic Principles'' (1889). Concurrently, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] built on ideas from [[Emmanuel Kant|Kant]] which emphasized the experience of space as a force field generated by human movement and perception. [[Martin Heidegger]] would later contradict both of these schools. In his 1927 ''Being and Time'' and 1951 "Building, Dwelling, Thinking" he claimed that space was neither a construct of the mind nor a given, but was "that for which a room has been made" and was created by the object within a room rather than the room itself. [[Henri Lefebvre]] would call all of this into question, linking designers' notions of themselves as space-makers to a subservience to a dominant [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. He felt that the [[abstract space]] they had created had destroyed [[social space]] through alienation, separation, and a privileging of the eye.

[[James C. Rose|James Rose]] and [[Garrett Eckbo]], colleagues at [[Harvard]] in the 1930s, were the pioneers of a movement which adopted ideas about space from artists such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Naum Gabo]] and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]], and from architectural ideas based om [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe's]] [[free plan]]. Seeing gardens as outdoor rooms or [[sculptures]] to be walked through, they prioritized movement. In analogy to [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], Rose in particular saw elements of [[landscape]] as having architectural volume, not just mass: "In pure landscape, we drop the structural shell and the volume is defined by earth, paving, water and ground cover; foliage, walls, structures and other vertical elements on the sides, and sky, branching and roofing above."&lt;ref&gt;James Rose, "Plant Forms and Space" Pencil Points 10(1938), 227.&lt;/ref&gt;   Eckbo adopted the grid of [[columns]] and thin [[wall]]s of the free plan to make a statement about the social function of the [[garden]] as a place where the [[individual]] and the [[collective]] coincide.

By the 1940s, writings about space in landscape design had proliferated. [[Siegfried Giedion]], in his ''Space, Time and Architecture'', reframed the history of architecture as that of the history of space. [[Ernő Goldfinger]] wrote several influential articles in ''Architectural Review''&lt;ref&gt;"The Sensation of Space", "The Elements of Enclosed Space", and "Urbanism and Spatial Order", 1941-1942.&lt;/ref&gt;  addressing the subconscious effect of the sizes and shapes of spaces. He notes that [[perception]] of space happens in a state of distraction: we are required to move through a landscape in order to fully experience it. [[Dan Kiley]] absorbed these writings and built upon the work of Rose and Eckbo, promoting asymmetry over [[symmetry]], [[balance in art|balance]] over [[hierarchy]], multiple centers, and figure-ground ambiguity.

==Minimalism==
[[Minimalism|Minimalist art]] would have a profound influence on designers of the 1960s such as [[Peter Walker (architect)|Peter Walker]], [[Martha Schwartz]], and [[Hideo Sasaki]]. On the one hand, [[Sol LeWitt|Sol LeWitt's]] space-frame sculptures and [[Carl Andre|Carl Andre's]] floor sculptures of [[mass production|mass-produced objects]] allowed a re-thinking of the necessity for [[wall]]s in the formation of [[space]]. [[Geometry]], repetition, and changes in ground plane created a "field of making" in which walls and even plantings were questioned as essential elements of landscape. Equally at issue in applied practice was the [[perception]] on the part of Sasaki that landscape had come to be seen as "open space", a white sheet of paper on which to display [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings. This disconnection with the [[landscape]] was especially notable in corporate office parks, and Sasaki and Walker addressed this through an attempt to connect interior and exterior spaces.

[[James Corner]] considers landscape spatiality to be one of the three things that distinguish the medium of landscape (the others are landscape temporality and landscape materiality). He refers to [[Gaston Bachelard]]&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard's ''The Poetics of Space'' was published in 1951 and had immense influence on designers and artists.&lt;/ref&gt;  in emphasizing the role of scale and psychic location, which distinguish the space of landscape from that of [[architecture]] and [[painting]]: "the immediate immensity of the world from the inner immensity of the imagination, the inner space of the self&lt;ref&gt;James Corner, "Representation and landscape: drawing and making in the landscape medium" Word &amp; Image 8(July-Sept. 1992) 246.&lt;/ref&gt;".

[[Augustin Berque]] analyses landscape space by comparing Newtonian [[universal space]] and [[René Descartes|Cartesian dualistic space]], in which there is a distinct separation between subject and object, and Chinese mediumistic space, in which a unity of landscape and environment corresponds to a unity of mind and body. Thus [[postmodernism|postmodern thought]] brings together the concepts of space as product of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]] and [[culture]]. Rather than being the negative of the objects that occupy it, space can be seen as its own volume with undeniable importance as a design tool. In contemporary design, it is considered a palpable, lived [[phenomenon]] that contributes to our [[perception]] and [[experience]] of the world in subtle but often intentional ways.

'''Turkish Space Systems, Integration and Test Centre''' ({{lang-tr|Uzay Sistemleri, Entegrasyon ve Test Merkezi}}) (USET) is a [[spacecraft]] production and testing facility owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Turkey)|Ministry of National Defence]] and operated by [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI). It is located in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; The facility's official inauguration took place on May 21, 2015 in presence of [[President of Turkey|President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

Considered as a critical infrastructure, the centre was established within the framework of the [[Göktürk-1]] project, which started in 2009, for the indigenous realization of satellite assembly, as well as for [[qualification testing|qualification]] and [[acceptance testing]] from design to launch phase. It was the product of an agreement between the Turkish Ministry of National Defence and the multinational space services company [[Telespazio]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt; Situated within TAI's grounds in the [[Kazan, Ankara|Kazan]] district of [[Ankara Province]], the budgeted cost of the facility is US$100 million.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bksv"/&gt;

USET is a technology centre, at which all satellites up to {{convert|5000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} mass can be assembled and tested in simulated space environmental conditions related to the orbit. Two satellites can be produced and tested at the simultaneously. The centre serves military and civilian institutions.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iix"/&gt;

Development of the [[Turksat (satellite)|Türksat series]] [[communication satellite]]s, starting with [[Türksat 5A]], and Göktürk series [[earth observation satellite]]s, will be carried out by Turkish engineers at this site.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="u"/&gt;

At the end of November 2014, it was announced that the construction of the facility was completed, and the centre was put into operation. The centre's Class 100,000 clean rooms cover an area of around {{convert|3800|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt; It is capable of the assembly, integration and testing of several satellites of type [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and [[Geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO) with a mass up to five tonnes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="tai2"/&gt; It has a direct connection to the airbase so that a transport by land becomes needless, offering advantages of security, economy and risk management.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

The centre has the following capabilities:
* [[Thermal vacuum chamber|thermal vacuum]] tests,
* [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]]/[[electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] tests,
* [[Antenna measurement|compact antenna measurement range]] (CATR) tests,
* [[Photovoltaic systems|solar array]] deployment tests,
* [[vibration]] tests,
* [[mass properties]] measurement,
* [[Acoustics|acoustic]] tests, and
* [[Multi-layer insulation|MLI]] preparation.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai2"/&gt;

The advanced integration and environmental tests of Göktürk-1 is the first project to be carried out in the centre. After completion, the satellite will be sent to the launch site by TUSAŞ.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

'''Computer and Information Science''' (CIS) at the [[University of Oregon]] is a leading [[computer science]] department established in 1970. It has been consistently ranked among the top 100 computer science programs over the decades. [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] currently ranks the graduate program as tied for 63rd with [[Iowa State University]], [[University at Buffalo, SUNY|University at Buffalo—SUNY]] and the [[University of Iowa]], placing the computer science program 1st in the state of Oregon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the past 20 years, students and researchers from the CIS department have made developments in the fields of [[algorithm]]s, [[artificial intelligence]],  [[computational biology]], [[computer network]]s, [[data science]], [[human–computer interaction]], [[parallel computing|parallel processing]],  [[quantum computing]] and [[software engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipcc.cs.uoregon.edu/curriculum.html|title=IPCC at UO|last=bnorris2@uoregon.edu|first=Boyana Norris|website=ipcc.cs.uoregon.edu|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Initially founded in 1970, Deschutes Hall was dedicated for the CIS department on Oct. 16, 1989 as the part of a $45.6 million dollar project with the Cascade, Streisinger and Willamette Halls in the current Lokey Science Complex. Deschutes Hall on the [[Campus of the University of Oregon|UO campus]] was complete in the Winter Quarter of 1990, along with the other Halls in the same year. Construction of the building was funded primarily through a [[United States Department of Energy]] grant sponsored by Oregon governor [[Victor G. Atiyeh]] and United States senator [[Mark Hatfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/deschutes.html|title=Deschutes Hall|publisher=UO Libraries|work=The Architecture of the University of Oregon|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deschutes hall is connected by a skybridge to the Lewis Integrative Science building.

==Academic Programs==
The CIS Department offers academic programs leading to the B.S., B.A., M.S., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees.

===Undergraduate===
The department offers two undergraduate degree majors. Both majors can be obtained with a B.S. or B.A. Minor programs are also offered.

==== Computer and Information Science (CIS) ====
As the flagship program at the UO Department of Computer and Information Science, the CIS major covers a various studies ranging from fundamental mathematics of computational complexity to designing the next generation of Internet protocols to organizing and distributing vast stores of genomics data.

The CIS major has seven available tracks: [[Management information system|Business Information Systems]], [[Computational Science]], [[Computer network|Computer Networks]], [[Computer Security]], [[Database|Database and Informatics]], [[Software Development]], and Foundations with freedom of choice in elective courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uocatalog.uoregon.edu/arts_sciences/computerandinfoscience/#undergraduatetext|title=2014-15 Catalog: Computer and Information Science - Undergraduate|publisher=University of Oregon|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Math and Computer Science (MACS) ====
The MACS program is designed for students studying both mathematics and computer science without a specialization in either subject. The program sets students up to use tools to analyze complex problems and to compute the answers to them. The joint major program offers students the chance to explore computer science while maintaining a foundation in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Education/MACS_Major.php|title=MACS Major|website=www.cs.uoregon.edu|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graduate===
The department offers Master's and Doctoral degree programs. The Master's degree requires a thesis or project. The Doctoral degree requires a directed research project, oral comprehensive exam, and dissertation and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014-15 Catalog: Computer and Information Science - Graduate|url=http://uocatalog.uoregon.edu/arts_sciences/computerandinfoscience/#graduatetext|publisher=University of Oregon|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
[[US News &amp; World Report]] currently ranks the graduate program as tied for 63rd along with [[Iowa State University]], [[University at Buffalo|University at Buffalo--SUNY]], and [[University of Iowa]], placing it as 1st for such computer science programs in the state of Oregon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Computer Science Programs|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings/page+3|website=grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com|publisher=US News &amp; World Report|access-date= April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''urban stream''' is a formerly natural [[River|waterway]] that flows through a [[Urban area|heavily populated area]].  Urban streams are often [[Water pollution|polluted]] by [[urban runoff]] and [[combined sewer]] outflows.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Christopher J. et al.(2005).[http://www.biology.duke.edu/wilson/EcoSysServices/papers/WalshEtal2005.pdf "The urban stream syndrome: current knowledge and the search for a cure."] ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society,'' 2005, 24(3):706–723. {{DOI|10.1899/04-028.1}}, {{ISSN|0887-3593}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water scarcity]] makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence, J.E., C.P.W.

Governments may alter the flow or course of an urban stream to prevent localized [[flood|flooding]] by [[river engineering]]: lining [[stream bed]]s with [[concrete]] or other [[hardscape]] materials, diverting the stream into [[culvert]]s and [[storm sewer]]s, or other means. Some urban streams, such as the [[subterranean rivers of London]], run completely underground. These modifications have often reduced habitat for [[fish]] and other species, caused downstream flooding due to alterations of [[flood plain]]s, and worsened [[water quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/hydromodification-and-habitat-alteration-national-management-measures |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |id=EPA 841-B-07-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hobart Rivulet Underground.jpg|thumb|right|Some urban streams, such as the [[Hobart Rivulet]] in [[Tasmania]], run [[Subterranean river|underground]] for substantial distances]]
Some communities have begun [[stream restoration]] projects in an attempt to correct the problems caused by alteration, using techniques such as [[daylighting (streams)|daylighting]] and fixing stream bank [[Erosion#Water|erosion]] caused by heavy [[stormwater]] runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=California Department of Water Resources|title=Urban Streams Restoration Program |url=http://www.watershedrestoration.water.ca.gov/urbanstreams/ |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Andrew C. |last= Revkin |authorlink= |title= Rolling Back Pavement to Expose Watery Havens |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/world/asia/17daylight.html?_r=1 |format= |work= [[New York Times]] |publisher= |location= |date=16 July 2009|accessdate=19 July 2009 |quote= }}

'''Woman on top''', also called the '''cowgirl''' or '''riding''' position, is a group of [[sex position]]s in which a man lies on his back or sits, a woman straddles him facing either forward or back, and the man [[sexual penetration|inserts]] his erect [[Human penis|penis]] into the woman's [[vagina]] or [[Human anus|anus]].&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;[http://healthguide.howstuffworks.com/sexual-positions-dictionary2.htm "Discovery Health Sexual Positions"]. ''healthguide.howstuffworks.com''. Retrieved 2010-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cowgirl name derives from the image of the receiving partner "riding" the partner as a [[cowgirl]] rides a bucking horse. It is one of a number of receptive-partner-superior sexual positions, another being the [[#Reverse cowgirl position|reverse cowgirl]] position. It is fairly simple to achieve and maintain and pleasures both partners. This position is also used as a precursor to the [[lateral coital position]] described by [[Masters and Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Little Brown and Company|edition=1st|year=June 1970|isbn=0-316-54985-1|title=Human Sexual Inadequacy|last=Masters|first=Johnson|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position is commonly cited as one of the more popular sex positions, especially by women, because of its ability to adequately stimulate the [[clitoris]]. In this position, the woman is usually the active partner during the sexual activity.

==Cowgirl position==
In the cowgirl position, the man lies on his back or sits, with the woman straddling him across his pelvis facing forward, either in a [[kneeling]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position. The woman will align her [[vagina]] with the man's erect [[penis]], and lower herself onto the penis with either the man or the woman guiding the penis into the woman's vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]].&lt;ref name="discovery" /&gt; With the erect penis inside the woman, the woman can glide up and down the man's penis,&lt;ref name="Kar"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Nilamadhab Kar, Gopal Chandra Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=108–109| isbn = 8180614050|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=everydayhealth&gt;[http://www.everydayhealth.com/sexual-health/sexual-positions.aspx "Sex Positions For Better Sex"]. Retrieved 2010-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; controlling the rhythm and pace of vaginal stimulation and the extent and duration of penetration.&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt; The woman is free to change her position ranging from leaning back to stretching out on her partner's chest to rocking from side to side or in a circular motion. Each of those changes would alter the angle and depth of penetration and which part of the vaginal area and sex organs are stimulated. The man's hands are free to reach and touch the woman's breasts, clitoris, buttocks, face etc.,&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="everydayhealth"/&gt; and the partners can maintain eye contact. With the woman in the sitting or leaning back positions, the man may also [[Stimulation of nipples|stimulate her nipples]] and [[clitoral stimulation|clitoris]] with his fingers, or suck on her nipples if she inclines towards him or he raises his torso towards her.

In this position a woman can continue with the up and down motion after the man has achieved orgasm until she reaches orgasm. Afterwards, she may collapse onto the man's chest, with her vagina being very sensitive to further stimulation. On the other hand, if the woman reaches orgasm before the man, the woman may raise her pelvis to enable the man to actively thrust upwards&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; or the couple may change to a position which enables the man to continue thrusting, such as the [[missionary position]].

A woman may also engage in [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]] (penetrating a man with a [[strap-on dildo]]) while being on top.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esquire.com/uk/life/sex-relationships/news/a11943/a-guide-to-pegging/ Why All Men Should Try Pegging]. Esquire. Retrieved 2018-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse missionary position==
[[File:PeterJohannNepomukGeigerEroticWatercolor06.jpg|thumb|Depiction of reverse missionary position by [[Johann Nepomuk Geiger]] (1840)]]
When the woman lies on her partner's chest, a better description is the '''reverse missionary position'''. Stretching out with her legs on the man&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; puts more pressure on the woman's [[mons pubis]] and clitoris. If the man separates his legs, the woman can put her legs between his.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; In this position she can increase the tightness on the man's penis by pressing her thighs together, or the man may press the woman's thighs together. This increases vaginal friction but she can still control the pace and rhythm of her thrusts. As most women approach orgasm, they experience acute [[vaginal contraction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Československá psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also increases the man's sexual stimulation by increasing tightness on his penis.

==Reverse cowgirl position==
[[File:Michael Zichy-love1.jpg|thumb|Depiction of reverse cowgirl position by [[Mihály Zichy]] (around 1911)]]
In the '''reverse cowgirl''' position, the woman straddles the man facing the man's feet in a [[kneeling]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position. After either she or the man has guided the penis into the woman's vagina, the woman can keep her torso upright, or she can lean forward or back to lie on the man's chest or move sideways at will. The man's legs can be flat on the bed or arched. The woman also has control over the pace, rhythm, depth and duration of penetration. By changing her position and thrusts, the woman can change the level of stimulation for the man, while simultaneously stimulating her clitoris or an area termed "the [[G-spot]]." When planting her feet instead of kneeling, still facing away from her partner, the position is known as Reverse Asian Cowgirl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexinfo101.com/reverseasiancowgirl.shtml Reverse Asian Cowgirl Sex Position] Sexinfo101.com&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Advantage==
An advantage of the woman on top positions is that the man's weight is not on the woman. The woman on top positions are ideal during pregnancy as there is no pressure on the woman's abdomen, and it is easy for her to control the depth and speed of penetration. It is also useful if the man is recovering from a serious illness or surgery or if the woman has recently given birth.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;

==Comparison to the cowboy position==
The '''cowboy position''' is the equivalent for sex wherein the man is being penetrated; in the [[LGBT community]], the major difference is that it is usually anal sex in which the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|bottom]] straddles the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Top|top]], who otherwise assumes the same role as the male does in the cowgirl position.&lt;ref&gt; [http://vadamagazine.com/features/vada-that/vada-guide-anal-sex-men The Vada Guide to Anal Sex for Men] Vada Magazine. Retrieved 2018-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sharing many of the same advantages as the cowgirl variant, the position is often cited as being advantageous for bottoms who are new to anal sex, as it allows the receiving partner to lower himself on to the other's penis at his own pace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/11/gay-sex-positions/ Pink News Explainer: The Best Gay Sex Positions] Pink News.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6773">'''Zoosadism''' is [[pleasure]] derived from [[cruelty to animals]]. It is part of the [[Macdonald triad]], a set of three behaviors that are considered a precursor to [[Psychopathy|psychopathic behavior]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. M.

==Research==
Some studies have suggested that individuals who are [[cruel to animals]] are more likely to be violent to humans. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'':

{{cquote|The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appear in its computer records of [[Serial rape|serial rapists]] and [[Serial killer|murderers]], and the standard diagnostic and treatment manual for psychiatric and emotional disorders lists cruelty to animals as a diagnostic criterion for [[conduct disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Goleman | first = Daniel | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Child's Love of Cruelty May Hint at the Future Killer | newspaper = New York Times | pages = | year = | date = 7 August 1991 | url = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Helen Gavin wrote however in ''Criminological and Forensic Psychology'' (2013):

{{cquote|This is not a universal trait, though. [[Dennis Nilsen]] had difficulty initiating social contact with people, but loved his faithful companion, Bleep, a mongrel bitch.

Alan R. Felthous reported in his paper "Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People" (1980):

{{cquote|A survey of psychiatric patients who had repeatedly tortured dogs and cats found all of them had high levels of aggression toward people as well, including one patient who had murdered a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Felthous | first = Alan R. | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 10 | pages = 169–177 | date = | year = 1980 | url = | doi = 10.1007/bf01433629| id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a commonly reported finding, and for this reason, [[cruelty to animals]] is often considered a warning sign of potential violence towards humans.

==Legal status==
In the [[United States]], since 2010, it has been a federal offense to create or distribute "obscene" depictions of "living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians ... subjected to serious bodily injury".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruthann Robson|Robson, Ruthann]] (2010-12-14) [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html Animal Porn - Criminalized by Federal Law Again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415045939/http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html |date=2011-04-15 }}, ''Constitutional Law Prof Blog''&lt;/ref&gt; This statute replaced an overly broad 1999 statute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|title=18 U.S. Code § 48 - Animal crush videos|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121143325/http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Stevens]]''.

==Criticism of alleged link to violence against humans==
Critics of the concept of a propensity for cruelty to humans cite the fact that animals can be cruel to some animals yet caring to other animals, combined with [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s studies using metronomes at different rates to test conditioned learning showing that humans can discriminate in fine ways that animals cannot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Catania, A.C.|year=1994|title=Query: Did Pavlov's research ring a bell?|journal=Psycoloquy Newsletter, June 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conclude that there is no such general basis. The exact way these critics explain studies that seems to show links varies, but most of them state that psychiatric and criminological studies are subject to [[institutional bias]] and [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill, 2002 RobertWhitaker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Unpredictable Species: What Makes Humans Unique by Lieberman, P 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is also pointed out that [[correlation does not prove causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|title=The Case for Animal Experimentation: An Evolutionary and Ethical Perspective|first=Michael Allen|last=Fox|date=23 April 1986|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=23 April 2018|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032616/https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|archivedate=5 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Piers Beirne]], a professor of [[criminology]] at the [[University of Southern Maine]], has criticized existing studies for ignoring socially accepted practices of violence against animals, such as [[animal slaughter]] and [[vivisection]], that might be linked to violence against humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021521/http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
