'''Aalto University''' ({{lang-fi|Aalto-yliopisto}}, {{lang-sv|Aalto-universitetet}}) is a [[university]] primarily located in [[Greater Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (established 1849), the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (established 1904), and the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] (established 1871). The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research. The Finnish government, in 2010, set out to create a university that fosters innovation, merging the three institutions into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |title=EU Policy Blog |publisher=Microsoft |work=EU Policy Blog |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170729/http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is composed of six schools with close to 17,500 students and 4,000 staff members, making it Finland's second largest university. The main campus of Aalto University is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]], where the engineering schools as well as the bachelor programs of the School of Business operate. Other functions of the [[Aalto University School of Business|School of Business]] are located in [[Töölö]]. The [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture|School of Arts, Design and Architecture]] is mainly located in [[Arabianranta]]. All of the university's activities will be located in the Otaniemi campus by 2020. In addition to the Greater Helsinki area, the university also operates in [[Mikkeli]] and [[Pori]].

Aalto University's operations showcase Finland’s experiment in higher education. The Aalto Design Factory, Aalto Ventures Program and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society (Aaltoes), among others, drive the university's mission for a radical shift towards multidisciplinary learning and have contributed substantially to the emergence of Helsinki as a hotbed for startups.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Aaltoes is Europe’s largest and most active student run entrepreneurship community that has founded major concepts such as the Startup Sauna accelerator program and [[Slush|Slush (event)]] startup event.

The university is named in honour of [[Alvar Aalto]], a prominent Finnish architect, designer and [[alumnus]] of the former Helsinki University of Technology, who was also instrumental in designing a large part of the university's main campus in Otaniemi.

== History ==
In 2004, a workgroup led by Anne Brunila of the Finnish Ministry of Finance concluded that Finland had too many universities and other institutes of tertiary education which should be consolidated. Following this, [[Yrjö Sotamaa]], president of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] at the time, proposed the merger of Aalto University's founding schools in his president's opening speech in 2005. Sotamaa's line of reasoning was that this move would create a unique interdisciplinary university that was needed to create new innovative thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The idea received attention within the Finnish Ministry of Education, which appointed Raimo Sailas, a leading official at the Ministry of Finance, to investigate the possibility of a merger. After Sailas' group reported that it considered the merger to be beneficial to the Finnish academic world and economy, the Finnish government decided to go on with the project on November 11, 2007.

On May 29, 2008, the government announced that the new university would be named after the Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]] in honor of his achievements in technology, economics and art. The Finnish Minister of Education at the time, Ms. [[Sari Sarkomaa]], together with representatives of Finnish industries and professional organisations, signed the Aalto University charter on June 25, 2008 in [[Helsinki]]. On December 19, 2008, Prof. [[Tuula Teeri]] was selected by the Board to be the first President of Aalto University.

Aalto University started operating on January 1, 2010. In the process of creating the university the university law of Finland was rewritten for the university to be allowed to collect endowment. The university managed to reach its goal of collecting 200 million euros in private donations. The sum was augmented by 2.5 times by the Finnish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123144055/https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-11-23|title=Aalto AlumniNET|author=Mira Network AB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Helsinki University of Technology ===
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|Surveying students with professor in the early days of the university of technology.]]
{{main|Helsinki University of Technology}}

As the Aalto University was founded the four schools of science and engineering were formed out of the departments of the '''[[Helsinki University of Technology]]''' (TKK), founded in 1849 by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas I]]. It received university status in 1908. In 1966, the University of Technology moved from [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] in downtown Helsinki to its current Otaniemi campus, designed by [[Alvar Aalto]]. At the time of creation of Aalto University, TKK had about 250 professors and approximately 15,000 students. This means the largest part of the Aalto University is formed from the former Helsinki University of Technology.

In 2011, the former University of Technology (then known as ''Aalto University School of Science and Technology'') was split up into four schools, corresponding to the former TKK faculties: [[Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|School of Chemical Technology]] (CHEM), [[Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|School of Electrical Engineering]] (ELEC), [[Aalto University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] (ENG), and [[Aalto University School of Science|School of Science]] (SCI).

=== Helsinki School of Economics ===
{{main|Helsinki School of Economics}}

The '''Helsinki School of Economics''' ('''HSE''') was established in [[Helsinki]] in 1904 by the business community and was given the status of a university in 1911. It operated as a private university until 1974, when the state of Finland was given the financial responsibility of the university.

Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed ''Aalto University School of Economics'', and is currently known as ''Aalto University School of Business'' (Aalto BIZ).

=== University of Art and Design Helsinki ===
{{main|University of Art and Design Helsinki}}
[[File:Leo Mechelin (cropped).png|thumb|[[Leo Mechelin]] served as one of the first presidents of the school of art and design.]]

The '''University of Art and Design Helsinki''' has been the largest [[art university]] in the [[Nordic countries]]. It was founded in 1871. Media Centre Lume - the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media - is also located in the university. The university awarded the following academic degrees: [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Arts]].

The university has been active in establishing research projects and industrial collaborations via the private sector. During the rectorship of [[Yrjö Sotamaa]] the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation networks.

Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed Aalto University School of Art and Design. In 2012, the Department of Architecture, which historically has been a part of the Helsinki University of Technology, was moved to the school, and the name was changed to ''Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture'' (Aalto ARTS).

== Administration and organisation ==

=== Governance ===
The university, which is incorporated as ''Aalto University Foundation'', is governed by the seven-member Aalto University Foundation Board. The Board decides on the Foundation's strategy, operation and financial issues, is responsible for any far-reaching plans and appoints the University president and vice rectors. Formerly working as the Provost of Aalto University, Ilkka Niemelä was elected President of Aalto University in 2017. The first President of Aalto University was [[Tuula Teeri]]. The university is organized into six schools with their respective deans and administrative structures.

=== Schools ===

=== Studies ===

==== Study in Science and Technology ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|Aalto University School of Engineering|Aalto University School of Science}}

[[File:Mathematics lecture at the Helsinki University of Technology.jpg|thumb|A lecture of mathematics for undergraduates inside the main building.]]

All engineering programmes offered by the schools of science and technology lead to the degree of ''[[diplomi-insinööri]]'' (M.Sc.(Tech.), Master of Science in Technology), a five-year taught master's degree, which is fairly similar to the German {{Interlanguage link multi|Diplom-Ingenieur|de}} degrees. From 2005, according to the [[Bologna process]], all students must also complete a bachelor's degree (B.Sc.(Tech), [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science in Technology]]), in Finnish ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' or ''TkK'', before the DI or architect's degree. However, the schools of science and technology do not offer programs terminating in a bachelor's degree; a student may only be accepted to study for the Master's level degree. The schools of science and technology require a bachelor's degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master's studies are offered completely in English.

Undergraduate studies are generally quite similar in between different programs with a considerable part being taken by a tuition of a solid base in mathematics and physics.

Apart from numerous programs in Finnish/Swedish, various international Master's programs are offered exclusively for studies in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/technology/|title=Aalto Game Changers. Change the world.|author=|date=11 July 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[postgraduate]] degrees given are ''tekniikan lisensiaatti'' (Lic.Sc.(Tech.), [[Licentiate (degree)|Licenciate of Science in Technology]]) and ''tekniikan tohtori'' (D.Sc.(Tech.), [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Science in Technology]]).

Finnish students are accepted mainly on the basis of result in the national DIA entrance exam. The exam variant taken by most entrants mainly tests quantitative ability in mathematics, physics and chemistry, but specialized tests are available for students applying to a number of programs. The score required for entry to the Aalto University varies much depending on the intended field of study, however, in general the scores required for the Aalto University are higher than for any other university granting entry through the DIA exam. For example, the mean sum of mathematics and physics DIA exam scores was 7.2 in the year 2010, whereas the mean minimum sum of mathematics and physics exam scores for gaining admission to an Aalto program was 17.1-20.1, depending on the priority point distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Valintaopas|url = http://dia.fi/media/4005/dia_hakuopas270111_fi_fk_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aalto also contains five of the most selective programs with respect to the matriculation exam scores, out of approximately total of 50 [[Diplomi-insinööri|university technology programs]] in the nation, of which approximately 30 are outside of Aalto, and the three most selective programs with respect to entrance exam and combined scores. The minimum scores required for these top programs are in the 95th-99th percentile range of the whole applicant pool, and approximately 98th-99.8th percentile of what would be the score distribution of the whole age group.

==== Study in Arts, Design and Architecture ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture}}
The School of Arts, Design and Architecture has been a leader in art and design education in Finland for over 138 years. It is an international postgraduate university institution with students from over 50 countries. It offers doctorate, master and bachelor's degrees in a wide range of disciplines - fine art, design, new media, art education, visual culture, motion picture and production design. School of Arts, Design and Architecture is a pioneer in research and in developing interdisciplinary study programmes.

The school received its current name in the beginning of 2012 when the architecture department moved in from the School of Engineering (previously part of Helsinki University of Technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.aalto.fi/en/current/news/view/2012-01-02/|title=School of Arts, Design and Architecture began operations at the start of the year|publisher=Aalto University|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture programmes lead to the Master of Science degrees in architecture and landscape architecture.

==== Study in Business ====
{{main|Aalto University School of Business}}
The School of Business offers degrees in economics and business administration at the Bachelor, Master, Licentiate and Doctoral levels, along with MBA programs targeted to business professionals. Many of the degrees and programs are offered in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/business/|title=Aalto University Gets You More Than a Degree|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its degree programs, the school has a two-step program structure with a three-year bachelor's degree followed by a two-year master's degree. A doctoral degree normally takes four additional years. Financial Times ranked Aalto University School of Business 29th in the European Business school rankings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/european-business-school-rankings-2013#european-business-school-rankings-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus of the Aalto University School of Business is located in Töölö, in the center of Helsinki. The school offers two Bachelor of Science Programs (one in Finnish at the Otaniemi campus and the other in English at the Mikkeli campus) and 13 Master of Science Programs (12 are offered in English).

The Aalto University School of Business is the first business school in Finland and the first business school in the Nordic countries to have received all three labels of excellence from the world’s leading business school accreditation bodies: [[AACSB]], [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]], [[EQUIS]]. This Triple Crown status is an honor held by only few business schools worldwide. The school is also an active member of the [[CEMS - The Global Alliance in Management Education|CEMS]] (Global Alliance in Management Education) and [[Partnership in International Management|PIM]] (Partnership in International Management).

===== MBA Programs =====
Aalto [[MBA]] and [[Executive MBA]] Programs are organized by [[Aalto University Executive Education]] Ltd. MBA and Executive MBA programs are offered in [[Helsinki]], [[China]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Poland]] and have tuition fees, unlike the degree programs. The MBA program is taught through two-week modules by visiting faculty from some of the top business schools in the world, including [[Emory University]], [[Rutgers Business School]], [[University of South Carolina]], [[Georgetown University]], [[UCLA]], [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]], [[Queen’s University]], [[Rotterdam School of Management]], [[Indiana University]], [[ESADE]] and [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaltoee.fi/en|title=Valmennusta, kehittämispalveluja ja koulutusta - Aalto EE|author=|date=|website=aaltoee.fi|access-date=2011-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106022249/http://www.aaltoee.fi/en|archive-date=2011-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/program/business/|title=Aalto University Gets You More Than a Degree|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial Times ranked Aalto University School of Business 78th in Global [[MBA]] programs,&lt;ref name="rankings.ft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/masters-in-management-2013#masters-in-management-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 85th in [[Executive MBA]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/helsinki-school-of-economics/emba-ranking-2013#emba-ranking-2013|title=Business school rankings from the Financial Times - FT.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
[[File:Dome planck hfi.jpg|thumb|right|Radio science done with the receiver in the Planck probe reveals the age and composition of the universe.]]
Aalto University has defined four fundamental competence areas: ICT and digitalisation, Materials and sustainable use of natural resources, Global business dynamics and Art and design knowledge building. In addition to these, the university invests in three integrative multidisciplinary themes: Advanced energy solutions, Health and wellbeing, and Human-centred living environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/strengths/|title=Key research areas|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at Aalto University have achieved notability in, among other things, [[low temperature physics]] (holding the current world record for the [[Coldest temperature recorded on Earth|lowest temperature achieved]]), the development of devices and methods for [[magnetoencephalography]], mobile communications, [[wood processing]], and neural networks, with professor [[Teuvo Kohonen]] initiating research in [[self-organizing map]]s. Additionally, the first commercialised [[total synthesis]], the synthesis of [[camphor]], was invented by [[Gustaf Komppa]], the first professor of chemistry at TKK&lt;ref&gt;Kemia-lehti. {{cite web|url=http://www.kemia-lehti.fi/pdf/gustafkomppa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140713/http://www.kemia-lehti.fi/pdf/gustafkomppa.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nobel laureate]] (chemistry, 1945) [[Artturi Virtanen]] held a professorship in biochemistry at TKK. More recently, the university has notably invested in the research of nanotechnology, operating the largest [[cleanroom]] facility in Northern Europe&lt;ref name="micronova"&gt;{{cite web | title=VTT inaugurated Microelectronics and Nanotechnology Centre 'Micronova' | accessdate=2009-10-08 | url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw53/linden.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest microscopy clusters in Europe.&lt;ref name="nanomicroscopy"&gt;{{cite web|title=TKK Nanomicroscopy Center |accessdate=2009-10-08 |url=http://nmc.tkk.fi/en/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717004627/http://nmc.tkk.fi/en/ |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MilliLab, a joint laboratory of [[VTT]] and Aalto University, built one of the radio receivers in the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] probe, which maps the [[cosmic microwave background]] for determining the age and composition of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/ulkomaat/2013032116811280_ul.shtml|title=Planck-luotain laittoi käsityksen kosmoksesta uusiksi|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centres of Excellence ===
Aalto University participates in seven Centres of Excellence ({{lang-fi|huippuyksikkö}}), selected by the [[Academy of Finland]] to represent the top research in the country, and receiving separate, fixed-period funding from the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/Centres-of-Excellence-/Aims/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928203831/http://www.aka.fi/en-GB/A/Centres-of-Excellence-/Aims/ |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the following units are designated Centres of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/fi/research/excellence_in_research/#sa_huippuyksikot|title=Tieteen huiput|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/excellence_in_research/#academy_of_finland_centres_of_excellence|title=Excellence in Research|author=|date=18 June 2013|website=aalto.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campuses ==
The main university campus is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]]. The other two campuses are located in [[Arabia, Finland|Arabia]] and [[Töölö]] in the former premises of TaiK and HSE, respectively, but are set to be gradually moved to Otaniemi.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Main Campus Otaniemi ===
The four Schools of Science and Technology as well as the bachelor programs of the School of Business are based in Otaniemi in Espoo, 10&amp;nbsp;km from the center of Helsinki, on a campus designed by Alvar Aalto. Otaniemi has a high concentration of high technology. Several high-tech companies, the Finnish forest industry's joint experimental laboratory KCL, and [[business incubator]]s Innopoli and Technopolis are also situated nearby. It is also directly adjacent to [[Keilaniemi]], with Life Science Center and the headquarters of several notable Finnish companies, such as [[Nokia]] and [[Fortum]]. The Otaniemi campus is connected by a 15-minute bus ride to the center of Helsinki. [[Länsimetro|A metro connection]] has just started operating.

The ‘Teekkarikylä’ Student Village, home to over 2,000 students, is also located in Otaniemi. There are over one hundred student organizations on campus which provide a range of opportunities to take part in pastimes of various kinds, from sports to music.

== Culture and student life ==
[[File:TFteknolog.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Finnish technology student's hat ({{lang|fi|teekkarilakki}}) photographed on top of a mirror.]]
The Aalto University students are known for active student life.

An integral part of many student traditions play the brightly colored overalls worn to many events. The color of the overall signals what the student studies (e.g. the economy students are recognized from ''dollar green'' overalls). The student community has also organised important charity events. In fact, the name for these events ''tempaus'', has entered common language to describe any carnival-like charity event.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The students of technology ({{lang|fi|teekkarit}}) are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft on many occasions (both formal and informal). Technology students are also famous for, and Finland's leading practitioners of, [[student prank]]s (''jäynä''), similar in principle to [[MIT hack]]s. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of [[Paavo Nurmi]] onto the 300-year-old wreck of [[Regalskeppet Vasa]] just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.&lt;ref name="iltasanomatttkyarchive"&gt;[[Ilta-Sanomat]] 5 July 1961 "Vasan veijarit", scan available at  [https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html archive.org dump of ttky.fi].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although student traditions vary in between the different constituent schools common activities started to burgeon early after the foundation of Aalto University. The most noticeable student event of the first year of the university was ''Aalto on Tracks'', where a group of 100 students came together to rent a private train which they traveled 10 000&amp;nbsp;km on from Helsinki to the [[Shanghai Expo]] enjoying multidisciplinary talks and workshops on the way.&lt;ref name="aaltoontracks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaltoontracks.com/|title=Aalto on Tracks|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was such a success that the follow-up ''Aalto on waves'' is planned to arrange a trip by boat to South America. ''Aalto on Tracks'' also spurred students of [[Tongji University]] to arrange ''Tongji on Tracks'' which essentially takes the journey of ''Aalto on Tracks'' in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfc.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&amp;a=detail&amp;id=26&amp;nav_id=47|title=欢迎来到同济大学中芬中心|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aalto Entrepreneurship Society]] is a multi-disciplinary society uniting students and graduates of all disciplines of the University. It aims to encourage high-tech, high-growth, scalable entrepreneurship by arranging get-togethers to spark ideas and innovations and aid start-up initiatives among the Aalto students.

=== Aalto Festival ===
Aalto Festival (formerly known as Masters of Aalto, and the Masters of Arts festival) is an annual event in May where the new professionals of the multidisciplinary university meet the public.

An extensive exhibition showcases a wide array of works: everything from distinguished theses, individual statements, concepts and products arising from commercial collaboration to works of art. For the graduating students, the exhibition is an opportunity to interact with society, future employers, the media and other influential parties.

Aalto Festival offers a varying program with exhibitions, seminars, discussions, films, workshops and guided tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moa.aalto.fi|title=Masters of Aalto University 2014 / MoA'14|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student Union ===
Aalto University Student Union ({{lang-fi|Aalto-yliopiston ylioppilaskunta}}, AYY in short) is the official student union of Aalto University. Every bachelor's and master's degree student enrolled in Aalto University is a member of the Student Union.

The purpose of AYY is to represent the students, look after their interests, and support the community of 15,000 students. AYY provides its members with a variety of services such as healthcare, recreation and housing. The Student Union is financed by membership fees, investments and profits from student housing.

Aalto University Student Union was formed in the beginning of 2010 through a merger between the respective student unions of the merged universities.

The Aalto University is also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more Nations, a Finnish type of [[Corporation (University)|student corporation]]. AU's only nation is [[Teknologföreningen|Teknologföreningen (TF)]] and its goal is to unite Swedish-speaking students at the university. The nation is housed in its peculiar building called ''Urdsgjallar''. Since 1972, when the corresponding Finnish-speaking nation ''Tekniikan Ylioppilaat'' was abolished, there are no nations for the Finnish-speaking students, though the 15 regional nations at the [[University of Helsinki]], both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking, do welcome AU students as members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml Osakunnat – Nationerna.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502091419/http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml |date=May 2, 2013 }} Osakuntien yhteistyövaliokunta ry.

=== Associations ===
[[File:Retuperän WBK.jpg|thumb|The Retuperä WBK is a student band that parodies a volunteer fire brigade brass band. In this picture Retuperä is performing in central Helsinki on top of their fire truck.]]

In addition to the student union, Aalto university students have formed numerous associations for studies, cultural activity and sports. There are more than 150 associations maintained by university students.

==== List of student associations ====

Currently this list includes only the associations known to have English Wikipedia articles.

* [[Polyteknikkojen kuoro|The Polytech Choir]] ({{lang-fi|Polyteknikkojen kuoro}})

* [[Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat|Helsinki Academic Male Choir KYL]] ({{lang-fi|Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat}})

=== Student housing ===
The housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as ''Teekkarikylä'' (technology student village), is owned mostly by the student union and partly by [[Foundation for Student Housing in the Helsinki Region|HOAS]] (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing is characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offers housing for approximately 2,600 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Union web pages for the student village |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706062907/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archivedate=6 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ''Teekkarikylä'' |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129041330/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |archivedate=2009-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of bombings by the [[Soviet Union]] itself. The student housing has been used for housing athletes again in e.g. the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison.

Some student housing is also available in the vicinity of the other campuses.

The Otaniemi campus also contains the former student union building ''[[Dipoli]]'', named as the second ''Poli'', the successor of the first student union building in downtown Helsinki. Dipoli was designed by [[Reima and Raili Pietilä]] and completed in 1966. In 1993, the building was permanently rented to the university to act as a conference and [[continuing education]] center and later sold due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.

{{main|List of Aalto University people}}
All three constituent schools have played an integral part in educating many of the top names in their respective fields in Finland. After the Second World War Finland's economy grew and Finnish companies became players in the international markets requiring highly educated expertise and leadership. Both the schools of technology and economy catered to this need as the premier schools of their fields in the country. During the latter part of the 20th century the schools had to increase their student intake considerably to meet the demands of growing markets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">The '''Art dans Tout''' movement was a French art group which operated from 1896 to 1901.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Felix Aubert, Art dans Tout, and Art Nouveau Lace|jstor = 40662780|journal = Studies in the Decorative Arts|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 37–76|volume = 8|issue = 2|first = ROSSELLA|last = FROISSART-PEZONE|first2 = Richard|last2 = Wittman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally called Les Cinq, because it had five founder members, artist and lace designer [[Félix Aubert]], sculptor and craftsman [[Alexandre Charpentier]], sculptor and medalist [[Jean Dampt]], sculptor and medalist Henry Nocq and architect [[Charles Plumet]], it later changed its name to Les Six when Nocq left the group in 1897, replaced by painter [[Étienne Moreau-Nélaton]] and architect and decorator [[Tony Selmersheim]]. In 1898, the group expanded further to become Art dans Tout when Carl-Albert Angst, a sculptor and student of Dampt,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: A Research Guide for Design Reform in France, Belgium, England, and the United States|last = Weisberg|first = Gabriel P.|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 184, 238|last2 = Menon|first2 = Elizabeth K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jules Desbois, a sculptor, [[Paul Follot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ketterer Kunst,  Art auctions, Book auctions Munich, Hamburg &amp; Berlin|url = http://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/paul-follot-1877.php|website = www.kettererkunst.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a furniture designer, Alphonse Hérold, a cabinetmaker, Antoine Jorrand, a painter and tapestry designer, [[Henri Sauvage]], an architect, and Louis Sorrel, an architect and collaborator of Aubert's, joined. The group dissolved in 1901 due to commercial necessity.&lt;ref name="Arwas"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: The French Aesthetic|last = Arwas|first = Victor|publisher = Papadakis Publisher|year = 2002|isbn = 9781901092370|location = |pages = 321, 616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's philosophy can be summed up in two concepts, that the form of a work of art should always fit its function and be artistic, and that the material the work is made from should always reflect the purpose of the object and the nature of the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical context ==

With the rise of machine production, the cost of producing object d'art and house decorations fell. In France, as around the rest of Europe, differing philosophies arose as to how to produce beautiful household objects and furniture for the masses, not just for the rich, following the philosophy of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Eugène-Émmanuel Viollet-le-Duc]]. Followers of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]] believed that banal, mediocre interiors had a negative effect on the development, morality and intellect of people who lived in them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Various attempts at collaborations between artists and industries that produced these items occurred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In France, these attempts had mostly ended in failure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Several of the artists in the group worked in a style that was part of the larger [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'ART DANS TOUT - Les arts décoratifs en France et l'utopie d'un Art nouveau|last=Froissart Pezone|first=Rossella|publisher=CNRS Éditions|year=2005|isbn=9782271062819|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was part of a tentative but determined attempt to break down the barriers between art, industry and everyday life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nocq in his role as art critic wrote an article on improvements in street design seen in England and Belgium, and encouraged France to follow their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Décoration &amp; Le Rationalisme Architecturaux a L'Exposition Universelle|last = Clausen|first = M. L.|publisher = Brill Archive|year = 1987|isbn = 9789004078796|location = |pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Les Cinq ==
Les Cinq originally came together in Autumn 1896, meeting in Charpentier's workshop on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Their first exhibition was held from December 1896 - January 1897 at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In their preface to the exhibition catalogue of the first exhibition, the group set forth their philosophy of bringing together the major arts (painting, sculpture and architecture) and the minor arts (ceramics, furniture and decorative objects), and to produce objects that served both functional and decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They also exhibited a furnished boudoir for the Salon de la [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In this room, Aubert designed the wall-hangings, curtains, carpet and fabric decorations, Charpentier the window-sash bolt and bottle-stoppers and Plumet, the dressing table, chair, shelf-unit, glass display case and the structure of the screens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Les Six ==
In December 1897, the group enlarged to become Les Six. In their 1897-1898 exhibition, Aubert and Charpentier designed a bathroom with the decorator Eugène Simas, which fulfilled the group's ideals of bringing beauty to an object that served a functional purpose, and was also part of an industrial collaboration, with the Sarreguemines factory.

== Art dans Tout ==
The group expanded further in 1898 to include members that could not always attend the Sunday meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The group planned to construct and furnish an entire house for the 1900 International Exhibition in Paris, but could not accomplish this due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  An Aubert and Charpentier-designed bedroom (for Prince Alexandre de Chimay and his wife) was part of the group's 1899 exhibition at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Members of the group collaborated with Léon Benoville and Édmond Socard in designing the interiors of other Parisian houses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sorrel designed a pavilion for the International Exhibition of 1900 which Aubert decorated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:CPAS building.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at the Australian National University in Canberra]]
The '''Centre for the Public Awareness of Science''' is part of the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Centre for the Public Awareness of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000 it became an accredited Centre for the Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]].

==Work of the Centre==

As a [[UNESCO]] Centre, CPAS engages with [[science communication]] and communicators in the Pacific region and beyond.  In partnership with the [[UNESCO]] Pacific Office in [[Apia]], [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=36986&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa]&lt;/ref&gt; CPAS has focused on science teaching training and communication in Pacific nations.  As well as running a science journalism workshop for [[Pacific Island]] journalists in 2001, CPAS  followed up in the same year with a science teacher workshop and the first Pacific Science Communication Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Pacific Science Communication Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] office in [[Jakarta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.or.id UNESCO Office in Jakarta, Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; invited CPAS to join a mission to [[Cambodia]] to conduct a survey to identify and assess the needs of the country with respect to science education in schools and universities. Other activities include joining with [[UNESCO]] ([[Apia]]) to help in its aims to raise social participation in science in and around the Pacific.

CPAS also established, as a pilot project, the Register of Pacific Scientists, an online database for those involved with Pacific Science to record their details and/or search for other people with similar or complementary interests. 

Other activities of CPAS include the presentation of workshops for secondary school science teachers and others in [[Fiji]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]]. A joint teaching program is being developed with the [[National University of Singapore]]. In [[South Africa]], CPAS helped to develop a touring hands-on science exhibition and has been invited to work in and with various [[South African]] science centres.

==Teaching, Outreach and Research==

With a flourishing graduate program, CPAS encourages research in all aspects of [[science communication]]. Degrees are offered at all tertiary levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php CPAS Academic Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113805/http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outreach programs within Australia include workshops for research scientists, science teachers, science and engineering students and science centre personnel, as well as the ANU Shell [[Questacon]] Science Circus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/sqsc.html ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

CPAS has a wide research program dealing with issues at the interface of science and the public. Apart from a long-standing agenda of research in science centres, CPAS is concerned with current issues in science, with the communication agendas of scientists, and with effective communication of science concepts. The research program is interdisciplinary and contributes to the emerging framework of [[science communication]] theory.

==History==

CPAS was launched by Professor [[Richard Dawkins]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/about/CPAS_launch.php CPAS Launch]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It owes it origin to the establishment, twenty years earlier, of a modest science centre in a vacant primary school in [[Canberra]]. This burgeoning science centre eventually grew into [[Questacon]] – The National Science and Technology Centre. [[Questacon]] was the brainchild of [[Mike Gore (physicist)|Michael Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike Prof. Michael Gore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior lecturer in Physics at the Australian National University, who became its first director. An important part of its activities was outreach, supported from the beginning by sponsorship from [[Shell Australia]].

Dr Gore approached Professor Chris Bryant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris Prof. Chris Bryant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then Dean of Science at the [[Australian National University]], with a proposal to set up a science circus to travel Australia, to be staffed by graduate science students enrolled in a course of [[science communication]]. Thus was born the Graduate Certificate in Science Communication that rapidly metamorphosed into a Graduate Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php CPAS Graduate Diploma in Science Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629085932/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative proved extremely popular and it became clear that there was a hitherto undetected demand for such a course. Over the next few years, Masters and PhD courses were offered and science communication became a full-fledged graduate program.

By 1994, the demand was so great that the Faculty of Science at the [[Australian National University]] agreed to fund a Lectureship in [[Science Communication]]. This was the first in Australia and, possibly, the world. Dr [[Susan Stocklmayer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue Dr Susan Stocklmayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to the position and immediately announced her intention of establishing a university centre for [[science communication]].  The Centre was established in 1996, with Professor Bryant as its first, interim, Director. Dr Stocklmayer took over the position in 1998, where she remains today.

==Awards==

In subsequent years, the work of CPAS has been recognised by a number of awards and honours: In 1999, CPAS, [[Shell Australia]] and [[Questacon]] jointly won the Business/Higher Education Round Table&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhert.com/ Business/Higher Education Round Table]&lt;/ref&gt; Award. The citation commends CPAS as “a university centre whose brief is to empower Australians by encouraging in them the confidence of 'ownership' of modern science. It is intended to increase science awareness in the Australian community and to improve communication skills of scientists.”  In 2000, its standing was such that it was designated as the first UNESCO Centre for Science Communication.

In 2004, the triple partnership was awarded the Financial Review National Award for long term sponsorship, and in 2006 it won the Special Award for Excellence in the Prime Ministers Community Business Partnerships. The individual contributions of members of CPAS have also been widely recognised and they have received many personal accolades.

{{Economic systems sidebar|By coordination}}
'''Autarky''' is the [[quality (philosophy)|quality]] of being [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient]]; the term is usually applied to political states or their [[economic system]]s. Autarky exists whenever an entity can survive or continue its activities without external assistance or [[international trade]]. If a self-sufficient [[economy]] also ''refuses'' all trade with the outside world then it is called a '''closed economy'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html#ClosedEconomy|Deardorff's Glossary of International Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212072813/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/c.html |date=2007-12-12 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "closed economy" is also used technically as an abstraction to allow consideration of a single economy without taking foreign trade into account – i.e. as the antonym of [[open economy]]. Autarky in the political sense is not necessarily an economic phenomenon; for example, a [[military]] autarky would be a state that could defend itself without help from another country, or could manufacture all of its weapons without any imports from the outside world.

Autarky as an ideal or method has been embraced by a wide range of [[political ideologies]] and [[Civil rights movements|movements]], especially [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] creeds like [[African socialism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], [[council communism]], [[syndicalism]] (especially [[anarcho-syndicalism]]) and [[Left-wing populism|leftist populism]]. It has also been used in temporary, limited ways by [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements, such as the [[American System (economic plan)|American system]], the [[Meiji Restoration#Centralization|Meiji Restoration]], [[social corporatism]], [[Juche]], and [[traditionalist conservatism]]. [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements occasionally [[Strasserism|claimed]] to strive for autarky in platform or propaganda, but in practice crushed existing movements towards self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|orig-year=1938|author=De Grand, Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintained extensive capital connections in efforts to ready for expansionist war and genocide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45896166|title=IBM and the Holocaust : the strategic alliance between Nazi Germany and America's most powerful corporation|last=Edwin.|first=Black,|date=2001|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0609607995|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=45896166}}&lt;/ref&gt; while allying with traditional business elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58452991|title=The anatomy of fascism|last=O.|first=Paxton, Robert|date=2005|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=1400033918|edition= 1st Vintage books|location=New York|oclc=58452991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autarky may be a policy of a state or other entity when it seeks to be self-sufficient as a whole, but also can be limited to a narrow field such as possession of a key raw material. For example, many countries have a policy of autarky with respect to foodstuffs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140120232431/http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/BerlinSumner.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and water for national security reasons. By contrast, autarky may be a result of economic isolation or external circumstances in which a state or other entity reverts to localized production when it lacks currency or excess production to trade with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Computer Simulations of International Trade and Conflict | journal=Economic Interdependence and International Conflict: New Perspectives on an Enduring Debate | editor1=Mansfield, Edward D.|editor2=Pollins, Brian M.  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L53fR-TusZAC | page=333| isbn=0472022938 | date=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Socialism in Provence, 1871–1914 | author=Judt, Tony | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeygBwAAQBAJ | page=263| isbn=9780814743553 | date=2011-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word ''autarky'' is from the {{lang-el|αὐτάρκεια}}, which means "self-sufficiency" (derived from αὐτο-, "self," and ἀρκέω, "to suffice"). The term is sometimes confused with [[autocracy]] (Greek: αὐτoκρατία "government by single absolute ruler")  or [[autarchy]] (Greek: αὐταρχία – the idea of rejecting government and ruling oneself and no other).

== History ==

===Ancient and medieval===
Early state societies that can be regarded as autarkic include [[nomadic pastoralism]] and [[palace economy]], though over time these tend towards becoming less self-sufficient and more interconnected. The late [[Bronze Age]], for example, saw formerly self-sufficient palace economies rely more heavily on trade, which may have been a contributing factor to the eventual [[Late Bronze Age collapse|Bronze Age Collapse]] when multiple crises hit those systems at once.

[[Medieval commune]]s combined an attempt at overall economic self-sufficiency through the use of common lands and resources with mutual defense pacts against the depredations of the local nobility. Many of these communes later became trading powers such as the [[Hanseatic League]]. In some cases, communal village economies maintained their own debt system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/426794447|title=Debt : the first 5,000 years|last=David.|first=Graeber,|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|isbn=1612191290|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=426794447}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a self-sufficient economy and to avoid reliance on possibly hostile aristocratic or business interests.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Autarkic ambitions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3650099|title=The Populist moment : a short history of the agrarian revolt in America|last=Lawrence.|first=Goodwyn|isbn=0195024176|location=New York|oclc=3650099}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be seen in the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] backlash to the exploitations of free trade in the late 19th-century and in many early [[Utopian socialism|Utopian Socialist]] movements. [[Benefit society|Mutual aid societies]] like the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] and [[Sovereigns of Industry]] attempted to set up self-sufficient economies (with varying degrees of success) in an effort to be less dependent on what they saw as an exploitative economic system and to generate more power to push for reforms.

Early socialist movements used these autarkic efforts to build their base with institutions like the [[Bourse du Travail|Bourse de travail]], socialist canteens and food assistance. These played a major role in securing workers' loyalty and building those parties into increasingly powerful institutions (especially in Europe) throughout the late 19th and early 20th-centuries. Through these cooperatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/731911132 |title= The Guns of August: The proud tower |last= Tuchman |first= Barbara W. |year=2012 |publisher= Library of America |others= MacMillan, Margaret |isbn= 159853145X |location= New York, NY |pages=1046 |oclc= 731911132}}&lt;/ref&gt; "workers bought Socialist bread and Socialist shoes, drank Socialist beer, arranged for Socialist vacations and obtained a Socialist education."

Local and regional farming autarkies in many areas of [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]] were displaced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37392803|title=Seeing like a state : how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300070160|location=New Haven|oclc=37392803}}&lt;/ref&gt; by European colonial administrations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who sought to push smallholder villages into larger plantations that, while less productive, they could more easily control.

Communist movements embraced or dismissed autarky as a goal at different times. Some socialist communities like [[Charles Fourier]]'s [[Phalanstère|phalansteres]] strove for self-sufficiency. The early [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] strove for a self-sufficient economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40510540|title=Red victory : a history of the Russian Civil War|last=Bruce.|first=Lincoln, W.|year=1999|publisher=Da Capo|isbn=0306809095|edition= 1st Da Capo Press|location=New York|oclc=40510540}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[War communism|War Communism]], but later pursued international trade vigorously under the [[New Economic Policy]]. However, while the Soviet government during the latter period encouraged some international trade, it also permitted and even encouraged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30841557|title=The making of the Soviet system : essays in the social history of interwar Russia|last=1921-2010.|first=Lewin, Moshe,|date=1994|publisher=New Press|isbn=1565841255|location=New York|oclc=30841557}}&lt;/ref&gt; local autarkies in many peasant villages.

Right-wing totalitarian governments that have claimed to strive for autarky have often pursued a very different policy in fact, just as some claimed to be in favor of socialism while killing socialists. In 1921 Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]] attacked existing left-wing autarkic projects at the behest of large landowners, destroying roughly 119 labor chambers, 107 cooperatives and 83 peasant offices that year alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42462895|title=Italian fascism : its origins &amp; development|last=De Grand|first= Alexander J.|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803266227|edition= 3rd|location=Lincoln|pages=31–33|oclc=42462895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi Germany]] under economics minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]] claimed to strive for self-sufficiency but pursued major international trade, albeit under a different system, to escape the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The regime would continue to conduct trade, including with countries like the United States, including connections with major companies like [[IBM and the Holocaust|IBM]] and [[Fanta|Coca-Cola]].

===After World War II===
Economic self-sufficiency was pursued as a goal by some members of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], such as [[India]] under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NAYAR|first=BALDEV RAJ|date=1997|title=Nationalist Planning for Autarky and State Hegemony : Development Strategy Under Nehru|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24010467|journal=Indian Economic Review|volume=32|issue=1|pages=13–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malima|first=Kighoma A.|date=1979|title=PLANNING FOR SELF-RELIANCE TANZANIA'S THIRD FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24498250|journal=Africa Development / Afrique et Développement|volume=4|issue=1|pages=37–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the ideology of [[Ujamaa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1024254210|title=State Ideology and Language in Tanzania : Second and Revised Edition.|last=Jan.|first=Blommaert,|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780748668267|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=1024254210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and swadeshi. hat was partly an effort to escape the economic domination of both the United States and the Soviet Union while modernizing the countries' infrastructure.

Small-scale autarkies were sometimes used by the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], such as in the case of the [[Montgomery bus boycott|Montgomery Bus Boycott]], where boycotters set up their own self-sufficient system of cheap or free transit to allow black residents to get to work and avoid using the then-segregated public systems in a successful effort to bring political pressure.

After World War II, [[Autonomism|Autonomist efforts]] in Europe embraced autarkic projects in an effort to craft anti-authoritarian left-wing spaces, especially influencing the [[social center]] and [[squatting|squatters]]' rights movements. Such efforts remain a common feature of Autonomist and anarchist movements on the continent today. The Micropolis social centre in Greece, for example, has gyms, restaurants, bars, meeting space and free distribution of food and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/984595655|title=Antifa : the anti-fascist handbook|last=activist),|first=Bray, Mark (Political|isbn=1612197035|location=Brooklyn, NY|oclc=984595655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, the [[Black Panther Party]] moved away from communist internationalism towards "intercommunalism," a term coined&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/huey-newton-introduces-revolutionary-intercommunalism-boston-college-november-18-1970|title=Huey Newton introduces Revolutionary Intercommunalism, Boston College, November 18 1970|website=libcom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Huey P. Newton]], "to retain a grasp on the local when the rest of radical thought seemed to be moving global." Intercommunalism drew&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|title=The Havoc of Less|date=2017-09-15|work=The New Inquiry|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206132434/https://thenewinquiry.com/the-havoc-of-less/|archivedate=2018-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from left-wing autarkic projects like free medical clinics and breakfast programs, "explicitly articulated as attempts to fill a void left by the failure of the federal government to provide resources as basic as food to black communities."

Autarkic efforts to counter forcible privatization of public resources and maintain local self-sufficiency also formed a key part of [[alter-globalization]] efforts. The [[Cochabamba Water War]] had Bolivians successfully oppose the privatization of their water system to keep the resource in public hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56194844|title=Cochabamba!: Water War in Bolivia|last=Oscar.|first=Olivera,|date=2004|publisher=South End Press|others=Lewis, Tom, |isbn=9780896087026|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=56194844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Today, national economic autarkies are relatively rare. A commonly-cited example is [[North Korea]], based on the government ideology of [[Juche]] ([[self-sufficiency]]), which is concerned with maintaining its domestic localized economy in the face of its isolation. However, even North Korea has extensive trade with [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]], and many countries in Europe and Africa. North Korea had to import food during a widespread [[North Korean famine|famine in the 1990s]].

A better modern example at a societal level is the autonomous region of [[Rojava]], the autonomous northern region of [[Syria]]. Cut off from international trade, facing multiple enemies, and striving for a society based on democratic confederalism and the ideals of [[Murray Bookchin]], Rojava's government and constitution emphasize economic self-sufficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A small key can open a large door: the Rojava revolution|editor=Strangers In A Tangled Wilderness|isbn=193866017X|location=United States|oclc=900796070}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by neighborhood and village councils, with property and business belonging to those who live in or use it towards that goal.

An example of an contemporary effort at localized autarky, incorporating the concept's history from [[black nationalism]], Ujamaa and [[African-American socialism]] and the civil rights movement, is Cooperation Jackson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cooperationjackson.org/|title=Welcome|website=Cooperation Jackson|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a movement aimed at creating a self-sufficient black working class economy in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].

Cooperation Jackson also saw a gain in electoral political power when its involvement proved pivotal to the 2013 mayoral election of [[Chokwe Lumumba]] and the 2017 election of his son, [[Chokwe Antar Lumumba]].

{{Redirect|B. A.|other uses|BA (disambiguation)}}
{{Redirect|A. B.|other uses|AB (disambiguation)}}


A '''Bachelor of Arts''' ('''BA''' or '''AB''', from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus artium}}'' or ''{{lang|la|artium baccalaureus}}'') is a [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course or program in either the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]], sciences, or both. Bachelor of Arts programs generally take three to four years depending on the country, institution, and specific specializations, majors, or minors. The word ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus}}'' (from the Latin ''{{lang|la|bacca}}'', a berry, and ''{{lang|la|laureus}}'', "of the [[bay laurel]]") should not be confused with ''{{lang|la|baccalaureatus}}'' (translatable as "gold-plated [[sceptre|scepter]]" by using the Latina ''{{lang|la|bacum}}'' and ''{{lang|la|aureatus}}''), which refers to the one- to two-year postgraduate ''Bachelor of Arts [[honors degree|with Honors]]'' degree (''{{lang|la|Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore}}'') in some countries.

[[Diploma]]s generally give the name of the institution, signatures of officials of the institution (generally the president or rector of the [[university]] as well as the secretary or dean of the component [[college]]), type of degree conferred, conferring authority, and location at which the degree is conferred. Diplomas generally are printed on high-quality [[paper]] or [[parchment]]; individual institutions set the preferred abbreviation for their degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu/degree-abbreviations An Explanation of Degree Abbreviations - Harvard University Commencement]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bachelor of Arts is usually attained in four years in [[Afghanistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]], [[Kenya]], [[Canada]], [[Greece]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Nigeria]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Turkey]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]], and most of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US5/REF/gpa.html FAST-US-5 United States Education Reference File&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Degree attainment generally takes three years in nearly all of the [[European Union]] and [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[the Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]] and the Province of [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]. In [[Pakistan]], the Bachelor of Arts can also be attained within two years as an ''[[external degree]].''

==Australia, Canada, India, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa==
In colleges and universities in Australia, New Zealand, [[Nepal]] and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 Bachelor of Arts degrees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401072859/http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 |date=2010-04-01 }}, [[Australian National University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Students must pursue at least one [[academic major|major]] area of study, and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper-level classes in the same year and as a result, can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.

Unlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours ("honours" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) Bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one year Bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) Honours degree (abbr. e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra "[[postgraduate]]" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[Honours Degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) Honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or a very high research master's degree program.

Education in [[Canada]] is controlled by the Provinces and can be very different depending on the province in Canada.  Canadian universities typically offer a 4-year Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as Bachelors of Arts or as honours Bachelor of Arts degree. The term "Honours" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.

The honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|Bachelor of Arts degree "with Honours"]], Latin "Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore", abbr. 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a "postgraduate" degree. Going back in history, a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree (also known e.g. in Québec as grade de bachelier ès arts) was also called a ''pass degree'' or ''general degree''.

A student who first achieves a general Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a "postgraduate" Baccalaureatus cum Honore degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one year but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students may be required to undertake a long high-quality research empirical thesis (Honours Seminar Thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive B. cum Honore degree is essential if students ultimate goal is to study towards a two- or three-year very high research master's degree qualification. A student holding a Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree also may choose to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years, in some universities certain Baccalaureatus cum Honore programs have been changed to corresponding master's degrees.

In general, in all four countries, the B.A. degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme. In science, a BA hons degree is generally a prerequisite for entrance to a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] program or a very-high-research-activity master's programme. As such, for example the UK awarded ''honours'' are designed and should not be confused with Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African awarded BA hons/BA (Hons) degree.

For further clarification, in other countries the so-called ''honours'' bachelor may not be an actual degree, but the name of a (vocational) programme which can be completed through specified course work, a high grade average, and the completion of possibly a short paper or project; students who completed such a ''honours'' BA programme sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' after the degree abbreviation without a space, in parentheses and after the 'Hon(s)' without a dot, for example 'B.A.(Hon)'. The 3 and 4 year B.A. degree is also accepted for entry into graduate professional programmes such as [[LLB#Structure of LL.B. programmes|law]] or a [[M.B.A.|Master of Business Administration]] program.

==Netherlands / Europe==
In the [[Netherlands]], the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then there was a single program which led to the [[doctorandus]] degree. This comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs combined. The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'', Dutch for master, abbreviated ''Mr.'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]''). Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, on completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (entitling them to use "Drs." in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (post-nominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.
A similar practice has been introduced in other EU countries, according to the [[Bologna Process]].

==Germany==
In Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universität'' (plural: ''Universitäten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as "University of Applied Sciences". Universitäten place greater emphasis on fundamental science and theoretical background, while Fachhochschulen are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at Universitäten and Fachhochschulen are legally equivalent.

In Germany, the B.A. normally lasts between 3 and 3 ½ years – 6 or 7 semesters – and is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually 21 terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK—the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalauréat]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.

The [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinar.  In Scotland, it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours (for example, B.A. with distinction, merit or pass).

A Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parentheses. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the last year requirement of a dissertation.

The networks saw the advantages: postseason baseball play was the perfect time to begin promoting the new fall TV season. Dual network coverage also brought an element of competition without economic overtones-quality of coverage. Then came October 21, 1975. The Boston Red Sox, unable to win a World Series since 1918, were on their way to a loss in six games to Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine". But a three-run pinch-hit homer by Bernie Carbo tied the game in the eighth, and in the twelfth (by then it was 12:34 a.m.) Carlton Fisk hit a solo shot over the "Green Monster" to win the game. Sixty-two million people saw it, and television couldn't have planned it better, because as Fisk hit his homer, the camera in the left field scoreboard followed him, not the ball, and on replay the audience saw Fisk furiously trying to wave the ball fair. It was the first-ever home run reaction shot. The next night, 75,890,000 people watched the seventh game, and baseball was definitely back. In 1976 baseball received revenue from radio and television approaching $51 million. Lou Harris said in 1977, "For the first time since 1968, more sports fans in the country follow baseball than football." Ten years later baseball received $350 million.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was only being recorded because [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] cameraman Lou Gerard, positioned inside Fenway's scoreboard at the base of the left-field [[Green Monster]] wall, had become distracted by a large rat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lowitt]], "Rats!

Unlike Fox, TBS did not bludgeon the audience with an overabundance of crowd shots or fan interviews. Much of the camera work was exceptional. The close-ups of insects feasting on the neck of Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain were so creepy that they could have been filmed by Wes Craven. For the most part, TBS did a nice job of letting the pictures work for them. Some of the graphics proved problematic, though. As SI's Tom Verducci pointed out, the Leadoff Line, the nine-foot arrow that measured the lead a runner gets off first base, overtly gimmicky and intrusive. Some SI.com readers complained that the graphic at the top of the screen showing how many runners were on base was too small. (To its credit, Behnke said that TBS adjusted it prior to the final game of the Indians-Yankees series by deepening the border and edgings.) Look for the same graphics to return for the LCS -- the Leadoff Line is sponsored by Travelers, not that most fans would know -- including the addition of microphones placed in the bases. "It's always a work in progress and we are our own worst critics," said Behnke, who averaged four hours of sleep during the Division Series. "We have this package for many years but I would say this: We are overwhelmingly deeply proud of what we have done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we done through the divisional series and I can assure you that it will only be better when we crank it up on Thursday."]&lt;/ref&gt; debuted various new looks, such as the first live online views from cameras in dugouts and ones focused on pitchers. TBS also introduced a graphic that creates sort of a rainbow to trace the arc of pitches on game replays. The graphic was superimposed in the studio so analysts like [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] for instance, could take virtual cuts at pitches thrown in games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2007-10-01-hiestand-weekend_N.htm "He'll be standing at a home plate with a bat," Behnke says.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10980">[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|thumb|right|A [[retention pond]] for treatment of [[urban runoff]] (stormwater).]]
'''Best management practices''' ('''BMPs''') is a term used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe a type of [[water pollution]] control.  Historically the term has referred to auxiliary pollution controls in the fields of [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] control and [[sewage treatment| municipal sewage]] control, while in [[stormwater]] management (both urban and rural) and [[wetland]] management, BMPs may refer to a principal control or treatment technique as well.

==Terminology==
Beginning in the 20th century, designers of industrial and municipal sewage pollution controls typically utilized [[sewage treatment|engineered systems]] (e.g. [[Trickling filter|filters]], [[clarifier]]s, [[Bioreactor|biological reactors]]) to provide the central components of pollution control systems, and used the term "BMPs" to describe the supporting functions for these systems, such as operator training and equipment maintenance.

'''Stormwater management,''' as a specialized area within the field of [[environmental engineering]], emerged later in the 20th century, and some practitioners have used the term '''BMP''' to describe both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. [[retention basin|retention ponds]]) to treat polluted stormwater, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. minimizing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides). Other practitioners prefer to use the term '''Stormwater control measure''', due to the varied definitions of the term "BMP" and its use in non-stormwater practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=http://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/7 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=5. Stormwater Management Approaches |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Clean Water Act References to "BMP" ==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] referred to '''BMP'''  in several sections of the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) but did not define the term.
*The 1977 CWA used the term in describing the areawide waste treatment planning program&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act of 1977, Pub.L. 95-217, December 27, 1977. Sections 208 (b), (i) and (j), {{USC|33|1288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in procedures for controlling [[toxic]] [[water pollution|pollutants]] associated with industrial discharges.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 304(e), {{USC|33|1314(e)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|"Section 404" program]], which covers dredge and fill permits, refers to BMPs in one of the enforcement exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;CWA sec. 404(f), {{USC|33|1344}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*References to stormwater BMPs first appear in the 1987 amendment to the CWA in describing the Nonpoint Source Management Demonstration Program.&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.L. 100-4, February 4, 1987. CWA sec. 319(a),(b),(h),(l), &amp; (m), {{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another stormwater BMP reference was added in 2001 with the authorization for a Wet Weather Watershed Pilot Project program.&lt;ref&gt;Wet Weather Water Quality Act of 2000, December 21, 2000. Added by the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763A–225), as enacted into law by section 1(a)(6) of Pub.L. 106–554 (114 Stat. 2763). Amended CWA sec.121(a)(2), {{USC|33|1274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPA definitions ==
In implementing the CWA, the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defined '''BMP''' in the federal wastewater permit regulations, initially to refer to auxiliary procedures for industrial wastewater controls.  
:...schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the pollution of waters of the United States, BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control plant site runoff, spillage or leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. "EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|40|122|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the Agency added a reference to stormwater management BMPs.
:...each NPDES permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable... (k) Best management practices (BMPs)  to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when: ... (2) Authorized under section 402(p) of the CWA for the control of storm water discharges...&lt;ref&gt;EPA. {{CodeFedReg|40|122|44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial wastewater BMPs ==
Industrial wastewater BMPs are considered an adjunct to engineered [[sewage treatment|treatment]] systems. Typical BMPs include operator training, maintenance practices, and spill control procedures for treatment chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite report |date=July 1994 |title=Best Management Practices and Spill Response: Guidance Document |url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/f7457ac3-7967-49c9-94dd-7986cb6624da/resource/6b40c069-d846-4fa2-a98b-bfd060a7ab3a/download/best-management-practices-spill-response-guidance-document.pdf |publisher=Alberta Environmental Protection |location=Edmonton, AB}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many BMPs available which are specific to particular industrial processes, for example:
* source reduction practices in metal finishing industries (e.g. substituting less toxic [[solvent]]s or using water-based cleaners);
* in the [[chemical industry]], capturing equipment washdown waters for recycle/reuse at various process stages;
* in the [[paper industry]], using [[process control]] monitoring to optimize [[bleaching]] processes, and reduce the overall amount of bleach used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1993 |title=Guidance Manual for Developing Best Management Practices (BMP) |chapter=Ch. 3. Industry-Specific Best Management Practices |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0274.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-833-B-93-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stormwater management BMPs ==
[[Stormwater]] management BMPs are control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[urban runoff]] caused through changes to [[land use]]. Generally BMPs focus on [[water quality]] problems caused by increased [[impervious surface]]s from [[land development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=National Research Council, Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12465/chapter/5 |title=Urban Stormwater Management in the United States |chapter=3. Hydrologic, Geomorphic, and Biological Effects of Urbanization on Watersheds |date=2009 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-309-12540-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs are designed to reduce stormwater volume, peak flows, and/or [[nonpoint source pollution]] through [[evapotranspiration]], [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], [[detention basin|detention]], and filtration or biological and chemical actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Debo |first1=Thomas N. |last2=Reese |first2=Andrew J. |authorlink= |title=Municipal Stormwater Management |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=1-56670-584-3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMPs also can improve receiving-water quality by extending the duration of outflows in comparison to inflow duration (known as  hydrograph extension), which dilutes the stormwater discharged into a larger volume of upstream flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author-last1=Granato |author-first1=G.E. |date=2014 |title=Statistics for stochastic modeling of volume reduction, hydrograph extension, and water-quality treatment by structural stormwater runoff best management practices (BMPs) |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5037/ |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |id=Scientific Investigations Report 2014–5037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater BMPs can be classified as "structural" (i.e., devices installed or constructed on a site) or "non-structural" (procedures, such as modified landscaping practices or street sweeping). There are a variety of BMPs available; selection typically depends on site characteristics and pollutant removal objectives. EPA has published a series of stormwater BMP fact sheets for use by local governments, builders and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater |title=National Menu of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for Stormwater |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater management BMPs can be also categorized into four basic types:
# Storage practices: ponds; recovery; [[Green infrastructure|green infrastructure design]]. 
# Vegetative practices: [[Buffer zone|buffers]]; channels; [[green roof]]s; wetlands; functional art;{{explain|date=November 2018}} stormwater wetland park design; wetland park engineering &amp; design. 
# Filtration/Infiltration practices: filtering; [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; [[Rain garden|rain gardens]]; [[Permeable paving|porous pavement]]; civic infrastructure and design; functional stormwater design.
# Water sensitive development: better site design;{{explain|date=November 2018}} open space site design; [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low impact development]].

A biofilm may also be considered a hydrogel, which is a complex polymer that contains many times its dry weight in water. Biofilms are not just bacterial slime layers but biological systems; the bacteria organize themselves into a coordinated functional community. Biofilms can attach to a surface such as a tooth, rock, or surface, and may include a single species or a diverse group of microorganisms. The biofilm bacteria can share nutrients and are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as desiccation, antibiotics, and a host body's immune system. A biofilm usually begins to form when a free-swimming bacterium attaches to a surface.&lt;ref&gt;

== Formation ==

[[File:Iridescent biofilm on a fishtank.JPG|thumb|300px|An [[iridescence|iridescent]] biofilm on the surface of a fish tank.]]

The formation of a biofilm begins with the attachment of free-floating microorganisms to a surface.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first colonist bacteria of a biofilm may adhere to the surface initially by the weak [[van der Waals force]]s and hydrophobic effects.&lt;ref name="pmid11397632"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Briandet R, Herry J, Bellon-Fontaine M | title = Determination of the van der Waals, electron donor and electron acceptor surface tension components of static Gram-positive microbial biofilms | journal = Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–310 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11397632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20438621"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi H, Suda T, Tanaka Y, Kimura B | title = Cellular hydrophobicity of Listeria monocytogenes involves initial attachment and biofilm formation on the surface of polyvinyl chloride | journal = Lett.

[[Hydrophobicity]] can also affect the ability of bacteria to form biofilms. Bacteria with increased hydrophobicity have reduced repulsion between the substratum and the bacterium.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Donlan RM | year = 2002 | title = Biofilms: Microbial Life on Surfaces | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 9| pages = 881–890 | doi=10.3201/eid0809.020063 | pmid=12194761 | pmc=2732559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacteria species are not able to attach to a surface on their own successfully due to their limited motility but are instead able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to other, earlier bacteria colonists. [[Non-motile bacteria]] cannot recognize surfaces or aggregate together as easily as motile bacteria.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt;

During surface colonization bacteria cells are able to communicate using [[quorum sensing]] (QS) products such as [[N-acyl homoserine lactone]] (AHL). Once colonization has begun, the biofilm grows by a combination of cell division and recruitment. [[Polysaccharide]] matrices typically enclose bacterial biofilms. In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin.&lt;ref name="Donlan2002" /&gt; The final stage of biofilm formation is known as dispersion, and is the stage in which the biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size.

The development of a biofilm may allow for an aggregate cell colony (or colonies) to be increasingly [[antibiotic resistance|resistant to antibiotics]]. Cell-cell communication or [[quorum sensing]] has been shown to be involved in the formation of biofilm in several bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;Quorum-Sensing Regulation of the Biofilm Matrix Genes (pel) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispersal ==
[[File:Honors Option-MMG.svg|thumb|Biofilm Dispersal]]
Dispersal of cells from the biofilm colony is an essential stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the [[Biofilm#Extracellular matrix|biofilm extracellular matrix]], such as [[dispersin B]] and [[deoxyribonuclease]], may contribute to biofilm dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Ramasubbu N, Fine DH |title=Detachment of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells by an endogenous beta-hexosaminidase activity |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=185 |issue=16 |pages=4693–8 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12896987 |pmc=166467 |doi=10.1128/JB.185.16.4693-4698.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Izano EA, Amarante MA, Kher WB, Kaplan JB |title=Differential roles of poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide and extracellular DNA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=470–6 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18039822 |pmc=2223269 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02073-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enzymes that degrade the biofilm matrix may be useful as anti-biofilm agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan JB, Ragunath C, Velliyagounder K, Fine DH, Ramasubbu N |title=Enzymatic detachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=2633–6 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15215120 |pmc=434209 |doi=10.1128/AAC.48.7.2633-2636.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Xavier JB, Picioreanu C, Rani SA, van Loosdrecht MC, Stewart PS |title=Biofilm-control strategies based on enzymic disruption of the extracellular polymeric substance matrix--a modelling study |journal=Microbiology |volume=151 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3817–32 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16339929 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.28165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, [[Cis-2-Decenoic acid|''cis''-2-decenoic acid]], is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies.

It is generally assumed that cells dispersed from biofilms immediately go into the planktonic growth phase. However, recent studies have shown that the physiology of dispersed cells from ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' biofilms is highly different from those of planktonic and biofilm cells.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Chua SL, Liu Y, Yam JK, Tolker-Nielsen T, Kjelleberg S, Givskov M, Yang L |title=Dispersed cells represent a distinct stage in the transition from bacterial biofilm to planktonic lifestyles |journal=Nature Communications |volume=5 |year=2014 |doi=10.1038/ncomms5462 |pmid=25042103 |pages=4462|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4462C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26158442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chua SL, Hultqvist LD, Yuan M, Rybtke M, Nielsen TE, Givskov M, Tolker-Nielsen T, Yang L | title = In vitro and in vivo generation and characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm-dispersed cells via c-di-GMP manipulation | journal = Nat Protoc | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 1165–80 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26158442 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2015.067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the dispersal process is a unique stage during the transition from biofilm to planktonic lifestyle in bacteria. Dispersed cells are found to be highly virulent against macrophages and ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', but highly sensitive towards iron stress, as compared with planktonic cells.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Properties ==

Biofilms are usually found on solid [[wikt:substrate|substrates]] submerged in or exposed to an [[aqueous]] [[solution]], although they can form as floating mats on liquid surfaces and also on the surface of leaves, particularly in high humidity climates. Given sufficient resources for growth, a biofilm will quickly grow to be macroscopic (visible to the naked eye). Biofilms can contain many different types of microorganism, e.g. [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[protozoa]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]]; each group performs specialized [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions. However, some organisms will form single-species films under certain conditions. The social structure (cooperation/competition) within a biofilm depends highly on the different species present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nadell|first=Carey D.|author2=Xavier, Joao B. |author3=Foster, Kevin R. |title=The sociobiology of biofilms |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |date=1 January 2009|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=206–224|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00150.x |pmid=19067751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extracellular matrix ===

The EPS matrix consists of [[exopolysaccharides]], proteins and nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danese|first=P. N.|last2=Pratt|first2=L.

This matrix encases the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals as well as gene exchange. The EPS matrix also traps extracellular enzymes and keeps them in close proximity to the cells. Thus, the matrix represents an external digestion system and allows for stable synergistic microconsortia of different species (Wingender and Flemming, Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 8, 623-633). Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute [[nutrient]]s and signalling molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoodley|first=Paul|author2=Dirk deBeer |author3=Zbigniew Lewandowski |title=Liquid Flow in Biofilm Systems |journal=Appl.

Bacteria living in a biofilm usually have significantly different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vlamakis|first=Hera|last2=Aguilar|first2=Claudio|last3=Losick|first3=Richard|last4=Kolter|first4=Roberto|date=2008-04-01|title=Control of cell fate by the formation of an architecturally complex bacterial community|journal=Genes &amp; Development|volume=22|issue=7|pages=945–953|doi=10.1101/gad.1645008|issn=0890-9369|pmc=2279205|pmid=18381896}}&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of this environment is increased resistance to [[detergent]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the community.

However, biofilms are not always less susceptible to antibiotics. For instance, the biofilm form of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the biofilm is compared to logarithmic-phase planktonic cells, the biofilm does have greater resistance to antimicrobials. This resistance to antibiotics in both stationary-phase cells and biofilms may be due to the presence of [[persister cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Spoering AL, Lewis K |title=Biofilms and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have similar resistance to killing by antimicrobials |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=183 |issue=23 |pages=6746–51 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11698361 |pmc=95513 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.23.6746-6751.2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacteria mats near Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|thumb|Mats of bacterial biofilm color the hot springs in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The longest raised mat area is about half a meter long.]]
[[File:Thermophilic bacteria.jpg|thumb|Thermophilic bacteria in the outflow of [[Mickey Hot Springs]], [[Oregon]], approximately 20&amp;nbsp;mm thick.]]
Biofilms are ubiquitous in organic life. Nearly every species of microorganism have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other. Biofilms will form on virtually every non-shedding surface in [[Asepsis|non-sterile]] aqueous or humid environments. Biofilms can grow in the most extreme environments: from, for example, the extremely hot, briny waters of [[hot spring]]s ranging from very acidic to very alkaline, to frozen [[glacier]]s.

Biofilms can be found on rocks and pebbles at the bottoms of most streams or [[river]]s and often form on the surfaces of [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pools of water. Biofilms are important components of [[food chains]] in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic [[invertebrate]]s upon which many fish feed. Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, as in the case of nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots, exist symbiotically with the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|title=Introduction to Biofilms: Desirable and undesirable impacts of biofilm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622002657/http://www.cs.montana.edu/ross/personal/intro-biofilms-s3.htm|archivedate=2008-06-22|df=}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include Citrus Canker, [[Pierce's Disease]] of grapes, and Bacterial Spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=September 2007|title=Influence of xylem fluid chemistry on planktonic growth, biofilm formation and aggregation of Xylella fastidiosa|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=274|issue=2|pages=210–7|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00827.x|pmid=17610515|vauthors=Andersen PC, Brodbeck BV, Oden S, Shriner A, Leite B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies in 2003 discovered that the immune system supports bio-film development in the large intestine. This was supported mainly with the fact that the two most abundantly produced molecules by the immune system also support bio-film production and are associated with the bio-films developed in the gut. This is especially important because the appendix holds a mass amount of these bacterial bio-films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Barbas|first2=Andrew|last3=Bush|first3=Errol|last4=Lin|first4=Shu|last5=Parker|first5=William|date=24 June 2007|title=Biofilms in the large bowel suggest an apparent function of the human vermiform appendix|url=http://sciences.surgery.duke.edu/files/BillSection1SecondInsert.pdf|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=249|issue=4|pages=826–831|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.08.032|pmid=17936308|last1=Bollinger|first1=Randal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery helps to distinguish the possible function of the appendix and the idea that the appendix can help reinoculate the gut with good gut flora.

In the human environment, biofilms can grow in [[shower]]s very easily since they provide a moist and warm environment for the biofilm to thrive. Biofilms can form inside water and [[Sanitary sewer|sewage]] [[pipe (material)|pipes]] and cause clogging and [[corrosion]]. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas. Biofilm in soil can cause [[bioclogging]]. Biofilms in cooling- or heating-water systems are known to reduce heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/01457638108939572 |title=Influence of Fouling Biofilms on Heat Transfer |year=1981 |last1=Characklis |first1=WG |last2=Nevimons |first2=MJ |last3=Picologlou |first3=BF |journal=Heat Transfer Engineering |volume=3 |pages=23–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilms in marine engineering systems, such as pipelines of the offshore oil and gas industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schwermer CU, Lavik G, Abed RM |title=Impact of nitrate on the structure and function of bacterial biofilm communities in pipelines used for injection of seawater into oil fields |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=2841–51 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18344353 |pmc=2394879 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02027-07|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to substantial corrosion problems. Corrosion is mainly due to abiotic factors; however, at least 20% of corrosion is caused by microorganisms that are attached to the metal subsurface (i.e., [[Microbial corrosion|microbially influenced corrosion]]).

Bacterial adhesion to boat hulls serves as the foundation for [[biofouling]] of seagoing vessels. Once a film of bacteria forms, it is easier for other marine organisms such as barnacles to attach. Such fouling can reduce maximum vessel speed by up to 20%, prolonging voyages and consuming fuel. Time in dry dock for refitting and repainting reduces the productivity of shipping assets, and the useful life of ships is also reduced due to corrosion and mechanical removal (scraping) of marine organisms from ships' hulls.

[[Stromatolites]] are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by microbial biofilms, especially of [[cyanobacteria]]. Stromatolites include some of the most ancient records of life on Earth, and are still forming today.

=== Dental plaque ===

Within the human body, biofilms are present on the [[teeth]] as [[dental plaque]], where they may cause [[tooth decay]] and [[gum disease]]. These biofilms can either be in an uncalcified state that can be removed by dental instruments, or a calcified state which is more difficult to remove. Removal techniques can also include [[antimicrobial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandki|first=Rita|last2=Banthia|first2=Priyank|last3=Banthia|first3=Ruchi|date=2011|title=Biofilms: A microbial home|journal=Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=111–114|doi=10.4103/0972-124X.84377|issn=0972-124X|pmc=3183659|pmid=21976832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dental plaque]] is an oral biofilm that adheres to the [[teeth]] and consists of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''Candida albicans''), embedded in salivary [[polymers]] and microbial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subjects the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial [[metabolite]]s which results in dental disease.&lt;ref name="RevistaOMF"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Dec 2010|title=Microbial biofilms in dental medicine in reference to implanto-prostethic rehabilitation|url=http://www.revistaomf.ro/(8)|journal=Revista de chirurgie oro-maxilo-facială și implantologie|language=ro|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–13|issn=2069-3850|id=8|author1=Augustin Mihai|author2=Carmen Balotescu-Chifiriuc|author3=Veronica Lazăr|author4=Ruxandra Stănescu|author5=Mihai Burlibașa|author6=Dana Catrinel Ispas|accessdate=2012-06-03}}(webpage has a translation button)&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilm on the surface of teeth is frequently subject to oxidative stress&lt;ref name="pmid8519478"&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 1995|title=Oxygen metabolism, oxidative stress and acid-base physiology of dental plaque biofilms|url=|journal=J.

The dental plaque biofilm can result in the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from balanced populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an [[acidogenic]], aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary [[carbohydrate]]. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues ([[Tooth enamel|enamel]] and then [[dentin]]), the sign and symptom being a [[carious lesion]]. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathology of dental caries.

Competence can lead to genetic transformation, a form of sexual interaction, favored under conditions of high cell density and/or stress where there is maximal opportunity for interaction between the competent cell and the DNA released from nearby donor cells. This system is optimally expressed when ''S. mutans'' cells reside in an actively growing biofilm. Biofilm grown ''S. mutans'' cells are genetically transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than ''S. mutans'' growing as free-floating planktonic cells suspended in liquid.&lt;ref name="Li" /&gt;

When the biofilm, containing ''S. mutans'' and related oral streptococci, is subjected to acid stress, the competence regulon is induced, leading to resistance to being killed by acid.&lt;ref name="Lemos" /&gt; As pointed out by Michod et al., transformation in bacterial pathogens likely provides for effective and efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages.&lt;ref name="Michod"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2008|title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens|url=|journal=Infect.

Many different bacteria form biofilms, including gram-positive (e.g. ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp, ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' spp, and [[lactic acid bacteria]], including ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and ''[[Lactococcus lactis]]'') and gram-negative species (e.g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', or ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'').&lt;ref name="Abee"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 21109420| year = 2011| author1 = Abee| first1 = T| title = Biofilm formation and dispersal in Gram-positive bacteria| journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology| volume = 22| issue = 2| pages = 172–9 | last2 = Kovács| first2 = A.

Biofilms are formed by bacteria that colonize plants, e.g. ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'', and related pseudomonads which are common plant-associated bacteria found on leaves, roots, and in the soil, and the majority of their natural isolates form biofilms.&lt;ref name="Danhorn"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 17506679| year = 2007| author1 = Danhorn| first1 = T| title = Biofilm formation by plant-associated bacteria| journal = Annual Review of Microbiology| volume = 61| pages = 401–22| last2 = Fuqua| first2 = C| doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.61.080706.093316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes such as ''[[Rhizobium leguminosarum]]'' and ''[[Sinorhizobium meliloti]]'' form biofilms on legume roots and other inert surfaces.&lt;ref name="Danhorn" /&gt;

It has recently been shown that biofilms are present on the removed tissue of 80% of patients undergoing surgery for chronic [[sinusitis]].

Research has shown that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam antibiotics induce biofilm formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus''. This sub-therapeutic level of antibiotic may result from the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture, or during the normal course of antibiotic therapy. The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kaplan JB, Izano EA, Gopal P |title=Low Levels of β-Lactam Antibiotics Induce Extracellular DNA Release and Biofilm Formation in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=MBio |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=2012 |doi=10.1128/mBio.00198-12|pmid=22851659 |pmc=3419523 |display-authors=etal |pages=e00198–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the [[tragedy of the commons]] in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com.eg/scholar?oi=bibs&amp;cluster=17231892830113723348&amp;btnI=1&amp;hl=ar] Ibrahim, Ahmed (2015): The tragedy of the commons and prisoner's dilemma may improve our realization of the theory of life and provide us with advanced therapeutic ways. figshare.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' ===

''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of septicemia in HIV-infected persons. When ''S. pneumonia'' grows in biofilms, genes are specifically expressed that respond to oxidative stress and induce competence.&lt;ref name="pmid16925554"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oggioni MR, Trappetti C, Kadioglu A, Cassone M, Iannelli F, Ricci S, Andrew PW, Pozzi G |title=Switch from planktonic to sessile life: a major event in pneumococcal pathogenesis |journal=Mol.

CSP also functions as a quorum-sensing peptide. It not only induces biofilm formation, but also increases virulence in pneumonia and meningitis.

It has been proposed that competence development and biofilm formation is an adaptation of ''S. pneumoniae'' to survive the defenses of the host.&lt;ref name=Michod /&gt; In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' in a biofilm have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the biofilm to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent ''S. pneumoniae'' can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22706053"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wei H, Håvarstein LS |title=Fratricide is essential for efficient gene transfer between pneumococci in biofilms |journal=Appl.

=== In industry ===
Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many [[sewage treatment]] plants include a [[secondary treatment]] stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter ([[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]), while [[protozoa]] and [[rotifer]]s are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. [[Slow sand filter]]s rely on biofilm development in the same way to filter surface water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate [[petroleum]] oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the [[microbial biodegradation|hydrocarbon-degrading]] activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCB).&lt;ref name="chapter9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|vauthors=Martins dos Santos VA, Yakimov MM, Timmis KN, Golyshin PN|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-17-2|pages=1971|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx6v3TIkzXUC&amp;pg=PA1971#v=onepage|editor=Díaz E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause of foodborne disease is [[Salmonella]].&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mizan F | year = | title = Microbial biofilms in seafood: A food-hygiene challenge | url = | journal = | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of salmonella contamination can be found in the poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; Salmonella increases the risk of foodborne illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly.

New forms of cleaning procedures are being tested in order to reduce biofilm formation in these processes which will lead to safer and more productive food processing industries. These new forms of cleaning procedures also have a profound effect on the environment, often releasing toxic gases into the groundwater reservoirs.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

Along with bacteria, biofilms are often initiated and produced by eukaryotic microbes. The biofilms produced by eukaryotes is usually occupied by bacteria and other eukaryotes alike, however the surface is cultivated and EPS is secreted initially by the eukaryote.&lt;ref name="pmid16897306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Colen 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cooksey K, Wigglesworth-Cooksey B | year = 1995 | title = Adhesion of bacteria and diatoms to surfaces in the sea: a review | url = | journal = Aquatic Microbial Ecology | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.3354/ame009087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[microalgae]] are known to form biofilms in such a way. Biofilms of fungal origin are important aspects of human infection and fungal pathagenicity, as the fungal infection is more resistant to antifungals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fanning S, Mitchell AP | year = 2012 | title = Fungal Biofilms | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = e1002585 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002585 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11514524"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra J, Kuhn DM, Mukherjee PK, Hoyer LL, McCormick T, Ghannoum MA | title = Biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans: development, architecture, and drug resistance | journal = J.

In the environment, fungal biofilms are an area of ongoing research. One key area of research is fungal biofilms on plants. For example, in the soil, plant associated fungi including [[mycorrhiza]] have been shown to decompose organic matter, protect plants from bacterial pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications {{cite book|last1=Burmølle|first1=Mette|last2=Kjøller|first2=Annelise|last3=Sørenses|first3=Søren|editor1-last=Lear|editor1-first=Gavin|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Gillian|title=Microbial Biofilms: Current Research and Applications|date=2012|publisher=Horizon Scientific Press|isbn=1904455964|pages=61–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofilms in aquatic environments are often founded by [[diatom]]s. The exact purpose of these biofilms is unknown, however there is evidence that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress.&lt;ref name="pmid27009999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25268215"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steele DJ, Franklin DJ, Underwood GJ | title = Protection of cells from salinity stress by extracellular polymeric substances in diatom biofilms | journal = Biofouling | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 987–98 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25268215 | pmc = 4706044 | doi = 10.1080/08927014.2014.960859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the [[phycosphere]], but importantly are the bacteria associated with diatoms, as it has been shown that although diatoms excrete EPS, they only do so when interacting with certain bacteria species.&lt;ref name="pmid26986529"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Windler M, Leinweber K, Bartulos CR, Philipp B, Kroth PG | title = Biofilm and capsule formation of the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum are affected by a bacterium | journal = J.

== Background ==

=== Speech accommodation theory ===

The communication accommodation theory was developed by [[Howard Giles]], professor of Communication at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} The speech accommodation theory was developed to demonstrate all of the value of social psychological concepts to understanding the dynamics of speech.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} It sought to explain "... the motivations underlying certain shifts in people's speech styles during social encounters and some of the social consequences arising from them."{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}}Particularly, it focused on the cognitive and affective processes underlying individuals' convergence and divergence through speech. The communication accommodation theory has broadened this theory to include not only speech but also the "non-verbal and discursive dimensions of social interaction".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} CAT has also created a different perspective from other research in language and social interaction—and communication more generally—that focuses on either interpersonal or intergroup communication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Social psychology and social identity theory ===

Like speech accommodation theory, communication accommodation theory continues to draw from [[social psychology]], particularly from four main socio-psychology theories: similarity-attraction, [[social exchange]], causal attribution and intergroup distinctiveness. These theories help to explain why speakers seek to converge or diverge from the language, dialect, accent and behavior of their interlocutors. CAT also relies heavily in [[social identity theory]]. This latter theory argues that a person's self-concept comprises a personal identity and a [[social identity]], and that this social identity is based in comparisons people make between in-groups (groups they belong to) and out-groups (groups they do not belong to).{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} According to social identity theory, people strive to maintain a positive social identity by either joining groups where they feel more comfortable or making a more positive experience of belonging to the groups they already belong to. Since speech is a way to express group membership, people adopt convergence or divergence in communication to "signal a salient group distinctiveness, so as to reinforce a social identity".{{sfn|Gallois|Ogay|Giles|2005}} Communication accommodation thus, becomes a tool to emphasize group distinctiveness in a positive way, and strengthen the individual's social identity. There are four main socio-psychological theories:

====Similarity-attraction====
The similarity-attraction theory posits that "The more similar our attitudes and beliefs are to those of others, the more likely it is for them to be attracted to us."{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Convergence through verbal and non-verbal communication is one of the mechanisms that we can use to become more similar to others, increasing their attraction towards us.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} For this reason, it can be said that one of the factors that leads individuals to use convergence is a desire to obtain social approval from their interlocutor.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} It could hence be concluded that "the greater one's need for social approval, the greater will be one's tendency to converge".{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Natalé (1975), for instance, has found that speakers with high needs for approval converge more to another's vocal intensity and pause length than those with low needs for approval.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} An individual on the receiving end of high level of accommodation is likely to develop a greater sense of self-esteem and satisfaction than being a receiver of low accommodation.

====Social exchange process====
The social exchange process theory "... states that prior to acting, we attempt to assess the rewards and costs of alternate courses of action",{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} and that we tend to choose whatever course of action will bring greater rewards and less costs. The Social Exchange Theory is a theory that looks at how people evaluate their relationships. Throughout the process of evaluating relationships, individuals want to feel as if they are receiving more from the relationship than they are expending within the relationship. In other words, people like to be in relationships where the rewards outweigh the costs. Although most often convergence can bring forth rewards, there are some occasions when it can also bring forth costs such as "increased effort to converge, a loss of perceived integrity and personal (and sometimes group) identity".{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Hence, when choosing whether or not to use convergence, people assess these costs and rewards.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}}

====Causal attribution process====
The causal attribution theory "[s]uggests that we interpret other people's behavior, and evaluate the individual themselves, in terms of the motivations and intentions that we attribute as the cause of their behavior"{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} It applies to convergence in that convergence might be viewed positively or negatively depending on the causes we attribute to it: "Although interpersonal convergence is generally favorably received, and non-convergence generally unfavorably received, the extent to which this holds true will undoubtedly be influenced by the listeners attributions of the speaker's intent."{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Giles and Smith provide the example of an experiment that they conducted amongst French and English speaking Canadians to illustrate this. In this experiment, when individuals believed that the person from the different group used language convergence to reduce cultural barriers, they evaluated it more positively than when they attributed it to the pressures of the situation. "When French Canadian listeners attributed an English Canadian's convergence to French as due to his desire to break down cultural barriers, the shift was viewed favorably. However, when this same behavior was attributed to pressures in the situation forcing the other to converge, positive feelings were not so strongly evoked."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

====Intergroup distinctiveness====
The process of intergroup distinctiveness, as theorized by Tajfel argues, "... when members of different groups are in contact, they compare themselves on dimensions that are important to them, such as personal attributes, abilities, material possessions and so forth."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}} In these "intergroup social comparisons" individuals seek to find ways to make themselves positively distinct from the out-group to enhance their social identity.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} Because speech style and language is an important factor in defining social groups, divergence in speech style or language is often used to maintain intergroup distinctiveness and differentiate from the out-group, especially when group membership is a salient issue or the individual's identity and group membership is being threatened.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

== Assumptions ==
Many of the principles and concepts from [[social identity theory]] are also applicable to communication accommodation theory. Under the influence of social psychology, especially social identity theory, communication accommodation theory are guided by mainly four assumptions.

*There are speech and behavioral similarities and dissimilarities in all conversations.
*The way we perceive the speech and behaviors of another determines our evaluation of the conversation.
*Language and behaviors have the ability to communicate social status and group belonging between people in a conversation.
*Norms guide the accommodation process, which varies in its degree of appropriateness.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}}

The first assumption indicates that people bring their past experience to conversations. Therefore, communication is influenced by situational conditions and initial reactions but also the "social-historical context in which the interaction is embedded".{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} People's attitudes and beliefs, derived from those factors, determine the extent to which they are willing to accommodate in a conversation. The more similarities that they share with each other, the more likely for them to accommodate.

The second assumption is concerned with how people perceive and evaluate a conversation. Perception is '"the process of attending to and interpreting a message'"{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}}, and evaluation is the "process of judging a conversation".{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Someone who enters a conversation usually first observes what takes place and then decides whether he should adjust to fit in. However, the decision about accommodation is not always necessary. If two strangers meet, they may have a random small talk and simply say goodbye. Then, neither of them is likely to evaluate the conversation since they have little chance of meeting again.

The importance of language and behavior is illustrated in the third assumption since they are indicators of social status and group belongings. When two people who speak different languages try to have a conversation, the language used is more likely to be the one used by the higher status person. That idea of "salient social membership"{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} negotiation is illustrated well during an interview as the interviewee usually makes all efforts to identify with the interviewer by accommodating the way that is spoken and behaved to raise the chance of getting the job.

The last assumption puts emphasis on social appropriateness and norms. Here, norms are defined as " expectations of behaviors that individuals feel should or should not occur in a conversation".{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Those expectations give guidance to people's behaviors, helping them to figure out the appropriate way to accommodate. Most of the time, the accommodation made according to those norms are perceived socially appropriate. For instance, when a young person talks to the seniors in the family, he should avoid using jargons among his generation to show respect and to communicate more smoothly.

== Convergence and divergence ==

=== Convergence ===

Convergence refers to the process through which an individual shifts speech patterns in interaction so that they more closely resemble the speech patterns of speech partners.{{sfn|Giles|Smith|1979}} People can converge through many features of communication such as their use of language, their "pronunciation, pause and utterance lengths, vocal intensities, non verbal behaviors, and intimacy of self disclosures"(Giles and Smith, 1979, 46), but they do not necessarily have to converge simultaneously at all of these levels. In fact, people can both converge at some levels and diverge through others at the same time.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} People use convergence based on their perceptions of others, as well as what they are able to infer about them and their backgrounds. Attraction (likability, charisma, credibility), also triggers convergence. As Turner and West note, "When communicators are attracted to others they will converge in their conversations."{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} On the other hand, as the similarity attraction theory highlights, when people have similar beliefs, personality and behaviors they tend to be more attracted towards each other. To achieve a "desired social distance"(Pardo, 2016), people use language to converge more towards a conversational partner they are attracted to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pardo|first=Jennifer S.|last2=Gibbons|first2=Rachel|last3=Suppes|first3=Alexandra|last4=Krauss|first4=Robert M.|date=2012-01-01|title=Phonetic convergence in college roommates|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447011000945|journal=Journal of Phonetics|volume=40|issue=1|pages=190–197|doi=10.1016/j.wocn.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to make social interaction flow subsequently results in convergence. Many people tend to use converge with one another because they want to feel a sense of fitting in and experience social approval to the people around them. Thus, when one individual shifts speech and non-verbal behaviors in order to assimilate to the other it can result in a more favorable appraisal of him, that is: when convergence is perceived positively it is likely to enhance both the conversation and the attraction between the listener and the speaker. For this reason it could be said that convergence reflects "an individual's desire for social approval"{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} from his interlocutor, and that the greater the individual's need for social approval, the more likely he or she is to converge. Besides attraction, other factors that "influence the intensity of this" need of approval and hence the level of convergence "include the probability of future interactions, the social status of the addressee, and interpersonal variability for need of social approval".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} Other factors that determine whether and to what extent individuals converge in interaction are their relational history, social norms and power variables.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Because individuals are more likely to converge to the individual with the higher status it is likely that the speech in a conversation will reflect the speech of the individual with the higher status.{{sfn|Turner|West|2010}} Converging also increases the effectiveness of communication, which in turn lowers uncertainty, interpersonal anxiety, and increases mutual understanding. This is another factor that motivates people to converge.

=== Divergence ===

Divergence is a linguistic strategy whereby a member of a speech community accentuates the linguistic differences between himself and his interlocutor.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} "Given that communication features are often core dimensions of what it is to be a member of a group, divergence can be regarded as a very important tactic of displaying a valued distinctiveness from the other."{{sfn|Giles|Ogay|2007}} This helps to sustain a positive image of one's in-group and hence to strengthen one's social identity. Divergence is commonly used to establish dominance or power in an interaction. For example, if a recent college graduate becomes a professor, they might be teaching students who are around the same age as them. Therefore, it is important for the professor to communicate in a way that the students are aware the professor has more authority than them. Another case where there is a need for divergence are when professionals are with clients. In a 2001 study, doctors and patients discussed musculoskeletal disorders and it was observed that there were miscommunications that occurred because the participants chose to converge during the communication rather than to accentuate their position differences. Patients in the study felt more comfortable discussing their problems because they felt "positive about their doctor’s capacity to understand them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Susan C.|last2=Gallois|first2=Cindy|last3=Driedger|first3=S.

Further research conducted by Gallois et al. in 1995 has expanded the theory to include 17 propositions that influence these processes of convergence and divergence. They are categorized into four main components: the ''sociohistorical context'', ''the communicators' accommodative orientation'', the ''immediate situation'' and ''evaluation and future intentions''.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} These components are essential to Communication accommodation Theory and affect the course and outcome of intercultural conversations.

===Sociohistorical context===

The sociohistorical context refers to ways that past interactions between groups the communicators belong to influence the communication behaviors of the communicators. It includes "the relations between the groups having contact and the social norms regarding contact".{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} These relations between the different groups the communicators belong to influence the communicators' behavior. Socio-historical factors that influence communicators include political or historical relations between nations, and different religious or ideological views of the two groups participating in the conversation.

===Accommodative orientation===

Accommodative orientation refers to the communicator's "... tendencies to perceive encounters with out group members in interpersonal terms, intergroup terms, or a combination of the two".{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} There are three factors that are crucial to accommodative orientations: (1) "intrapersonal factors" (e.g. personality of the speakers), (2) "intergroup factors" (e.g. communicators' feelings toward outgroups), and (3) "initial orientations" (e.g., perceived potential for conflict).{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}} Issues that influence this last factor include: collectivistic culture context or whether the culture is collectivistic or individualistic; distressing history of interaction, the possible tensions that exist between groups due to past interactions; stereotypes; norms for treatment of groups; and high group solidarity/ high group dependence, how dependent the person's self-worth is in the group.{{sfn|Griffin|2008|pp=387–399}}

===Immediate situation===

The immediate situation refers to the moment when the actual communication takes place. It is shaped by five interrelated aspects: (1) ''sociopsychological states'', (2) ''goals and addressee focus'' (e.g., motivations and goals for the encounter), (3) ''sociolinguistic strategies'' (e.g., convergence or divergence), (4) ''behavior and tactics'' (e.g., topic, accent) and (5) ''labeling and attributions''.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}}

===Evaluation and future intentions===

This aspect deals with how communicators perceive their conversational partners' behavior and its effects on future encounters between the two groups. Positively rated conversations will most likely lead to further communication between the interlocutors and other members of their respective groups.{{sfn|Gudykunst|2003}}

==In action==

In 1991, Giles, Coupland, and Coupland expressed the belief that a "more qualitative perspective" would be necessary to get more diverse and clarifying explanations of the behaviors presented within varying contexts.  They referred to this as "the applied perspective" that showed accommodation theory as a vital part of day-to-day activity as opposed to solely being a theoretical construct. They sought to "demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships invoked by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns".{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}} For Giles, Coupland, and Coupland, these "pragmatic concerns" were extremely varied in nature.

One of these "pragmatic concerns" included understanding the relational issues that present themselves in the medical and clinical fields, such as the relational "alternatives, development, difficulties, and outcomes" that affected the patients' contentment with their medical interactions—and whether or not, through these interactions, they agreed with and implemented said health care regimens. Another of these situations involved the potential options in a legal arena. The way that the judges, plaintiffs, and defendants accommodated themselves to both the situation and the jury could manipulate the jury's acceptance or rejection of the defendant, and could, thus, control the outcome of the case.

Communication accommodation theory was also found to have a place in media. In regards to radio broadcasting, the alliance of the audience with the broadcaster played an important part in both the ratings that the shows would receive and whether the show progressed or was cancelled.

In the area of jobs and employment, accommodation theory was believed to influence the satisfaction one has with his or her job and the productivity that that person possesses in said job through convergence with or divergence from the co-workers and their work environment.

Accommodation theory also possessed practical applications in the development of learning a second language. This was seen when the student's education of and proficiency in said language was either assisted or hindered by accommodative measures. Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991) also addressed the part that accommodation theory plays in a situation they called ''language switching'', when bilingual individuals must decide which language they should speak when they are in an organizational environment with other bilingual individuals. This can be an incredibly important choice to make, especially in a business setting, because an incorrect judgment in this area of communication could unwittingly promote negative reactions between the two or more parties involved. In addition, accommodation theory was strongly intertwined with the way an immigrant accepts and is accepted by their host country. An instance of over-accommodation from the immigrating individual can unintentionally damage that person's sense of individuality while a strong divergence from the immigrating individual from their host culture can prompt the natives of the host country to react negatively to them because of the immigrating individual's use of divergence.

The final area of practical application, as presented by Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991), was that of accommodation theory's effect on the lives of people with disabilities. Accommodation theory was thought to either aid them by promoting them to "fulfill their communicative and life potentials", or by hindering them from reaching their full potential by focusing on the disability that made them different rather than the other characteristics that made them similar to their peers.

Despite the fact that communication accommodation theory is theoretical, it has shown itself to be viable by its numerous practical applications.{{sfn|Giles|Coupland|Coupland|1991}}

== Criticisms ==

The Communication Accommodation Theory has obtained scholarly criticism by the three scholars Judee Burgon, Leesa Dillman, and Lesa Stern. These scholars question the "convergence-divergence frame... [and] they believe that conversations are too complex to be reduced simply to the processes of the Communication Accommodation theory. They also challenge the notion that people's accommodation can be explained by just the practice of [convergence-divergence]".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} Questions asked by the scholars were: "what occurs if people both converge and diverge in conversations, are there consequences to the speaker, the listener, is there an influence if race or ethnicity is played in the process?".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} It causes conflicts between communicators because the theory relies too heavily on a rational way of communicating. Sometimes we as people do not have a rational way of thinking and this becomes a problem when communicating.

== Application ==

The Communication Accommodation theory focuses "on the role of conversations in our lives".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}}  It has been incorporated into "the mass media (Bell, 1991), with families (Fox, 1999), with Chinese students (Hornsey and Gallois, 1998), with elderly (Harwood, 2002), on the job (McCroskey and Richmond, 2000), in interviews (Willemyns, Gallois, Callan, and Pittam, 1997), and even with messages left on telephone answering machines (Buzzanell, Burrell, Stafford, and Berkowitz, 1996)".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}} The theory tends to be heuristic because it is "expansive enough to be complete, and has been supported by research from diverse authors". "The theory's core processes of convergence and divergence make it relatively easy to understand, underscoring the simplicity of the theory".{{sfn|McGraw|2004}}

==Intergenerational communications==

Researchers of communication accommodation theory who have been interested in conversations between the elderly and the young, actively apply this theory to analyze intergenerational communication situations. Since the aging of population is becoming a serious issue in current society, communication difficulties of older adults and issues like [[ageism]] should be addressed. According to mainstream sociolinguistic studies, age is regarded as a variable only to the extent that it may show patterns of dialectal variation within speech communities across time. However, the existence of potentially important generational differences relating to beliefs about talk, situational perceptions, interactional goals, and various language devices between the young and the elderly are all taken into account as empirical questions in their own right{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}} when using communication accommodation theory to explore intergenerational communication problems and improve effectiveness. Previous researchers have also developed models such as the communication predicament model of ageing,{{sfn|Ryan|Giles|Bartolucci|Henwood|1986}} and the communication enhancement model of ageing,{{sfn|Ryan|Meredith|MacLean|Orange|1995}} to point out numerous consequences brought by both negative and positive attitudes towards aging.

===Young-to-elderly language strategies===

Even though young people are more likely to perceive the old by multiple stereotypes, the elderly are negatively evaluated in most situations,{{sfn|Hummert|1990}} resulting in a reduction of meaningful communication.To further illustrate this, Ryan ''et al''. devised a typology of four young-to-elderly language strategies{{sfn|Ryan|Giles|Bartolucci|Henwood|1986}} in his research concerning psycho linguistic and social psychological components of communication with the elderly, addressing a problem for the elderly that they are vulnerable to the social and psychological circumstances of isolation, neglect, and negative stereotyping. However, it is not appropriate to see problematic intergenerational talk as a one-sided affair since both the young and the old can be responsible for miscommunication and unsuitable accommodation.

The first of these is characterized as over-accommodation due to physical or sensory handicaps, which happens when speakers talk to handicapped recipients, usually those with hearing impairment, and adapt their speech beyond the optimal level. This is also known as "Elderspeak", a form of baby talk in which a person addresses the elderly in an overly simple and sometimes patronizing way.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The second strategy is labelled as dependency-related over-accommodation, which refers to overbearing, excessively directive and disciplinary speech to the elderly. "It was conjectured that this strategy is encoded as one of the means by which a younger person can control the relationship and induce the elderly individual to become dependent on the former".{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}}

Age-related divergence is the third strategy. This tenet proposes that young speakers may seek to amplify the distinctiveness of their own social group by purposefully acting in ways that differ from their stereotype of old speakers.{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}} Older speakers might be seen as in physical and mental decline; slowing down with age and unable to keep pace with the current social norms. These young speakers, attempting to differentiate themselves from this image, will talk faster, use fashionable colloquialism and slang, and express more "modern" ideas and values in their communication with seniors.

The fourth strategy is intergroup over-accommodation and it is considered one of the most pervasive of young-to-elderly language strategies.  The "simple perception of an addressee's social category membership being old – and, independently of a particular handicap (if any), considerations of dependency and in-group symbolization are sufficient to invoke negative physical, social, and psychological inferences for many younger people".{{sfn|Coupland|Coupland|Giles|Henwood|1988}}

===Communication between old and young people in various relationships===

Giles has studied the interaction of young and elderly persons in business settings using communication accommodation as a theoretical framework. Findings demonstrated that elderly persons tend to be less accommodating than their younger counterparts. Findings also demonstrated that, for example, in business settings, one is much more likely to accommodate and converge to the language of a superior, such as a manager, than to someone with less or equal amount of superiority, such as a co-worker.  While several other factors came into play, convergence, and divergence portions of this theory were used in interpreting and explain this phenomenon.{{sfn|McCann|Giles|2006}}

The prevalence of and consequences for ageism and ageist language in intergenerational interactions in health care contexts such as hospitals and long-term care facilities have also been discussed.{{sfn|Nussbaum|Pitts|Huber|Krieger|2005}} Factors such as negative ageist stereotypes and unique features of the older adult patient-physician interaction can result in miscommunication between physicians and patients.{{sfn|Nussbaum|Pecchioni|Crowell|2001}} Moreover, individuals are more likely to use patronizing language styles,{{sfn|Hummert|Shaner|Garstka|Henry|1998}} to evaluate patronizing communication positively, and less likely to respond assertively to ageist language in hospital settings than in community dwellings.{{sfn|Hummert|Mazloff|2001}} In the domain of mental health care for older individuals, research also suggests that the elderly are systematically disadvantaged when interacting with mental health professionals.{{sfn|Ivey|Wieling|Harris|2000}}

==Intercultural communications==

Since communication accommodation theory applies to both interpersonal and inter-group communication one of the fields in which it has been most applied has been in [[intercultural communication]]. Within this field it has been applied to explain and analyze communication behaviors in a variety of situations, such as interactions between non-native and natives during second language acquisition processes, and interactions between inter-ethnic groups.

Studies{{sfn|Dörnyei|Csizér|2005}} show the comparison of communication accommodation in foreign countries between tourists and locals. In countries with heavy tourism, many being [[Third World]], it is common that the actual tourists have little to no competency in, or desire of having competency in the language and style of communication of the local natives. On the other hand, the country's local economy as well as the livelihood of its citizens, heavily depends on these tourists. Therefore, there is a great need to accommodate the communication styles of the tourists.

==Communication between native and non-native language speakers in second language acquisition==

===Non-native language speakers===

The input that [[non-native speakers]] (NNS) obtain from their interlocutors during [[second language acquisition]] is crucial in their process of language learning.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  For instance, as the similarity attraction theory predicts, non-native speakers (NNS) are more likely to converge towards the [[native speaker]]'s (NS) language when they identify him or her as similar to themselves: "When an NNS and an NS share important social identities, ethnic or not, the NNS will be more likely to converge towards the NS's language use".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  In a study conducted by Young (1998) for instance, high [[Language proficiency|proficiency]] Chinese English Language Second Speakers interviewed by individuals with a higher degree of social convergence in terms of ethnicity, sex, occupation, educational level, place of origin, and age were significantly more likely to converge to their interlocutor's standard English plural conjunction than those who were interviewed by subjects that differed more in terms of these social characteristics.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  Unlike previous studies that focussed mostly in ethnic solidarity to explain language variations in second language learners (Beebe and Zuengler, 1983), this later study proved that "it is not interlocutor ethnicity alone that causes linguistic variation, but a collection of attributes (of which one is ethnicity) by which interlocutors assess their relative similarity to each other... providing clear support for the similarity-attraction aspect of CAT".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}

On the other hand, like the inter-group distinctiveness theory argues, several studies have revealed that when second language learners feel their social identity is threatened due to patronizing behavior towards their ethnic group they are more likely to engage in divergence. In a study conducted by Zuengler (1982) amongst Spanish and Greek speakers learning English, subjects were asked both ethnically threatening and neutral questions by a native English speaker. Those subjects that answered the ethnic-threatening question in a more personal form were noted to decrease the "native English-like pronunciations of the sounds" in their answers.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} Similar results were obtained in a study conducted by Giles and Bourhis conducted in Wales.  In this study Welshmen with strong ties to their nation and their language who were learning Welsh were asked questions about methods of second language acquisition.  In this study the questions were asked by an English speaker with an RP-sounding accent "...who at one point arrogantly challenged their reasons for what he called "... a dying language which had a dismal future."{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}  In response to this question, which greatly threatened their identity and intergroup distinctiveness, the informants diverged considerably by strengthening their Welsh accents and using Welsh.{{sfn|Giles|St. Clair|1979}}

===Native language speakers===

Native language speakers frequently engage in "foreign talk" (FT) when interacting with second language learners. In this type of talk native speakers adopt features such as "slower speech rates, shorter and simpler sentence, more question and question tags, greater pronunciation articulation" amongst others.{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} This is done to increase efficiency, especially when the native speakers perceive the non-native speakers as less competent communicators,{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}} or (as the similarity-attraction theory predicts) to increase attraction.  Foreign talk often contains features that mirror the mistakes made by non-native speakers in order to make speech more similar, and hence "NS may include ungrammatical features in their FT".{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}  As predicted by the inter-group distinctiveness theory, native speakers might also choose to refrain from engaging in FT or might use divergence, whenever they wish to maintain group distinctiveness, either because they have a lower perception of the other group, they feel threatened by them, or they wish to display [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentricity]].{{sfn|Zuengler|1991}}

== Immigrants ==

Immigrants tend to converge according to what they perceive to be the prototypical behaviors of their new group, or according to the norms that they infer make part of their new environment.{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}} Meanwhile, their new communities "also may hold norms, about how immigrants do and/or should use the majority language" and "convergence that is perceived by members of the host community as inappropriate to the speaker's status, the relationship, or the norms of the situation, may be labelled as ingratiating, condescending or gauche".{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}} This might lead to a negative appraisal of the immigrant speaker. For this reasons, Gallois and Callan  (1991) suggest that it is important to teach immigrants about the norms that govern convergence in each community. Although other personal motives govern immigrant's linguistic choices later on, their expectations and the situational norms that they are able to perceive are what guide their linguistic choices when they are new to a culture.{{sfn|Gallois|Callan|1991}}

== Family communication dynamics and sexual identity ==
A research paper uses the basis of the Communication Accommodation Theory along with Intergroup Communication and relational Satisfaction to explain the perception of a family towards homosexuality and how family communication dynamics are impacted when one of the family member has a different sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=9&amp;sid=535c088a-c36c-43bc-bf22-479d73c3d4e3@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Off-campus Access Login|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the study was conducted to understand how to parent such a child and the consequences of disclosure on the communication in the family. Sexual identity can be a challenging discussion for a family and revealing one's preferred identity led to topic avoidance under intergroup anxiety and the relational satisfaction was negatively viewed. Such a constrained communication made the individuals feel that their relationship with the family member was less fulfilling and eventually less satisfying.

==New media==
As communication accommodation theory explains "the cognitions and motivations that underlie interactants' communication" with context and identity salience,{{sfn|Jones| Watson|Gardner|Gallois|2006}} it's feasible to apply it to new media related settings. Even though research in this field is still at its early stage, interesting case studies have appeared in recent years.
Studies have investigated possible accommodative tendencies of librarians when faced with cyberlanguage use by the patron through instant messaging technology. Since use of cyberlanguage in VRS (virtual reference services) conversations has been suggested as one possible way to strengthen patron relations, patrons who are satisfied with their interaction with a librarian who use cyberlanguage may be more willing to return. However, the result suggests that patron's use of cyberlanguage has no influence on a librarian's use of cyberlanguage and surprisingly convergence doesn't happen.{{sfn|Christopherson| 2011}} Nevertheless, accommodation of communication styles do happen in other [[computer-mediated communication]] circumstances. In group [[brainstorming]] conversations, Chinese participants are likely to become as responsive as Americans when working in mixed-culture groups and more talkative when using lean medium.{{sfn|Wang|Fussell|Setlock| 2009}} The use of new media provides users an opportunity to more quickly provide or gather information without new or additional disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garrett|first=R. Kelly|last2=Danziger|first2=James N.|date=October 2007|title=IM = Interruption Management? Instant Messaging and Disruption in the Workplace|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=13|pages=23–42|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===Police officers===

Giles has also looked at the actions and attitudes in the public's interaction with [[police officer]]s, using accommodation theory.  Relational and identity aspects of this theory help to illustrate the interaction patterns that exist between the public and the police in the various situations in which these interaction take place.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  This study looked at both the accommodation patterns of the officers and the public with whom they were dealing.

In this case of policemen and accommodation, it is important for men and women of the force to find a stable balance between accommodating (displaying care, empathy, respect etc.,) and keeping a firm stance of authority. Studies show that the public believes policemen, overall, should work on being more community oriented and accommodating to all of its citizens, not only to reduce tension, anxiety, and stress, but to build trust and satisfaction between both parties. There are current, as well as up-and-coming community-based police programs to give citizens a more "informal", "down to earth", view of their commanding officers. However, even with all of these accommodations being made, it is necessary for there to remain an understanding of the higher power, so that in the case in life-threatening situations, men and women of the police force can continue to actively and effectively uphold society

===Pharmacists===

From November 2015 to April 2016, a study was conducted to observe the communication between pharmacists and patients during medication counseling sessions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chevalier|first1=Bernadette A. M.|last2=Watson|first2=Bernadette M.|last3=Barras|first3=Michael A.|last4=Cottrell|first4=William Neil|title=Investigating strategies used by hospital pharmacists to effectively communicate with patients during medication counselling|journal=Health Expectations|date=October 2017|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1121–1132|doi=10.1111/hex.12558}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was conducted in order to understand what is occurring during these exchanges. "Twelve pharmacists engaged four patients each for a total of 48 medication counselling interactions that took place".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During each session, the pharmacists were recorded by one of the main researchers, another pharmacist with no ties to the other pharmacists. In each recording, the main researcher (referred to as BC) specifically searched for five strategies of CAT: approximation, interpretability, discourse management, emotional expression and interpersonal control.

* "Approximation concerns how individuals adjust their speech patterns".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Speech in approximation can converge or diverge from the patient, but is appropriately applied with convergence
* "Interpretability strategies focus on each speaker's conversational competence".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the speaker communicates in a way to ensure the speaker understands the content of the message.
* "Discourse management strategies involve conversation processes to promote conversation between interactants".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This involves using nonverbal or verbal cues to signal a person to speak or change the subject accordingly. 
* Emotional expression demonstrates "empathy and reassurance".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Interpersonal control focuses on the roles and power relations between speakers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This strategy of CAT establishes common ground between the speakers in a form of equality.

Upon conclusion of this study, it was shown that most of the pharmacists used the five CAT strategies during their social exchanges with the patients; however, the presentations of discourse varied by pharmacist.

===''Speak Arabic please!'' A case study in communication accommodation ===

In Sonia S'hiri's ''Speak Arabic please!'': [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]] Arabic Speakers' Linguistic Accommodation to Middle Easterners" she describes how speakers of Tunisian Arabic converge to the "[[Arabic language|Sharqi]]" or " Middle Eastern Arabic" of their co-workers.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

One of the many ways to divide the [[Arab]] world is between the West ''[[Maghreb]]'' and the East ''Sharq''.  Though there is no official ''Sharqi Arabic'', the varieties usually associated with Sharqi Arabic are [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine]], and [[Persian Gulf/Iraqi Arabic]].  Due to [[Egypt]]'s dominance of the media and arts, the "Sharqi" Arabic spoken in the region has come to be perceived by Tunisians, as "lighter", more poetic and artistic, more humorous, more romantic and even more beautiful than the local [Tunisian] variety.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}  Again, because of its dominance in the media and the arts, Arabic speakers throughout the Arab world are much more familiar with "Sharqi" varieties than they are with "Maghrebi" varieties.  A common yet incorrect belief about speech interactions in the Arab speaking world is that when speakers of different varieties of the language come into contact with one another, the default language for communication is [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (Fusha).

In her study conducted in London, S'hiri examined the social reasons for Tunisian Arabs to converge linguistically to speakers of "Sharqi Arabic".  The data she found also gave ample evidence to show that code-switching into pure Fusha for communication is a misconception.  S'hiri recorded five Tunisian Arabic speakers (M1, M2, W1, W2, and W3) who worked at two different broadcasting companies and found that they did indeed converge linguistically to their Sharqi co-workers.  They did not however, resort solely to Fusha.  S'hiri found that when interacting with speakers of "Sharqi" Arabic, her Tunisian informants used linguistic features and [[Word|lexical items]] characteristic of the "Sharqi" variety, some English words, (instead of the [[French language|French]] words often used in Tunisian Arabic speech) in addition to switching to Fusha.  S'hiri found that many of her informants were proud of both their Tunisian variety of Arabic as well as their ability converge linguistically and even posits the idea of "showing off" as a goal of linguistic convergence".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} Her findings lead to an interesting sort of paradox. Although the Tunisian Arabs abandon their own variety of the language, they do not experience a feeling of loss of identity, because the ability to code-switch, perceived as prestigious in their culture, makes part of their positive identity. Despite their inner feelings of pride for their own group, by accommodating to the Sharqi speakers the Tunisians are setting aside their ingoup identity in order to "promote their extended ethnicity as members of an Arab nation instead of just as Tunisians".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} In terms of accommodation theory, Tunisians in [[London]] can be seen as the "ingroup" trying to assimilate to the "outgroup".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

When her informants were asked why they had switched to the "Sharqi" variety, they all agreed it was psychologically motivating, because it allowed them to get closer to their interlocutors.   M1 added that this allowed him to convey friendliness to his interlocutors, to reduce differences and avoid rejection.{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} Informant W2 "Found that using TA [Tunisian Arabic] is an obstacle to getting closer to people.  She felt excluded especially at the beginning since Sharqis seemed to avoid her because they believed she would be difficult to understand".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}} W2 also "Claims that the level of readiness of Sharqis to understand her determines whether she uses TA with them or not.  She wants to avoid ridicule".{{sfn|S'hiri|2002}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Distance decay''' is a [[Human geography|geographical]] term which describes the effect of [[distance]] on cultural or spatial [[interaction]]s.  The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-[[abandoned railway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in [[communications technology]], such as telegraphs, telephones, [[broadcasting]], and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692313000653 | doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.04.001 | volume=31 | title=Boots are made for walking: interactions across physical and social space in infrastructure-poor regions | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Transport Geography | pages=226–235 | author=Matous Petr, Todo Yasuyuki, Mojo Dagne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance decay is graphically represented by a curving line that swoops [[convex function|concavely]] downward as distance along the x-axis increases.  Distance decay can be mathematically represented as an [[Inverse-square law]] by the expression

&lt;math&gt;I = const. \times d^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; 
or
&lt;math&gt;I \propto 1/d^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where I is interaction and d is distance. It can take other forms such as [[Exponential decay|negative exponential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nekola J. C., White P. S. | year = 1999 | title = The distance decay of similarity in biogeography and ecology | url = http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/ecoinfo/distance_decay/nekolapeter.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 867–878 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00305.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

&lt;math&gt;I \propto e^{-d}&lt;/math&gt;
.

Distance decay is evident in town/[[city centre]]s. It can refer to various things which decline with greater distance from the center of the [[Central Business District]] (CBD):
* density of [[pedestrian]] traffic
* street quality 
* quality of shops (depending on definitions of 'quality' and 'center')
* height of buildings 
* [[bid rent theory|price of land]]

Distance decay weighs into the decision to migrate, leading many [[Human migration|migrants]] to move less far.

== Related concepts ==

Related terms include "[[friction of distance]]", which describes the force that creates distance decay and [[Waldo R. Tobler]]'s "[[Tobler's first law of geography|First law of geography]]", an informal statement that "All things are related, but near things are more related than far things." 
"[[Loss of Strength Gradient]]" holds that the amount of a nation's military power that could be brought to bear in any part of the world depends on geographic distance.

==History==

The environmental movement has its roots in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtmultipleuse.org/endangered/esahistory.htm |title=History of Environmentalism |publisher=Mtmultipleuse.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892 after successfully lobbying Congress to create [[Yosemite National Park]].

The modern environmental movement began in the mid-to-late 1960s.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"/&gt; Environmental problems had been illustrated in books such as [[Silent Spring]] and there was a [[back-to-the-land movement]], closely associated with the [[Hippie movement]] and [[Counterculture]].

By the 1990s, the need for [[green technology]] was realized, and the development of [[electric cars]] and [[alternative energy]] gradually began to become mainstream. In the first decades of the 21st century, significant progress has been made. The first new electric cars were released to the public in 2010, and environmentalism has gone from being fringe to being completely mainstream, even embraced by [[Conservatism|conservative]] institutions such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==New technologies==

Many environmentally friendly technologies, such as electric cars, [[solar power]], [[geothermal energy]], [[wind power]], [[vertical farming]], [[recycling]], [[permaculture]], [[hydroponics]], [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] technology such as [[fluorescent lighting]] and [[LEDs]] and [[high-speed rail]] have been implemented or have become mainstream in Western nations since 1980. Developing nations have also embraced these technologies, and China has become the world's leading manufacturer of wind turbines and solar-electric panels in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/business/energy-environment/31renew.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=China Leading Global Race to Make Clean Energy « |publisher=nytimes.org |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17955">'''Expectancy-value theory''' has been developed in many different fields including education, health, communications, marketing and economics. Although the model differs in its meaning and implications for each field, the general idea is that there are expectations as well as values or beliefs that affect subsequent behavior.

==Education model==

===History and model overview===
[[John William Atkinson]] developed the expectancy-value theory in the 1950s and 1960s in an effort to understand the achievement motivation of individuals.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"&gt;Eccles, J. (1983). Expectancies, values, and academic behaviors. In J. T. Spence (Ed.), Achievement and achievement motives: Psychological and sociological approaches (pp. 75-146). San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[Jacquelynne Eccles]] expanded this research into the field of education.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; According to expectancy-value theory, students' achievement and achievement related choices are most proximally determined by two factors,&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; expectancies for success, and subjective task values. Expectancies refer to how confident an individual is in his or her ability to succeed in a task whereas task values refer to how important, useful, or enjoyable the individual perceives the task. Theoretical&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt;  and empirical;&lt;ref name="Nagengast2011"&gt;Nagengast, B., Marsh, H. W., Scalas, L. F., Xu, M. K., Hau, K. T., &amp; Trautwein, U. (2011). Who took the "×" out of expectancy-value theory? A psychological mystery, a substantive-methodological synergy, and a cross-national generalization. Psychological Science, 22(8), 1058-1066.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trautwein2012"&gt;Trautwein, U., Marsh, H. W., [[Nagengast, B.]], Lüdtke, O., Nagy, G., &amp; Jonkmann, K. (2012). Probing for the multiplicative term in modern expectancy–value theory: A latent interaction modeling study. Journal of educational psychology, 104(3), 763-777.&lt;/ref&gt; work suggests that expectancies and values interact to predict important outcomes such as engagement, continuing interest, and academic achievement.  Other factors, including demographic characteristics, [[Stereotype|stereotypes]], prior experiences, and perceptions of others' beliefs and behaviors affect achievement related outcomes indirectly through these expectancies and values. This model has most widely been applied and used in research in the field of education.

===Expectancies===
Expectancies are specific beliefs individuals have regarding their success on certain tasks they will carry out in the short-term future or long-term future.&lt;ref name="EcclesWig2002"&gt;Eccles, J. S. &amp; Wigfield, A. (2002). Motivational beliefs, values, and goals. Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 109-132.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectancies an individual has shaped their behaviors as well as the choices they make. For example, a high school student might believe that they really struggle on standardized tests. This leads them to expect that they will perform poorly on the SAT. These beliefs then impact their actual performance on the SAT. These expectancies are tied to concepts such as self-concept and self-efficacy. [[Self-concept]] is a broad concept that involves one's beliefs about their own abilities to reach their goals.&lt;ref name="BongSkaalvik203"&gt;Bong, M. &amp; Skaalvik, E.M. (2003). Academic self-concept and self-efficacy: How different are they really?. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 15(1), 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self-efficacy]] is similar in an academic context, because it involves one's beliefs about their abilities and competence; however, it is specific to certain domains, such as math and history.&lt;ref name="BongSkaalvik203"/&gt;

===Subjective task values===

According to Eccles and colleagues&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; subjective task value can be thought of the motivation that allows an individual to answer the question "Do I Want to do This Activity and Why?"&lt;ref name="WigCam2010A"&gt;Wigfield. A., Cambria. J., "Student's achievement values, goal orientations, and interest: Definitions, development, and relations to achievement outcomes, " ''Developmental Review'' 30, 2010, 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective task values can be broken into four subcategories:&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; Attainment Value (Importance for identity or self), Intrinsic Value (Enjoyment or Interest), Utility Value (Usefulness or Relevance), and Cost(loss of time, overly-high effort demands, loss of valued alternatives, or negative psychological experiences such as stress). Traditionally, attainment value and intrinsic value are more highly correlated. What's more, these two constructs tend to be related to intrinsic motivation, interest, and task persistence.&lt;ref name="Hulleman2008"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., Durik, A. M., Schweigert, S. B., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2008). Task values, achievement goals, and interest: An integrative analysis. Journal of Educational Psychology, 100(2), 398-416&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, utility value has both intrinsic and extrinsic components.&lt;ref name="SD&amp;W2004"&gt;Simons, J., Dewitte, S., &amp; Lens, W. (2004). The role of different types of instrumentality in motivation, study strategies, and performance: know why you learn, so you'll know what you learn! The British journal of educational psychology, 74(Pt 3), 343-60. doi:10.1348/0007099041552314&lt;/ref&gt; and has been related to both intrinsic and extrinsic outcomes such as course performance and interest.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2009). Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes. Science, 326(5958), 1410-1412&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that utility value has time-dependent characteristics as well.&lt;ref name="H&amp;L1999"&gt;Husman, J., &amp; Lens, W. (1999). The role of the future in student motivation. Educational Psychologist, 34(2), 113-125&lt;/ref&gt; Cost has been relatively neglected in the empirical research;&lt;ref name="WigCam2010A"/&gt; however, the construct has received some attention more recently.&lt;ref name="Luttrell2010"&gt;Luttrell, V. R., Callen, B. W., Allen, C. S., Wood, M. D., Deeds, D. G., &amp; Richard, D. C. (2010). The mathematics value inventory for general education students: Development and initial validation. Educational and Psychological measurement, 70(1), 142-160.&lt;/ref&gt; Feather combined subjective task values with more universal human values&lt;ref name="WE&amp;T2004"&gt;Wigfield, A., Tonks, S., &amp; Eccles, J. S. (2004). Expectancy-value theory in cross-cultural perspective. In D. M. McInerney &amp; S. Van Etten (Eds.), Research on sociocultural influences on motivation and learning, volume 4: Big theories revisited (pp. 165-198). Greenwich, CT: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that the former are just one type of general human motives that help to direct behavior.

===Applications===

====Developmental trajectories====
Researchers have found that expectancies and values can be distinguished as separate types of motivation as early as 6 years old.&lt;ref name="WigCam2010B"&gt;Wigfield, A., &amp; Cambria, J. (2010). Expectancy-value theory: Retrospective and prospective. Advances in motivation and achievement, 16, 35-70&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, types of value (e.g., attainment vs. utility) can be distinguished within an academic domain as early as fifth grade.&lt;ref name = "WigCam2010B"/&gt; Generally speaking, Eccles and colleagues&lt;ref name="Eccles1983" /&gt; implicate a wide array of different factors that determine an individual's expectancies and values, including: 
* the cultural milieu
* socializer's beliefs and behaviors
* differential aptitudes of the individual
* previous achievement-related experiences
* individual perceptions of social beliefs
* individual's interpretations of experiences
* affective memories
* general goals
* self-concepts
Experts agree that student motivation tends to decline throughout their time in school.&lt;ref name="EcclesWig2002"/&gt; Longitudinal research has confirmed this general trend of motivational decline and also demonstrated that motivation is domain specific.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2002"&gt;Jacobs, J. E., Lanza, S., Osgood, D. W., Eccles, J. S., &amp; Wigfield, A. (2002). Changes in children's self-competence and values: Gender and domain differences across grades one through twelve. Child development, 73(2), 509-527&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also demonstrated that there are gender differences in motivation.&lt;ref name="Eccles1983"/&gt; Motivation decline is particularly steep for Math achievement, but less so for reading or sports domains among both boys and girls.&lt;ref name="Jacobs2002"/&gt; Researchers offer two general explanations for these declines in motivation.&lt;ref name="WE&amp;T2004"/&gt; The first is that students' conceptualizations of different domains become more complex and nuanced—they differentiate between subdomains, which results in an appearance of mean-level decrease. In fact, children as young as 11 years old have demonstrated that they can differentiate between academic domains.&lt;ref name="WigCam2010B"/&gt; The second is that the focus of their environment changes as they age. As students reach higher grades, the focus shifts from learning to achievement. In fact, a large body of research exists showing that shifts from learning to performance as an educational focus can be detrimental to student motivation.&lt;ref name="Hulleman2010"&gt;Hulleman, C. S., Schrager, S. M., Bodmann, S. M., &amp; Harackiewicz, J. M. (2010). A meta-analytic review of achievement goal measures: Different labels for the same constructs or different constructs with similar labels?. Psychological bulletin, 136(3), 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interventions====
Expectancy-value theory constructs can and have been applied to intervention programs that strive to change motivational beliefs. These interventions are able to increase expectancy&lt;ref name ="Blackwell2007"&gt;Blackwell, L. S., Trzesniewski, K. H., &amp; Dweck, C. S. (2007). Implicit theories of intelligence predict achievement across an adolescent transition: A longitudinal study and an intervention. Child development, 78(1), 246-263.&lt;/ref&gt; and value&lt;ref name = "Hulleman2010"/&gt; or decrease cost.&lt;ref name = "R&amp;B2011"&gt;Ramirez, G., &amp; Beilock, S. L. (2011). Writing about testing worries boosts exam performance in the classroom. science, 331(6014), 211-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Such interventions not only target motivation, but also ultimately increase general student achievement and help to close traditionally problematic achievement gaps.&lt;ref name = "H&amp;H2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Good2003"&gt;Good, C., Aronson, J., &amp; Inzlicht, M. (2003). Improving Adolescents' Standardized Test Performance: An Intervention to Reduce the Effects of Stereotype Threat. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 24, 645-662.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, value- focused interventions have been developed to help teachers design their curriculum in ways that allow students to see the connections between the material they learn in the classroom and their own lives.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"/&gt; Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes.&lt;ref name ="H&amp;H2009"/&gt; This intervention is able to boost student's performance and interest, particularly for students who have low initial expectancy. According to the expectancy-value theory, this intervention is effective because it increases students interest in the material.&lt;ref name="H&amp;H2009"/&gt;

==Psychology, health, communications, marketing, and economics model==
Expectancy-value theory was originally created in order to explain and predict individual's attitudes toward objects and actions. Originally the work of [[psychologist]] [[Martin Fishbein]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}, the [[theory]] states that attitudes are developed and modified based on assessments about beliefs and values. Primarily, the theory attempts to determine the [[Mind|mental]] [[calculation]]s that take place in attitude development. Expectancy-value theory has been used to develop other theories and is still utilized today in numerous fields of study.

===History===
Dr. Martin Fishbein is credited with developing the expectancy-value theory (EVT) in the early to mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It is sometimes referred to as Fishbein's expectancy-value theory or simply expectancy-value model. The primary work typically cited by scholars referring to EVT is Martin Fishbein and [[Icek Ajzen]]'s 1975 book called ''Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research''. The seed work of EVT can be seen in Fishbein's doctoral dissertation, ''A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation of the Interrelation between Belief about an Object and the Attitude toward that Object'' (1961, UCLA) and two subsequent articles in 1962 and 1963 in the journal ''Human Relations''. Fishbein's work drew on the writings of researchers such as Ward Edwards, [[Milton J. Rosenberg]], Edward Tolman, and [[John B. Watson]].

===Concepts===
EVT has three basic components. First, individuals respond to novel information about an item or action by developing a belief about the item or action. If a belief already exists, it can and most likely will be modified by new information. Second, individuals assign a value to each attribute that a belief is based on. Third, an expectation is created or modified based on the result of a calculation based on beliefs and values. For example, a student finds out that a professor has a reputation for being humorous. The student assigns a positive value to humor in the classroom, so the student has the expectation that their experience with the professor will be positive. When the student attends class and finds the professor humorous, the student calculates that it is a good class. EVT also states that the result of the calculation, often called the "attitude", stems from complex equations that contain many belief/values pairs. Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) represented the theory with the following equation where attitudes (a) are a factorial function of beliefs (b) and values (v).

Theory of Reasoned Action:
Formula
In its simplest form, the TRA can be expressed as the following equation:
&lt;math&gt;BI {{=}} (AB)W_1 + (SN)W_2&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;BI&lt;/math&gt; = behavioral intention

&lt;math&gt;(AB)&lt;/math&gt; = one's attitude toward performing the behavior

&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = empirically derived weights

&lt;math&gt;SN&lt;/math&gt; = one's subjective norm related to performing the behavior

(Source: Hale, 2002)

===Current usage===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fishbein and Ajzen expanded expectancy-value theory into the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA). Later Ajzen posited the [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) in his book ''Attitudes, Personality, and Behavior'' (1988). Both TRA and TPB address predictive and explanatory weaknesses with EVT and are still prominent theories in areas such as health communication research, marketing, and economics. Although not used as much since the early 1980s, EVT is still utilized in research within fields as diverse as audience research (Palmgreen &amp; Rayburn, 1985) advertising (Shoham, Rose, &amp; Kahle 1998; Smith &amp; Vogt, 1995), child development (Watkinson, Dwyer, &amp; Nielsen, 2005), education (Eklof, 2006; Ping, McBride, &amp; Breune, 2006), health communication (Purvis Cooper, Burgoon, &amp; Roter, 2001; Ludman &amp; Curry, 1999), and organization communication (Westaby, 2002).

Professional development for educators may include [[teacher training]], and is usually considered pre-service, or before beginning teaching. However faculty development ''and'' professional development may both be used to refer to on-going professional learning for educators. Such learning may take place during work hours, such as "in-service" within K-12 settings, or it may be beyond work hours. These learning pursuits may be for credit or noncredit; therefore they may be with a college or university, through a school district, or private consulting agency. Additionally educators may pursue [[self-directed learning]] professional development, although the term faculty development is less commonly applied to this scope of activity.

K-12 faculty development and professional development and higher education faculty development and professional development have very different traditions, practices and terminologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/606752555|title=Keeping pace with technology, vol. 1 : the promise and potential for k-12 educators|last=King|first=Kathleen P.|publisher=Hampton Press|year=2002|isbn=1572734329|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=|oclc=606752555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954710961|title=Keeping pace with technology, vol. 2 : the challenge and promise for higher education faculty|last=King|first=Kathleen P.|publisher=Hampton Press|year=2003|isbn=157273471X|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=|oclc=954710961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education faculty development is beginning to take place not just face-to-face but also online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenthal|first=Patrick R.|date=September 2008|title=Online Faculty Development and Storytelling: An Unlikely Solution to Improving Teacher Quality|url=http://jolt.merlot.org/vol4no3/lowenthal_0908.pdf|journal=MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching|volume=4|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fanfare''''' is an American bimonthly magazine devoted to reviewing recorded music in all playback formats. It mainly covers [[classical music]], but since inception, has also featured a [[jazz]] column in every issue.

==History and profile==
''Fanfare'' was founded on 1 September 1977 "as a labor of love"&lt;ref name=Rockwell/&gt; by an elementary-school teacher turned editor named Joel Bruce Flegler (born 1941).  After {{age|1977|09|01}} years, he is still the publisher.&lt;ref name=Rockwell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laffler, William D. (31 August 1980). "Born on a Shoestring". ''[[The Times (Trenton)|The Trenton Evening Times]]'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine now runs to over 600 pages in a 6" x 9" format with about 80% of the editorial copy devoted to record reviews, and a front section with a substantial number of interviews and feature articles.&lt;ref&gt;''Fanfare''. January/February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It avoids [[Audio equipment testing|equipment]] and [[pop music]] coverage and manages to include reviews of many more classical releases than is typical for other magazines in this genre.&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;Rockwell, John (29 June 1980). [https://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/29/archives/the-new-crop-of-music-magazines.html?sq=fanfare%2520magazine&amp;scp=1&amp;st=cse "The New Crop of Music Magazines"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael (20 December 1987). [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/arts/the-tempo-is-changing-for-music-magazines.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm "The Tempo is Changing for Music Magazines"]. ''The New York Times''. "The most prolific at [reviewing classical records] now is Fanfare magazine…."&lt;/ref&gt; Subscriptions include online access to current content and archives of past issues.&lt;ref name=FanfareOnline&gt;[http://www.fanfaremag.com/ ''Fanfare'' website]. Retrieved 15 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fanfare'''s editorial contributors have a range of expertise from the medieval to contemporary work.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Describing itself as "the magazine for serious record collectors", its reviews cover not only the quality of live performance, but also that of sound and recording.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A '''fuzzy cognitive map''' is a [[cognitive map]] within which the relations between the elements (e.g. concepts, events, project resources) of a "mental landscape" can be used to compute the "strength of impact" of these elements.  Fuzzy cognitive maps were introduced by [[Bart Kosko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Bart Kosko]]|title=''Fuzzy Cognitive Maps''|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|volume=24|date=1986|pages=65-75|url=http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/FCM.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060902033901/http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/Virtual_Worlds_FCM.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; Ron Axelrod introduced cognitive maps as a formal way of representing social scientific knowledge and modeling [[decision making]] in social and political systems, then brought in the computation [[fuzzy logic]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Details==
Fuzzy cognitive maps are signed fuzzy [[directed graph|digraph]]s.  They may look at [[first blush]] like [[Hasse diagram]]s but they are not.
[[Spreadsheet]]s or tables are used to map FCMs into [[matrix (Mathematics)|matric]]es for further computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.FCMappers.net/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=53 |title=FCMapper - our Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping Software Solution |website=Fcmappers.net |date=2016-01-27 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ochoadeaspuru.com/fuzcogmap/index.php |title=Fuzzy Cognitive Maps |website=Ochoadeaspuru.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfcm.megadix.it/ |title=JFCM - Java Fuzzy Cognitive Maps |website=Jfcm.megadix.it |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FCM is a technique used for causal knowledge acquisition and representation, it supports causal knowledge reasoning process and belong to the neuro-fuzzy system that aim at solving decision making problems, modeling and simulate [[complex system]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2012.01.015 |title= Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for Artificial Emotions Forecasting |journal=Applied Soft Computing |volume=12 |issue=2 |page=3704-3710 |year=2012 |first1=Jose L. |last1=Salmeron }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Learning algorithms  have been proposed for training and updating FCMs weights mostly based on ideas coming from the field of [[Artificial Neural Network]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.knosys.2016.04.023 |title= Dynamic Optimization of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for Time Series Forecasting |journal= Knowledge-Based Systems |volume=105 |page=29-37 |year=2016 |first1=Jose L. |last1=Salmeron |first2= W. |last2=Froelich}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have gained considerable research interest due to their ability in representing structured knowledge and model complex systems in various fields. This growing interest led to the need for enhancement and making more reliable models that can better represent real situations.
A first simple application of FCMs is described in a book&lt;ref name="confusion"&gt;William R. Taylor: ''[http://www.americanconfusion.com/?p=122 Lethal American Confusion] (How Bush and the Pacifists Each Failed in the War on Terrorism)'', 2006, {{ISBN|0-595-40655-6}} (FCM application in chapter 14) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930103802/http://www.americanconfusion.com/?p=122 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of William R. Taylor, where the war in Afghanistan and Iraq is analyzed. In [[Bart Kosko]]'s book ''Fuzzy Thinking'',&lt;ref name="FuzzyThinking"&gt;Bart Kosko: ''Fuzzy Thinking'', 1993/1995, {{ISBN|0-7868-8021-X}} (Chapter 12: Adaptive Fuzzy Systems)''&lt;/ref&gt; several Hasse diagrams illustrate the use of FCMs. As an example, one FCM quoted from Rod Taber&lt;ref name="Drugs"&gt;Rod Taber: ''Knowledge Processing with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps'', Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 2, no. 1, 83-87, 1991 ([[:de:Bild:FCMdrug520.png|Hasse diagram]] in German Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt; describes 11 factors of the American cocaine market and the relations between these factors. For computations, Taylor uses pentavalent logic (scalar values out of {-1,-0.5,0,+0.5,+1}). That particular map of Taber uses [[trivalent logic]] (scalar values out of {-1,0,+1}). Taber et al. also illustrate the dynamics of map fusion and give a theorem on the convergence of combination in a related article.&lt;ref name='Medical'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/int.20185 |title=Quantization effects on the equilibrium behavior of combined fuzzy cognitive maps |journal=International Journal of Intelligent Systems |volume=22 |issue=2 |page=181 |year=2007 |last1=Taber |first1=Rod |last2=Yager |first2=Ronald R. |last3=Helgason |first3=Cathy M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Girls Who Code''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] which aims to support and increase the number of women in [[computer science]]. The organization is working to close the gender employment difference in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like. They have a 7-week Summer Immersion Program, a 2-week specialized Campus Program, after school Clubs, and a 13-book [[The New York Times|New York Times]] best-selling series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2017/09/10/childrens-middle-grade-hardcover/|title=Children’s Middle Grade Hardcover Books - Best Sellers - September 10, 2017 - The New York Times|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to inspire, educate, and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities.

==Summary==
Girls Who Code was founded by [[Reshma Saujani]] in 2012 who came up with the idea of creating the organization during her run for the [[United States Congress]] when she noticed that schools along her campaign route lacked girls in computer science classrooms.&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2014"/&gt; The organization runs programs during the academic year teaching high school girls computing skills like [[computer programming|programming]], [[robotics]], and [[web design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/reshma-saujanis-ambitious-plan-for-technology-1415237831 |title= Reshma Saujani’s Ambitious Plan for Technology |date= November 5, 2014 |accessdate= February 14, 2015 |first= Christopher |last= Ross |work= Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "One Million"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/girls-who-code-leading-charge-for-women-in-computer-science/ |title= Aiming for 1 million "Girls Who Code" |date= December 11, 2014 |accessdate= February 15, 2015 |work= CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; with sessions including projects and trips to companies like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="USA TODAY 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=No boys allowed: Girls Who Code takes on gender gap | website=USA TODAY | date=August 15, 2014  | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/08/12/girls-who-code-facebook-sheryl-sandberg/13784445/ | accessdate=February 15, 2015|author= Guynn, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tc&gt;{{cite web |url= https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/14/girls-who-code-expands-to-get-more-young-women-in-computer-science-majors/ |title= Girls Who Code Expands To Get More Young Women In Computer Science Majors |work= Tech Crunch |date= December 14, 2014 |accessdate= February 15, 2015 |first= Sarah |last= Buhr}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 1500 Girls Who Code clubs across America, with the organization aiming to teach one million girls to code by 2020.&lt;ref name = "One Million"/&gt; By December 2014, three thousand students had completed a Girls Who Code program, 95% of whom went on to major in computer science at university.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3062885/girls-who-code-google-facebook/ |title= Cracking the Girl Code: How to End the Tech Gender Gap |work= Time |date= July 31, 2014 |first= Eliana |last= Dockterman |accessdate= February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As of 2015, only 18% of computer science college graduates are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/cracking-the-code:-why-aren-t-more-women-majoring-in-computer-science|title=Cracking the code: Why aren't more women majoring in computer science?|last=Vu|first=Shana|website=UCLA Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/|title=Girls Who Code - About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Girls Who Code, [[Reshma Saujani]], believes that girls are raised to "be perfect" while boys are raised to "be brave".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Saujani|first=Reshma|title=Teach girls bravery, not perfection|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection?language=en|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reshma Saujani participated in a [[TED (conference)|TED Talk]] where she spoke about the consequences girls face in their future if they don't start taking risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/girls-who-code/teach-girls-bravery-not-perfection-257691d13476#.nd7v6zqso|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks of the tech industry and how she thinks there is a bias towards women in the industry. The company announced that in 2016 the non-profit organization will be expanding to all 50 states- making it the largest computing program for girls in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=the largest computer science program for girls in the U.S.!|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the nonprofit launched a 13-book series with [[Penguin Random House]], including a nonfiction book, Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the World, and several fiction books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/books/coding-children.html|title=Teaching Kids Coding, by the Book|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|date=2017-08-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 2018, Girls Who Code will have reached more than 50,000 girls with their computer science education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://girlswhocode.com/clubs-launch-2017/|title=Girls Who Code free after school Clubs launch for 2017-2018|date=2017-10-04|work=girlswhocode|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's efforts to close the [[gender gaps in mathematics and reading|achievement gender gap]] has resulted in several honors. Saujani was recognized for 'her vision and efforts to close the gender gap in technology'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202771539858/Law-Firm-Awards-Girls-Who-Code-Founder-?slreturn=20161019022429|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==
With the support of their sponsors, Girls Who Code is building the largest pipeline of future female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://girlswhocode.com/partners/|title=Partners - Girls Who Code|last=|first=|date=|work=girlswhocode|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Girls Who Code partnered with [[Accenture]] to work on the future of tech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/cracking-the-gender-code|title=Cracking the Gender Code in Computing - Accenture and Girls Who Code|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They subsequently released a report on recommendations to decrease the gender gap in computing. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://girlswhocode.com/crack-the-code/|title=Cracking the Gender Code - Research from Girls Who Code &amp; Accenture|work=girlswhocode|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls Who Code has also announced they will be releasing an app on the [[Apple App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/10/12/girls-who-code-debuts-app.aspx|title=Girls Who Code Debuts App -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is intended to increase popularity and get more people involved.

[[Dell Technologies]] has partnered with the organization to support after school programs for young girls.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On October 11, 2018, Girls Who Code partnered with [[TikTok]] starting the hashtag #raiseyourhand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/prnewswire/press_releases/New_York/2018/10/08/NY31696|title=Girls Who Code Releases Digital Visual Album Celebrating Sisterhood, Empowering Girls|website=Biz Journals|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The app will be giving US$1 for every video posted using the hashtag with a maximum of $10,000.

[[File:Yongamsa Gwaebul.jpg|thumb|Seoul Tangible Cultural Heritage #363, the Bongwonsa Amita Gwaebul, on display during a festival at Yongamsa Temple in Seoul.]]
'''Gwaebul''' (괘불), meaning "Large Buddhist Banner Painting," are extremely large-scale Buddhist scroll paintings found throughout Korea. They are fairly rare, and only 53 were studied between 1986 and 2001. The paintings are typically brought out only rarely for special festivals or holidays such as [[Buddha's Birthday]] or [[Gwaebul Festival]]s when they are unrolled and hung from tall poles in the temple courtyard. When not in use, ''gwaebul'' are stored un a box behind the altar in a temple hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrich.go.kr/english/page.do?menuIdx=1038|title=RESEARCH ON TRADITIONAL PAINTINGS|last=|first=|date=|website=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status as Cultural Assets ==
Of the known ''gwaebul,'' seven have been designated as [[National Treasure (South Korea)|National Treasures]], 47 as [[Treasures of South Korea|Treasures]], and eight as Registered Cultural Heritage objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cha.go.kr/cha/idx/SubIndex.do?mn=EN|title=Cultural Heritage Administration|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Melli Library.jpg|thumb|left|The northern campus of IPM in Niavaran, where the School of Cognitive Sciences is located.]]
The '''School of Cognitive Sciences''' forms part of the [[Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics]] (IPM) in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. The school was called the '''School of Intelligent Systems''' ('''SIS''') until 2003 when it was renamed to the '''School of Cognitive Sciences'''. The research is predominantly focused on cognitive [[Neuroscience]]. 

The research programs cover diverse areas including [[cognitive neuroscience]], neural modeling, [[psychophysics]], [[linguistics]], [[neural networks]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Since its inception the school has been managed by Prof. [[Caro Lucas]] (School of ECE, [[University of Tehran]]), Prof. Shahin Rouhani (Physics Department, [[Sharif University of Technology]]), [http://www.visionlab.ir/ Prof. Hossein Esteky] (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences) and most recently by Prof. Mojtaba Zarei (Institute for Medical Science and Technology, Shahid Beheshti University).  

The school earned enormous recognition with the publication of the article entitled "Microstimulation of inferotemporal cortex influences face categorization" by Seyed Reza Afraz, Roozbeh Kiani and [http://www.visionlab.ir/ Hossein Esteky] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. The article was published on August 10, 2006.

'''[[Funeral]]s''' in '''[[Islam]]''' (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific [[rite]]s, though they are subject to regional interpretation and variation in custom. In all cases, however, [[sharia]] (Islamic [[religious law]]) calls for [[burial]] of the body as soon as possible, preceded by a simple [[ritual]] involving bathing and shrouding the body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15444275 |title=Who, What, Why: What are the burial customs in Islam?|website= BBC News|date=25 October 2011 |author=Rema Rahman |accessdate= 16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[salah]] (prayer). Burial is usually within 24 hours of death to protect the living from any sanitary issues, except in the case of a person killed in battle or when foul play is suspected; in those cases it is important to determine cause of death before burial. [[Cremation]] of the body is forbidden.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

== Common Islamic burial rituals ==

[[File:白榕蔭堂墓園（白崇禧將軍墓）1.jpg|thumb|Muslim Cemetery in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]]]

Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:&lt;ref name="cul"&gt;Ghamidi (2001),[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html Customs and Behavioral Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923142412/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/janisla2y2.html |date=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collective bathing of the dead body,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih al-Bukhari]] 1254&lt;/ref&gt; except in extraordinary circumstances as in [[battle of Uhud]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari 1346&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shroud|Enshrouding]] dead body in a white cotton or linen cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Muslim]] 943&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Salat al-Janazah|Funeral prayer]] ( صلاة الجنازة ).&lt;ref name="pray"&gt;Ghamidi, [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/DecIslaw2y5.htm Various types of the prayer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923144205/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/DecIslaw2y5.htm |date=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Burial of the dead body in a grave.
* Positioning the deceased so that the head is faced towards [[Mecca]] (Makkah Al-Mukarramah).

===Bathing the deceased===
The [[Cadaver|corpse]] is washed (''[[ghusl]]'', bathed), with the purpose to physically cleanse the deceased. The exact manner: the method, style and accessories used for bathing the corpse may vary by locale and [[Time|temporal]] position, except that it is to be done with heated water. Bathing the dead body is an essential ritual of the [[Sunnah]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]],&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.344 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 344-358] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.344 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore a part of the Islamic Sharia. This should occur as soon as possible after death, preferably within hours.

Orthodox practice is to wash the body an odd number of times (at least once) with a cloth covering its [[awrah]] (parts of the body that should be hidden according to Sharia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesa|first=Baduroon|title=The Washing and Shrouding of the Deceased|url=http://www.aljazeerah.info/Islam/Islamic%20subjects/2004%20subjects/May/The%20Washing%20and%20Shrouding%20of%20the%20Deceased.htm|work=Al-Jazeerah.nfo|publisher=Dr. Hassan Ali El-Najjar|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The "washers" are commonly adult members of the immediate family, who are of the same [[gender]] as the deceased. In cases of violent deaths or accidents, where the deceased has suffered [[Physical trauma|trauma]] or [[mutilation]], [[morgue]] facilities mend the body and wrap it in a shroud to minimise [[fluid]] leakage prior to surrendering it to mourners for washing.

===Enshrouding the deceased===
The corpse is typically wrapped in a simple plain cloth (the ''kafan'').
This is done to respect the dignity and privacy of the deceased with the family sometimes present. The specifics of this ritual, including the material, style, and colour of the cloth, may vary across regions. However, the [[shroud]] should be simple and [[Simplicity|modest]]. It is for this reason that [[Muslim]]s have generally preferred to use white cotton cloth to serve as the shroud. 
Men may use only three pieces of cloth and women five pieces of cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.353 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 353-358] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.353 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deceased may be kept in this state for several hours, allowing well-wishers to pass on their respects and condolences.

===Funeral prayer===
The Muslims of the community gather to offer their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead. This prayer has been generally termed as the [[Salat al-Janazah]] (Janazah prayer).

The Janazah prayer is as follows: 
*like [[Eid prayer]], the ''Janazah'' prayer  incorporates an additional (four&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.404 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 404] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.404 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Takbir]]s, the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name for the phrase ''Allah Akbar'', ''but'' there is no [[Ruku']] (''bowing'') and [[Sujud]] (''prostrating'').
* [[Supplication]] for the deceased and mankind is recited.
* In extraordinary circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was done in the Battle of Uhud.&lt;ref name="pray"/&gt;
* It is required for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, but conventionally and in practice the ''Janazah'' is performed by few people so it alleviates that obligation for all.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.359 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 359] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.359 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burial===
[[File:Muslim grave.jpg|thumb|Grave of a Muslim]]
The deceased is then taken for burial (''al-Dafin''). The exact manner, customs and  style of the [[Grave (burial)|grave]], the burial and so forth may vary by regional [[Norm (sociology)|custom]]. 

The grave should be at right angles to the direction of the [[Qibla]] (i.e. Mecca) so that the body, placed in the grave without a [[coffin]] lying on its right side, faces the Qibla.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=al-Misri|first=Ahmad ibn Naqib|title=Reliance of the Traveler (edited and translated by [[Nuh Ha Mim Keller]]|publisher=Amana Publications|year=1994|pages=238–239|isbn=0-915957-72-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grave markers should be raised, not more than about {{convert|30|cm|in}} above the ground, so that the grave will neither be walked nor sat on. [[Headstone|Grave markers]] are simple, because outwardly lavish displays are discouraged in Islam. Graves are frequently marked only with a simple [[wreath]], if at all. However, it is becoming more common for family members to erect grave monuments.

In [[Middle Eastern]] [[cultures]] women are generally discouraged from participating in the funeral procession. The reason for this is that in pre-Islamic Arabia it was customary in Arabia for grieving women to wail loudly. Wealthy families often even hired 'wailers' to attend the funerals of their deceased relative. Wailing at funerals is not permitted according to the Sahih Bukhari. Women are allowed to attend or be present if they do not wail or cry or hit themselves in grief, especially in an exaggerated excessive manner as it used to be done in old Arabia times.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.368 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 368] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.368 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three fist-sized spheres of hand-packed soil prepared beforehand by the gravediggers are used as props, one under the head, one under the [[chin]] and one under the shoulder. The lowering of the corpse and positioning of the soil-balls is done by the next of kin. In the case of a deceased husband, a male brother or brother-in-law usually performs this task. In the case of a deceased wife, the husband undertakes this if physically able to. If the husband is elderly, then the eldest male son (or son-in-law) is responsible for lowering, alignment and propping the deceased.

[[Orthodoxy]] expects those present to [[symbol]]ically pour three handfuls of soil into the grave while reciting a quranic verse meaning, "We created you from it, and return you into it, and from it we will raise you a second time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|20|55|style=nosup}}; compare "Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return" (Genesis 3:19)&lt;/ref&gt; More prayers are then said, asking for forgiveness of the deceased, and reminding the dead of their profession of faith.
[[File:C0566-Kstovo-Muslim-cemetery.jpg|thumb|In a [[Tatars|Tatar]] Muslim cemetery]]

The corpse is then fully buried by the gravediggers, who may stamp or pat down the grave to shape. Commonly the eldest male will supervise. After the burial the Muslims who have gathered to pay their respects to the dead collectively pray for the forgiveness of the dead. This collective prayer is the last formal collective prayer for the dead. In some cultures, e.g. South East Asian Muslims, the surviving members of the deceased scatter flowers and perfumed rose water upon the grave as the last action prior to leaving the grave.

===Mourning===
According to Sunni Islam, loved ones and relatives are to observe a 15-day [[mourning]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.369 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 369-371] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.369 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic mourning is observed by increased devotion, receiving visitors and condolences, and avoiding decorative clothing and jewelry in accordance with the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|234|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Widow]]s observe an extended mourning period ([[iddah]], ''period of waiting''), 4 months and 10 days long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.370 |archive-date=2010-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, the widow is not to remarry or to interact with non-mahram (a man she can marry). This rule is to confirm that the woman is not pregnant with the deceased's child prior to remarrying. However, in case of emergencies such as visiting a doctor because of a health emergency, the widow can interact with non-mahram.

Grief at the death of a beloved person and weeping for the dead is normal and acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.391 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 391] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.391 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni Islam expects expression of  grief to remain dignified, prohibiting loud wailing (bewailing refers to mourning in a loud voice), shrieking, beating the chest and cheeks, tearing hair or clothes, breaking objects, scratching faces or speaking phrases that make a Muslim lose faith. Grieving is allowed and a part of the death and burial process to allow one to come in terms with the loss of a person passing away as long as it respects the above.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.375 Volume 2, Book 23, Number 375-393] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819123140/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/023.sbt.html#002.023.375 |date=2010-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Burial Grave.jpg|thumb|Muslim men finishing a grave after a burial]]

===Directives for widows===
The Qur'an prohibits [[widow]]s to engage themselves for four [[lunar month]]s and ten days, after the death of their husbands. According to the Qur'an:
{{quote|And those of you who die and leave widows behind, they should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days. Then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you about what they do with themselves in accordance with the norms [of society]. And Allah is well acquainted with what you do. And there is also no blame on you if you tacitly send a marriage proposal to these women or hold it in your hearts. Allah knows that you would definitely talk to them. [Do so] but do not make a secret contract. Of course you can say something in accordance with the norms [of the society]. And do not decide to marry until the law reaches its term. And know that Allah has knowledge of what is in your hearts; so be fearful of Him and know that Allah is Most forgiving and Most Forbearing.| {{Cite quran|2|234|end=235|style=nosup}} ||}}

Islamic scholars consider this directive a balance between the mourning of a husband's death and the protection of a widow from cultural or societal censure if she became interested in remarrying after her husband’s death, often an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Islahi (1986), p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; This provision also operates to protect the property rights of the unborn, as the duration is enough to ascertain whether a widow is pregnant or not.&lt;ref&gt;Shehzad Saleem. ''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Marislaw2y4.html The Social Directives of Islam: Distinctive Aspects of Ghamidi’s Interpretation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403024603/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/Marislaw2y4.html |date=2007-04-03 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance]]. March, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Husbands are recommended to make a [[Will (law)|will]] in favor of their wives for the provision of one year’s residence and maintenance, except if the wives themselves leave the house or take any other similar step. As stated in Qur'an:
{{quote|And those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their widows a year’s provision and [bequeath] that [in this period] they shall not be turned out of their residences; but if they themselves leave the residence, there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves according to the norms of society. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.|{{Cite quran|2|240|style=nosup}}||}}

'''''Language and Language Disturbances: Aphasic Symptom Complexes and Their Significance for Medicine and Theory of Language''''' is a book on [[aphasia]] by Dr. [[Kurt Goldstein]], published in 1948. In ''Language and Language Disturbances'', Goldstein theorized that a loss of abstract processing was the core deficit in aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;Davidoff, Jules. "Color terms and color concepts." ''Journal of Experimental Child Psychology'' 94, no. 4 (2006): 334-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, Goldstein studied [[transcortical sensory aphasia]] (TSA), characterizing it as impaired auditory comprehension, with intact repetition and fluent speech.&lt;ref&gt;Boatman, Dana, Barry Gordon, John Hart, Ola Selnes, Diana Miglioretti, and Frederick Lenz. "Transcortical sensory aphasia: revisited and revised." ''Brain'' 123, no. 8 (2000): 1634-1642.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein studied word comprehension in patients with aphasia, theorizing that naming shows relatively little specificity to the site of lesion within the left hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Coughlan, A. K., and ELIZABETH K. WARRINGTON. "Word-comprehension and word-retrieval in patients with localized cerebral lesions." ''Brain'' 101, no. 1 (1978): 163-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein compared patients with damage restricted to the anterior portion of the left hemisphere (whose difficulties are primarily a matter of production) with those with exclusively posterior damage (whose difficulties lie chiefly in comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Ellen, and Howard Gardner. "The comprehension of metaphor in brain-damaged patients." ''Brain'' 100, no. 4 (1977): 717-729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein cited cases where patients experienced semantic confusion and could not verbalize certain words as a result of the brain damage. In one instance, a German patient of Goldstein's who could not name a handkerchief, said instead "''nas'putzen''" ("to blow one's nose").&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun, Wan, and Eric Buyssens. "Metalanguage and speech pathology." ''International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders'' 17, no. 1 (1982): 21-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imaginal Realm==
The realm called ''Al Malakut'' or ''Alam al Mithal'' (translated as ''imaginal realm'') terms the concept of a realm where all ideas, thoughts and actions are manifested, including supernatural experiences,&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi ''Saints and Saviours of Islam'' Sarup &amp; Sons 2005 {{ISBN|978-8-176-25555-4}} page 170&lt;/ref&gt;  conversations with angels and encounters with jinn.&lt;ref&gt;Jess Hollenback ''Mysticism: Experience, Response, and Empowerment'' Penn State Press 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-271-04444-6}} page 259&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the lower soul ([[nafs]]), came from there and the dreamer enters this realm again during sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Black Macdonald ''Development of Muslim Theology, Jurisprudence, and Constitutional Theory'' The Lawbook Exchange 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-584-77858-5}} page 234&lt;/ref&gt; It is held to be between the material realm ([[Alam al Mulk]]) and the spiritual realm (Alam al Jabarut).&lt;ref&gt;Victor Danner ''Kitāb Al-Ḥikam'' Brill Archive 1984 {{ISBN|978-9-004-07168-1}} page 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medicina Radio Observatory''' is an astronomical observatory located 30&amp;nbsp;km from [[Bologna, Italy]]. It is operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy of the [[INAF|National Institute for Astrophysics]] (INAF) of the government of Italy.

The site includes:
* 32-metre diameter [[parabolic antenna]] for observing between 1.4 and 23 [[GHz]].

==Northern Cross Radio Telescope==
The '''Northern Cross Radio Telescope''' ('''Croce del Nord''' in Italian) is one of the largest transit radio telescopes in the world. Observations are focused around 408&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF band]]), corresponding to 73.5&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength. The older receivers of the telescope function with a 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz wide frequency band, while the upgraded parts have a 16&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].&lt;ref name=cross-debris&gt;{{cite news|journal = International Astronautical Congress, IAC 2014|title = Orbit determination of space debris using a bi-static radar configuration with a multiple-beam receiver|author = A. Morselli and R. Armellin and P. Di Lizia and F. Bernelli-Zazzera and E. Salerno and G. Bianchi and S. Montebugnoli and A. Magro and K.Z. Adami|location = Toronto, Canada|year = 2014|pages = 1–11|url = http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/372082/1/Article-formatted.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope is steerable only in declination, meaning that it can solely observe objects that are culminating on the local [[Meridian (astronomy)|celestial meridian]].&lt;ref name=description /&gt; The telescope is T-shaped and consists of:

* E/W (East-West) arm - Single reflector 560 m x 35 m (1536 [[Dipole antenna|dipoles]])
* N/S (North-South) arm - Array of 64 reflectors 640 m x 23.5 m (4096 dipoles)

The telescope can provide 22880 possible theoretical independent beams and has a [[field of view]] of 55.47 degrees (East-West) by 1.8 degrees (North-South).&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; The resolution is around 4-5 [[Minute of arc|arcminutes]] in the North-South direction, and 4 arcminutes in the East-West direction. While less than the resolution of large [[optical telescopes]], the amount of radiation which can be gathered with the Northern Cross is much greater, proportional to the mirror surface of approximately 27400 square meters.  Northern Cross represents the largest UHF-band antenna in the [[Northern hemisphere]], with an [[Antenna aperture|aperture efficiency]] of 60%, making it second in the world, after the [[Arecibo radio telescope]].&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; This allows the Northern Cross to identify and measure extremely faint sources, making the telescope is particularly suitable to [[Extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic researches]].&lt;ref name=description /&gt;

There are plans upgrade of the East-West arm telescope to a [[LOFAR]] SuperStation, due to the good performances of a cylindrical-parabolic antenna in the 100-700&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range. Since LOFAR operates in the 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz range, some of the sensors on the Northern Cross Radio Telescope, optimized for 408&amp;nbsp;MHz, will have to be replaced with broadband antennas. This installation will have an effective area much larger than any other remote LOFAR station. If extended to the whole 22000 square meters area of the East-West arm, this single element effective area of 20 standard remote LOFAR stations. The resulting system will provide signification improvement in observation sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/Lofar_page8EN.htm|title=LOFAR SuperStation|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astron.nl/other/workshop/MCCT/MondayVirone.pdf|title=Electromagnetic development of broadband antenna feeding arrays for the Northern Cross Radio Telescope|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=IEIIT-CNR}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Square Kilometre Array pathfinder==
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico - BEIC 6339200.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Paolo Monti]]]]

The Cross is currently used as a pathfinder for the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ira.inaf.it/Medicinaweb/Nc/SKA%20ACTIVITIES.htm|title=SKA Activities|accessdate=2015-04-30|publisher=Medicina Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is focused on studying the amplification and filtering of signals between the LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) output and the [[Analog-to-Digital Converter]] input for the SKA. The Medicina Radio Observatory is studying all problems related to "antenna array implementation" through a prototype installation called MAD (Medicina Array Demonstrator).&lt;ref name=technology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/tecnologie.html|title=Technology Developments|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory staff have also built new receiver demonstrators for the SKA called ''BEST'' (Basic Element for SKA Training), part of the [[European Union|EU]]-funded SKADS (SKA Design Studies) programme.&lt;ref name=best-x&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/index_en.htm| title=BEST-X Project|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project started in 2005 and finished in 2009. It involved the installation of the new receivers on some reflectors of the North-South section (and later East-West section) of the Northern Cross telescope, along with new analog [[fiber-optic]] and [[coaxial]] digital finks from the front-end receiver boxes to the back-ends.&lt;ref name=receivers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/ricevitori.html|title=Receiver Design and Development|accessdate=2015-05-02|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite proceedings|author = Montebugnoli, S. and Bianchi, G. and Monari, J. and Naldi, G. and Perini, F. and Schiaffino, M.|title=BEST: Basic Element for SKA Training|journal = Wide Field Astronomy &amp; Technology for the Square Kilometre Array|year = 2009|pages = 331-336|url = http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/132/058/SKADS%202009_058.pdf|conference=SKADS Conference 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BEST project was divided in three parts:&lt;ref name=best-x /&gt;

* BEST-3lo focused on lower frequencies - between 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz. [[Log periodic antenna]]s optimized for 120-240&amp;nbsp;MHz, along with 18 receivers were installed on part of the East-West arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.med.ira.inaf.it/BEST/BEST-3_en.htm| title=BEST-3lo|accessdate=2015-05-22|publisher=IRA-INAF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space debris tracking==
There is an ongoing effort to use the 32 meter dish as a receiver for radar-based tracking system [[artificial satellites]] and [[space debris]] in [[Earth orbit]]. The system functions as a [[bistatic radar]], where an emitter located in a different location sends a signal, which bounces off objects in orbit and the echo is picked up by a receiver. The 32 meter dish acts as receiver, while usually the [[Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope|Yevpatoria 70 meter]] located in [[Crimea]], functions as a transmitter. The systems can either actively track debris to determine their orbit more precisely or utilize a technique called [[beam park]], where the transmitting and receiving antennas are kept fixed at a given position and the debris pass in and out of the observed area. The measurements obtain through such a system can be used to determine object [[radar cross-section]], time of peak occurrence, [[polarization (antenna)|polarization]] ratio, bistatic [[doppler shift]] and target rotation. In one of the carried-out tests, Yevpatoria-Medicina system was able to detect an object with an estimated radar cross section of 0.0002 square meter, which was created by the [[2009 satellite collision|Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 satellite collision]]. The system can also function as a [[multistatic radar]] using the 32 meter receivers at Medicina, the [[Noto Radio Observatory]] in Italy and the [[Ventspils Starptautiskais Radioastronomijas Centrs]] in [[Latvia]].&lt;ref name=debris&gt;{{cite news |
author = Pupillo, G. and Salerno, E. and Bartolini, M. and Di Martino, M. and Mattana, A. and Montebugnoli, S. and Portelli, C. and  Pluchino, S. and Schilliro, F. and Konovalenko, A. and Nabatov, A. and Nechaeva, M.|title = The INAF contribution to the ASI Space Debris program: observational activities|journal = Memorie della Societa Astronomica Italiana Supplementi|year = 2012|volume = 20|pages = 43|url = http://sait.oat.ts.astro.it/MSAIS/20/PDF/43.pdf|bibcode = 2012MSAIS..20...43P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Cross radio telescope has also been part of space debris tracking studies, utilized as a multiple-beam receiver for a bistatic radar system. The first tested configuration is a quasi-monostatic radar system, with a 3 m dish as transmitter, located in [[Bagnara]] - 20&amp;nbsp;km from the receiver. The second configuration was a simulation of a true bistatic radar system with 7 m dish as transmitter located at the site of the [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]] (SRT). The system has a maximum field-of-view of about 100 square degrees and collecting area of approximately 27400 square meter and is capable of providing up to 22880 beams, each 4 by 4 arcminutes wide. Tracking the sequence of beams that are illuminated, makes possible for the system to track with higher level of detail, with respect to the single-beam systems, the [[ground track]] of a transiting object.&lt;ref name=cross-debris /&gt; The Northern Cross radio telescope in a bistatic radar configuration is also part of the Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) segment of the [[ESA]] [[Space Situational Awareness Programme]] (SSA).&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml|title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors|access-date=2015-05-04|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morocco Fes Camel.jpg|thumb|upright|Mule moving goods through the car-free Medina in [[Fez, Morocco|Fes]], [[Morocco]]]]
A '''medina quarter''' ({{lang-ar|المدينة القديمة}} {{transl|ar|''al-madīnah al-qadīmah''}} "the old city") is a distinct city section found in a number of [[North Africa]]n and [[Fortifications of Malta|Maltese]] cities. A medina is typically walled, with many narrow and [[maze|maze-like]] streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|work=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/medina?q=medina|entry=Medina definition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[wikt:medina|medina]]" ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:مدينة|مدينة]]}} {{transl|ar|''madīnah''}}) itself simply means "[[city]]" or "[[town]]" in modern-day Arabic although it was borrowed from an [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word (also "medina") referring to a city or populated area.

==Description==
Medina quarters often contain historical [[fountain]]s, [[palace]]s, [[mosque]]s, and sometimes churches.

Because of the very narrow streets, medinas are generally free from [[car]] traffic, and in some cases even [[motorcycle]] and [[bicycle]] traffic. The streets can be less than a metre wide. This makes them unique among highly populated urban centres. The Medina of [[Fes]], or [[Fes el Bali]], is considered one of the largest car-free urban areas in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Mother Nature Network|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-car-free-cities/the-medina-of-fes-al-bali-morocco-pop-156000|title=7 car-free cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3788">A '''city charter''' or '''town charter''' (generically, '''municipal charter''') is a legal [[document]] (''[[charter]]'') establishing a [[municipality]] such as a [[city]] or [[town]].  The concept developed in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

Traditionally the granting of a charter gave a settlement and its inhabitants the right to [[town privileges]] under the [[Feudalism|feudal system]].  Townspeople who lived in chartered towns were [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], as opposed to [[serfs]] who lived in villages.  Towns were often "[[Free imperial city|free]]", in the sense that they were directly protected by the king or emperor, and were not part of a feudal [[Fiefdom|fief]].

Today the process for granting is determined by the type of government of the state in question.  In monarchies, charters are still often a [[royal charter]] given by [[the Crown]] or the state authorities acting on behalf of the Crown.  In federations, the granting of charters may be within the jurisdiction of the lower level of government such as  [[province]].

==Canada==
{{main article|Local government in Canada}}
In Canada charters are granted by [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]].

==Philippines==
{{main article|Cities of the Philippines}}
Since the beginning of American colonial rule, Philippines cities were formally established through laws enacted by the various national legislatures in the country. The [[Philippine Commission]] gave the city of Manila its charter in 1901, while the city of Baguio was established by the [[Philippine Assembly]] which was composed by elected members instead of appointed ones. During the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth era]], the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] established an additional ten cities. Since achieving independence from the United States in 1946 the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] has established 124 more cities (as of September 2007), the majority of which required the holding of a [[plebiscite]] within the proposed city's jurisdiction to ratify the city's charter.

== Sweden ==
In [[Sweden]] until 1951, cities were established by [[royal charter]]; see [[City status in Sweden]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], towns and cities are established by [[royal charter]]; see [[city status in the United Kingdom]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], such [[charter]]s are established either directly by a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] by means of [[local legislation]], or indirectly under a general [[municipal corporation]] [[law]], usually after the proposed charter has passed a [[referendum]] vote of the affected population.

A municipal charter is the basic document that defines the organization, powers, functions and essential procedures of the city government. The charter is, therefore, the most important legal document of any city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlc.org/build-skills-and-networks/resources/cities-101/city-structures/municipal-charters|title=Municipal Charters|website=www.nlc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities without charters, in states where such exist, are known as [[general-law municipality|general-law municipalities or cities]].

[[File:Lennuliiklust uurimas.jpg|thumbnail|An observer is someone who gathers information about a phenomenon, but does not intervene. (Observing the air traffic in [[Rõuge]], [[Estonia]])]]

'''Observation''' is the active acquisition of [[information]] from a [[primary source]]. In living beings, observation employs the [[sense]]s. In science, observation can also involve the recording of [[data (information)|data]] via the use of [[scientific instrument]]s. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be [[qualitative property|qualitative]], that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or [[quantitative data|quantitative]] if a numerical value is attached to the observed [[phenomenon]] by [[counting]] or [[measurement|measuring]].

==Observation in science==
The [[scientific method]] requires observations of [[list of natural phenomena|natural phenomena]] to formulate and test [[hypothesis|hypotheses]].&lt;ref name="Kosso"&gt;{{cite book

Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However, the need for [[reproducibility]] requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human [[sense]] impressions are [[subjectivity|subjective]] and [[qualitative data|qualitative]], making them difficult to record or compare. The use of [[measurement]] developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard unit]]. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the [[measurement|resolution]] of the process.

Human senses are limited and subject to errors in perception, such as [[optical illusion]]s. [[Scientific instrument]]s were developed to aid human abilities of observation, such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[clock]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[camera]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by the senses, such as [[pH indicator|indicator dyes]], [[voltmeter]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[infrared camera]]s, [[oscilloscope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[geiger counter]]s, and [[radio receiver]]s.

One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the ''[[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]''. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.

Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve [[amplifier|amplification]] and are thus thermodynamically [[irreversibility|irreversible processes]], increasing [[entropy]].

==Observational paradoxes==
In some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "[[paradox]]es" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".
* '''Relativity:''' In [[relativistic physics]] which deals with velocities close to the [[speed of light]], it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the [[twin paradox]] one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].
* '''Quantum mechanics:''' In [[quantum mechanics]], which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to [[observer (quantum physics)|observe a system]] without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the [[system]] being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a [[wave function]] which often exists in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] or mixture of different [[quantum state|states]]. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "[[wave function collapse|collapse]]" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an ''observation'' or ''measurement'', whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.

==Biases==
The human senses do not function like a video [[camcorder]], impartially recording all observations.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web

What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a ''[[schema (psychology)|schema]]'', that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called ''[[reconstructive memory]]''. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why [[eyewitness testimony]] is notoriously unreliable.

Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.

===Confirmation bias===
{{main|confirmation bias}}
Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "''see what we expect to see''".&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite book

It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the [[scientific racism]] that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as [[blind experiment|blind]] or [[double blind experiment]]s, to minimize observational bias.

==="Cargo cult" science===
{{main|Cargo cult science}}
Another bias, which has become more prevalent with the advent of "[[big science]]" and the large rewards of new discoveries, is bias in favor of the researcher's desired hypothesis or outcome; we "''see what we want to see''". Called [[pathological science]] and [[cargo cult science]], this is different from deliberate falsification of results, and can happen to good-faith researchers.  Researchers with a great incentive or desire for a given outcome can misinterpret or misjudge results, or even persuade themselves they have seen something they haven't.  Possible examples of mistaken discoveries caused by this bias are [[Mars#Martian 'canals'|Martian "canals"]], [[N rays]], [[polywater]], [[cold fusion]], and [[perpetual motion]] machines. Recent decades have seen scientific scandals caused by researchers playing "fast and loose" with observational methods in order to get their pet theories published. This type of bias is rampant in [[pseudoscience]], where correct scientific techniques are not followed. The main defense against this bias, besides correct research techniques, is [[peer review]] and repetition of the experiment, or the observation, by other researchers with no incentive to bias. For example, an emerging practice in the competitive field of [[biotechnology]] is to require the physical results of experiments, such as serums and [[tissue culture]]s, be made available to competing laboratories for independent testing.

===Processing bias===
Modern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to where in the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with [[digital image processing|digitally enhanced]] images published as experimental data in [[scientific paper|papers]] in [[scientific journal]]s. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some [[scientific journal]]s have begun to set detailed standards for what types of [[image processing]] are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defense against processing bias, and similarly scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.

===Observational bias===
An observational bias occurs when researchers only look where they think they will find positive results, or where it is easy to record observations. This is called the "[[streetlight effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David H. Freedman |title=The Streetlight Effect |url= |quote= |work=[[Discover magazine]] |date=August 1, 2010 &lt;!--|accessdate=2010-08-24 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations in philosophy==
{{quote|"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing [[Nature]] loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them."|Meditations. iv. 36. – [[Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Observation in [[philosophical]] terms is the process of filtering [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] through the thought process. Input is received via [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[visual perception|sight]], [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[Haptic perception|touch]] and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought.


For example, let us suppose that an observer ''sees'' a parent beat their child; and consequently ''observes'' that such an action is either good or bad.{{Citation needed|reason=What is the source of the distinction "seeing" versus "observing"?|date=May 2009}} Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.

As the use of [[e-mail]] and the [[Internet access|internet]] becomes even more widespread, these tools become more valuable and useful in education for the purposes of increasing [[learning]] for students, and [[facilitation (business)|facilitating]] [[conversation]]s between students, parents, and schools.&lt;ref name=sup7/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;

== Overview ==

Online communication emphasizes 21st century skills, [[self-directed learning]], [[self-advocacy]], global awareness, and thinking skills for learners.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"&gt;Watson, J., Gemin, B., &amp; International Association for K-12 Online, L. (2009). Management and Operations of Online Programs: Ensuring Quality and Accountability. Promising Practices in Online Learning. International Association for K-12 Online Learning&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing online communication methods, schools help students develop [[Netiquette]], and technical and [[computer skills]].&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  In addition, teachers can provide parents with frequent information about school programs and their children's progress through automated e-mails, official [[website]]s and [[learning management system]]s.&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt; This communication can be achieved either [[synchronization|synchronously]] or [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly, providing greater time flexibility.&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup9/&gt;

With online communication, learning may occur outside traditional school hours as students participate in collaborative activities, like reading and responding to [[Peer group|peer]] posts in online forums, [[experiment]]s, group [[project]]s, research papers, and current events assignments.&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;   In addition, online communication can connect a wide range of individuals and increase the diversity of [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s that learners are exposed to.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;

However, not all parents, students, or teachers have access to unlimited [[internet access]] or the digital technology necessary to participate in online communication, and it may be costly to initially implement the [[information technology]], [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]], and [[software]].&lt;ref name=sup1/&gt;  Furthermore, schools must provide [[Student orientation|orientation]] to the online environments and [[technical support]] to ensure that all potential [[User (telecommunications)|user]]s are ready to participate.&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  Teachers will also need to spend additional time online as active participants in the communication activities (e.g. act as the [[Forum moderator#Moderators|moderator]]s of discussions).&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;  In addition, the immediacy of online communication can lead to students and parents' unreasonable expectations that teachers be 'on-call' at all times.&lt;ref name=sup1&gt;Southern Regional Education Board (2003). Essential Principles of High-Quality Online Teaching: Guidelines for Evaluating K-12 Online Teachers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online communication between parents and school ==

Online communication between parents and schools are online methods that serve as a [[Computing platform|platform]] for parents and teachers to exchange ideas.  For teachers and administrators, online communication makes it easier to reach the parents and build the partnerships with parents.Online communication allows parents to receive real-time information about their child’s performance and activities at school, and flexible opportunities to ask questions and provide information to teachers and school administrators.

In this recent time of technology and modern educational sector, there are many ways to get instant connectivity with your university or college teachers. In the online education process the communication is playing a major role for both teachers and students. There are many online universities and colleges who offer their education services online and they create a good communication path where all the student and the teacher took participation to discuss with every other and this will also help to get problem resolve very early. For  those professional employees who stop their studies and start doing work. With the online education colleges and universities now they have an opportunity to get complete their education and complete their academic profile by having a higher degree on their resume. If you have a years of work experience in any field, but your employer doesn’t recognize you just because of your degree then there is a good news for you that the online universities also giving you the chance for apply your degree on the basis of your work experience.

=== Benefits ===

Creating [[Mode (literature)|mode]]s for online communication can increase parent participation in their children's education, which in turn increases students’ interest in their learning.  Online communication increases parents’ understanding of classroom [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], [[Philosophy|philosophies]] and [[Policy|policies]].  Parents then feel more involved in their child's school and more connected to the teacher.  In general, online communication improves parents’ attitudes toward conferencing with teachers and administrators.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

This style of communication allows for more asynchronous communication and greater flexibility.  With online communication, parents can initiate conversations and express concerns to teachers and school officials easily.  In addition, informal communication through online [[Online chat|chat]]ting or [[Internet forum|forum]]s can reduce parents’ [[anxiety]] of meeting face-to-face with teachers and/or school officials.  When possible, online communication can also offer comfort through anonymity.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

=== Challenges ===

Though most of the time, teachers and parents want to establish communication, there are some challenges that teacher and parents need to face together.  The most common challenges involve parent’s ability to use the [[software]], their access to consistent [[internet access]] and [[language barrier]]s.  There may be financial costs incurred by the school, if they provide [[training]] or [[translation]] to parents in order to make online communication more inclusive.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;

== Online communication between students and teachers ==

Online communication between teachers and students facilitates the exchange of ideas and [[e-learning]]. Online communication allows students to access learning materials beyond school hours and develop relationships with peers and teachers.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup32/&gt;

=== Benefits ===

The creation of [[Web 2.0]] and [[social networks]] means that knowledge is now [[collective]] and readily available online for students to access and contribute to.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; Promoting online communication between teachers and students creates opportunities for students to receive feedback and assistance from teachers and peers outside the regular school day and classroom.  Student can e-mail or post questions, add their opinions to peer-discussions, and check official websites for pertinent information.

Through online learning communities of teachers and peers, students can build relationships with other users and establish a sense of both [[connectedness]] and belonging.  Some students, who are less likely to participate in face-to discussions, are more likely to participate in [[online discussion]]s and activities.  This online communication enhances the strength of the relationships between students and both their peers and teachers.

=== Challenges ===

Student can demonstrate [[antipathy]] towards online communication or peer [[interdependency]] in internet forums.  In order to be productive, online communication between students and teachers requires [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[interactivity]], common expectations and shared goals.  Some students expect teachers to be on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, placing unreasonable expectations upon teachers.&lt;ref name=sup28/&gt; In addition, most students spend participate in online communication from home, which means that parent's help is often required, but may not be available.  Finally, students may lack the technical skills or access to the technology necessary to involve themselves in online communication.

=== Role of teachers ===

Teachers have great responsibility in the establishment of online communication and [[communities]] with students, because of their leadership position.  Several of their in-class characteristics must extend into the online environment, such as their ability to guide student behavior and learning.  With online communication, teachers must model and demonstrate appropriate Netiquette throughout their persistent involvement.  Teachers should also encourage their classes to evolve into [[learning communities]] in which group processes have the power to influence the behavior of individuals.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; These online environments should foster a sense of [[openness]], friendliness, and [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], so that [[problem solving]] becomes a group function.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup34/&gt;

=== Examples ===

Teachers and students can e-mail questions and answers to each other about course content and assignments.  Schools and teachers can maintain official websites with important information about events, assignments, and resources that students can utilize outside class.&lt;ref name=sup25/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup33/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup45/&gt;

Both students and teachers can post messages in online forums as a part of homework assignments.  In this way they can present different points of view that they don't have any chance to present in the classroom.

Online [[study group]]s  allow students to maintain relationships with their peers from a distance.  These study groups can be created within a classroom’s [[Social-networking sites|social networking site]], allowing users to connect with each other directly, beyond typical chat rooms and forums.

Teachers can develop [[virtual tour]]s, [[virtual education]], and virtual learning environment for their students in [[Multi-User Virtual Environment|multi-user virtual environment]]s (MUVE).

== Technology and tools ==

The most widely used online communication tool is e-mail between teachers, which provides opportunities for asynchronous communication, instantaneous distribution to a mass audience, mobile access, and file exchange.&lt;ref name=sup39/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup40/&gt;  Teacher-created websites provide online access to administrative information, calendars, [[Hyperlink|link]]s, [[blog]]s, etc.  Internet forums allow learners and teachers to articulate ideas, give and receive feedback, reflect on the perspectives of others, and receive clarification of concepts.&lt;ref name=sup37/&gt;  [[List of social networking websites|social networking site]]s are used for focused and open communication between users.  Blogs allow individuals to express their ideas in greater detail and with [[multimedia]].

===Course Management Systems (CMS)===
{{See also|Learning management system|Virtual learning environment}}

Various course management systems are designed specifically for facilitating online communication in education.  Effective course management software tends to include more information, widgets, functions, and customization options than teacher-created websites.

Most course management systems include:
* class information: calendar, [[syllabus]], details of prerequisites, assessment information, and a [[FAQ]]
* a notice board with up-to-date course information
* learning materials: course content, copies of visual aids, reading materials and links to community resources
* assessment opportunities: [[self-assessment]], [[Self- and Peer-Assessment|peer-assessment]], and formal assessment
* communication support: e-mail, [[threaded discussion]]s, and a chat room
* differentiated access rights for teachers, administrators, and students
* document authoring tools
* administrative tools:  student [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] capabilities, [[statistics]], and [[report]]s

Notable CMS Software include:
&lt;!--Entries should have a Wikipedia article, based on multiple independent sources.--&gt;
* [[Chamilo]]
* [[Claroline]]
* [[eFront]]
* [[ILIAS]]
* [[JoomlaLMS]] (a LMS based on Joomla platform)
* [[LAMS]] (Learning Activity Management System)
* [[Moodle]]
* [[Sakai Project|Sakai]]

'''Passionism''' is a [[contemporary art]] movement in [[Scandinavia]], anti-avantgarde in its approach. The term was coined by art critique [[Merete Sanderhoff]] in her work ''Sorte Billeder'' [Black Pictures] &lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff (2007): Sorte Billeder&amp;nbsp;– kunst og kanon. Rævens Sorte Bibliotek.&lt;/ref&gt; as an attempt to categorise talents outside the avantgarde canon, that did not fit into any known art category. They are referred to as the black sheep of the contemporary art scene.&lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff (2007): Sorte Billeder&amp;nbsp;– kunst og kanon. Rævens Sorte Bibliotek, p. 37ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passionist artists are concerned with the continuation of pre-avantgarde painting traditions without turning into a repetition of these works. They are not simply postmodernists because they actually take the content and the techniques of these traditional paintings seriously. The content focuses on [[narratives]] of riddles, yearning, and solemnity. That does not mean they lack humour, but their paintings are meant to be taken seriously. There is a tendency to create very dark paintings hence the title ''black pictures''. Furthermore, they often comment on the [[doctrine]]s of the [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] art and art theories, moving beyond these rigid constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Merete Sanderhoff. This is not a canon. Canonization and its effect on contemporary art. In Nordisk Museologi 2005/2. pp. 74-88. Abstract: ''How does canonization affect contemporary art and the definition of cultural heritage? This subject is right now topical in Denmark, where the Ministry of Culture recently issued a much debated canon of Danish culture. This article looks behind the concept of canonization and examines the structures that determine why some artists and art works are canonized, while others are disregarded. The focus of the article is a marginalized group of contemporary Danish artists, named passionists, who have deliberately chosen to oppose the prevailing standards of art production. These standards are based on the tradition of the avant-garde, which itself forms a canon within art historiography today.'' {{cite web |url=http://www.nordiskmuseologi.com/Summaries/Abstracts061.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007233653/http://www.nordiskmuseologi.com/Summaries/Abstracts061.html |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Passionism differs from the Scandinavian's in that these Passionist artists claim their art is "born independently of the will of the artist, with no pre-planning or founding concept" (www.passionism.com). This strain of Passionism was created by Cat Moss and [[metcuc]] in May 2000, and launched to the public at the Forum de Nice in 2002 (see press and radio archive footage, Nice Matin Press and Radio FR3). It further claims to be "the first French artistic movement of the 21st Century, and the first artistic movement in the history of art to be spearheaded by women and followed by artists of all types around the globe. Passionist artists include writers, painters, photographers, poets, musicians, film directors, and fashion designers" (www.passionism.com)

'''Patna School of Painting''' or '''Patna Qalaam''' or '''Patna Kalam''' or '''company painting''' is a style of Indian Painting, which existed in [[Bihar]], [[India]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1upindia.com/states/bihar/culture.html Bihar Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Patna Qalaam''' was world’s first independent school of painting which dealt exclusively with the commoner and his lifestyle also helped Patna Kalam paintings gain in popularity. The Principal centers were [[Patna]], [[Danapur]] and [[Arrah]].

The Patna School of Painting is facing a gradual decline and becoming a matter of past with the lapse of time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deccanherald.com/content/56522/return-patna-kalam.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philadelphia Center for Architecture''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organization]] founded in 2002&lt;ref name=About/&gt; by the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA). The Center opened a physical space on the ground floor of the [[Smyth Young Field Company Building]] in  2008.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;  The building, at 1218 Arch Street, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nrhp nom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McVarish|first1=Douglas C.|title=Young, Smyth, Field Company Building|url=http://www.dot7.state.pa.us/CRGIS_Attachments/SiteResource/H052754_01H.pdf|website=Pennsylvania CGRIS|publisher=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center serves as a venue for public programs on [[architecture]], [[urban planning]], and [[design]], including various competitions and exhibitions, as well as home to offices for AIA Philadelphia, the Community Design Collaborative, and the AIA Bookstore.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Center for Architecture|url=http://www.philadelphiacfa.org/about|website=Philadelphia Center for Architecture|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutAIA&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIA Philadelphia|url=http://aiaphiladelphia.org/about-aia-philadelphia|website=AIA Philadelphia|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neon&gt;{{cite news|title=Neon art colors the Center for Architecture|url=http://www.theartblog.org/2012/06/neon-art-colors-the-center-for-architecture/|accessdate=24 September 2015|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
AIA Philadelphia is the second oldest Chapter of the AIA and a nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(6) status, designating it as a professional membership organization. The [[American Institute of Architects]] was founded in 1857, and the Philadelphia chapter received its charter in 1869. The Chapter includes members from Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester and Montgomery Counties.  AIA Philadelphia has a history of community engagement.  Activities include helping to create [[Independence National Historical Park]], the Charter High School for Architecture + Design, the Community Design Collaborative, and the Philadelphia Center for Architecture.&lt;ref name=Strategic2012&gt;{{cite web|title=AIA Philadelphia &amp;  Center for Architecture Strategic Plan 2013  – 2017|url=http://www.aaonetwork.org/system/files/resources/Architecture%20Center%20Strategic%20Plan%20-%20AIA%20Philadelphia%20and%20Philadelphia%20Center%20for%20Architecture.pdf|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Claypool became Executive Director of AIA Philadelphia in 2001.&lt;ref name=Massie/&gt; Under his leadership, the Philadelphia Center for Architecture was established as a separate nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(3) status, designating it as an educational non-profit. Its purpose was to support charitable and educational initiatives to benefit the community at large, on behalf of the architectural profession.  It developed programs in the community.&lt;ref name=Strategic2012/&gt;

The Center soon took advantage of the opportunity to create a physical space as well as providing a set of programs.  The Center at 1218 Arch Street opened in 2008.  In 2009 the Chapter and Center boards created a framework to coordinate the two organizations.  The Chapter board holds the authority for annually appointing the Board of the Center. The Center's mission involves engaging "the public, decision leaders, thought leaders, and allied design professionals" on issues related to design and architecture, to recognize and enhance the quality of architecture in the region,&lt;ref name=Strategic2012/&gt; distinct from AIA Philadelphia's mission to provide architects with "opportunities for professional development, service, and collegiality among peers".&lt;ref name=Mission&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIA Philadelphia|url=http://www.aiaphiladelphia.org/about-aia-philadelphia|website=AIA Philadelphia|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cosmology}}
'''Physical cosmology''' is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the [[Universe]] and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate.&lt;ref name=GFR_Ellis&gt;For an overview, see {{cite book |chapter=Issues in the Philosophy of Cosmology |author=George FR Ellis |arxiv=astro-ph/0602280 |isbn=978-0-444-51560-5 |publisher=North Holland |title=Philosophy of Physics (Handbook of the Philosophy of Science) 3 volume set |editor=Jeremy Butterfield &amp; John Earman|bibcode = 2006astro.ph..2280E |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cosmology]] as a [[science]] originated with the [[Copernican principle]], which implies that [[astronomical object|celestial bodies]] obey identical [[physical law]]s to those on Earth, and [[Newtonian mechanics]], which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, [[Edwin Hubble]] discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external [[Galaxy|galaxies]] beyond our own [[Milky Way]]; then, work by [[Vesto Slipher]] and others showed that the universe is [[expanding universe|expanding]]. These advances made it possible to speculate about the [[origin of the universe]], and allowed the establishment of the [[Big Bang]] Theory, by [[Georges Lemaître]], as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cosmologystatement.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401081546/http://cosmologystatement.org/|title=An Open Letter to the Scientific Community as published in New Scientist, May 22, 2004|last=|first=|date=2014-04-01|website=cosmologystatement.org|archive-date=1 April 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better.

Dramatic advances in observational cosmology since the 1990s, including the [[cosmic microwave background]], distant [[supernovae]] and galaxy [[redshift survey]]s, have led to the development of a [[Lambda-CDM model|standard model of cosmology]]. This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] whose nature is currently not well understood, but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations.&lt;ref name="PDG"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pdg.ge.infn.it/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-cosmological-parameters.pdf | title=2013 Review of Particle Physics | author=Beringer, J. | author2=et al.

Cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of research in theoretical and applied [[physics]]. Areas relevant to cosmology include [[particle physics]] experiments and [[particle physics phenomenology|theory]], theoretical and observational [[astrophysics]], [[general relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]], and [[plasma physics]].

Modern cosmology developed along tandem tracks of theory and observation. In 1916, Albert Einstein published his theory of [[general relativity]], which provided a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize Biography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Einstein believed in a [[static universe]], but found that his original formulation of the theory did not permit it.&lt;ref name="Liddle, A. 51"&gt;{{cite book | author = Liddle, A. | title = An Introduction to Modern Cosmology | publisher = Wiley | page=51 | isbn =978-0-470-84835-7 | date = 2003-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because masses distributed throughout the universe gravitationally attract, and move toward each other over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vilenkin | first = Alex | title = Many worlds in one : the search for other universes | publisher = Hill and Wang, A division of Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location = New York | date = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-8090-6722-0 | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he realized that his equations permitted the introduction of a constant term which could counteract the attractive force of gravity on the cosmic scale. Einstein published his first paper on relativistic cosmology in 1917, in which he added this ''[[cosmological constant]]'' to his field equations in order to force them to model a static universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Mark |last2=Lambourne |first2=Robert | title = An introduction to galaxies and cosmology | publisher = Open University Cambridge University Press | location = Milton Keynes Cambridge, UK New York | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-54623-2 | page= 228}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Einstein model describes a static universe; space is finite and unbounded (analogous to the surface of a sphere, which has a finite area but no edges). However, this so-called Einstein model is unstable to small perturbations—it will eventually start to [[metric expansion of space|expand]] or contract.&lt;ref name="Liddle, A. 51"/&gt; It was later realized that Einstein's model was just one of a larger set of possibilities, all of which were consistent with general relativity and the cosmological principle. The cosmological solutions of general relativity were found by [[Alexander Friedmann]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Mark |last2=Lambourne |first2=Robert | title = An introduction to galaxies and cosmology | publisher = Open University Cambridge University Press | location = Milton Keynes Cambridge, UK New York | date = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-521-54623-2 |page=232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His equations describe the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] universe, which may expand or contract, and whose geometry may be open, flat, or closed.
[[File:History of the Universe.svg|thumb|left|350px|History of the [[Universe]] – [[gravitational wave]]s are hypothesized to arise from [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], a [[Faster-than-light#Universal expansion|faster-than-light]] expansion just after the [[Big Bang]]&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]]
In the 1910s, [[Vesto Melvin Slipher|Vesto Slipher]] (and later [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]]) interpreted the [[red shift]] of [[nebula|spiral nebulae]] as a [[Doppler shift]] that indicated they were receding from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Slipher | first1=V. M. | title=Further Notes on Spectrographic Observations of Nebulae and Clusters | journal=Publications of the American Astronomical Society| volume=4 | editor1-first=Philip | editor1-last=Fox | editor2-first=Joel | editor2-last=Stebbins | date=1922 | pages=284–286 | bibcode=1922PAAS....4..284S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Seitter | first1=Waltraut C. | last2=Duerbeck | first2=Hilmar W. | title=Carl Wilhelm Wirtz – Pioneer in Cosmic Dimensions  | journal=Harmonizing Cosmic Distance Scales in a Post-Hipparcos Era | series=ASP Conference Series | volume=167 | editor1-first=Daniel | editor1-last=Egret | editor2-first=Andre | editor2-last=Heck | isbn=978-1-886733-88-6 | date=1999 | pages=237–242 | bibcode=1999ASPC..167..237S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult to determine the distance to astronomical objects. One way is to compare the physical size of an object to its [[angular size]], but a physical size must be assumed to do this. Another method is to measure the [[brightness]] of an object and assume an intrinsic [[luminosity]], from which the distance may be determined using the [[inverse square law]]. Due to the difficulty of using these methods, they did not realize that the nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own [[Milky Way]], nor did they speculate about the cosmological implications. In 1927, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] [[Georges Lemaître]] independently derived the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker equations and proposed, on the basis of the recession of spiral nebulae, that the universe began with the "explosion" of a "primeval [[atom]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Lemaître | first1=G. | title=Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques | journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | pages=49–59 | date=1927 | language=French | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L }}&lt;/ref&gt;—which was later called the [[Big Bang]]. In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] provided an observational basis for Lemaître's theory. Hubble showed that the spiral nebulae were galaxies by determining their distances using measurements of the brightness of [[Cepheid variable]] stars. He discovered a relationship between the redshift of a galaxy and its distance. He interpreted this as evidence that the galaxies are receding from Earth in every direction at speeds proportional to their distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Hubble | first1=Edwin  | title=A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=168–173 | date=March 1929 | doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168  | bibcode=1929PNAS...15..168H | pmid=16577160 | pmc=522427}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is now known as [[Hubble's law]], though the numerical factor Hubble found relating recessional velocity and distance was off by a factor of ten, due to not knowing about the types of Cepheid variables.

Given the [[cosmological principle]], Hubble's law suggested that the universe was expanding. Two primary explanations were proposed for the expansion. One was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow. The other explanation was [[Fred Hoyle]]'s [[steady state model]] in which new matter is created as the galaxies move away from each other. In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Hoyle | first1=F. | title=A New Model for the Expanding Universe | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=108 | issue=5 | pages=372–382 | date=1948 | bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..372H | doi=10.1093/mnras/108.5.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aip"&gt;{{citation | title=Big Bang or Steady State? | work=Ideas of Cosmology | publisher=American Institute of Physics | url=https://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/ideas/bigbang.htm | accessdate=2015-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a number of years, support for these theories was evenly divided. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1965 lent strong support to the Big Bang model,&lt;ref name="aip"/&gt; and since the precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] in the early 1990s, few cosmologists have seriously proposed other theories of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. One consequence of this is that in standard general relativity, the universe began with a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]], as demonstrated by [[Roger Penrose]] and [[Stephen Hawking]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Earman1999&gt;{{citation | contribution=The Penrose-Hawking Singularity Theorems: History and Implications | last1=Earman | first1=John | title=The expanding worlds of general relativity | journal=The Expanding Worlds of General Relativity | pages=235 | editor1-first=Hubert | editor1-last=Goenner | editor2-last=Jürgen | editor3-first=Jim | editor3-last=Ritter | editor4-first=Tilman | editor4-last=Sauer | series=Birk presentations of the fourth conference on the and gravitation | year=1999 | bibcode=1999ewgr.book..235E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view to extend the Big Bang model, suggesting the universe had no beginning or singularity and the age of the universe is infinite, has been presented.&lt;ref name="LS-20150226"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ghose |first=Tia |title=Big Bang, Deflated?

==Energy of the cosmos==
The lightest [[chemical elements]], primarily [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], were created during the [[Big Bang]] through the process of [[nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Burles2001/&gt; In a sequence of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] reactions, smaller atomic nuclei are then combined into larger atomic nuclei, ultimately forming stable [[iron group]] elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which have the highest nuclear [[binding energies]].&lt;ref name=B2FH&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Burbidge | first1=E.

R. | last3=Fowler | first3=W.A. | last4=Hoyle | first4=F. | year=1957 | title=Synthesis of the Elements in Stars | journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=547–650 | bibcode=1957RvMP...29..547B | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The net process results in a ''later energy release'', meaning subsequent to the Big Bang.&lt;ref name=Frautschi1982&gt;{{cite journal | title=Entropy in an expanding universe | last1=Frautschi | first1=S. | journal=Science | volume=217 | issue=4560 | pages=593–599 | date=August 13, 1982 | doi=10.1126/science.217.4560.593 | pmid=17817517 | bibcode=1982Sci...217..593F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such reactions of nuclear particles can lead to ''sudden energy releases'' from [[cataclysmic variable star]]s such as [[nova]]e. Gravitational collapse of matter into [[black hole]]s also powers the most energetic processes, generally seen in the nuclear regions of galaxies, forming ''[[quasar]]s'' and ''[[active galaxies]]''.

Cosmologists cannot explain all cosmic phenomena exactly, such as those related to the [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion of the universe]], using conventional [[Energy forms|forms of energy]]. Instead, cosmologists propose a new form of energy called [[dark energy]] that permeates all space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/300/5627/1914?siteid=sci&amp;ijkey=eJV6VmToFgZIE&amp;keytype=ref Science 20 June 2003:Vol. 300. no. 5627, pp. 1914 - 1918] Throwing Light on Dark Energy, Robert P. Kirshner. Retrieved December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis is that dark energy is just the [[vacuum energy]], a component of empty space that is associated with the [[virtual particle]]s that exist due to the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name=Frieman2008&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe | last1=Frieman | first1=Joshua A. | last2=Turner | first2=Michael S. | last3=Huterer | first3=Dragan | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume=46 | issue=1 | pages=385–432 | year=2008 | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243 | bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F | arxiv=0803.0982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no clear way to define the total energy in the universe using the most widely accepted theory of gravity, [[general relativity]]. Therefore, it remains controversial whether the total energy is conserved in an expanding universe. For instance, each [[photon]] that travels through intergalactic space loses energy due to the [[redshift]] effect. This energy is not obviously transferred to any other system, so seems to be permanently lost. On the other hand, some cosmologists insist that energy is conserved in some sense; this follows the law of [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book | author = Liddle, A. | title = An Introduction to Modern Cosmology | publisher = Wiley | isbn =978-0-470-84835-7 | date = 2003-05-26 }} This argues cogently "Energy is always, always, always conserved."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermodynamics of the universe]] is a field of study that explores which form of energy dominates the cosmos – [[relativistic particle]]s which are referred to as [[radiation]], or non-relativistic particles referred to as matter. Relativistic particles are particles whose [[rest mass]] is zero or negligible compared to their [[kinetic energy]], and so move at the speed of light or very close to it; non-relativistic particles have much higher rest mass than their energy and so move much slower than the speed of light.

As the universe expands, both matter and radiation in it become diluted. However, the [[energy density|energy densities]] of radiation and matter dilute at different rates. As a particular volume expands, mass energy density is changed only by the increase in volume, but the energy density of radiation is changed both by the increase in volume and by the increase in the [[wavelength]] of the [[photon]]s that make it up. Thus the energy of radiation becomes a smaller part of the universe's total energy than that of matter as it expands. The very early universe is said to have been 'radiation dominated' and radiation controlled the deceleration of expansion. Later, as the average energy per photon becomes roughly 10 [[electronvolt|eV]] and lower, matter dictates the rate of deceleration and the universe is said to be 'matter dominated'. The intermediate case is not treated well [[analytic solution|analytically]]. As the expansion of the universe continues, matter dilutes even further and the [[cosmological constant]] becomes dominant, leading to an acceleration in the universe's expansion.

==History of the universe==
{{see also|Timeline of the Big Bang}}
The history of the universe is a central issue in cosmology. The history of the universe is divided into different periods called epochs, according to the dominant forces and processes in each period. The standard cosmological model is known as the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

===Equations of motion===
{{main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric}}

Within the [[standard cosmological model]], the [[equations of motion]] governing the universe as a whole are derived from [[general relativity]] with a small, positive [[cosmological constant]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The solution is an expanding universe; due to this expansion, the radiation and matter in the universe cool down and become diluted. At first, the expansion is slowed down by [[gravitation]] attracting the [[radiation]] and matter in the universe. However, as these become diluted, the cosmological constant becomes more dominant and the expansion of the universe starts to accelerate rather than decelerate. In our universe this happened billions of years ago.&lt;ref name=Springel2006&gt;{{cite journal | title=The large-scale structure of the Universe | last1=Springel | first1=Volker | last2=Frenk | first2=Carlos S. | last3=White | first3=Simon D.

===Particle physics in cosmology===
{{main|Particle physics in cosmology}}

During the earliest moments of the universe the average [[energy density]] was very high, making knowledge of [[particle physics]] critical to understanding this environment. Hence, [[scattering]] processes and [[particle decay|decay]] of unstable [[elementary particles]] are important for cosmological models of this period.

As a rule of thumb, a scattering or a decay process is cosmologically important in a certain epoch if the time scale describing that process is smaller than, or comparable to, the time scale of the expansion of the universe.{{clarify |date=April 2018 |reason=Isn't the opposite true -- departures from equilibrium occur only when the process takes longer than the time scale? }} The time scale that describes the expansion of the universe is &lt;math&gt;1/H&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Hubble parameter]], which varies with time. The expansion timescale &lt;math&gt;1/H&lt;/math&gt; is roughly equal to the age of the universe at each point in time.

===Timeline of the Big Bang===
{{main|Timeline of the Big Bang}}
Observations suggest that the universe began around 13.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the evolution of the universe has passed through three phases. The very early universe, which is still poorly understood, was the split second in which the universe was so hot that [[subatomic particle|particles]] had energies higher than those currently accessible in [[particle accelerator]]s on Earth. Therefore, while the basic features of this epoch have been worked out in the Big Bang theory, the details are largely based on educated guesses.
Following this, in the early universe, the evolution of the universe proceeded according to known [[high energy physics]]. This is when the first protons, electrons and neutrons formed, then nuclei and finally atoms. With the formation of neutral hydrogen, the [[cosmic microwave background]] was emitted. Finally, the epoch of structure formation began, when matter started to aggregate into the first [[star]]s and [[quasar]]s, and ultimately galaxies, [[clusters of galaxies]] and [[supercluster]]s formed. The future of the universe is not yet firmly known, but according to the [[&amp;Lambda;CDM]] model it will continue expanding forever.

==Areas of study==
Below, some of the most active areas of inquiry in cosmology are described, in roughly chronological order. This does not include all of the Big Bang cosmology, which is presented in ''[[Timeline of the Big Bang]].''

===Very early universe===
The early, hot universe appears to be well explained by the Big Bang from roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; seconds onwards, but there are several [[Big Bang#Standard Problems|problems]]. One is that there is no compelling reason, using current particle physics, for the universe to be [[shape of the universe|flat]], homogeneous, and [[isotropic]] ''(see the [[cosmological principle]])''. Moreover, [[grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] of particle physics suggest that there should be [[magnetic monopole]]s in the universe, which have not been found. These problems are resolved by a brief period of [[cosmic inflation]], which drives the universe to [[Flatness (cosmology)|flatness]], smooths out anisotropies and inhomogeneities to the observed level, and exponentially dilutes the monopoles.&lt;ref name=Guth1981&gt;{{cite journal | title=Inflationary universe: A possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems | last1=Guth | first1=Alan H. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=23 | issue=2 | date=January 15, 1981 | pages=347–356 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 | bibcode=1981PhRvD..23..347G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical model behind cosmic inflation is extremely simple, but it has not yet been confirmed by particle physics, and there are difficult problems reconciling inflation and [[quantum field theory]].{{Vague|date=April 2018}} Some cosmologists think that [[string theory]] and [[brane cosmology]] will provide an alternative to inflation.&lt;ref name=Pogosian2003&gt;{{cite journal | title=Observational constraints on cosmic string production during brane inflation | last1=Pogosian | first1=Levon | last2=Tye | first2=S.-H.

Another major problem in cosmology is what caused the universe to contain far more matter than [[antimatter]]. Cosmologists can observationally deduce that the universe is not split into regions of matter and antimatter. If it were, there would be [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s produced as a result of [[annihilation]], but this is not observed. Therefore, some process in the early universe must have created a small excess of matter over antimatter, and this (currently not understood) process is called ''[[baryogenesis]]''. Three required conditions for baryogenesis were derived by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1967, and requires a violation of the particle physics [[Symmetry#In physics|symmetry]], called [[CP-symmetry]], between matter and antimatter.&lt;ref name=Canetti2012&gt;{{citation | title=Matter and antimatter in the universe | display-authors=1 | first1=Laurent | last1=Canetti | first2=Marco | last2=Drewes | first3=Mikhail | last3=Shaposhnikov | journal=New Journal of Physics | volume=14 | issue=9 | pages=095012 | date=September 2012 | doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 | bibcode=2012NJPh...14i5012C | arxiv=1204.4186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, particle accelerators measure too small a violation of CP-symmetry to account for the baryon asymmetry. Cosmologists and particle physicists look for additional violations of the CP-symmetry in the early universe that might account for the baryon asymmetry.&lt;ref name=Pandolfi2017&gt;{{cite web | title=New source of asymmetry between matter and antimatter | first1=Stefania | last1=Pandolfi | date=January 30, 2017 | publisher=CERN | url=https://home.cern/about/updates/2017/01/new-source-asymmetry-between-matter-and-antimatter | accessdate=2018-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the problems of baryogenesis and cosmic inflation are very closely related to particle physics, and their resolution might come from high energy theory and [[particle accelerator|experiment]], rather than through observations of the universe.{{speculation inline|date=April 2018}}&lt;!-- This statement is both speculative and somewhat obvious.

===Big Bang Theory===
{{Main|Big bang nucleosynthesis}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis is the theory of the formation of the elements in the early universe. It finished when the universe was about three minutes old and its [[temperature]] dropped below that at which [[nuclear fusion]] could occur. Big Bang nucleosynthesis had a brief period during which it could operate, so only the very lightest elements were produced. Starting from [[hydrogen]] [[ion]]s ([[proton]]s), it principally produced [[deuterium]], [[helium|helium-4]], and [[lithium]]. Other elements were produced in only trace abundances. The basic theory of nucleosynthesis was developed in 1948 by [[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Asher Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]].&lt;ref name=Peebles2014&gt;{{cite journal | title=Discovery of the hot Big Bang: What happened in 1948 | last1=Peebles | first1=Phillip James Edwin | journal=The European Physical Journal H | volume=39 | issue=2 | pages=205–223 | date=April 2014 | doi=10.1140/epjh/e2014-50002-y | bibcode=2014EPJH...39..205P | arxiv=1310.2146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for many years as a probe of physics at the time of the Big Bang, as the theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis connects the abundances of primordial light elements with the features of the early universe.&lt;ref name=Burles2001&gt;{{cite journal | title=Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Predictions for Precision Cosmology | last1=Burles | first1=Scott | last2=Nollett | first2=Kenneth M. | last3=Turner | first3=Michael S. | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=552 | issue=1 | pages=L1–L5 | date=May 2001 | doi=10.1086/320251 | bibcode=2001ApJ...552L...1B | arxiv=astro-ph/0010171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it can be used to test the [[equivalence principle]],&lt;ref name=Boucher2004&gt;{{citation | title=Cosmic microwave background constraints on the strong equivalence principle | last1=Boucher | first1=V. | last2=Gérard | first2=J.-M. | last3=Vandergheynst | first3=P. | last4=Wiaux | first4=Y. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=70 | issue=10 | page=103528 | date=November 2004 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.103528 | bibcode=2004PhRvD..70j3528B | arxiv=astro-ph/0407208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to probe [[dark matter]], and test [[neutrino]] physics.&lt;ref name=Cyburt2016&gt;{{citation | title=Big bang nucleosynthesis: Present status | last1=Cyburt | first1=Richard H. | last2=Fields | first2=Brian D. | last3=Olive | first3=Keith A. | last4=Yeh | first4=Tsung-Han | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | volume=88 | issue=1 | page=015004 | date=January 2016 | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.88.015004 | bibcode=2016RvMP...88a5004C | arxiv=1505.01076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cosmologists have proposed that Big Bang nucleosynthesis suggests there is a fourth "sterile" species of neutrino.&lt;ref name=Lucente2018&gt;{{cite arxiv| title=Leptogenesis, dark matter and neutrino masses | last1=Lucente | first1=Michele | last2=Abada | first2=Asmaa | last3=Arcadi | first3=Giorgio | last4=Domcke | first4=Valerie  | eprint=1803.10826 | date=March 2018| class=hep-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''[[Lambda-CDM]]''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] cosmological model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM''').

The cosmic microwave background is radiation left over from [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]] after the epoch of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] when neutral [[atom]]s first formed. At this point, radiation produced in the Big Bang stopped [[Thomson scattering]] from charged ions. The radiation, first observed in 1965 by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], has a perfect thermal [[black body|black-body]] spectrum. It has a temperature of 2.7 [[kelvin]]s today and is isotropic to one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Cosmological perturbation theory]], which describes the evolution of slight inhomogeneities in the early universe, has allowed cosmologists to precisely calculate the angular [[power spectrum]] of the radiation, and it has been measured by the recent satellite experiments ([[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]])&lt;ref name=Lamarre2010&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The Cosmic Microwave Background | last1=Lamarre | first1=Jean-Michel | title=Observing Photons in Space | volume=9 | editor1-first=M.C.E. | editor1-last=Huber | editor2-first=A. | editor2-last=Pauluhn | editor3-first=J.

===Formation and evolution of large-scale structure===
{{Main|Large-scale structure of the cosmos|Structure formation|Galaxy formation and evolution}}
Understanding the formation and evolution of the largest and earliest structures (i.e., [[quasar]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[galaxy groups and clusters|clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s) is one of the largest efforts in cosmology. Cosmologists study a model of '''hierarchical structure formation''' in which structures form from the bottom up, with smaller objects forming first, while the largest objects, such as superclusters, are still assembling.&lt;ref name=Hess2013&gt;{{cite journal | title=Simulating structure formation of the Local Universe | last1=Heß | first1=Steffen | last2=Kitaura | first2=Francisco-Shu | last3=Gottlöber | first3=Stefan | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=435 | issue=3 | pages=2065–2076 | date=November 2013 | doi=10.1093/mnras/stt1428 | bibcode=2013MNRAS.435.2065H | arxiv=1304.6565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to study structure in the universe is to survey the visible galaxies, in order to construct a three-dimensional picture of the galaxies in the universe and measure the matter [[power spectrum]]. This is the approach of the ''[[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]'' and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref name=Cole2005&gt;{{cite journal | title=The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final data set and cosmological implications | display-authors=6 | last1=Cole | first1=Shaun | last2=Percival | first2=Will J. | last3=Peacock | first3=John A. | last4=Norberg | first4=Peder | last5=Baugh | first5=Carlton M. | last6=Frenk | first6=Carlos S. | last7=Baldry | first7=Ivan | last8=Bland-Hawthorn | first8=Joss | last9=Bridges | first9=Terry | last10=Cannon | first10=Russell | last11=Colless | first11=Matthew | last12=Collins | first12=Chris | last13=Couch | first13=Warrick | last14=Cross | first14=Nicholas J.

Another tool for understanding structure formation is simulations, which cosmologists use to study the gravitational aggregation of matter in the universe, as it clusters into [[Galaxy filament|filaments]], superclusters and [[void (astronomy)|voids]]. Most simulations contain only non-baryonic [[cold dark matter]], which should suffice to understand the universe on the largest scales, as there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible, baryonic matter. More advanced simulations are starting to include baryons and study the formation of individual galaxies. Cosmologists study these simulations to see if they agree with the galaxy surveys, and to understand any discrepancy.&lt;ref name=Kuhlen2012&gt;{{cite journal | title=Numerical simulations of the dark universe: State of the art and the next decade | journal=Physics of the Dark Universe | volume=1 | issue=1–2 | date=November 2012 | pages=50–93 | first1=Michael | last1=Kuhlen | first2=Mark | last2=Vogelsberger | first3=Raul | last3=Angulo | doi=10.1016/j.dark.2012.10.002 | arxiv=1209.5745 | bibcode=2012PDU.....1...50K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, complementary observations to measure the distribution of matter in the distant universe and to probe [[reionization]] include:
*The [[Lyman-alpha forest]], which allows cosmologists to measure the distribution of neutral atomic hydrogen gas in the early universe, by measuring the absorption of light from distant quasars by the gas.&lt;ref name=Weinberg2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Weinberg | first1=David H. | last2=Davé | first2=Romeel | last3=Katz | first3=Neal | last4=Kollmeier | first4=Juna A. | title=The Lyman-&amp;alpha; Forest as a Cosmological Tool | journal=The Emergence of Cosmic Structure | booktitle=The Emergence of Cosmic Structure | date=May 2003 | series=AIP Conference Series | volume=666 | issue=2003 | editor1-first=S.

These will help cosmologists settle the question of when and how structure formed in the universe.

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
Evidence from [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], the [[cosmic microwave background]], structure formation, and [[galaxy rotation curve]]s suggests that about 23% of the mass of the universe consists of non-baryonic dark matter, whereas only 4% consists of visible, [[baryonic matter]]. The gravitational effects of dark matter are well understood, as it behaves like a cold, [[Radioactive decay|non-radiative]] fluid that forms [[galactic halo|haloes]] around galaxies. Dark matter has never been detected in the laboratory, and the particle physics nature of dark matter remains completely unknown. Without observational constraints, there are a number of candidates, such as a stable [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] particle, a [[weakly interacting massive particle]], a [[gravitationally-interacting massive particle]], an [[axion]], and a [[massive compact halo object]]. Alternatives to the dark matter hypothesis include a modification of gravity at small accelerations ([[MOND]]) or an effect from [[brane cosmology]].&lt;ref name=Klasen2015&gt;{{cite journal | title=Indirect and direct search for dark matter | last1=Klasen | first1=M. | last2=Pohl | first2=M. | last3=Sigl | first3=G. | journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics | volume=85 | pages=1–32 | date=November 2015 | doi=10.1016/j.ppnp.2015.07.001 | arxiv=1507.03800 | bibcode=2015PrPNP..85....1K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
If the universe is [[Flatness (cosmology)|flat]], there must be an additional component making up 73% (in addition to the 23% dark matter and 4% baryons) of the energy density of the universe. This is called dark energy. In order not to interfere with Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background, it must not cluster in haloes like baryons and dark matter. There is strong observational evidence for dark energy, as the total energy density of the universe is known through constraints on the flatness of the universe, but the amount of clustering matter is tightly measured, and is much less than this. The case for dark energy was strengthened in 1999, when measurements demonstrated that the expansion of the universe has begun to gradually accelerate.&lt;ref name=Perlmutter1999&gt;{{cite journal | title=Constraining Dark Energy with Type Ia Supernovae and Large-Scale Structure | last1=Perlmutter | first1=Saul | last2=Turner | first2=Michael S. | last3=White | first3=Martin | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=83 | issue=4 | year=1999 | pages=670–673 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.670 | bibcode=1999PhRvL..83..670P | arxiv=astro-ph/9901052 | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from its density and its clustering properties, nothing is known about dark energy. ''[[Quantum field theory]]'' predicts a [[cosmological constant]] (CC) much like dark energy, but 120 [[orders of magnitude]] larger than that observed.&lt;ref name=Adler1995&gt;{{cite journal | title=Vacuum catastrophe: An elementary exposition of the cosmological constant problem | last1=Adler | first1=Ronald J. | last2=Casey | first2=Brendan | last3=Jacob | first3=Ovid C. | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume=63 | issue=7 | pages=620–626 | date=July 1995 | doi=10.1119/1.17850 | bibcode=1995AmJPh..63..620A }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Weinberg]] and a number of string theorists ''(see [[string landscape]])'' have invoked the 'weak [[anthropic principle]]': i.e. the reason that physicists observe a universe with such a small cosmological constant is that no physicists (or any life) could exist in a universe with a larger cosmological constant. Many cosmologists find this an unsatisfying explanation: perhaps because while the weak anthropic principle is self-evident (given that living observers exist, there must be at least one universe with a cosmological constant which allows for life to exist) it does not attempt to explain the context of that universe.&lt;ref name=Siegfried2006&gt;{{cite journal | title=A 'Landscape' Too Far? | first1=Tom | last1=Siegfried | journal=Science | date=August 11, 2006 | volume=313 | issue=5788 | pages=750–753 | doi=10.1126/science.313.5788.750 | pmid=16902104 | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5788/750.full?etoc= | accessdate=2018-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the weak anthropic principle alone does not distinguish between:
* Only one universe will ever exist and there is some underlying principle that constrains the CC to the value we observe.
* Only one universe will ever exist and although there is no underlying principle fixing the CC, we got lucky.
* Lots of universes exist (simultaneously or serially) with a range of CC values, and of course ours is one of the life-supporting ones.

Other possible explanations for dark energy include [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]&lt;ref name=Sahni2002&gt;{{cite journal | title=The cosmological constant problem and quintessence | last1=Sahni | first1=Varun | journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity | volume=19 | issue=13 | pages=3435–3448 | year=2002 | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/19/13/304 | bibcode=2002CQGra..19.3435S | arxiv=astro-ph/0202076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a modification of gravity on the largest scales.&lt;ref name=Nojiri2007&gt;{{cite journal | title=Introduction to Modified Gravity and Gravitational Alternative for Dark Energy | last1=Nojiri | first1=S. | last2=Odintsov | first2=S.

The nature of dark energy is one of the most challenging problems in cosmology.

A better understanding of dark energy is likely to solve the problem of the [[ultimate fate of the universe]]. In the current cosmological epoch, the accelerated expansion due to dark energy is preventing structures larger than [[supercluster]]s from forming. It is not known whether the acceleration will continue indefinitely, perhaps even increasing until a [[big rip]], or whether it will eventually reverse, lead to a [[big freeze]], or follow some other scenario.&lt;ref name=Jambrina2014&gt;{{cite journal | title=Grand rip and grand bang/crunch cosmological singularities | last1=Fernández-Jambrina | first1=L. | journal=Physical Review D | volume=90 | issue=6 | page=064014 | date=September 2014 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.90.064014 | bibcode=2014PhRvD..90f4014F | arxiv=1408.6997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gravitational waves===
[[Gravitational wave]]s  are ripples in the [[curvature]] of [[spacetime]] that propagate as [[wave]]s at the speed of light, generated in certain gravitational interactions that propagate outward from their source. [[Gravitational-wave astronomy]] is an emerging branch of [[observational astronomy]] which aims to use gravitational waves to collect observational data about sources of detectable gravitational waves such as [[binary star]] systems composed of [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s; and events such as [[supernova]]e, and the formation of the [[chronology of the universe|early universe]] shortly after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=Colpi2017&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Gravitational Wave Sources in the Era of Multi-Band Gravitational Wave Astronomy | last1=Colpi | first1=Monica | last2=Sesana | first2=Alberto | title=An Overview of Gravitational Waves: Theory, Sources and Detection | journal=An Overview of Gravitational Waves: Theory | editor1-first=Augar | editor1-last=Gerard | editor2-first=Plagnol | editor2-last=Eric | isbn=9789813141766 | pages=43–140 | year=2017 | doi=10.1142/9789813141766_0002 | bibcode=2017ogw..book...43C | arxiv=1610.05309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political culture''' is defined by the ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]]'' as the "set of attitudes, beliefs and sentiments that give order and meaning to a [[Politics|political]] process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the [[political system]]". It encompasses both the political ideals and operating norms of a [[polity]]. Political culture is thus the manifestation of the psychological and subjective dimensions of politics. A political ''culture'' is the product of both the history of a political system and the histories of the members. Thus, it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', New York: Macmillen, 1968, Vol. 12, p. 218 (quoted in Jo Freedman, [http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polparties/polculture.htm The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
In 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/january8/obitalmond-18.html Stanford Report, Obit: Gabriel Almond, January 8, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verba|first1=Sidney|last2=Almond|first2=Gabriel|title=The Civic Culture|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is "deference", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of "inferiority" or "superiority", and authority in society.

The second key feature is "consensus" which represents the key link between government and public agreement and appeasement. Support for appeasement may not always be shared by the whole nation, but as a whole, people agree to sustain it, meaning it is a common agreement. There are various "Examples of Consensus" in British political culture: how people are governed as a whole, consensus regarding the welfare state, agreement as to who acts as head of state, and with what powers.

The third feature of British political culture is "homogeneity". Church attendance as a whole is decreasing. Sections of the Scottish and Welsh populations have called for independence.

==Political philosophy==
The term political culture was brought into political science to promote the American political system. The concept was used by [[Gabriel Almond]] in the late 50s, and outlined in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' (1963, [[Gabriel Almond|Almond]] &amp; [[Sidney Verba|Verba]]), but was soon opposed by two European political scientists, [[Gerhard Lehmbruch]] and [[Arend Lijphart]]. Lehmbruch analysed politics in [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] and Lijphart analysed politics in [[Netherlands]]. Both argued that there are political systems that are more stable than the one in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Lukšič, Igor (2006). ''Politična kultura'', pp. 40–42. [[University of Ljubljana|FDV, Ljubljana]]. Retrieved on June 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Different typologies of political culture have been proposed. According to political scientist William S. Stewart, all political behavior can be explained as participating in one or more of eight political cultures: [[anarchism]], [[oligarchy]], [[Tory corporatism]], [[fascism]], [[classical liberalism]], radical liberalism, [[democratic socialism]], and [[Leninist socialism]]. Societies that exemplify each of these cultures have existed historically.

[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]] in ''[[The Civic Culture]]'' outlined three pure types of political culture based on  level and type of [[political participation]] and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:
* [[Parochial political culture|Parochial]] – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent with a traditional political structure.
* Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent. The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions. It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the "downward flow" side of the politics. In general congruent with a centralized authoritarian structure.
* Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and administrative structures and processes (to both the input and output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political structure.

Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the [[civic culture]], which mixes the best elements of each.

[[Arend Lijphart]] wrote that there are different classifications of political culture:
* First classification:
** Mass political culture
** [[Elite]] political culture
* Second classification (of elite political culture):
** coalitional
** contradictive

Lijphart also classified the structure of society:
* homogeneous
* heterogeneous

María Eugenia Vázquez Semadeni defines political culture as "the set of discourses and symbolic practices by means of which both individuals and groups articulate their relationship to power, elaborate their political demands and put them at stake."&lt;ref&gt;[Vázquez Semadeni, M. E. (2010). ''La formación de una cultura política republicana: El debate público sobre la masonería. México, 1821-1830.''

'''''Print, A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts''''' was a limited edition quarterly [[periodical]] begun in 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=22 August 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued under different names through the end of 2017 as '''''Print''''', a bimonthly [[United States|American]] magazine about visual culture and design.

In its final format, ''Print'' documented and critiqued commercial, social, and environmental design from every angle: the good (how New York’s public-school libraries are being reinvented through bold graphics), the bad (how Tylenol flubbed its disastrous ad campaign for suspicious hipsters{{clarify|reason=only clear Americans, probably|date=September 2015}}), and the ugly (how Russia relies on Soviet symbolism to promote sausage and real estate).

''Print'' was a general-interest magazine, written by cultural reporters and critics who look at design in its social, political, and historical contexts. From newspapers and book covers to Web-based motion graphics, from corporate branding to indie-rock posters, from exhibitions to cars to monuments, ''Print'' showed its audience of designers, art directors, illustrators, photographers, educators, students, and enthusiasts of popular culture why our world looks the way it looks, and why the way it looks matters. ''Print'' underwent a complete redesign in 2005, and ceased publication in 2017, with a promise to focus the brand on "a robust and thriving online community." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.printmag.com/regional-design-annual/print-magazine-winter-2017-2018-regional-design-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the Journal Initially==
The journal was founded by [[William Edwin Rudge]] to demonstrate “the far reaching importance of the graphic arts” including art prints, commercial printing, wallpaper, etc.  Contents were eclectic covering typography, book making, book printing, fine prints as well as the trade journal aspects of printing candy bar wrappers.&lt;ref&gt;Editor’s forward Vol 1, #1 (Jun 1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the publication included original prints such as the frontispiece for Vol 1, #1 (Jun 1940) a two color woodcut by Hans Alexander Mueller and Vol 1, #3 (December 1940) a black and white wood engraving by [[Paul Landacre]].

By Volume 8 (1953) the focus of the periodical had shifted to a trade journal.

==Name Changes==
* Vol 1, #1 (Jun 1940) ''Print: A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts''
* Vol 3, #2 (Summer 1942) combined with ''The Printing Art. An Illustrated Monthly Magazine of the Art of Printing and of the Allied Arts'' but continued under ''Print: A Quarterly Journal of the Graphic Arts''

===Until===
* Vol 7, #1 (Aug 1951) ''Print'': combining: ''Print, A Quarterly Journal of Graphic Arts'', Vol. VII, Number 1 and ''The Print Collector's Quarterly'', Volume XXX, Number 4.
* Vol 7, #2 (Jan 1952) ''Print, The Magazine of the Graphic Arts'' - until
* Vol 9, #2 (Oct/Nov 1954) ''Print'' - until
* Vol 11, #4 (Jan/Feb 1958) ''Print, The Magazine of Visual Communication'' - until
* Vol 12, #1 (July/Aug 1958) ''Print, America's Graphic Design Magazine'' at least until May/June 2005 Vol 59, #3.

'''Revisionary materialism''' is the view that falls between [[eliminative materialism]] and [[reductive materialism]] when it comes to a particular psychological phenomenon.&lt;ref name="StandfordEM"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative/#SpeProFolPsy, | title=Eliminative Materialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Take, for example, debates over the reality of a psychological concept like "[[demonology]]" – the posit that evil spirits influence human behaviour. An eliminativist might argue that this theory completely fails to describe anything real; the reductionist might argue that the concepts are valid, and that science will simply provide an increasingly detailed understanding of the demons. The revisionist would be somewhere in between, suggesting only that ''partial'' revision of the common sense understanding will be necessary. That is, parts of the demon theory will be validated by future research.&lt;ref name="StandfordEM"/&gt;

Today, one is likely to be eliminativist about demons. However, eliminative materialists mention other psychological concepts (e.g. belief, will, consciousness) about which one is more likely to be revisionist.

Unlike strong eliminative materialism, the revisionist often claims that a theory or concept is only ''partially'' incorrect, perhaps because it ignores a few important causal factors.&lt;ref name="StandfordEM"/&gt;

Broadly speaking, a '''risk assessment''' is the combined effort of 1. identifying and analyzing potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e., risk analysis); and 2. making judgments "on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis" while considering influencing factors (i.e., risk evaluation).&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT21 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–28 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqjLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |chapter=Chapter 1: Risk Assessments: Their Significance and the Role of the Safety Professional |title=Risk Assessment: A Practical Guide to Assessing Operational Risks |author=Manuele, F.A. |editor=Popov, G.; Lyon, B.K.; Hollcraft, B.  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–22 |year=2016 |isbn=9781118911044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put in simpler terms, a risk assessment analyzes what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, what the potential consequences are, and how tolerable the identified risk is.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As part of this process, the resulting determination of risk may be expressed in a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] fashion. The risk assessment plays an inherent part of an overall [[risk management]] strategy, which attempts to, after a risk assessment, "introduce control measures to eliminate or reduce" any potential risk-related consequences.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt;

===Individual risk assessment===
Risk assessment is necessary in individual cases, including patient and physician interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbu.se/contentassets/e7039ddba84c4eca9b474d6b15c9c9ac/vop_eng_18_180521_lr.pdf|title=Getting Real About Both Benefits and Risks|last=Levi|first=Ragnar|date=June 1, 2018|website=Swedish Agency of Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services|pages=8–9|language=en|via=[https://www.sbu.se/en/publications/medical-science-and-practice/new-issue-sbu-newsletter-medical-science-and-practice/ Science &amp; Practice, English Special 2018]|issn=1104-1250|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual judgements or assessments of risk may be affected by psychological, ideological, religious or otherwise subjective factors, which impact rationality of the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A [[systematic review]] of patients and doctors from 2017 found that overstatement of benefits and understatement of risks occurred more often than the alternative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Tammy C.|last2=Del Mar|first2=Chris|year=2015|title=Patients' expectations of the benefits and harms of treatments, screening, and tests: a systematic review|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=175|issue=2|pages=274–286|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.6016|issn=2168-6114|pmid=25531451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tendency for individuals to be less rational when risks and exposures concern themselves as opposed to others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also a tendency to underestimate risks that are voluntary or where the individual sees themselves as being in control, such as smoking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2017 systematic review from the [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane collaboration]] suggests “well-documented decision aids” are helpful in reducing effects of such tendencies or biases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Lewis|first3=Krystina|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bennett|first5=Carol L.|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B.|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|date=12 April 2017|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD001431|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28402085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways statistics are expressed and communicated, both through words and numerically also impact the interpretation of benefit and harm. For example, a fatality rate may be interpreted as less benign than the corresponding survival rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Systems risk assessment===
Risk assessment can also be made on a much larger "systems" scale, for example assessing the risks of a nuclear power plant (an interactively complex mechanical, electronic, nuclear, and human system) or a hurricane (a complex meteorological and geographical system). Systems may be defined as linear and nonlinear (or complex), where linear systems are predictable and relatively easy to understand given a change in input, and non-linear systems unpredictable when inputs are changed.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13-6"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT166 |chapter=Chapter 6: Accident Models |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=137–76 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, risk assessments of non-linear/complex systems tend to be more challenging.

In the engineering of complex systems, sophisticated risk assessments are often made within [[safety engineering]] and [[reliability engineering]] when it concerns threats to life, [[Natural environment|environment]], or machine functioning. The agriculture, nuclear, aerospace, oil, railroad, and military industries have a long history of dealing with risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16"&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical Infrastructures: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment in Transportation of Dangerous Goods: Transportation by Road and Rail |author=Vamanu, B.I.; Gheorghe, A.V.; Kaina, P.F. |publisher=Springer |page=11 |year=2016 |isbn=9783319309316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, medical, hospital, [[social services|social service]],&lt;ref name="LaceyAnApp11"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lacey |first=Peter |title=An Application of Fault Tree Analysis to the Identification and Management of Risks in Government Funded Human Service Delivery |journal=Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Public Policy and Social Sciences |year=2011 |ssrn=2171117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and food industries control risks and perform risk assessments on a continual basis. Methods for assessment of risk may differ between industries and whether it pertains to general financial decisions or environmental, ecological, or public health risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16" /&gt;

== Concept ==
Rapid technological change, increasing scale of industrial complexes, increased system integration, market competition, and other factors have been shown to increase societal risk in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As such, risk assessments become increasingly critical in mitigating accidents, improving safety, and improving outcomes. Risk assessment consists of an objective evaluation of [[risk]] in which assumptions and uncertainties are clearly considered and presented. This involves identification of risk (what can happen and why), the potential consequences, the [[Outcome (probability)|probability of occurrence]], the tolerability or acceptability of the risk, and ways to mitigate or reduce probability of the risk.&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt; Optimally, it also involves documentation of the risk assessment and its findings, implementation of mitigation methods, and review of the assessment (or risk management plan), coupled with updates when necessary.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; Sometimes risks can be deemed acceptable, meaning the risk "is understood and tolerated ... usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss."&lt;ref name="ShireyInternet07"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949 |title=Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 |author=Shirey, R. |work=Network Working Group |publisher=The IETF Trust |page=9 |date=August 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the difficulty in managing risk is that both the quantities by which risk assessment is concerned—potential loss and probability of occurrence—can be very difficult to measure. The chance of error in measuring these two concepts is high. Risk with a large potential loss and a low probability of occurrence is often treated differently from one with a low potential loss and a high likelihood of occurrence. In theory, both are of near equal priority, but in practice it can be very difficult to manage when faced with the scarcity of resources—especially time—in which to conduct the risk management process.

===Mathematical conceptualization===
[[Image:RiskAssessment.jpg|thumb|320px|Risk assessment from a financial point of view.]]
To see the risk management process expressed mathematically, one can define total risk as the sum over individual risks, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, which can be computed as the product of potential losses, &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, and their probabilities, &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;R_i=L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{total}=\sum_i L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Even though for some risks &lt;math&gt;R_i, R_j&lt;/math&gt;, we might have &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, if the probability &lt;math&gt;p(L_j)&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;, its estimation might be based only on a smaller number of prior events, and hence, more uncertain. On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt; must be larger than &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, so decisions based on this uncertainty would be more consequential, and hence, warrant a different approach.

Financial decisions, such as insurance, express loss in terms of dollar amounts.  When risk assessment is used for public health or environmental decisions, loss can be quantified in a common metric such as a country's currency or some numerical measure of a location's quality of life.  For public health and environmental decisions, loss is simply a verbal description of the outcome, such as increased cancer incidence or incidence of birth defects. In that case, the "risk" is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;R_i= p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
If the risk estimate takes into account information on the number of individuals exposed, it is termed a "population risk" and is in units of expected increased cases per a time period. If the risk estimate does not take into account the number of individuals exposed, it is termed an "individual risk" and is in units of incidence rate per a time period.  Population risks are of more use for cost/benefit analysis; individual risks are of more use for evaluating whether risks to individuals are "acceptable".

====Quantitative risk assessment====
{{Further|Quantitative Risk Assessment software}}
In quantitative risk assessment an [[annualized loss expectancy]] (ALE) may be used to justify the cost of implementing countermeasures to protect an asset. This may be calculated by multiplying the [[single loss expectancy]] (SLE), which is the loss of value based on a single security incident, with the [[annualized rate of occurrence]] (ARO), which is an estimate of how often a threat would be successful in exploiting a vulnerability.

The usefulness of quantitative risk assessment has been questioned, however. [[Barry Commoner]], [[Brian Wynne]] and other critics have expressed concerns that risk assessment tends to be overly quantitative and reductive. For example, they argue that risk assessments ignore qualitative differences among risks. Some charge that assessments may drop out important non-quantifiable or inaccessible information, such as variations among the classes of people exposed to hazards, or social amplification.&lt;ref name="Kasperson"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kasperson, R.E., Renn, O., Slovic, P., Brown, H.S., Emel, J., Goble, R., Kasperson, J.X., Ratick, S.| year=1988 | title = The social amplification of risk: A conceptual framework|journal= Risk Analysis|volume=8|issue=2|pages=177–187|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01168.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Commoner and O'Brien claim that quantitative approaches divert attention from precautionary or preventative measures.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, Barry. O'Brien, Mary. Shrader-Frechette and Westra 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] consider risk managers little more than "blind users" of statistical tools and methods.&lt;ref&gt;The fourth quadrant: a map of the limits of statistics [9.15.08] Nassim Nicholas Taleb An Edge Original Essay&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of risk ==
The process of risk assessment may be somewhat informal at the individual social level, managing economic and household risks,&lt;ref name="HolzmannSocial01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Risk Management: A New Conceptual Framework for Social Protection, and Beyond |journal=International Tax and Public Finance |author=Holzmann, R.; Jørgensen, S. |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=529–56 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1011247814590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NakašThree17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowledgehub.cef-see.org/?p=1399 |title=Three Lessons About Risk Management from Everyday Life |author=Nakaš, N. |work=Knowledge Hub |publisher=Center of Excellence in Finance |date=21 November 2017 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a sophisticate process at the strategic corporal level. However, in both cases, ability to anticipate future events and create effective strategies for mitigating them when deemed unacceptable is vital.

At the individual level, a simple process of identifying objectives and risks, weighing their importance and creating plans, may be all that's necessary. At the strategic organisational level, more elaborate policies are necessary, specifying acceptable levels of risk, procedures to be followed within the organisation, priorities, and allocation of resources.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;{{rp|10}} At the systematic level, management involved with the project produce project level risk assessments with the assistance of the available expertise as part of the planning process, and set up systems to ensure that required actions to manage the assessed risk are in place. At the dynamic level, the personnel directly involved may be required to deal with unforeseen problems in real time. The tactical decisions made at this level should be reviewed after the operation to provide feedback on the effectiveness of both the planned procedures and decisions made in response to the contingency.

The first step in risk assessment is to establish the context. This restricts the range of hazards to be considered.

This is followed by ''identification of visible and implied hazards'' that may threaten the project, and ''determining the qualitative nature of the potential adverse consequences'' of each hazard. Without a potential adverse consequence, there is no hazard.

It is also necessary to identify the potential parties or assets which may be affected by the threat, and the potential consequences to them if the hazard is activated.

If the consequences are dependent on dose, i.e. the amount of exposure, the relationship between dose and severity of consequence must be established, and the risk depends on the probable dose, which may depend on concentration or amplitude and duration or frequency of exposure. This is the general case for many health hazards where the mechanism of injury is toxicity or repetitive injury, particularly where the effect is cumulative.

For other hazards, the consequences may either occur or not, and the severity may be extremely variable even when the triggering conditions are the same. This is typical of many biological hazards as well as a large range of safety hazards. Exposure to a pathogen may or may not result in actual infection, and the consequences of infection may also be variable. Similarly a fall from the same place may result in minor injury or death, depending on unpredictable details. In these cases estimates must be made of reasonably likely consequences and associated probability of occurrence.

In cases where statistical records are available they may be used to evaluate risk, but in many cases there are no data or insufficient data available to be useful. Mathematical or experimental models may provide useful input.

=== Dose dependent risk ===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food risk assessment [[nomogram]]]]

#''Dose-Response Analysis'', is determining the relationship between dose and the type of adverse response and/or probability or the incidence of effect (dose-response assessment). The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals (e.g. [[mouse]], [[rat]]) to humans, and/or from high to lower doses, including from high acute occupational levels to low chronic environmental levels. In addition, the differences between individuals due to [[genetics]] or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine a concentration unlikely to yield observable effects, that is, a [[no effect concentration]]. In developing such a dose, to account for the largely unknown effects of animal to human extrapolations, increased variability in humans, or missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety or uncertainty factors in the estimate of the "safe" dose, typically a factor of 10 for each unknown step.
#''Exposure Quantification'', aims to determine the amount of a contaminant (dose) that individuals and populations will receive, either as a contact level (e.g., concentration in ambient air) or as intake (e.g., daily dose ingested from drinking water). This is done by examining the results of the discipline of [[exposure assessment]]. As different location, lifestyles and other factors likely influence the amount of contaminant that is received, a range or distribution of possible values is generated in this step. Particular care is taken to determine the exposure of the susceptible population(s).

The results of these steps are combined to produce an estimate of risk. Because of the different susceptibilities and exposures, this risk will vary within a population. An uncertainty analysis is usually included in a health risk assessment.

== Dynamic risk assessment ==
During an emergency response, the situation and hazards are often inherently less predictable than for planned activities (non-linear). In general, if the situation and hazards are predictable (linear), standard operating procedures should deal with them adequately. In some emergencies this may also hold true, with the prepared and trained responses being adequate to manage the situation. In these situations, the operator can manage risk without outside assistance, or with the assistance of a backup team who are prepared and available to step in at short notice.

Other emergencies occur where there is no previously planned protocol, or when an outsider group is brought in to handle the situation, and they are not specifically prepared for the scenario that exists but must deal with it without undue delay. Examples include police, fire department, disaster response and other public service rescue teams. In these cases ongoing risk assessment by the involved personnel can advise appropriate action to reduce risk.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt; HM Fire Services Inspectorate has defined dynamic risk assessment (DRA) as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of an operational incident, in order to implement the control measures necessary to ensure an acceptable level of safety.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lock|first1=Gareth|editor1-last=Phillips|editor1-first=Mark|title=Public Safety Diving-Dynamic Risk Assessment|journal=PS Diver Magazine|date=June 2017|issue=116|page=9|url=http://psdiver.com/images/PSDiver_Issue_116_-_SECURE.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2017|publisher=PSDiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dynamic risk assessment is the final stage of an integrated safety management system which can provide appropriate response during changing circumstances. It relies on experience, training and continuing education, including effective debriefing to analyse not only what went wrong, but also what went right, and why, and to share this with other members of the team and the personnel responsible for the planning level risk assessment.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;

==Fields of application==
Application of risk assessment procedures is common in a wide range of fields, and these may have specific legal obligations, codes of practice and standardised procedures. Some of these are listed here.

=== General health ===
There are many resources that provide health risk information.

The [[National Library of Medicine]] provides risk assessment and regulation information tools for a varied audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment and Regulation Information from the NLM|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/riskinformation.html|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* TOXNET (databases on hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|work=TOXNET|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Household Products Database (potential health effects of chemicals in over 10,000 common household products),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Household Products Database|url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TOXMAP]] (maps of the [[Superfund|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund]] and [[Toxics Release Inventory]] data).
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides basic information about environmental health risk assessments for the public for a wide variety of possible environmental exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment Portal|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency began actively using risk assessment methods to protect drinking water in the United States after passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. The law required the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on drinking water issues, and in its report the NAS described some methodologies for doing risk assessments for chemicals that were suspected carcinogens, recommendations that top EPA officials have described as perhaps the study’s most important part.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=11 Transcript] (see pages 11,14).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the increase in junk food and its toxicity, FDA required in 1973 that cancer-causing compounds must not be present in meat at concentrations that would cause a cancer risk greater than 1 in a million over a lifetime. The US Environmental Protection Agency provides extensive information about ecological and environmental risk assessments for the public via its risk assessment portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|title=Risk Assessment|last=EPA, ORD, NCEA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) supports a qualitative risk framework for public health protection from chemicals that display environmental and biological persistence, [[bioaccumulation]], toxicity (PBT) and long range transport; most global chemicals that meet this criteria have been previously assessed quantitatively by national and international health agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |issue=Edition |pages=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Small sub-populations ====
When risks apply mainly to small sub-populations, there is uncertainty at which point intervention is necessary. For example, there may be a risk that is very low for everyone, other than 0.1% of the population. It is necessary to determine whether this 0.1% is represented by:
* all infants younger than ''X'' days or
* recreational users of a particular product.

If the risk is higher for a particular sub-population because of abnormal exposure rather than susceptibility, strategies to further reduce the exposure of that subgroup are considered.  If an identifiable sub-population is more susceptible due to inherent genetic or other factors, public policy choices must be made. The choices are:
* to set policies for protecting the general population that are protective of such groups, e.g. for children when data exists, the Clean Air Act for populations such as asthmatics or
* not to set policies, because the group is too small, or the costs too high.

==== Acceptable risk criteria ====
The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/iwachap10.pdf|title=Acceptable Risk|first1=Paul R.|last1=Hunter|first2=Lorna|last2=Fewtrell|publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]''|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk.

Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially "acceptable" if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk.  Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives or other chemicals.

In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity.

Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives.  There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no [[incineration]] is potential spread of infectious diseases, or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator.

Intelligent thought about a reasonably full set of options is essential.  Thus, it is not unusual for there to be an iterative process between analysis, consideration of options, and follow up analysis.

===Auditing===
For audits performed by an outside audit firm, risk assessment is a crucial stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 ''Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement'', "the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control". Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and Detection risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows:  [[inherent risk]] × [[control risk]] × [[detection risk]].

=== Public health ===
In the context of [[public health]], risk assessment is the process of characterizing the nature and likelihood of a harmful effect to individuals or populations from certain human activities. Health risk assessment can be mostly qualitative or can include statistical estimates of probabilities for specific populations. In most countries the use of specific chemicals or the operations of specific facilities (e.g. power plants, manufacturing plants) is not allowed unless it can be shown that they do not increase the risk of death or illness above a specific threshold. For example, the American [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates food safety through risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Richard A. "Food Safety Regulation: Reforming the Delaney Clause" in ''Annual Review of Public Health'', 1997, 18:313-40. This source includes a useful historical survey of prior food safety regulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project management===
In [[project management]], risk assessment is an integral part of the risk management plan, studying the probability, the impact, and the effect of every known risk on the project, as well as the corrective action to take should an incident implied by a risk occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/managing-project-risks Managing Project Risks] - Retrieved May 20th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Of special consideration in this area are the relevant codes of practice that are enforced in the specific jurisdiction. Understanding the regime of regulations that risk management must abide by is integral to formulating safe and compliant risk assessment practices.

=== Information security ===
{{Main|IT risk management#Risk assessment}}

[[IT risk|Information technology risk]] assessment can be performed by a qualitative or quantitative approach, following different methodologies. One important difference{{clarify|reason=difference from what?|date=June 2017}} in risk assessments in information security is modifying the threat model to account for the fact that any adversarial system connected to the Internet has access to threaten any other connected system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk assessments may therefore need to be modified to account for the threats from all adversaries, instead of just those with reasonable access as is done in other fields.

Another notable difference is the strategic nature of IT risk assessments.  Unlike tactical vulnerability assessments and penetration testing which aim to identify and close specific gaps in security, IT risk assessments are functional at the executive level to examine the broader picture of IT risk management.{{clarify|reason=what does this actually mean|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Rob|title=3 Types of Security Assessments|url=https://threatsketch.com/3-types-cyber-security-assessments/|website=Threat Sketch|publisher=Threat Sketch|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Megaprojects ===
[[Megaprojects]] (sometimes also called "major programs") are extremely large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than US$1 billion per project. They include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defence systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.

=== Software evolution ===
Studies have shown that early parts of the system development cycle such as requirements and design specifications are especially prone to error. This effect is particularly notorious in projects involving multiple [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] with different points of view. Evolutionary software processes offer an iterative approach to [[Requirements engineering|requirement engineering]] to alleviate the problems of uncertainty, ambiguity and inconsistency inherent in software developments.{{clarify|reason=What does this have to do with risk assessment?|date=June 2017}}

=== Shipping industry ===
In July 2010, shipping companies agreed to use standardized procedures in order to assess risk in key shipboard operation. These procedures were implemented as part of the amended [[International Safety Management Code|ISM Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISM CODE – Amendments from 1st July 2010 Risk Assessment |url=http://www1.veristar.com/veristar/dps_info.nsf/veristar/Dps_info.nsf/AllByDateInternal/353FC02A22D59873C1257734003EC51C?opendocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underwater diving ===
{{see also|List of diving hazards and precautions}}
Formal risk assessment is a required component of most [[Professional diving|professional dive planning]], but the format and methodology may vary. Consequences of an incident due to an identified hazard are generally chosen from a small number of standardised categories, and probability is estimated based on statistical data on the rare occasions when it is available, and on a best guess estimate based on personal experience and company policy in most cases. A simple matrix is often used to transform these inputs into a level of risk, generally expressed as unacceptable, marginal or acceptable. If unacceptable, measures must be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, and the final outcome of the risk assessment must be accepted by the affected parties before a dive commences. Higher levels of risk may be acceptable in special circumstances, such as military or search and rescue operations when there is a chance of recovering a survivor. [[Diving supervisor]]s are trained in the procedures of [[hazard identification and risk assessment]], and it is part of their planning and operational responsibility. Both health and safety hazards must be considered. Several stages may be identified. There is risk assessment done as part of the diving project planning, on site risk assessment which takes into account the specific conditions of the day, and [[dynamic risk assessment]] which is ongoing during the operation by the members of the dive team, particularly the supervisor and the working diver.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Diving Regulations 2009 |work=Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 – Regulations and Notices – Government Notice R41 |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |publisher=Government Printer |location=Pretoria |via=Southern African Legal Information Institute |accessdate=3 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104080007/http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMCA D022 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staff|first=|title=Guidance for diving supervisors IMCA D 022|edition=Revision 1|date=August 2016|publisher=International Marine Contractors Association|location=London, UK|pages=15{{hyphen}}5|chapter=15 - General safety requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[recreational scuba diving]], the extent of risk assessment expected of the diver is relatively basic, and is included in the [[Buddy check|pre-dive checks]]. Several mnemonics have been developed by [[diver certification agencies]] to remind the diver to pay some attention to risk, but the training is rudimentary. Diving service providers are expected to provide a higher level of care for their customers, and [[diving instructor]]s and [[divemaster]]s are expected to assess risk on behalf of their customers and warn them of site-specific hazards and the competence considered appropriate for the planned dive. Technical divers are expected to make a more thorough assessment of risk, but as they will be making an informed choice for a recreational activity, the level of acceptable risk may be considerably higher than that permitted for occupational divers under the direction of an employer.&lt;ref name="Diving at Work Regulations 1997" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2776/made |title=The Diving at Work Regulations 1997 |last=Staff |year=1977 |work=Statutory Instruments 1997 No. 2776 Health and Safety |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) |location=Kew, Richmond, Surrey |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurr 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Kevin |editor-last=Mount |editor-first=Tom|editor2-last=Dituri |editor2-first=Joseph|title=Exploration and Mixed Gas Diving Encyclopedia|edition=1st|date=August 2008|publisher=International Association of Nitrox Divers|location=Miami Shores, Florida|isbn=978-0-915539-10-9|pages=165–180|chapter=13: Operational Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor and wilderness adventure===
In outdoor activities including commercial outdoor education, wilderness expeditioning and [[Outdoor_recreation | outdoor recreation]], risk assessment refers to analysis of the probability and magnitude of unfavorable outcomes such as injury, illness, or property damage due to environmental and related causes, compared to the human development or other benefits of outdoor activity. This is of particular importance as school programs and others weigh the benefits of youth and adult participation in various outdoor learning activities against the inherent and other hazards present in those activities.  Schools, corporate entities seeking team-building experiences, parents/guardians, and others considering outdoor experiences expect or require&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nwais.org/uploaded/accreditation_resources/2018_Membership_AccredRubric.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; organizations to assess the hazards and risks of different outdoor activities—such as sailing, mountaineering, or camping—and select activities with acceptable risk profiles.

Outdoor education, wilderness adventure, and other outdoor-related organizations should, and are in some jurisdictions required, to conduct risk assessments prior to offering programs for commercial purposes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportadventure.co.nz/adventure-activities-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2016/0019/latest/DLM6725703.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/aala/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Such organizations are given guidance on how to provide their risk assessments&lt;ref&gt;https://worksafe.govt.nz/topic-and-industry/adventure-activities&lt;/ref&gt; and external consultancy services provide these assessments as well&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outdoorsafetyinstitute.com/pages/reviews/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.viristar.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nols.edu/en/about/risk-services/&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Environment ===
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) aims at assessing the effects of stressors, often chemicals, on the local environment. A risk is an integrated assessment of likelihood and severity of an undesired event. In ERA, the undesired event often depends on the chemical of interest and on the risk assessment scenario.&lt;ref name="Goussen et al 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goussen|first=Benoit|last2=Price|first2=Oliver R.|last3=Rendal|first3=Cecilie|last4=Ashauer|first4=Roman|date=2016-10-26|title=Integrated presentation of ecological risk from multiple stressors|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep36004|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep36004|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5080554|pmid=27782171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This undesired event is usually a detrimental effect on organisms, populations or ecosystems. Current ERAs usually compare an exposure to a no-effect level, such as the [[Predicted environmental concentration|Predicted Environmental Concentration]]/[[Predicted no-effect concentration|Predicted No-Effect Concentration]] (PEC/PNEC) ratio in Europe. Although this type of ratio is useful and often used in regulation purposes, it is only an indication of an exceeded apparent threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jager|first=Tjalling|last2=Heugens|first2=Evelyn H. W.|last3=Kooijman|first3=Sebastiaan A. L.

=== Biodiversity ===
Biodiversity Risk Assessments evaluate risks to [[biological diversity]], specially the risk of [[species]] [[extinction]] or the risk of [[ecosystem collapse]]. The units of assessments are the biological (species, [[subspecies]] or [[population]]s) or ecological entities ([[habitat]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, etc), and the risk are often related to human actions and interventions (threats and pressures). Regional and national protocols have been proposed by multiple academic or governmental institutions and working groups,&lt;ref name="NicholsonRegan2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Emily|last2=Regan|first2=Tracey J.|last3=Auld|first3=Tony D.|last4=Burns|first4=Emma L.|last5=Chisholm|first5=Laurie A.|last6=English|first6=Valerie|last7=Harris|first7=Stephen|last8=Harrison|first8=Peter|last9=Kingsford|first9=Richard T.|last10=Leishman|first10=Michelle R.|last11=Metcalfe|first11=Daniel J.|last12=Pisanu|first12=Phil|last13=Watson|first13=Christopher J.|last14=White|first14=Matthew|last15=White|first15=Matt D.|last16=Williams|first16=Richard J.|last17=Wilson|first17=Bruce|last18=Keith|first18=David A.|title=Towards consistency, rigour and compatibility of risk assessments for ecosystems and ecological communities|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=40|issue=4|year=2015|pages=347–363|issn=14429985|doi=10.1111/aec.12148}}&lt;/ref&gt; but global standards such as the [[Red List of Threatened Species]] and the [[IUCN Red List of Ecosystems]] have been widely adopted, and are recognized or proposed as official indicators of progress toward international policy targets and goals, such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Aichi targets]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="KeithRodríguez2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=David A.|last2=Rodríguez|first2=Jon Paul|last3=Brooks|first3=Thomas M.|last4=Burgman|first4=Mark A.|last5=Barrow|first5=Edmund G.|last6=Bland|first6=Lucie|last7=Comer|first7=Patrick J.|last8=Franklin|first8=Janet|last9=Link|first9=Jason|last10=McCarthy|first10=Michael A.|last11=Miller|first11=Rebecca M.|last12=Murray|first12=Nicholas J.|last13=Nel|first13=Jeanne|last14=Nicholson|first14=Emily|last15=Oliveira-Miranda|first15=María A.|last16=Regan|first16=Tracey J.|last17=Rodríguez-Clark|first17=Kathryn M.|last18=Rouget|first18=Mathieu|last19=Spalding|first19=Mark D.|title=The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems: Motivations, Challenges, and Applications|journal=Conservation Letters|volume=8|issue=3|year=2015|pages=214–226|issn=1755263X|doi=10.1111/conl.12167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrooksButchart2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Butchart|first2=Stuart H.M.|last3=Cox|first3=Neil A.|last4=Heath|first4=Melanie|last5=Hilton-Taylor|first5=Craig|last6=Hoffmann|first6=Michael|last7=Kingston|first7=Naomi|last8=Rodríguez|first8=Jon Paul|last9=Stuart|first9=Simon N.|last10=Smart|first10=Jane|title=Harnessing biodiversity and conservation knowledge products to track the Aichi Targets and Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Biodiversity|volume=16|issue=2-3|year=2015|pages=157–174|issn=1488-8386|doi=10.1080/14888386.2015.1075903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Social epistemology''' refers to a broad set of approaches that can be taken in the study of [[knowledge]] that construes human knowledge as a collective achievement. Another way of characterizing social epistemology is as the evaluation of the social dimensions of knowledge or information.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{Cite SEP|url-id=epistemology-social|title=Social Epistemology|first=Alvin|last=Goldman|first2=Thomas|last2=Blanchard|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes simplified to mean a social justification of belief.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

One of the enduring difficulties with defining "social epistemology" that arises is the attempt to determine what the word "knowledge" means in this context. There is also a challenge in arriving at a definition of "social" which satisfies academics from different disciplines.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; Social epistemologists may exist working in many of the disciplines of the humanities and [[social sciences]], most commonly in [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]]. In addition to marking a distinct movement in traditional and analytic [[epistemology]], social epistemology is associated with the interdisciplinary field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS).

== History ==
The consideration of social dimensions of knowledge in relation to philosophy started in 380 B.C.E with Plato's dialogue: [[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]. In it he questions the degree of certainty an unprofessional in a field can have towards a person's claim to be a specialist in that same field. As the exploration of a dependence on authoritative figures constitutes a part of the study of social epistemology, it confirms the existence of the ideology in minds long before it was given its label. 

In 1936, [[Karl Mannheim]] turned [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of ideology (which interpreted the "social" aspect in epistemology to be of a political or sociological nature) into an analysis of how the human society develops and functions.

It was not until the 1970s that there was a powerful growth of interest amongst philosophers in topics such as epistemic value of testimony, the nature and function of expertise, proper distribution of cognitive labor and resources among individuals in the communities and the status of group reasoning and knowledge.

=== The rise of social epistemology ===
The term "social epistemology" was firstly used by the library scientists [[Margaret Egan]] and [[Jesse Shera]] in the 1950s. [[Steven Shapin]] also used it in 1979. However, it was not until the late 1980s that its current sense began to emerge. In 1987, the philosophical journal ''[[Synthese]]'' published a special issue on social epistemology which included two authors that have since taken the branch of epistemology in two divergent directions: [[Alvin Goldman]] and [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;A comparison of Goldman and Fuller can be found in ''Legitimizing Scientific Knowledge: An Introduction to Steve Fuller's Social Epistemology'', Francis Remedios, Lexington Books, 2003. pp.&amp;nbsp;106 –112. http://social-epistemology.com/2013/07/12/orienting-social-epistemology-francis-remedios/&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller founded a journal called ''[[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology: A journal of knowledge, culture, and policy]]'' in 1987 and published his first book, ''Social Epistemology'', in 1988. Goldman's ''Knowledge in a Social World'' came out in 1999. Goldman advocates for a type of epistemology which is sometimes called "veritistic epistemology" because of its large emphasis on truth.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{url|http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/PES-Yearbook/95_docs/goldman.html}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of epistemology is sometimes seen to side with "essentialism" as opposed to "multiculturalism".&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; But Goldman has argued that this association between veritistic epistemology and essentialism is not necessary.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; He describes Social Epistemology as knowledge derived from one's interactions with another person, group or society. 

Goldman looks into one of the two strategies of the socialization of epistemology. This strategy includes the evaluation of social factors that impact knowledge formed on true belief. In contrast, Fuller takes preference for the second strategy that defines knowledge influenced by social factors as collectively accepted belief. The difference between the two can be simplified with exemplars e.g.: the first strategy means analyzing how your degree of wealth (a social factor) influences what information you determine to be valid whilst the second strategy occurs when an evaluation is done on wealth’s influence upon your knowledge acquired from the beliefs of the society in which you find yourself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimkutė|first=Audronė|date=2014|title=The Problem of Social Knowledge in Contemporary Social Epistemology: Two Approaches|url=http://www.journals.vu.lt/problemos/article/view/6645|journal=Problemos|language=lt|volume=0|issue=65|pages=4–19|doi=10.15388/Problemos.2004.65.6645|issn=1392-1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of ''Social Epistemology'', Fuller reflected upon the history and the prospects of the field, including the need for social epistemology to re-connect with the larger issues of knowledge production first identified by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] as ''cognitive economy'' and nowadays often pursued by [[library and information science]]. As for the "analytic social epistemology", to which Goldman has been a significant contributor, Fuller concludes that it has "failed to make significant progress owing, in part, to a minimal understanding of actual knowledge practices, a minimised role for philosophers in ongoing inquiry, and a focus on maintaining the status quo of epistemology as a field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Social Epistemology: A Quarter-Century Itinerary|journal=Social Epistemology|volume=26|issue=3-4|year=2012|doi=10.1080/02691728.2012.714415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic view of knowledge that motivated the emergence of social epistemology as it is perceived today can be traced to the work of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michel Foucault]], which gained acknowledgment at the end of the 1960s. Both brought historical concerns directly to bear on problems long associated with the [[philosophy of science]]. Perhaps the most notable issue here was the nature of [[truth]], which both Kuhn and Foucault described as a relative and contingent notion. On this background, ongoing work in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] (SSK) and the [[history and philosophy of science]] (HPS) was able to assert its epistemological consequences, leading most notably to the establishment of the [[strong programme]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In terms of the two strands of social epistemology, Fuller is more sensitive and receptive to this historical trajectory (if not always in agreement) than Goldman, whose "veritistic" social epistemology can be reasonably read as a systematic rejection of the more extreme claims associated with Kuhn and Foucault.

==Social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy==
As a field within [[analytic philosophy]], social epistemology foregrounds the social aspects of knowledge creation and dissemination. What precisely these social aspects are, and whether they have beneficial or detrimental effects upon the possibilities to create, acquire and spread knowledge is a subject of continuous debate.

Within the field, "the social" is approached in two complementary and not mutually exclusive ways: "the social" character of knowledge can either be approached through inquiries in ''inter-individual'' epistemic relations or through inquiries focusing on epistemic ''communities''. The inter-individual approach typically focuses on issues such as [[testimony]], epistemic trust as a form of trust placed by one individual in another, epistemic dependence, epistemic authority, etc. The community approach typically focuses on issues such as community standards of justification, community procedures of critique, diversity, epistemic justice, and collective knowledge.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

Social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy has close ties to, and often overlaps with [[feminist epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]]. While parts of the field engage in abstract, normative considerations of knowledge creation and dissemination, other parts of the field are "naturalized epistemology" in the sense that they draw on empirically gained insights---which could mean [[natural science]] research from, e.g., [[cognitive psychology]], be that [[qualitative research|qualitative]] or [[quantitative research|quantitative]] [[social science]] research. (For the notion of "naturalized epistemology" see [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].) And while parts of the field are concerned with analytic considerations of rather general character, case-based and domain-specific inquiries in, e.g., knowledge creation in collaborative scientific practice, knowledge exchange on online platforms or knowledge gained in learning institutions play an increasing role.

Important academic journals for social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy are, e.g., ''[[Episteme (journal)|Episteme]]'', ''[[Hypatia (journal)|Hypatia]]'', ''[[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology]]'', and ''[[Synthese]]''. However, major works within this field are also published in journals that predominantly address philosophers of science and psychology or in interdisciplinary journals which focus on particular domains of inquiry (such as, e.g., ''[[Ethics and Information Technology]]'').

== Major philosophers who influenced social epistemology ==
# [[Plato]] in [[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides Dialogue]]
# [[John Locke]] in Problem of Testimony
# [[David Hume]] in Problem of Testimony
# [[Thomas Reid]] in Problem of Testimony
# [[Karl Marx]] in Conception of Ideology
#* extended by [[Karl Mannheim]] who portrayed the sociological aspect of knowledge with the reasoning that a knowledge claim's validity is restricted by the social conditions wherein the claims were initially made.

==Present and future concerns==
In both stages, both varieties of social epistemology remain largely "academic" or "theoretical" projects. Yet both emphasize the social significance of knowledge and therefore the cultural value of social epistemology itself. A range of journals publishing social epistemology welcome papers that include a policy dimension. 

More practical applications of social epistemology can be found in the areas of [[library science]], [[academic publishing]], guidelines for scientific authorship and collaboration, [[knowledge policy]] and debates over the role over the Internet in knowledge transmission and creation.

Social epistemology is still considered a relatively new addition to philosophy, with its problems and theories still fresh and in rapid movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitt|first=Frederick F.|last2=Scholz|first2=Oliver R.|date=2010|title=Introduction: The History of Social Epistemology|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/introduction-the-history-of-social-epistemology/DDCF782B4CDBEBD2098140847C64700C|journal=Episteme|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.3366/E174236000900077X|issn=1750-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statkraft osmotic power prototype''' is the world's first [[osmotic power]] plant, based on the energy of [[osmosis]]. The power plant is run by [[Statkraft]]. The power plant is located at [[Tofte, Norway|Tofte]] in [[Hurum]], [[Norway]], with rooms at the factory area at [[Södra Cell Tofte]] cellulose factory. The power plant uses the osmotic gradient that occurs when fresh water and salt water meet, separated by a permeable membrane. The salt water pulls fresh water through the membrane and the pressure increases on the salt water side; this pressure increase can be used to produce [[electrical power]] with the use of a normal hydroelectric turbine/generator setup. 

The plant is a prototype developed together with [[Sintef]] and began test power production on 24 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10404158-54.html November 24, 2009, cnet.com: Norway opens world's first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2009/11/30/RTV2324909/ 30 November 2009, itnsource.com: NORWAY: World's first osmotic power plant opens in Tofte]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frifagbevegelse.no/anb-nyheter/article4722834.ece 24.11.2009, Åpnet verdens første saltkraftanlegg. Oslo (ANB-NTB)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015805/http://www.frifagbevegelse.no/anb-nyheter/article4722834.ece |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway]] officially opened the plant. This plant had been planned since the summer of 2008, with a water usage of 10 litres of fresh water and 20 litres of salt water per second. It is expected to give a power output of between 2-4 [[kW]]. With better membranes it is assumed that the power for a similar plant can be increased to about 10&amp;nbsp;kW. A commercial plant is expected to be built between 2012 and 2015.

In 2013, Statkraft announced that is discontinuing its work to develop osmotic power technology. The larger planned pilot facility, and the future commercial plant, will not be built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/presscentre/news/statkraft-halts-osmotic-power-investments.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213005850/http://www.statkraft.com/presscentre/news/statkraft-halts-osmotic-power-investments.aspx |date=2014-02-13 }} Statkraft halts osmotic power investments&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
This type of power generation is very reliable, consisting of only slightly more moving parts than a conventional hydroelectric power plant; in this case the addition of a pair of small pumps to move the fresh and salt water to the membrane surfaces. It is very quiet when operating and requires minimal supervision. In addition, it is expected the plant could respond very quickly as an emergency power source, using the membranes to 'store' power ready in the form of high pressure water; this water could be very quickly fed to the hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity. The expected lifetime of this plant is large; with almost no moving parts (those that do move are very simple and reliable), there will be little wear occurring. The availability of spare parts and upgrade components is also good, meaning that an installed osmotic power plant could be run for many years cost-effectively.

==Disadvantages==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Whilst highly reliable, simple and cheap to run/maintain, this plant is very expensive to install. The permeable membrane is currently an expensive resource, and to have any meaningful output, a very large membrane area is required. The plant described in this article could reach a power output of 4&amp;nbsp;kW in ideal conditions. By comparison, an open cycle gas turbine a fraction of the size (such as the Rolls-Royce or GE aero-derivative gas turbines) could easily produce greater than 15MW for a fraction of the installation costs, although fuel and maintenance costs would be greater. This is an increase in power output 3750 times greater, with a land usage that is much smaller. Comparing the ideal power output of this plant to the rough average household consumption of a modern home detailed in the article [[domestic energy consumption]], it can be seen that this is a very limited technology - working back the figures, it equates that the average home requires 2&amp;nbsp;kW of power. Bear in mind however that advances in materials technology will likely greatly increase the power output per plant volume over time and thus make this a more useful form of power generation, particularly in remote locations where reliability is key and spare parts are difficult to come by (e.g. difficult-to-access coastal locations with a small stream or river nearby that can provide the fresh water required).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38813">'''System justification theory''' ('''SJT''') is a theory within [[social psychology]] that system-justifying beliefs serve a psychologically palliative function. It proposes that people have several underlying needs, which vary from individual to individual, that can be satisfied by the defense and justification of the status quo, even when the system may be disadvantageous to certain people. People have epistemic, existential, and relational needs that are met by and manifest as ideological support for the prevailing structure of social, economic, and political norms. Need for order and stability, and thus resistance to change or alternatives, for example, can be a motivator for individuals to see the status quo as good, legitimate, and even desirable.

According to system justification theory, people desire not only to hold favorable attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and the groups to which they belong (group-justification), but also to hold positive attitudes about the overarching social structure in which they are entwined and find themselves obligated to (system-justification). This system-justifying motive sometimes produces the phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, an acceptance of inferiority among low-status groups and a positive image of relatively higher status groups. Thus, the notion that individuals are simultaneously supporters and victims of the system-instilled norms is a central idea in system justification theory. Additionally, the passive ease of supporting the current structure, when compared to the potential price (material, social, psychological) of acting out against the status quo, leads to a shared environment in which the existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred. Alternatives to the status quo tend to be disparaged, and inequality tends to perpetuate.&lt;ref name="jostbanaji1994"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Origins==
Previous social psychological theories that aimed to explain intergroup behavior typically focused on the tendencies for people to have positive attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and their self-relevant groups (group-justification).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In other words, people are motivated to engage in behaviors that allow for them to maintain a high self-esteem and a positive image of their group.&lt;ref name=Jost&amp;Hunyady2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Orsolya Hunyady |title=The psychology of system justification and the palliative function of ideology|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=13|pages=111–153|doi=10.1080/10463280240000046}}&lt;/ref&gt;
System Justification theory addressed the additional, prevalent phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, in which people defend the social systems (status quo) even when it does not benefit, and in the long-run may even cause more harm, to the individual or the group to which he or she belongs. Out-group favoritism can manifest as a dis-identification on the part of members of lower social status with their own categorical grouping (social, ethnic, economic, political) and instead further support for the existing structure. Prior social psychology theories lacked explanation for and attention given to popular instances of out-group favoritism; thus, SJT was developed to further explain and understand why some people tend to legitimize the prevailing social systems, despite their being against one's interests, in a way that previous social psychological theories did not.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

==Theoretical influences==
While [[Social Identity Theory]], [[Cognitive Dissonance|Cognitive Dissonance Theory]], [[Just-world hypothesis|Just-World Hypothesis]], [[Social Dominance Theory]], and [[false consciousness|Marxist-Feminists Theories of Ideologies]] have heavily influenced System Justification Theory, it has also expanded on these perspectives, infusing them with the system-justification motive and behaviors.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
One of the most popular and well-known social psychological theories, [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] explains that people have a need to maintain cognitive consistency in order to retain a positive self-image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jostetal2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Brett W. Pelham |author3=Oliver Sheldon |author4=Bilian Sullivan |title=Social inequality and the reduction of ideological dissonance on behalf of the system: evidence of enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=33|issue=1|pages=13–36|doi=10.1002/ejsp.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; System justification theory builds off the cognitive dissonance framework, in that it posits people will justify a social system in order to retain a positive image of that social system, due to the fact that they inherently play a role (whether passive or active) in perpetuating it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Social identity theory===
Jost and colleagues interpret [[social identity theory]] as suggesting that when people are presented with intergroup conflict that threatens their social group identities people will justify behaviors like [[stereotypes|stereotyping]] and [[discrimination]] against outgroups in order to maintain their positive group image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This interpretation has been rejected by social identity theorists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/014466601164777|title=Social Identity Theory does not maintain that identification produces bias, and Self-categorization Theory does not maintain that salience is identification: Two comments on Mummendey, Klink and Brown|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=173–176|year=2001|last1=McGarty|first1=Craig|pmid=11446223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

People with out-group favoritism will hold more positive images of other, often higher status, groups (outgroups) than the groups they belong to (ingroups). Thus, the argument is that system justification theory builds on the foundations of social identity theory in attempting to account for the out-group favoritism observed in many disadvantaged group members that social identity theory does not.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jost|first=John T.|chapter=Outgroup favoritism and the theory of system justification: A paradigm for investigating the effects of socioeconomic success on stereotype content|title=Cognitive Social Psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition|year=2001|pages=89–102 |chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907081147/http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Jost%20(2001)%20Outgroup%20favoritism%20and%20the%20theory%20of%20system%20justification1.pdf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DE-cJ8F4rSMC&amp;pg=PA89|editor-first=Gordon B. |editor-last=Moskowitz|isbn=9780805834147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social dominance theory===
This theory has widely been compared to system justification theory since they are both system justifying theories. [[Social dominance theory]] focuses on people’s motive to maintain a positive group image by generally supporting hierarchical inequality at the group level. Individuals with a high social dominance orientation (SDO) will hold myths that tend to be hierarchy enhancing, which justify an in-group's place and their relation to it. Thus, in both social dominance theory and system justification theory, there are common threads of group-based opposition to equality and justification for maintaining intergroup inequalities through systemic norms.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin&amp;Hewstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Rubin|author2=Miles Hewstone |title=Social Identity, System Justification, and Social Dominance: Commentary on Reicher, Jost et al., and Sidanius et al.|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=823–844|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00400.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sidaniusetal2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sidanius|first=Jim|author2=Felicia Pratto |author3=Colette Van Laar |author4=Shana Levin |title=Social Dominance Theory: Its Agenda and Method|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=845–880|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00401.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief in a just world===
This [[Just-world theory|theory]] broadly explains that people are inclined to believe the world is generally fair, and that the outcomes of people’s behavior are subsequently deserved. Ideologies that relate to belief in a just world have to do with maintaining a sense of personal control and a desire to understand the world as non-random. Such ideologies include the protestant work ethic and belief in meritocracy. Essentially, belief in a just world feeds an epistemic need for predictability, order, and stability in one's environment. System justification theory, while keeping the perspective that people are inclined to believe the world is just, extracts the underlying epistemic needs of the just world ideology and uses them as support for why people are motivated to uphold the system. In other words, preference for stability, predictability, and the perception of personal control, over random chance, motivates one to see the status quo as fair and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This can be an issue, however, due to the fact that disadvantaged people can easily internalize their low position and blame themselves for 'shortcomings' or lack of 'successes.'

===False consciousness===
In order to account for the phenomenon of outgroup favoritism that is a main component of system justification, theorists have derived heavily from the Marxist-feminist theories on the prevailing ideologies as tools to preserve the system. In particular, the concept of [[false consciousness]], in which the dominant group in society believes their dominance to be destined, can help to inform why certain members of disadvantage groups sometimes engage in outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Further, system justification emphasizes that those that lack means of material production (lower status) are subject to the ideas, (cultural values, legislation, and social teachings) of the dominant, controlling group.

==Aspects of system justification theory==

===Rationalization of the status quo===

One of the main aspects of [[system justification theory]] explains that people are motivated to justify the [[status quo]] and view it as stable and desirable. To this extent, theorists have provided specific [[hypotheses|hypothesis]] in which the rationalization of the status quo can manifest. One consequence of the system-justifying motivation, is the rationalization of desirability of likely versus less-likely events.

Since people will be inclined to make sure their preferences are congruent with the status quo, in situations of inevitability, people are more likely to endorse the status quo as a coping mechanism for dealing with unpleasant realities. In essence, people will judge events that are more likely as more desirable than events that are less likely.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Anticipatory rationalization studies completed during presidential election in 2000 demonstrate how future candidate endorsement and desirability is dependent on the likelihood of that candidate winning.  When subjects of both the Republican and Democratic parties were told, for example, that it was probable that one candidate would win over the other, people of both parties tended to rationalize support for the more likely winner. System justification for seemingly inevitable and unavoidable outcomes serves as a stress/dissonance reducer and provides psychological and emotional consolation, as well as allowing the individual to feel a sense of control over external events.

Another way people rationalize the [[status quo]] is through the use of [[stereotypes]]. When people perceive threats to the predominant system, they are more inclined to cling to and back the existing structure, and one way of doing so is by means of endorsing [[stereotypes]] that rationalize inequality. If one considers oneself a member of a higher social status group (economic standing, race, gender) he or she will hold favorable stereotypes about their group and less positive ones toward lower status outgroups. As perceived legitimacy of the system or threat to it increases, members of both disadvantaged and advantaged groups will be more motivated to utilize [[stereotypes]] as explanatory rationalizations (no matter how weak) for unequal status differences. Those that belong to disadvantaged groups will tend to associate positive characteristics (favorable stereotypes) to high status members and lead low status group members to minimize negative feelings about their low status.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Thus, stereotype endorsement as system justification is consensual and holds a palliative function. This is true for both the ingroup and outgroup. Stereotypes also deflect blame of unfair status differences from the system and instead, attribute inequality to group traits or characteristics. Such rationalization for inequality via stereotyping is said to be what makes political conservatives happier than liberals. In a recent research study on the connection of system justification beliefs and [[ambivalent sexism]], researchers found that benevolent sexism beliefs related to higher [[life satisfaction]] through system justification. That is, both men and women may be motivated to hold benevolent sexism beliefs because such beliefs may help to promote the notion that the status quo is fair, which in turn can maintain life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0361684312456369|title = Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing? Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction|journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume = 36|issue = 4|pages = 432–443|year = 2012|last1 = Connelly|first1 = K.|last2 = Heesacker|first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outgroup favoritism===
In contrast to [[ingroup favoritism]], which holds that people have a motivation to regard the social groups that they belong in more positively than other groups, outgroup favoritism is when people tend to regard groups to which they do not belong more positively than the groups to which they are members.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists argue that this is an example or manifestation of how some people have unconsciously absorbed, processed, and attempted to cope with existing inequalities—more specifically, one's own disadvantaged position in the social hierarchy. Because people have a tendency to justify the status quo (which usually consists of inequality among groups) and believe that it is fair and legitimate, certain people from low status groups will accept, internalize, and hence perpetuate that inequality.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

Criticisms of outgroup favoritism have suggested observations of this in disadvantaged group members are simply manifestations of more general [[demand characteristics]] or [[social norms]] that encourage low status groups to evaluate other groups more positively.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In response to this, system justification theorists introduced both implicit and explicit measures of outgroup favoritism. It was found that low status group members still exhibited outgroup favoritism (i.e. preference for other groups) on both implicit and explicit measures, and they displayed higher instances of outgroup favoritism on implicit measures than on explicit (self-reported) measures. In contrast, people from high status groups were found to display [[ingroup favoritism]] more on implicit measures.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JostPelhamCarvallo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brett Pelham |author3=Mauricio Carvallo |title=Non-conscious forms of system justification: Implicit and behavioral preferences for higher status groups.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=38|issue=6|pages=586–602|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(02)00505-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it is expected that when motivation to justify the system or status quo increases and it is perceived to be more legitimate, high status group members will also display increased [[ingroup favoritism]], while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;
Researchers have also linked [[conservatism|political conservatism]] with system justification, in that conservatism is associated with upholding [[tradition]] and resistance to change, which is similar to justifying the status quo (or current state of social, political, and economic [[norm (social)|norm]]s). Along this vein, system justification theorists hold that high status group members will engage in increased [[ingroup favoritism]] the more politically conservative they are, while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism the more politically [[conservative]] they are.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Depressed entitlement===
Research on [[Male–female income disparity in the United States|wage disparities]] among men and women have found that women often believe they are paid less than men because they do not deserve equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hough|first=Mary|author2=Janice D. Yoder |title=The Role of Status in Producing Depressed Entitlement in Women's and Men's Pay Allocations|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2003|volume=27|issue=4|pages=330–337|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Major|first=Brenda|author2=Mark Zanna |chapter=From social inequality to personal entitlement: The role of social comparisons, legitimacy appraisals, and group membership|year=1994|volume=26|pages=293–355|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-00371-006|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60156-2|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152261}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depressed entitlement was first thought as the manifestation of women internalizing the low status of their gender compared to men. Subsequent research has found depressed entitlement occur across contexts in which gender was not a variable. System justification theorists have suggested that depressed entitlement is another general example of how individuals of low status groups absorb their inferiority in order to justify the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; As such, system justification holds that low status group members regardless of context will be more likely to display instances of depressed entitlement than high status group members. And this will be seen more among low status group members for completed work as opposed to work not yet completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanton|first=Hart|author2=Greg George |author3=Jennifer Crocker |title=Contexts of System Justification and System Evaluation: Exploring the Social Comparison Strategies of the (Not Yet) Contented Female Worker|journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=126–137|doi=10.1177/1368430201004002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ego, group, and system justification motives===
As previously stated, people are motivated by the desire for [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] to view themselves and their group positively (which can manifest through feelings of [[self-esteem]] and value).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; The system-justification motive is people’s desire to view the system or status quo in a favorable light as legitimate and fair. Among high status group members, all three of these motives are congruent with one another. The need to believe the system is just and fair is easy for high status group members because they are the groups benefiting from the system and status quo. Therefore, as the advantaged groups, holding positive regard for the self and group corresponds readily with believing the status quo is legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;

In particular, as system justification motives increase for high status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will decrease, levels of [[self-esteem]] will increase, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will decrease.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; For low status groups, the [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] motives come into conflict with the system-justification motive. If low status group members have a desire to believe the status quo and prevailing system is fair and legitimate, then this would conflict with the motivation of these individuals to maintain positive self and group images. Theorists posit that this conflict of justification motives creates conflicting or [[ambivalence|mixed attitudes]] in low status groups as a result of being the disadvantaged group that does not necessarily benefit from the status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Diana Burgess |title=Attitudinal Ambivalence and the Conflict between Group and System Justification Motives in Low Status Groups|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2000|volume=26|issue=3|pages=293–305|doi=10.1177/0146167200265003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As system justification motives increase for low status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will increase and occur at stronger levels compared to high status groups, levels of [[self-esteem]] will decrease, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will increase. Moreover, researchers suggest that when ego and group justification motives are particularly decreased, system-justification motives will increase.&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"/&gt;

===Enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged===
Based on [[cognitive dissonance theory]] that holds people have a need to reduce dissonance and maintain cognitive consistency, system justification theory explains that people are motivated to rationalize and justify instances of inequality in order to preserve and defend the legitimacy of the system.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Because people have this need to believe the current prevailing system is legitimate and the way it is for a reason, when presented with instances where this might threaten that, people will respond with more justifications to maintain the legitimacy of the system or status quo. Since high status group members regularly benefit from the prevailing system, they are expected to rarely be presented with examples that would threaten the legitimacy of the system. In contrast, it is expected that low status group members who do not benefit from the system, would be presented more regularly with threats to the legitimacy of the system and status quo. Thus, it is expected for system justification tendencies to increase in societies with more substantial group inequalities, and low status group members will be more inclined than high status group members to provide more intense justifications to rationalize and uphold the prevailing systems and status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Compensatory stereotypes===
Research has found that [[stereotypes|compensatory stereotypes]] might lead to increased justification of the status quo. That is, [[stereotypes]] that have components that would offset the negative aspects of the stereotypes would allow people to more easily explain or justify the inequality of the prevailing system.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; One of the more common examples is the compensatory stereotype of “poor but happy” or “rich but miserable.”&lt;ref name=KayJost2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Aaron|author2=John Jost |title=Complementary Justice: Effects of "Poor but Happy" and "Poor but Honest" Stereotype Exemplars on System Justification and Implicit Activation of the Justice Motive|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=5|pages=823–837|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.823|pmid=14599247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stereotypes like these that incorporate a positive aspect to counterbalance the negative aspect would lead people to increase their justification of the status quo. Other findings suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by those with more left leaning [[political ideologies]], while those with more right leaning [[political ideologies]] preferred non-complimentary stereotypes that simply rationalized [[Social inequality|inequality]] rather than compensated for it.&lt;ref name="Kay Jost2009"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Left–right ideological differences in system justification following exposure to complementary versus noncomplementary stereotype exemplars|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=39|issue=2|pages=290–298|doi=10.1002/ejsp.500|last1=Kay|first1=Aaron C.|last2=Czapliński|first2=Szymon|last3=Jost|first3=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But that overall, [[conservatives]] were more likely to have increased system justification tendencies than [[Liberalism|liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brian A.

Gosling |title=Ideology: Its Resurgence in Social, Personality, and Political Psychology|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=126–136|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00070.x|pmid=26158879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Jack Glaser |author3=Arie W.Kruglanski |author4=Frank Sulloway |title=Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2003|volume=129|issue=3|pages=339–375|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339|pmid=12784934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of system justification==
Consequences of people’s motivation to legitimize the status quo are wide-ranging. In needing to believe that the current or prevailing systems are fair and just, results in people justifying the existing inequalities within it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Research on system justification theory has been applied to many different social and political contexts that have found the theory has implications for general [[social change]], social policies, and specific [[communities]].
Research has found that people with increased system justification motives are more resistant to change, and thus an implication of this would be greater difficulty to move towards [[policy|policies]], [[governments]], [[authority]] figures, and [[hierarchies]] that reflect [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Gary|author2=John Jost |title=System Justification Theory and Research: Implications for Law, Legal Advocacy, and Social Justice|journal=California Law Review|year=2006|volume=94|issue=4|pages=1119–1168|jstor=20439060|doi=10.2307/20439060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that system justification motives reduce emotional distress in people that would otherwise result in demands for amendments to perceived [[injustices]] or inequalities. Specifically, [[moral outrage]], guilt, and [[frustration]] are reduced when system justification motives increase. This has shown to result in less support for social policies that redistribute resources in the aim for [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Orsola Hunyady |title=ecedents and Consequences of System-Justifying Ideologies|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=14|issue=5|pages=260–265|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakslak|first=Cheryl|author2=John T.

In developing countries, in which group inequalities are most evident, researchers were interested in testing the claim of system justification theory that when inequalities are more visible, this will result in greater justification of the status quo.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=PJ|author2=Andrea Saul |title=The Development of System Justification in the Developing World|journal=Social Justice Research|year=2006|volume=19|issue=3|pages=365–378|doi=10.1007/s11211-006-0012-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers visited the most impoverished areas of [[Bolivia]], and found that among children (aged 10–15) who were members of low status groups, legitimized the [[Bolivian government]] as sufficiently meeting the needs of the people more than children from high status groups. Observing system-justification motives in low status groups located in one of the most impoverished countries implies there will be less support for [[social change]] in a country that arguable needs it the most.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"/&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, there were different reactions to the devastation it brought to communities as well as the government’s [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]]. Researchers who have studied these reactions, found that the slow and inefficient response of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]] were perceived by some to expose “governmental shortcomings, call into question the legitimacy of agency leadership, and highlight [[racial inequality]] in [[United States of America|America]].”&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Jaime L.|author2=Anesu N.

As a result of this system threat, researchers found that people tended to restore legitimacy to the system through utilizing [[stereotypes]] and [[victim blaming]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;  In particular, since the majority of the communities affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]] were generally low-income and composed mostly of [[minorities]], some people used [[stereotypes]] to blame the victims for their misfortune and restore legitimacy to the [[government]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt; Researchers explained how this could have consequences for the victims and restoring their homes and communities back to normal. Increased system justification, and increased victim blaming could be detrimental in providing the victims the resources needed to work towards repairing the damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt;

==Critiques==

===Social identity theory debate===
This debate arose from [[social identity]] theorists countering a critique to the theory by system justification theorists. The critique by system justification theorists refers to the evidence for the theoretical conception of system justification theory that derived from limitations to [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists have stated that Social Identity Theory does not account for outgroup favoritism, and that the limitations of the theory only lend it to measure [[ingroup favoritism]]. Advocates for [[social identity theory]] claim that this critique is more a result of lack of research done that has focused on outgroup favoritism rather than a limitation of the theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt; Moreover, social identity theorists also claim this is not sufficient evidence for the need of system justification and [[Social Dominance Theory|social dominance]] theories to help account for justification motives. As such, they have claimed that research that measures outgroup favoritism from a social identity perspective is simply needed to bolster the theory. While both theories continue to produce findings, the debate continues to be discussed.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt;

===Relation to status quo bias===
Another critique is that SJT is too similar and indistinguishable to [[status quo bias]]. Given that both deal directly with upholding and legitimizing the status quo, this critique is not unfounded. But system justification theory differs from the [[status quo bias]] in that it is predominately [[motivational]] rather than [[cognitive]]. Generally, the status quo bias refers to a tendency to prefer the default or established option when making choices. In contrast, system justification posits that people need and want to see prevailing social systems as fair and just. The motivational component of system justification means that its effects are exacerbated when people are under psychological threat or when they feel their outcomes are especially dependent on the system that is being justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Current research==
Congruent with a broader trend toward [[neuroscience]], current research on system justification has tested to see how this manifests in the [[brain]]. Findings by researchers have shown that people with more [[conservative]] ideologies differed in certain [[brain]] structures, which was associated with sensitivity to threat and response conflict.&lt;ref name="Jost 2012 55–64"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=David Amodio |title=Political ideology as motivated social cognition: Behavioral and neuroscientific evidence|journal=Motivation and Emotion|year=2012|volume=36|issue=1|pages=55–64|doi=10.1007/s11031-011-9260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, those who were more [[conservative]] were “associated with greater neural sensitivity to threat and larger [[amygdala]] volume, as well as less sensitivity to response conflict and smaller [[anterior cingulate]] volume,” compared to those who were more [[liberalism|liberal]]. This research is currently exploratory and has not yet determined the direction of the relations to ideology and brain structures.&lt;ref name="Jost 2012 55–64"/&gt;

Recent findings by researchers have shown that system justification motives to legitimize the [[status quo]] was found in young children.&lt;ref name="Baron 2009 918–926"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=Andrew|author2=Mahzarin Banaji |title=Evidence of System Justification in Young Children|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|year=2009|volume=3|issue=6|pages=918–926|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00214.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through utilizing the [[developmental psychology|developmental psychological theory]] and data, children as early as age 5 were found to have basic understandings of their ingroup and the status of their ingroup. System justification motives were also observed in that children from low status groups were found display implicit outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Baron 2009 918–926"/&gt; Research on system justification in young children remains a current trend.

{{quote|I hope these lectures will contribute to the intellectual and moral life of mankind. I see them simply as a search for a better understanding of human behavior and human values.

{{Taoism}}
{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
'''Taoist sexual practices''' ({{lang-zh|s=房中术|t=房中術|p=fángzhōngshù}}), literally "the bedroom arts", are the ways [[Taoism|Taoists]] may practice [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].  These practices are also known as "Joining Energy" or "The Joining of the Essences".  Practitioners believe that by performing these sexual arts, one can stay in good health, and attain longevity or spiritual advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/heart-and-soul-healing/201210/tantric-and-taoist-practices-improve-sex|title=Tantric and Taoist Practices to Improve Sex|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr STEVEN LIU and JONATHAN BLANK SECRETS OF DRAGON GATE 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreattao.com/html/taoofsexology.html|title=Tao of Sexology: Sexual Wisdom and Methods|website=www.thegreattao.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some Taoist sects during the [[Han dynasty]] performed [[sexual intercourse]] as a spiritual practice, called "Héqì" (合氣], "Joining Energy"){{cn|date=October 2018}}. The first sexual texts that survive today are those found at the [[Mawangdui]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}. While [[Taoism]] had not yet fully evolved as a philosophy at this time, these texts shared some remarkable similarities with later [[Tang dynasty]] texts, such as the [[Ishinpō|Ishinpō (醫心方)]]. The sexual arts arguably reached their climax between the end of the [[Han dynasty]] and the end of the Tang dynasty{{cn|date=October 2018}}. 

After 1000 AD, [[Confucian]] restraining attitudes towards sexuality became stronger, so that by the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644, sex was a [[taboo]] topic in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. These Confucians alleged that the separation of genders in most social activities existed 2,000 years ago, and suppressed the sexual arts. Because of the [[taboo]] surrounding sex, there was much [[censorship|censoring]] done during the Qing in literature, and the sexual arts disappeared in public life{{cn|date=October 2018}}. As a result, some of the [[Document|texts]] survived only in [[Japan]], and most scholars had no idea that such a different concept of sex existed in [[History of China|early China]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Gulik (1961), preface&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and medieval practices==

===Qi (lifeforce) and jing (essence)===
The basis of all Taoist thinking is that [[qi| qi (氣)]] is part of everything in existence.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Qi is related to another energetic substance contained in the human body known as [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], and once all this has been expended the body dies. Jing can be lost in many ways, but most notably through the loss of body fluids. Taoists may use practices to stimulate/increase and conserve their bodily fluids to great extents.  The fluid believed to contain the most Jing is semen. Therefore, Taoists believe in decreasing the frequency of, or totally avoiding, ejaculation in order to conserve life essence.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male control of ejaculation===
Many [[Taoist]] practitioners link the loss of ejaculatory fluids to the loss of vital life force: where excessive fluid loss results in premature aging, disease, and general fatigue.  While some Taoists contend that one should never ejaculate, others provide a specific formula to determine the maximum amount of regular [[ejaculation]]s in order to maintain health.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea is to limit the loss of fluids as much as possible to the level of your desired practice.  As these sexual practices were passed down over the [[centuries]], some practitioners have given less importance to the limiting of ejaculation.  Nevertheless, the "retention of the [[semen]]" is one of the foundational tenets of Taoist sexual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different methods to control ejaculation prescribed by the Taoists. In order to avoid [[ejaculation]], the man could do one of several things. He could pull out immediately before [[orgasm]], a method which [[Joseph Needham]] termed "coitus conservatus".&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1983), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; A second method involved the man applying pressure on the [[perineum]], thus retaining the sperm. While, if done incorrectly can cause a [[retrograde ejaculation]], the Taoists believed that the jing traveled up into the head and "nourished the brain."&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1993), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jing===
Another important concept of "The Joining of the Essences" was that the union of a man and a woman would result in the creation of [[jing (TCM)|jing (精)]], a type of sexual energy. When in the act of lovemaking, jing would form, and the man could transform some of this jing into qi, and replenish his lifeforce. By having as much sex as possible, men had the opportunity to transform more and more jing, and as a result would see many health benefits.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 6"/&gt;

===Yin/Yang===

The concept of [[Yin and yang]] is important in Taoism, and consequently also holds special importance in sex. Yang usually referred to the male sex, whereas Yin could refer to the female sex. Man and Woman were the equivalent of heaven and earth, but became disconnected. Therefore, while heaven and earth are eternal, man and woman suffer a premature death.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  Every interaction between Yin and Yang had significance. Because of this significance, every position and action in lovemaking had importance. Taoist texts described a large number of special sexual positions that served to cure or prevent illness.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===

For Taoists, sex was not just about pleasing the man{{cn|date=October 2018}}. The woman also had to be stimulated and pleased in order to benefit from the act of sex{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and the man could more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the [[Ishinpō]], with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women had a great deal of strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

Women were often given a position of inferiority in sexual practice{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Many of the texts{{which|date=October 2018}} discuss sex from a male point of view, and avoid discussing how sex could benefit women. Men were encouraged to not limit themselves to one woman, and were advised to have sex only with the woman who was beautiful and not yet produced children. While the man had to please the woman sexually, she was still just an object.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; At numerous points during the Ishinpō, the woman is referred to as the "enemy"; this was because the woman could cause him to spill semen and lose vitality. In later sexual texts from the Ming, women had lost all semblance of being human and were referred to as the "other," "crucible", or "stove" from which to cultivate vitality.  The importance of pleasing the woman was also diminished in later texts.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was known as ([[:zh:采阴补阳|Caibu (採補)]]), as a man enters many women without ejaculation.

Women were also considered to be a means for men to extend men's lives{{cn}. Many of the ancient texts were dedicated explanation of how a man could use sex to extend his own life. But, his life was extended only through the absorption of the woman's vital energies (jing and qi). Some Taoists called the act of sex “The battle of stealing and strengthening.”&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These sexual methods could be correlated with Taoist military methods. Instead of storming the gates, the battle was a series of feints and maneuvers that would sap the enemy's resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===When and where===

Another text, ''Health Benefits of the Bedchamber''{{cn|date=October 2018}}, indicates that certain times were better for [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] than others. A person had to avoid having [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] on [[Quarter moon|quarter]] or [[full moon]]s and on [[days]] when there were great [[winds]], [[rain]], [[fog]], [[cold]] or [[heat]], [[thunder]], [[lightning]], [[darkness]] over [[heaven and earth]]{{dn|date=October 2018}}, [[solar eclipses|solar]] and [[lunar eclipses]], [[rainbow]]s and [[earthquake]]s. Having intercourse at these times would harm a [[man]]'s spirit and would cause [[women]] to become [[illness|ill]]. [[Children]] [[Fertilisation|conceived]] at these times would be [[wikt:mad|mad]], [[stupid]], [[perverse]] or [[wikt:foolish|foolish]]; [[Muteness|mute]], [[deaf]], [[crippled]] or [[Visual impairment|blind]]; [[Filial piety|unfilial]] and [[violent]]{{dubious|date=October 2018}}.

Also important was selecting the right day for intercourse if a person desired children. After the woman's [[menstrual period|period]], the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on these days the man [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] after [[midnight]], the child would likely be male. If a female child was desired, the man needed to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's [[menstrual period|period]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

The location of [[sex|sexual intercourse]] was also important. People had to avoid the glare of the [[sun]], [[moon]] or [[stars]], the interior of [[shrines]], proximity to [[temples]], [[Water well|wells]], [[stoves]] and [[wikt:privy|privies]], and the vicinity of [[grave]]s or [[coffin]]s{{cn|date=October 2018}}.

If these suggestions were followed "the family's offspring would be [[good]], wise and [[virtuous]]". If they were not followed, "the [[offspring]] would be [[evil]] and the [[family]] would eventually die off".&lt;ref&gt;Wile (1992), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity and immortality===
Some [[Ming dynasty]] Taoist [[sect]]s believed that one way for men to achieve longevity or 'towards immortality' is by having intercourse with [[virgin]]s, particularly young virgins. Taoist sexual books, such as the ''Hsuan wei Hshin'' ("Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques") and ''San Feng Tan Cheueh'' ("Zhang Sanfeng's Instructions in the Physiological Alchemy"), written, respectively, by Zhao Liangpi and Zhang Sanfeng (not to be confused with semi-mythical [[Zhang Sanfeng]] who lived in an earlier period), call the woman sexual partner ''[[Ding (vessel)|ding]]'' ([[wiktionary:鼎|鼎]]) and recommend sex with [[menarche|premenarche]] virgins. Zhao Liangpi concludes that the ideal ''ding'' is a premenarche virgin just under 14 years of age and women older than 18 should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mental Images of the Mysteries and Subtleties of Sexual Techniques |first1=Zhao |last1=Lianpi |first2=Hsuan Wei |last2=Hshin}} (published before 1850)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang Sanfeng went further and divided ''ding'' into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old [[Menstruation|menstruating]] virgins; the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XyChBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56 |author-link=Ruan Fangfu |first=Fang Fu |last=Ruan |editor-first=Molleen |editor-last=Matsumura |title=Sex in China: Studies in Sexology in Chinese Culture |date=31 October 1991 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |chapter=The Value of Virgins as Sex Partners |page=56 |quote=Almost all Taoist sex handbooks recommend that the "ding" should be a girl of 14 to 16, just before or after menarch.

Zhang '''Sanfeng''' went further and divided ding into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old menstruating virgin girls; and the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgin girls.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ge Hong]], a 4th-century Taoist [[alchemy|alchemist]], "those seeking 'immortality' must perfect the absolute essentials. These consist of treasuring the jing, circulating the qi and consuming the great medicine."&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"&gt;Wile (1992), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual arts concerned the first precept, treasuring the jing. This is partially because treasuring the jing involved sending it up into the brain. In order to send the jing into the brain, the male had to refrain from ejaculation during sex. According to some Taoists, if this was done, the jing would travel up the spine and nourish the brain instead of leaving the body. Ge Hong also states, however, that it is folly to believe that performing the sexual arts only can achieve immortality and some of the ancient myths on sexual arts had been misinterpreted and exaggerated. Indeed, the sexual arts had to be practiced alongside [[alchemy]] to attain longevity. Ge Hong also warned it could be dangerous if practiced incorrectly.&lt;ref name="Wile 1992, p. 24"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Technological somnambulism''' is a concept used when talking about the [[philosophy of technology]]. The term was used by [[Langdon Winner]] in his essay ''Technology as forms of life''. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of ''sleepwalking'' in our mediations with [[technology]]. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors.  One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again.  Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new ''worlds'' in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of &lt;!--using that--&gt;the technology (Winner 105-107).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "[http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Society_Fall_2010/Winner_Ttechnologies_as_Forms_of_Life.pdf Technologies as Forms of Life]". ''Readings in the Philosophy of Technology''. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0742564015}}. 103-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be found in the earlier work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], cf. ''[[Understanding Media]]'', where he refers to a comment made by [[David Sarnoff]] expressing a [[social determinism|socially deterministic]] view of "value free" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, "...the voice of the current somnambulism".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in [[Media Theory]] it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.gatech.edu/je77/222|title=Media Theory Reading List|website=home.cc.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/reading/montgomery.htm|title=Media Theory Reading List -- Harper Montgomery|website=csmt.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | title=Media Digital Humanities | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603180344/http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | archivedate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rabbit-erosion.jpg|thumb|An [[erosion|erosion gully]] in Australia caused by rabbits. The release of [[rabbits in Australia]] for hunting purposes has had serious unintended ecological consequences.]]
In the [[social sciences]], '''unintended consequences''' (sometimes '''unanticipated consequences''' or '''unforeseen consequences''') are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/nyregion/robert-k-merton-versatile-sociologist-and-father-of-the-focus-group-dies-at-92.html Robert K. Merton, Versatile Sociologist and Father of the Focus Group, Dies at 92], Michael T. Kaufman, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:
* ''Unexpected benefit'':  A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as [[luck]], [[serendipity]] or a [[wikt:windfall|windfall]]).
* ''Unexpected drawback'':  An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while [[irrigation]] schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase [[waterborne diseases]] that have devastating health effects, such as [[schistosomiasis]]).
* ''Perverse result'': A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse). This is sometimes referred to as 'backfire'.

==History==
===John Locke===
The idea of ''unintended consequences'' dates back at least to [[John Locke]] who discussed the unintended consequences of [[interest rate]] [[regulation]] in his letter to Sir John Somers, Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/763#lf0128-04_head_002''The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes''], (London: Rivington, 1824 12th ed.). Vol. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Smith===
The idea was also discussed by [[Adam Smith]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and [[consequentialism]] (judging by results).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments|page=93|url=http://metalibri.wikidot.com/title:theory-of-moral-sentiments:smith-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] popularised this concept in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renowned Columbia Sociologist and National Medal of Science Winner Robert K. Merton Dies at 92|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mar03/indextwo.html Robert K. Merton Remembered] Footnotes, American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merton/&gt;

In "The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action" (1936), Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause [[social change]]. He emphasized that his term ''purposive action'', "[was exclusively] concerned with 'conduct' as distinct from 'behavior.' That is, with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives".&lt;ref name=Merton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=895|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton's usage included deviations from what [[Max Weber]] defined as rational social action: instrumentally rational and value rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton also stated that "no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of ''all'' social planning is warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=904|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everyday usage===
More recently, the ''law of unintended consequences'' has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a [[complex system]] tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Norton "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Norton |first=Rob |editor=[[David R. Henderson]] |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Unintended Consequences |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html  |year=2008 |edition= 2nd |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0865976658 |oclc=237794267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/mislj71&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/flsulr28&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=28 Florida State University Law Review 2000–2001 Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Exemplifying the Law of Unintended Consequences Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date=1993-06-18 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/antil65&amp;div=47&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin to [[Murphy's law]], it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the [[hubris]]tic belief that humans can fully control the world around them.

==Causes==
Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world's inherent [[complexity]] (parts of a system responding to changes in the environment), [[perverse incentive]]s, human [[stupidity]], [[self-deception]], failure to account for human nature, or other [[cognitive bias|cognitive]] or [[emotional bias|emotional]] biases. As a sub-component of complexity (in the scientific sense), the chaotic nature of the universe—and especially its quality of having small, apparently insignificant changes with far-reaching effects (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]])—applies.

[[Robert K. Merton]] listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences in 1936:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Merton, Robert K|title=On Social Structure and Science|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1996|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3626245.html|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ignorance, making it  impossible to anticipate everything, thereby leading to incomplete analysis.
# Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation.
# Immediate interests overriding long-term interests.
# Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long-term result might be unfavourable (these long-term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values).
# [[Self-defeating prophecy]], or, the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs, thus the non-occurrence of the problem is not anticipated.

In addition to Merton's causes, psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that [[groupthink]], described by [[Irving Janis]], has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Can Anything Save Us from Unintended Consequences? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=20-23 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919223200/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/can_anything_save_us_from_unintended_consequences |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial [[coral reefs]], which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers.

In [[medicine]], most [[Medication|drugs]] have unintended consequences ('[[side effect]]s') associated with their use. However, some are beneficial. For instance, [[aspirin]], a [[pain reliever]], is also an [[anticoagulant]] that can help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and reduce the severity and damage from [[thrombotic stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC15Feb2001&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1168850.stm |title=BBC 15 February 2001, ''Aspirin heart warning'' |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of beneficial [[side effect]]s also leads to [[off-label use]]—prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose. Famously, the drug [[Viagra]] was developed to lower blood pressure, with its use for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials.

The objective of microfinance initiatives is to foster micro-entrepreneurs but an unintended consequence can be informal intermediation: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413_Microfinance_for_poverty_alleviation_Do_transnational_initiatives_overlook_fundamental_questions_of_competition_and_intermediation|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103–117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] made [[bicycle helmet|safety helmets]] mandatory for all bicycle riders. While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries, there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists—fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries, assuming [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]]. The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased, possibly due to [[risk compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html |title=Evaluating Head Injuries and Helmet Laws in Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Vulcan, ''et al.'' found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Maxwell H. |last2=Vulcan |first2=A.

[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition in the 1920s United States]], originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade, drove many small-time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large-scale [[organized crime]] over the illegal alcohol industry. Since alcohol was still popular, criminal organisations producing alcohol were well-funded and hence also increased their other activities. Similarly, the [[War on Drugs]], intended to suppress the [[illegal drug trade]], instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", The New York Times, August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure," ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dominic Streatfeild |title=Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild |date=June 2000 |url=http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |publisher=Dominicstratfeild |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113201345/http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |archivedate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger-side [[airbag]]s in motorcars were intended as a safety feature, but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid-1990s as small children were being hit by deploying airbags during collisions. The supposed solution to this problem, moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle, led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles, some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/hot-car-death/ |work=Time |first1=Justin |last1=Worland/Ridgefield |title=Who's To Blame For Hot Car Deaths? |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk compensation, or the [[Risk compensation|Peltzman effect]], occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death (e.g. bike helmets, seatbelts, etc.). People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place. This may result in no change, or even an increase, in morbidity or mortality, rather than a decrease as intended.

The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, [[Cobra effect|offered a bounty for every dead cobra]]. This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, they scrapped the reward program, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse, becoming known as the [[Cobra effect]].

[[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Theobald Mathew]]'s temperance campaign in 19th-century [[Ireland]] resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] again.

Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s, the Canadian federal government gave the Catholic Church in Quebec $2.25 per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care, but only $0.75 a day per orphan. The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so the church could receive the larger amount of money. This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to 20,000 people, and the children are known as the [[Duplessis Orphans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 |title=The Spokesman-Review  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 |title=The Prescott Courier |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental intervention==

Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all [[environmental problem]]s, from chemical [[pollution]] to [[global warming]], are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. [[Traffic congestion]], deaths and injuries from car accidents, [[air pollution]], and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the [[automobile]]. [[Hospital infection]]s are the unexpected side-effect of [[antibiotic resistance]], and even [[human overpopulation]] is the side effect of various technological (i.e., [[Agricultural revolution (disambiguation)|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution|industrial]]) revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author1=Huesemann, Michael H.|author2=Joyce A.

Because of the complexity of [[ecosystems]], deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have (usually negative) unintended consequences. Sometimes, these effects cause permanent [[irreversible change]]s. Examples include:

* After about 1900, public demand led the US government to fight [[forest fire]]s in the American West, and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires. This policy led to fewer fires, but also led to growth conditions such that, when fires did occur, they were much larger and more damaging. Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided, and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of [[forest ecology]].&lt;ref name="How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/23/159373691/how-the-smokey-bear-effect-led-to-raging-wildfires|work=npr.org|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vibration''' is a mechanical phenomenon whereby [[oscillation]]s occur about an [[equilibrium point]]. The word comes from Latin ''vibrationem'' ("shaking, brandishing"). The oscillations may be [[periodic function|periodic]], such as the motion of a pendulum—or [[random]], such as the movement of a tire on a gravel road.

Vibration can be desirable: for example, the motion of a [[tuning fork]], the [[Reed (music)|reed]] in a [[woodwind instrument]] or [[harmonica]], a [[mobile phone]], or the cone of a [[loudspeaker]].

In many cases, however, vibration is undesirable, wasting [[energy]] and creating unwanted [[sound]]. For example, the vibrational motions of [[engine]]s, [[electric motor]]s, or any [[Machine|mechanical device]] in operation are typically unwanted. Such vibrations could be caused by [[Engine balance|imbalances]] in the rotating parts, uneven [[friction]], or the meshing of [[gear]] teeth. Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations.

The studies of sound and vibration are closely related.  Sound, or pressure [[wave]]s, are generated by vibrating structures (e.g. [[vocal cords]]); these pressure waves can also induce the vibration of structures (e.g. [[ear drum]]).  Hence, attempts to reduce noise are often related to issues of vibration.

==Types of vibration==

''' Free vibration''' occurs when a mechanical system is set in motion with an initial input and allowed to vibrate freely.  Examples of this type of vibration are pulling a child back on a swing and letting it go, or hitting a tuning fork and letting it ring. The mechanical system vibrates at one or more of its [[resonance|natural frequencies]] and [[damping|damps]] down to motionlessness.

'''Forced  vibration''' is when a time-varying disturbance (load, displacement or velocity) is applied to a mechanical system. The disturbance can be a periodic and steady-state input, a transient input, or a random input. The periodic input can be a harmonic or a non-harmonic disturbance. Examples of these types of vibration include a washing machine shaking due to an imbalance, transportation vibration caused by an engine or uneven road, or the vibration of a building during an earthquake. For linear systems, the frequency of the steady-state vibration response resulting from the application of a periodic, harmonic input is equal to the frequency of the applied force or motion, with the response magnitude being dependent on the actual mechanical system.

'''Damped vibration:''' When the energy of a vibrating system is gradually dissipated by friction and other resistances, the vibrations are said to be damped. The vibrations gradually reduce or change in frequency or intensity or cease and the system rests in its equilibrium position. An example of this type of vibration is the [[Vehicle suspension|vehicular suspension]] dampened by the [[shock absorber]].

==Vibration testing==

Vibration testing is accomplished by introducing a forcing function into a structure, usually with some type of shaker. Alternately, a DUT (device under test) is attached to the "table" of a shaker. Vibration testing is performed to examine the response of a device under test (DUT) to a defined vibration environment. The measured response may be fatigue life, resonant frequencies or squeak and rattle sound output ([[Noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]]). Squeak and rattle testing is performed with a special type of ''quiet shaker'' that produces very low sound levels while under operation.

For relatively low frequency forcing, servohydraulic (electrohydraulic) shakers are used.  For higher frequencies, electrodynamic shakers are used.  Generally, one or more "input" or "control" points located on the DUT-side of a fixture is kept at a specified acceleration.&lt;ref name="Tustin06"&gt;Tustin, Wayne. ''[https://www.evaluationengineering.com/where-to-place-the-control-accelerometer Where to place the control accelerometer: one of the most critical decisions in developing random vibration tests also is the most neglected]'', EE-Evaluation Engineering, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other "response" points experience maximum vibration level (resonance) or minimum vibration level (anti-resonance). It is often desirable to achieve anti-resonance to keep a system from becoming too noisy, or to reduce strain on certain parts due to vibration modes caused by specific vibration frequencies .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Polytec InFocus 1/2007 | url =http://www.polytec.com/fileadmin/user_uploads/Applications/InFocus/Documents/OM_InFocus_2007_01_US.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of vibration testing services conducted by vibration test labs are Sinusoidal and Random. Sine (one-frequency-at-a-time) tests are performed to survey the structural response of the device under test (DUT). A random (all frequencies at once) test is generally considered to more closely replicate a real world environment, such as road inputs to a moving automobile.

Most vibration testing is conducted in a 'single DUT axis' at a time, even though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously.  MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter testing. The ''vibration test fixture'' used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of the resonances that may be present in the future. Devices specifically designed to trace or record vibrations are called [[vibroscope]]s.

==Vibration analysis==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Vibration Analysis (VA), applied in an industrial or maintenance environment aims to reduce maintenance costs and equipment downtime by detecting equipment faults.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Art; Simplified Handbook of Vibration Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eshleman, R 1999, Basic machinery vibrations: An introduction to machine testing, analysis, and monitoring&lt;/ref&gt; VA is a key component of a Condition Monitoring (CM) program, and is often referred to as Predictive Maintenance (PdM).&lt;ref&gt;Mobius Institute; Vibration Analyst Category 2 - Course Notes 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly VA is used to detect faults in rotating equipment (Fans, Motors, Pumps, and Gearboxes etc.) such as Unbalance, Misalignment, rolling element bearing faults and resonance conditions.

VA can use the units of Displacement, Velocity and Acceleration displayed as a [[Waveform|Time Waveform]] (TWF), but most commonly the spectrum is used, derived from a [[Fast Fourier Transform]] of the TWF. The vibration spectrum provides important frequency information that can pinpoint the faulty component.

The fundamentals of vibration analysis can be understood by studying the simple [[Mass-spring-damper]] model.  Indeed, even a complex structure such as an automobile body can be modeled as a "summation" of simple mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper models.  The mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model is an example of a [[simple harmonic oscillator]]. The mathematics used to describe its behavior is identical to other simple harmonic oscillators such as the [[RLC circuit]].

Note: This article does not include the step-by-step mathematical derivations, but focuses on major vibration analysis equations and concepts.  Please refer to the references at the end of the article for detailed derivations.

===Free vibration without damping===

[[File:Mass spring.svg|200px|right|Simple Mass Spring Model]] To start the investigation of the mass–spring–damper assume the damping is negligible and that there is no external force applied to the mass (i.e. free vibration). The force applied to the mass by the spring is proportional to the amount the spring is stretched "x" (assuming the spring is already compressed due to the weight of the mass). The proportionality constant, k, is the stiffness of the spring and has units of force/distance (e.g. lbf/in or N/m). The negative sign indicates that the force is always opposing the motion of the mass attached to it:
:&lt;math&gt;
F_s=- k x. \!
&lt;/math&gt;
The force generated by the mass is proportional to the acceleration of the mass as given by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law of motion]]:
:&lt;math&gt; 
\Sigma\ F = ma = m \ddot{x} = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}. 
&lt;/math&gt;
The sum of the forces on the mass then generates this [[ordinary differential equation]]: &lt;math&gt;  \ m \ddot{x} + k x = 0.&lt;/math&gt; 
[[File:Simple harmonic oscillator.gif|thumb|100px|right|Simple harmonic motion of the mass–spring system]] Assuming that the initiation of vibration begins by stretching the spring by the distance of ''A'' and releasing, the solution to the above equation that describes the motion of mass is: 
:&lt;math&gt;
x(t) =  A \cos (2 \pi f_n  t). \!
&lt;/math&gt;
This solution says that it will oscillate with [[simple harmonic motion]] that has an [[amplitude]] of ''A'' and a frequency of ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The number ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the '''undamped natural frequency'''. For the simple mass–spring system, ''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;
f_n = {1\over {2 \pi}} \sqrt{k \over m}. \!
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: [[angular frequency]] ω (ω=2 π ''f'') with the units of radians per second is often used in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to [[ordinary frequency]] (units of [[hertz|Hz]] or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness of the system is known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains why, when a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.

====What causes the system to vibrate: from conservation of energy point of view====

Vibrational motion could be understood in terms of [[conservation of energy]]. In the above example the spring has been extended by a value of x and therefore some [[potential energy]] (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{2} k x^2&lt;/math&gt;) is stored in the spring. Once released, the spring tends to return to its un-stretched state (which is the minimum potential energy state) and in the process accelerates the mass. At the point where the spring has reached its un-stretched state all the potential energy that we supplied by stretching it has been transformed into [[kinetic energy]] (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;). The mass then begins to decelerate because it is now compressing the spring and in the process transferring the kinetic energy back to its potential. Thus oscillation of the spring amounts to the transferring back and forth of the kinetic energy into potential energy. In this simple model the mass continues to oscillate forever at the same magnitude—but in a real system, ''damping'' always dissipates the energy, eventually bringing the spring to rest.

===Free vibration with damping===
[[File:Mass spring damper.svg|thumb|right|Mass–spring–damper model]]

When a "viscous" damper is added to the model this outputs a force that is proportional to the velocity of the mass.  The damping is called viscous because it models the effects of a fluid  within an object.  The proportionality constant ''c'' is called the damping coefficient and has units of Force over velocity (lbf⋅s/in or N⋅s/m).

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{d}  =  - c v  = - c \dot{x} =  - c \frac{dx}{dt}. &lt;/math&gt;

Summing the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{x} + { c } \dot{x} + {k } x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this equation depends on the amount of damping.  If the damping is small enough, the system still vibrates—but eventually, over time, stops vibrating.  This case is called underdamping, which is important in vibration analysis. If  damping is increased just to the point where the system no longer oscillates, the system has reached the point of [[critical damping]]. If the damping is increased past critical damping, the system is [[overdamped]].   The value that the damping coefficient must reach for critical damping in the [[mass-spring-damper model]] is:

:&lt;math&gt;c_\text{c} = 2 \sqrt{\text{km}}.&lt;/math&gt;

To characterize the amount of damping in a system a ratio called the [[damping ratio]] (also known as damping factor and % critical damping) is used.  This damping ratio is just a ratio of the actual damping over the amount of damping required to reach critical damping.  The formula for the damping ratio (&lt;math&gt;\zeta &lt;/math&gt;) of the mass-spring-damper model is:

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = { c \over 2 \sqrt{\text{km}} }.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, metal structures (e.g., airplane fuselages, engine crankshafts) have damping factors less than 0.05, while automotive suspensions are in the range of 0.2&amp;ndash;0.3. The solution to the [[underdamped system]] for the mass-spring-damper model is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=X  e^{-\zeta \omega_n t} \cos({\sqrt{1-\zeta^2} \omega_n t - \phi}) , \qquad \omega_n= 2\pi f_n. &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Damped Free Vibration.png|thumb|right|Free vibration with 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratio]]

The value of ''X'', the initial magnitude, and &lt;math&gt; \phi, &lt;/math&gt; the [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shift]], are determined by the amount the spring is stretched.  The formulas for these values can be found in the references.

====Damped and undamped natural frequencies====
&lt;!--A link from Damping links here--&gt;

The major points to note from the solution are the exponential term and the cosine function.  The exponential term defines how quickly the system “damps” down – the larger the damping ratio, the quicker it damps to zero.  The cosine function is the oscillating portion of the solution, but the frequency of the oscillations is different from the undamped case.

The frequency in this case is called the "damped natural frequency", &lt;math&gt; f_\text{d}, &lt;/math&gt; and is related to the undamped natural frequency by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{d}= f_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The damped natural frequency is less than the undamped natural frequency, but for many practical cases the damping ratio is relatively small and hence the difference is negligible. Therefore, the damped and undamped description are often dropped when stating the natural frequency (e.g. with 0.1 damping ratio, the damped natural frequency is only 1% less than the undamped).

The plots to the side present how 0.1 and 0.3 damping ratios effect how the system “rings” down over time. What is often done in practice is to experimentally measure the free vibration after an impact (for example by a hammer) and then determine the natural frequency of the system by measuring the rate of oscillation, as well as the damping ratio by measuring the rate of decay. The natural frequency and damping ratio are not only important in free vibration, but also characterize how a system behaves under forced vibration.{{multiple image

===Forced vibration with damping===
The behavior of the spring mass damper model varies with the addition of a harmonic force. A force of this type could, for example, be generated by a rotating imbalance.

:&lt;math&gt;F= F_0 \sin {(2 \pi f t)}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Summing the forces on the mass results in the following ordinary differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{x} + { c } \dot{x} + {k } x = F_0 \sin {(2 \pi f t)}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[steady state]] solution of this problem can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)= X \sin{(2 \pi f t +\phi)}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The result states that the mass will oscillate at the same frequency, ''f'', of the applied force, but with a phase shift &lt;math&gt; \phi. &lt;/math&gt;

The amplitude of the vibration “X” is defined by the following formula.

:&lt;math&gt;X= {F_0 \over k} {1 \over \sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2 \zeta r)^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where “r” is defined as the ratio of the harmonic force frequency over the undamped natural frequency of the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model.

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{f}{f_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase shift, &lt;math&gt;\phi,&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the following formula.

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= \arctan {\left (\frac{-2 \zeta r}{1-r^2} \right)}. &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Forced Vibration Response.png|700px|Forced Vibration Response]]

The plot of these functions, called "the frequency response of the system", presents one of the most important features in forced vibration.  In a lightly damped system when the forcing frequency nears the natural frequency (&lt;math&gt;r \approx 1 &lt;/math&gt;) the amplitude of the vibration can get extremely high.  This phenomenon is called '''[[mechanical resonance|resonance]]''' (subsequently the natural frequency of a system is often referred to as the resonant frequency).  In rotor bearing systems any rotational speed that excites a resonant frequency is referred to as a [[critical speed]].

If resonance occurs in a mechanical system it can be very harmful – leading to eventual failure of the system. Consequently, one of the major reasons for vibration analysis is to predict when this type of resonance may occur and then to determine what steps to take to prevent it from occurring. As the amplitude plot shows, adding damping can significantly reduce the magnitude of the vibration.  Also, the magnitude can be reduced if the natural frequency can be shifted away from the forcing frequency by changing the stiffness or mass of the system. If the system cannot be changed, perhaps the forcing frequency can be shifted (for example, changing the speed of the machine generating the force).

The following are some other points in regards to the forced vibration shown in the frequency response plots.

*At a given frequency ratio, the amplitude of the vibration, ''X'', is directly proportional to the amplitude of the force &lt;math&gt;F_0 &lt;/math&gt; (e.g. if you double the force, the vibration doubles)
*With little or no damping, the vibration is in phase with the forcing frequency when the frequency ratio ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and 180 degrees out of phase when the frequency ratio ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1
*When ''r''&amp;nbsp;≪&amp;nbsp;1 the amplitude is just the deflection of the spring under the static force &lt;math&gt;F_0. &lt;/math&gt;  This deflection is called the static deflection &lt;math&gt;\delta_{st}.&lt;/math&gt; Hence, when ''r''&amp;nbsp;≪&amp;nbsp;1 the effects of the damper and the mass are minimal.
*When ''r''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;1 the amplitude of the vibration is actually less than the static deflection &lt;math&gt;\delta_{st}.&lt;/math&gt;  In this region the force generated by the mass (''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ma'') is dominating because the acceleration seen by the mass increases with the frequency. Since the deflection seen in the spring, ''X'', is reduced in this region, the force transmitted by the spring (''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kx'') to the base is reduced. Therefore, the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper system is isolating the harmonic force from the mounting base – referred to as [[vibration isolation]]. More damping actually reduces the effects of vibration isolation when ''r''&amp;nbsp;≫&amp;nbsp;1 because the damping force (''F''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''cv'') is also transmitted to the base.
* whatever the damping is, the vibration is 90 degrees out of phase with the forcing frequency when the frequency ratio r =1, which is very helpful when it comes to determining the natural frequency of the system.
* whatever the damping is, when r  ≫1, the vibration is 180 degrees out of phase with the forcing frequency
* whatever the damping is, when r ≪ 1, the vibration is in phase with the forcing frequency

====Resonance causes====

Resonance is simple to understand if the spring and mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently pump energy into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child on swing, a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As in the case of the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the system.

The damper, instead of storing energy, dissipates energy. Since the damping force is proportional to the velocity, the more the motion, the more the damper dissipates the energy. Therefore, there is a point when the energy dissipated by the damper equals the energy added by the force. At this point, the system has reached its maximum amplitude and will continue to vibrate at this level as long as the force applied stays the same. If no damping exists, there is nothing to dissipate the energy and, theoretically, the motion will continue to grow into infinity.

====Applying "complex" forces to the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model====

In a previous section only a simple harmonic force was applied to the model, but this can be extended considerably using two powerful mathematical tools. The first is the [[Fourier transform]] that takes a signal as a function of time ([[time domain]]) and breaks it down into its harmonic components as a function of frequency ([[frequency domain]]). For example, by applying a force to the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model that repeats the following cycle – a force equal to 1&amp;nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|newton]] for 0.5&amp;nbsp;second and then no force for 0.5&amp;nbsp;second. This type of force has the shape of a 1&amp;nbsp;Hz [[square wave]].

[[File:Square wave frequency spectrum animation.gif|thumb|300px|How a 1 Hz square wave can be represented as a summation of sine waves(harmonics) and the corresponding frequency spectrum. Click and go to full resolution for an animation]]

The Fourier transform of the square wave generates a [[frequency spectrum]] that presents the magnitude of the harmonics that make up the square wave (the phase is also generated, but is typically of less concern and therefore is often not plotted). The Fourier transform can also be used to analyze non-[[periodic function|periodic]] functions such as transients (e.g. impulses) and random functions. The Fourier transform is almost always computed using the [[Fast Fourier Transform]] (FFT) computer algorithm in combination with a [[window function]].

In the case of our square wave force, the first component is actually a constant force of 0.5 newton and is represented by a value at "0" Hz in the frequency spectrum. The next component is a 1&amp;nbsp;Hz sine wave with an amplitude of 0.64.  This is shown by the line at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. The remaining components are at odd frequencies and it takes an infinite amount of sine waves to generate the perfect square wave.  Hence, the Fourier transform allows you to interpret the force as a sum of sinusoidal forces being applied instead of a more "complex" force (e.g. a square wave).

In the previous section, the vibration solution was given for a single harmonic force, but the Fourier transform in general gives multiple harmonic forces.  The second mathematical tool, "the principle of [[superposition principle|superposition"]], allows the summation of the solutions from multiple forces if the system is [[linear system|linear]]. In the case of the spring–mass–damper model, the system is linear if the spring force is proportional to the displacement and the damping is proportional to the velocity over the range of motion of interest.  Hence, the solution to the problem with a square wave is summing the predicted vibration from each one of the harmonic forces found in the frequency spectrum of the square wave.

====Frequency response model====

The solution of a vibration problem can be viewed as an input/output relation – where the force is the input and the output is the vibration.  Representing the force and vibration in the frequency domain (magnitude and phase) allows the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(i\omega)=H(i\omega)\cdot F(i\omega) \ \ or \ \ H(i\omega)= {X(i\omega) \over F(i\omega)}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;H(i\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[frequency response]] function (also referred to as the [[transfer function]], but not technically as accurate) and has both a magnitude and phase component (if represented as a [[complex number]], a real and imaginary component). The magnitude of the frequency response function (FRF) was presented earlier for the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper system.

:&lt;math&gt;|H(i\omega)|=\left |{X(i\omega) \over F(i\omega)} \right|= {1 \over k} {1 \over \sqrt{(1-r^2)^2 + (2 \zeta r)^2}},&lt;/math&gt; {{pad|3em}} where {{pad|3em}} &lt;math&gt; r=\frac{f}{f_n}=\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The phase of the FRF was also presented earlier as:

:&lt;math&gt;\angle H(i\omega)= -\arctan {\left (\frac{2 \zeta r}{1-r^2} \right)}. &lt;/math&gt;

For example, calculating the FRF for a mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper system with a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;kg, spring stiffness of 1.93&amp;nbsp;N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7&amp;nbsp;Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1&amp;nbsp;Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7&amp;nbsp;Hz. The frequency response of the mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper therefore outputs a high 7&amp;nbsp;Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7&amp;nbsp;Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.

[[File:Frequency response example.png|thumb|left|300px|Frequency response model]]

The figure also shows the time domain representation of the resulting vibration. This is done by performing an inverse Fourier Transform that converts frequency domain data to time domain. In practice, this is rarely done because the frequency spectrum provides all the necessary information.

The frequency response function (FRF) does not necessarily have to be calculated from the knowledge of the mass, damping, and stiffness of the system—but can be measured experimentally. For example, if a known force over a range of frequencies is applied, and if the associated vibrations are measured, the frequency response function can be calculated, thereby characterizing the system. This technique is used in the field of experimental [[modal analysis]] to determine the vibration characteristics of a structure.

==Multiple degrees of freedom systems and mode shapes==

The simple mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model is the foundation of vibration analysis, but what about more complex systems?  The mass&amp;ndash;spring&amp;ndash;damper model described above is called a single [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degree of freedom]] (SDOF) model since the mass is assumed to only move up and down.  In more complex systems, the system must be discretized into more masses that move in more than one direction, adding degrees of freedom.  The major concepts of multiple degrees of freedom (MDOF) can be understood by looking at just a 2 degree of freedom model as shown in the figure.
[[File:2dof model.gif|thumb|300px|right|2 degree of freedom model]]

The equations of motion of the 2DOF system are found to be:

:&lt;math&gt;
m_1 \ddot{x_1} + { (c_1+c_2) } \dot{x_1} - { c_2 } \dot{x_2}+ { (k_1+k_2) } x_1 -{ k_2 } x_2= f_1,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
m_2 \ddot{x_2} - { c_2 } \dot{x_1}+ { (c_2+c_3) } \dot{x_2} - { k_2 } x_1+ { (k_2+k_3) } x_2 = f_2. \!
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be rewritten in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] format:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}m_1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; m_2\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{x_1}\\ \ddot{x_2}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}c_1+c_2 &amp; -c_2\\ -c_2 &amp; c_2+c_3\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\dot{x_1}\\ \dot{x_2}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}k_1+k_2 &amp; -k_2\\ -k_2 &amp; k_2+k_3\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} x_1\\ x_2\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} f_1\\ f_2\end{Bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A more compact form of this matrix equation can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\dot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} f \end{Bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}C\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are [[symmetric matrices]] referred respectively as the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices.  The matrices are NxN square matrices where N is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

The following analysis involves the case where there is no damping and no applied forces (i.e. free vibration). The solution of a viscously damped system is somewhat more complicated.&lt;ref name="MaiaSilva97"&gt;Maia, Silva. ''Theoretical And Experimental Modal Analysis'', Research Studies Press Ltd., 1997, {{ISBN|0-471-97067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{x}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This differential equation can be solved by assuming the following type of solution:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{Bmatrix} x\end{Bmatrix}=\begin{Bmatrix} X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega t}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note: Using the exponential solution of &lt;math&gt; \begin{Bmatrix} X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; is a mathematical trick used to solve linear differential equations. Using [[Euler's formula]] and taking only the real part of the solution it is the same cosine solution for the 1 DOF system.  The exponential solution is only used because it is easier to manipulate mathematically.

The equation then becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}-\omega^2\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}e^{i\omega t}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;e^{i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; cannot equal zero the equation reduces to the following.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}-\omega^2\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Eigenvalue problem===

This is referred to an [[eigenvalue]] problem in mathematics and can be put in the standard format by pre-multiplying the equation by &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}-\omega^2\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and if: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda=\omega^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}-\lambda\begin{bmatrix}I\end{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to the problem results in N '''eigenvalues''' (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\omega_1^2,\omega_2^2,\cdots\omega_N^2&lt;/math&gt;), where N corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom.  The eigenvalues provide the natural frequencies of the system. When these eigenvalues are substituted back into the original set of equations, the values of &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix}X\end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; that correspond to each eigenvalue are called the '''eigenvectors'''.  These eigenvectors represent the [[mode shape]]s of the system. The solution of an eigenvalue problem can be quite cumbersome (especially for problems with many degrees of freedom), but fortunately most math analysis programs have eigenvalue routines.

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are often written in the following matrix format and describe the modal model of the system:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown \omega_{r\diagdown}^2 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1^2 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \omega_N^2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_1 \end{Bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_2 \end{Bmatrix} \cdots \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_N \end{Bmatrix} \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A simple example using the 2 DOF model can help illustrate the concepts. Let both masses have a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;kg and the stiffness of all three springs equal 1000 N/m.  The mass and stiffness matrix for this problem are then:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2000 &amp; -1000\\ -1000 &amp; 2000\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}A\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2000 &amp; -1000\\ -1000 &amp; 2000\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues for this problem given by an eigenvalue routine is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown \omega_{r\diagdown}^2 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1000 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; 3000 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The natural frequencies in the units of hertz are then (remembering  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega=2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f_1=5.033 \mathrm {\ Hz}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f_2=8.717 \mathrm {\ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;.

The two mode shapes for the respective natural frequencies are given as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_1 \end{Bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} \psi_2 \end{Bmatrix} \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} -0.707 \\ -0.707 \end{Bmatrix}_1 \begin{Bmatrix} 0.707  \\ -0.707  \end{Bmatrix}_2 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the system is a 2 DOF system, there are two modes with their respective natural frequencies and shapes.  The mode shape vectors are not the absolute motion, but just describe relative motion of the degrees of freedom.  In our case the first mode shape vector is saying that the masses are moving together in phase since they have the same value and sign.  In the case of the second mode shape vector, each mass is moving in opposite direction at the same rate.

===Illustration of a multiple DOF problem===
When there are many degrees of freedom, one method of visualizing the mode shapes is by animating them using structural analysis software such as [[Femap]] or [[ANSYS]]. An example of animating mode shapes is shown in the figure below for a [[cantilever]]ed [[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]] as demonstrated using [[modal analysis]] on ANSYS. In this case, the [[finite element method]] was used to generate an approximation of the mass and stiffness matrices by meshing the object of interest in order to solve a [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Vibration analysis|discrete eigenvalue problem]]. Note that, in this case, the finite element method provides an approximation of the meshed surface (for which there exists an infinite number of vibration modes and frequencies). Therefore, this relatively simple model that has over 100 degrees of freedom and hence as many natural frequencies and mode shapes, provides a good approximation for the first natural frequencies and modes{{ref|1|†}}. Generally, only the first few modes are important for practical applications.

===Multiple DOF problem converted to a single DOF problem===

The eigenvectors have very important properties called orthogonality properties.  These properties can be used to greatly simplify the solution of multi-degree of freedom models.  It can be shown that the eigenvectors have the following properties:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; are [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]] that contain the modal mass and stiffness values for each one of the modes.  (Note: Since the eigenvectors (mode shapes) can be arbitrarily scaled, the orthogonality properties are often used to scale the eigenvectors so the modal mass value for each mode is equal to 1.  The modal mass matrix is therefore an [[identity matrix]])

These properties can be used to greatly simplify the solution of multi-degree of freedom models by making the following coordinate transformation.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} x \end{Bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q \end{Bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using this coordinate transformation in the original free vibration differential equation results in the following equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{q}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking advantage of the orthogonality properties by premultiplying this equation by &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}M\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{q}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}\Psi\end{bmatrix}^{T}\begin{bmatrix}K\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The orthogonality properties then simplify this equation to:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} ^\diagdown m_{r\diagdown} \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix}\ddot{q}\end{Bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}^\diagdown k_{r\diagdown}\end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q\end{Bmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is the foundation of vibration analysis for multiple degree of freedom systems. A similar type of result can be derived for damped systems.&lt;ref name="MaiaSilva97"/&gt; The key is that the modal mass and stiffness matrices are diagonal matrices and therefore the equations have been "decoupled".  In other words, the problem has been transformed from a large unwieldy multiple degree of freedom problem into many single degree of freedom problems that can be solved using the same methods outlined above.

Solving for ''x'' is replaced by solving for ''q'', referred to as the modal coordinates or modal participation factors.

It may be clearer to understand if  &lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} x \end{Bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \Psi \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix} q \end{Bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; is written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{Bmatrix} x_n \end{Bmatrix}= q_1\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_1  +q_2\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_2  +q_3\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_3 +\cdots +  q_N\begin{Bmatrix} \psi \end{Bmatrix}_N.&lt;/math&gt;

Written in this form it can be seen that the vibration at each of the degrees of freedom is just a linear sum of the mode shapes.  Furthermore, how much each mode "participates" in the final vibration is defined by q, its modal participation factor.

=== Rigid-body mode ===
An unrestrained multi-degree of freedom system experiences both rigid-body translation and/or rotation and vibration. The existence of a rigid-body mode results in a zero natural frequency. The corresponding mode shape is called the rigid-body mode.
