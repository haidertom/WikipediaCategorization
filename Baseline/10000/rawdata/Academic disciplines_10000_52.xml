      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">In the [[film industry]], '''3D [[lookup table]]s''' ('''3D LUT'''s) are used to map one [[color space]] to another. They are commonly used to calculate preview colors for a monitor or digital projector of how an image will be reproduced on another display device, typically the final digitally projected image or [[release print]] of a movie. A 3D LUT is a 3D lattice of output RGB color values that can be indexed by sets of input RGB colour values. Each axis of the lattice represents one of the three input color components and the input color thus defines a point inside the lattice.  Since the point may not be on a lattice point, the lattice values must be interpolated; most products use [[trilinear interpolation]].&lt;ref name="usingluts"&gt;Selan, Jeremy (2004).

3D LUTs are used extensively in the movie production chain, as part of the [[Digital Intermediate]] process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digital-intermediate.co.uk/calibration/calibrationluts.htm http://www.digital-intermediate.co.uk Calibration LUTs - Look Up Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.av-iq.com/AVCat/images/documents/pdfs/FIL-1013F-3.pdf Grasvalley 3D LUT, LUTher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallenempiredigital.com/blog/2012/12/04/luts-part-1-what-is-a-lut/ LUTs Part 1: What is a LUT?, By Angelo Lorenzo, December 4th, 2012] &lt;/ref&gt;

Cubes may be of various sizes and [[Color depth|bit depths]].  Often 33×33×33 cubes are used as 3D LUTs.  The most common practice is to use [[RGB]] 10-bit/component log images as the input to the 3D LUT. Output is usually RGB values that are to be placed unchanged into a display device's buffer.

Modern graphics cards have direct support for 3D LUTs, allowing entire HD images to be processed at 60&amp;nbsp;fps or faster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://documentation.apple.com/en/color/usermanual/index.html#chapter=6%26section=3%26tasks=true Apple, Using Display LUTs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many 3D lookup tables start with a [[Magic number (programming)|magic number]] to note the type of 3D LUT.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/photoshop/pdfs/dng_spec_1.4.0.0.pdf Abobe, Digital Negative (DNG), Specification, Page 52, June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5145">{{About|a concept used universally in computing|virtual memory addressing|Virtual address space}}
{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}
In [[computing]], an '''address space''' defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a [[network host]], [[peripheral device]], [[disk sector]], a [[computer data storage|memory]] cell or other logical or physical entity.

For [[software program]]s to save and retrieve stored data, each unit of data must have an address where it can be individually located or else the program will be unable to find and manipulate the data. The number of address spaces available will depend on the underlying address structure and these will usually be limited by the [[computer architecture]] being used.

Address spaces are created by combining enough uniquely identified qualifiers to make an address unambiguous within the address space. For a person's physical address, the ''address space'' would be a combination of locations, such as a neighborhood, town, city, or country. Some elements of an address space may be the same, but if any element in the address is different than addresses in said space will reference different entities. An example could be that there are multiple buildings at the same address of "32 Main Street" but in different towns, demonstrating that different towns have different, although similarly arranged, [[street address]] spaces.

An address space usually provides (or allows) a partitioning to several regions according to the [[mathematical structure]] it has. In the case of [[total order]], as for [[memory address]]es, these are simply [[interval (mathematics)|chunks]]. Some nested domain hierarchies appear in the case of [[arborescence (graph theory)|directed ordered tree]] as for the [[Domain Name System]] or a [[directory structure]]; this is similar to the hierarchical design of [[postal address]]es. In the [[Internet]], for example, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) allocates ranges of [[IP address]]es to various registries in order to enable them to each manage their parts of the global Internet address space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ |title= IPv4 Address Space Registry |date=March 11, 2009 |publisher=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) |accessdate= September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Uses of addresses include, but are not limited to the following:
* [[Memory address]]es for [[main memory]], [[memory-mapped I/O]], as well as for [[virtual memory]];
* Device addresses on an [[expansion bus]];
* [[disk sector|Sector]] addressing for [[disk drive]]s;
* [[File name]]s on a particular [[volume (computing)|volume]];
* Various kinds of network host addresses in [[computer network]]s;
* [[Uniform resource locator]]s in the Internet.

== Address mapping and translation ==
[[File:CNFTL9.JPG|thumb|Illustration of translation from logical block addressing to physical geometry]]
Another common feature of address spaces are [[map (mathematics)|mappings and translations]], often forming numerous layers. This usually means that some higher-level address must be translated to lower-level ones in some way. 
For example, [[file system]] on a [[logical disk]] operates [[one-dimensional array|linear]] sector numbers, which have to be translated to ''absolute'' [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] sector addresses, in simple cases, via [[addition]] of the partition's first sector address. Then, for a disk drive connected via [[Parallel ATA]], each of them must be converted to ''logical'' [[cylinder-head-sector]] address due to the interface historical shortcomings. It is converted back to LBA by the disk [[controller (computing)|controller]] and then, finally, to ''physical'' [[cylinder (disk drive)|cylinder]], [[disk head|head]] and [[track (disk drive)|sector]] numbers.

The [[Domain Name System]] maps its names to (and from) network-specific addresses (usually IP addresses), which in turn may be mapped to [[link layer]] network addresses via [[Address Resolution Protocol]]. Also, [[network address translation]] may occur on the edge of ''different'' IP spaces, such as a [[local area network]] and the Internet.

[[File:Virtual address space and physical address space relationship.svg|thumb|Virtual address space and physical address space relationship]]
An iconic example of virtual-to-physical address translation is [[virtual memory]], where different [[Page (computer memory)|pages]] of [[virtual address space]] map either to [[paging|page file]] or to main memory [[physical address]] space. It is possible that several numerically different virtual addresses all refer to one physical address and hence to the same physical byte of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. It is also possible that a single virtual address maps to zero, one, or [[CPU cache#Homonym and synonym problems|more than one]] physical address.

Algorithmic art, also known as [[computer-generated art]], is a subset of [[generative art]] (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to [[systems art]] (influenced by systems theory). [[Fractal art]] is an example of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=UCSB&gt;{{cite web |title=Approximating Reality with Interactive Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/brentYokota/200a_fin.html |publisher=University of California Santa Barbara |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=7 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest [[algorithm]]s require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers.  The final output is typically displayed on a [[computer monitor]], printed with a [[wikt:raster|raster]]-type printer, or drawn using a [[plotter]].  Variability can be introduced by using [[pseudo-random]] numbers.  There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo-random numbers) can still be considered computer-generated art, as opposed to computer-assisted art.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Islamic geometric patterns]] such as this [[girih]] tiling in the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]], are precursors of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;]]

[[Roman Verostko]] argues that [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are constructed using algorithms, as are [[Italian Renaissance]] paintings which make use of [[mathematics and art|mathematical techniques]], in particular [[linear perspective]] and proportion.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

[[File:San Romano Battle (Paolo Uccello, London) 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|[[Paolo Uccello]] made innovative use of a geometric algorithm, incorporating [[linear perspective]] in paintings such as ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances run along perspective lines.]]

Some of the earliest known examples of computer-generated algorithmic art were created by [[Georg Nees]], [[Frieder Nake]], [[A. Michael Noll]], [[Manfred Mohr]] and [[:fr:Vera Molnár|Vera Molnár]] in the early 1960s. These artworks were executed by a [[plotter]] controlled by a [[computer]], and were therefore computer-generated art but not [[digital art]]. The act of creation lay in writing the [[Computer program|program]], which specified the sequence of actions to be performed by the [[plotter]]. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early work with copier and telematic art focused on the differences between the human hand and the algorithm.&lt;ref name="MF1"&gt;Flanagan, Mary. "An Appreciation on the Impact of the work of Sonia Landy Sheridan." The Art of Sonia Landy Sheridan. Hanover, NH: [[Hood Museum of Art]], 2009, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aside from the ongoing work of Roman Verostko and his fellow algorists, the next known examples are [[fractal art]]works created in the mid to late 1980s. These are important here because they use a different means of execution. Whereas the earliest algorithmic art was "drawn" by a [[plotter]], [[fractal art]] simply creates an image in [[computer memory]]; it is therefore [[digital art]]. The native form of a [[fractal art]]work is an image stored on a [[computer]]&amp;nbsp;–this is also true of very nearly all equation art and of most recent algorithmic art in general. However, in a stricter sense "fractal art" is not considered algorithmic art, because the algorithm is not devised by the artist.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

In light of such ongoing developments, pioneer algorithmic artist [[Ernest Edmonds]] has documented the continuing prophetic role of art in human affairs by tracing the early 1960s association between art and the computer up to a present time in which the algorithm is now widely recognized as a key concept for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/3|author=Ernest Edmonds|date=15 January 2018|title=Algorithmic Art Machines|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7010003|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The role of the algorithm==
[[File:Judson Rosebush Visions 15101 Computer Art April 22, 1978 JGR19780422 100.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Letter Field'' by Judson Rosebush, 1978. [[Calcomp plotter]] computer output with liquid inks on rag paper, 15.25 x 21 inches. This image was created using an early version of what became [[Digital Effects]]' Vision software, in [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[Fortran]] on an [[IBM 370]]/158. A database of the Souvenir font; [[Statistical randomness|random number]] generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan line [[raster image]], output to a plotter.]]

From one point of view, for a work of art to be considered algorithmic art, its creation must include a process based on an [[algorithm]] devised by the artist. Here, an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include [[computer code]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]], or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt; This input may be [[mathematical]], [[computation]]al, or generative in nature. Inasmuch as algorithms tend to be [[deterministic]], meaning that their repeated execution would always result in the production of identical artworks, some external factor is usually introduced. This can either be a random number generator of some sort, or an external body of data (which can range from recorded heartbeats to frames of a movie.) Some artists also work with organically based gestural input which is then modified by an algorithm. By this definition, [[fractal]]s made by a fractal program are not art, as humans are not involved. However, defined differently, algorithmic art can be seen to include fractal art, as well as other varieties such as those using [[genetic algorithm]]s. The artist [[Kerry Mitchell]] stated in his 1999 ''Fractal Art Manifesto'':&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Kerry |title=Selected Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QUyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |date=24 July 2009| publisher=Lulu.com&lt;!--This book is published by the artist himself, and can be relied on only for his own point of view.--&gt;|isbn=978-0-557-08398-5|pages=7–8}} This artist is notable for his place in the Fractal Art movement, as is his opinion and manifesto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Kerry |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is not..Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009/&gt;}}

==Algorists==
"Algorist" is a term used for [[digital artist]]s who create algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorists formally began correspondence and establishing their identity as artists following a panel titled "Art and Algorithms" at [[SIGGRAPH]] in 1995. The co-founders were [[Jean-Pierre Hébert]] and [[Roman Verostko]]. Hébert is credited with coining the term and its definition, which is in the form of his own algorithm:&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

 if (creation &amp;&amp; object of art &amp;&amp; algorithm &amp;&amp; one's own algorithm) {
      return * an algorist *
 } else {
      return * not an algorist *
 }

[[Cellular automata]] can be used to generate artistic patterns with an appearance of randomness, or to modify images such as photographs by applying a transformation such as the stepping stone rule (to give an impressionist style) repeatedly until the desired artistic effect is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoke |first1=Brian P. |title=Cellular Automata and Art |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.pattern/FinalProject/Hoke.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=24 December 2015 |date=21 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has also been explored in music.&lt;ref name="Burraston Edmonds 2005 pp. 165–185"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burraston | first=Dave | last2=Edmonds | first2=Ernest | title=Cellular automata in generative electronic music and sonic art: a historical and technical review | journal=Digital Creativity | volume=16 | issue=3 | year=2005 | doi=10.1080/14626260500370882 | pages=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fractal art]] consists of varieties of computer-generated [[fractals]] with colouring chosen to give an attractive effect.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the western world, it is not drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], [[iteration|iterating]] through three phases: setting [[parameter]]s of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Conner, Elysia |date=25 February 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic or evolutionary art makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to develop images iteratively, selecting at each "generation" according to a rule defined by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eberle |first1=Robert |title=Evolutionary Art - Genetic Algorithm |url=http://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-Evolutionary-Art-Genetic-Algorithm/57335/1837679/view |publisher=Saatchi Art |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Craig |title=Evolutionary Computation and its application to art and design |url=http://www.red3d.com/cwr/evolve.html |publisher=Reynolds engineering &amp; Design |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=27 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithmic art is not only produced by computers. Wendy Chun explains:&lt;ref name=Chun2011/&gt;

{{quote|Software is unique in its status as metaphor for metaphor itself. As A universal imitator/machine, it encapsulates a logic of general substitutability ; a logic of ordering and creative, animating disordering. Joseph Weizenbaum has argued that computers have become metaphors for "effective procedures," that is, for anything that can be solved in a prescribed number of steps, such as gene expression and clerical work.&lt;ref name=Chun2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Chun, Wendy Hui Kyong |year=2011 |title=Programmed Visions: Software and Memory |page=2 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0262518512}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American artist, [[Jack Ox]], has used algorithms to produce paintings that are [[music visualization|visualizations of music]] without using a computer. Two examples are ''visual performances'' of extant scores, such as [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)|Eighth Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Ox, Jack |year=1990 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35788162/The_Systematic_Translation_of_Anton_Bruckners_Eighth_Symphony_into_a_Series_of_Thirteen_Paintings |title=The Systematic Translation of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony into a Series of Thirteen Paintings |conference=Bruckner Symposium 1990 |location=Linz, Austria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intermediaprojects.org/pages/Bruckner.html |title=Bruckner: Eighth Symphony visualized themes |publisher=Intermedia Projects |accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Ursonate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ox, Jack |year=1993 |title=Creating a Visual Translation of Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate |journal=Leonardo Music Journal |volume=3 |pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jackox.net/pages/Ursonate/UrPaintMv1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she and her collaborator, Dave Britton, created the 21st Century Virtual Color Organ that does use computer coding and algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ox |first1=Jack |last2=Britton |first2=Dave |year=2000 |url=https://www.academia.edu/785266/The_21st_century_virtual_reality_color_organ |title=The 21st Century Virtual Reality Color Organ |journal=Journal of IEEE Computer Society |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">[[File:Arch Sculpt - CA 09.jpg|thumb|350px|right|sculpted [[pediment]]]]'''Architectural sculpture''' is the use of [[sculpture|sculptural]] techniques by an [[architect]] and/or [[sculptor]] in the design of a building, [[bridge]], [[mausoleum]] or other such project. The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture.

It has also been defined as, ''an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectartusa.com/gloss.htm|title=Select Art Sculpture: Glossary|work=selectartusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia.

==Egyptian==
{{main article|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:LuxTempleObelisk.JPG|left|200px|thumb|[[Luxor Obelisk]]]]
Modern understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on the religious monuments that have survived since antiquity, which are carved stone with post-and-lintel construction. These religious monuments dedicated to the gods or [[pharaoh]]s were designed with a great deal of architectural sculpture inside and out:  engaged statues, carved columns and pillars, and wall surfaces carved with bas-reliefs. The classic examples of Egyptian colossal monuments (the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], the [[Abu Simbel temples]], the [[Karnak]] Temple Complex, etc.) represent thoroughly integrated combinations of architecture and sculpture.

Obelisks, elaborately carved from a single block of stone, were usually placed in pairs to flank the entrances to temples and pyramids. Reliefs are also common in Egyptian building, depicting scenes of everyday life and often accompanied by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]].

==Assyro-Babylonian==
[[File:Ashurnasipal with official.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Ashurnasipal with officials]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] architectural sculptural tradition began when [[Ashurnasirpal II]] moved his capitol to the city of [[Nimrud]] around 879 BCE.  This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum ([[alabaster]]).  This fairly easy to cut stone could be quarried in large blocks that allowed them to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there.  The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian, ''Assyrian Sculpture'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  1983 pp. 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries.

[[image:Porch of Maidens.jpg|thumb|250px|The Caryatid Porch of the [[Erechtheion]], [[Athens]], 421&amp;ndash;407 BC]]

Classical Greek architecture, like the prototypical [[Parthenon]], incorporate architectural sculpture in a fairly narrow set of standard, formal building elements.  The names of these elements still comprise the usual vocabulary for discussion:  the [[pediment]], the [[Metope (architecture)|metope]], the [[frieze]], the [[caryatid]], the [[quadriga]], [[acroteria]], etc.

Greek examples of architectural sculpture are distinguished not only by their age but their very high quality and skillful technique, with rhythmic and dynamic modeling, figural compositions in friezes that continue seamlessly over vertical joints from one block of stone to the next, and mastery of depth and legibility.

The known Greek and Roman examples have been exhaustively studied, and frequently copied or adapted into subsequent neo-classical styles:  [[Greek Revival architecture]], usually the most strict; [[Neoclassical architecture]]; [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] with its exaggerated and romantic free interpretations of the vocabulary, and even Stalinist neo-classical architecture like the [[Central Moscow Hippodrome]] adapted to a totalitarian aesthetic.  These re-interpretations are sometimes dubious, for instance, there are many modern copies of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], like the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo, despite the fact that all classical descriptions of the Mausoleum are vague.

[[File:Pediment, Philly Art Museum (3).jpg|right|250px|thumb|pediment sculpture detail, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], sculptor [[C. Paul Jennewein]], 1933]]

Not until about 1870 did the U.S. develop the talent, the economic power, and the taste for buildings grand enough to need architectural sculpture.  The [[Philadelphia City Hall]], constructed 1871 through 1901, is recognized as the turning point,&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, George, Sculpture of a City—Philadelphia's Treasures in Bronze and Stone, Fairmount Park Association, Walker Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the approximately 250 sculptures planned for the building, the large [[finial]] of [[William Penn]], and the practical effect of [[Alexander Milne Calder]] training many assistants there.

In the same years, [[H.H. Richardson]] began to develop his influential signature genre, which included romantic, medieval, and Romanesque stone carving.  [[Richard Morris Hunt]] became the first to bring the Parisian neo-classical [[École des Beaux-Arts]] style back to the United States, a style that depended on integrated figural sculpture and a highly ornamented building fabric for its aesthetic effect.  The Beaux-Arts style dominated for major public buildings between the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, through about 1912, the year of the [[San Francisco City Hall]].  The need for sculptors saw the emergence of a small industry of carvers and modelers, and a professional organization, the [[National Sculpture Society]].

The advent of steel frames and reinforced concrete encouraged, at first, more diverse building styles into the 1910s and 1920s.  The diversity of skyscraper Gothic, exotic "revivals" of Mayan and Egyptian, [[Stripped Classicism]], [[Art Deco]], etc. called for a similar diversity of sculptural approaches.  The use of sculpture was still expected, particularly for public buildings such as war memorials and museums.  In 1926 the pre-eminent American architectural sculptor, [[Lee Lawrie]], with his longtime friend and collaborator architect [[Bertram Goodhue]], developed perhaps the most sophisticated American examples at the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] and the [[Los Angeles Public Library]].

Goodhue's premature death ended that collaboration.  The [[Great Depression|Depression]], and the onset of World War II, decimated building activity.  The old building trades disbanded.  By the postwar years the aesthetic of architectural modernism had taken hold.  Except for a few diehards and regional sculptors, the profession was not only dead but discredited.  As of 2010 there are isolated signs of a revival of interest, for instance in the career of [[Raymond Kaskey]].

'''Barro Colorado Island''' (BCI) is located in the man-made [[Gatun Lake]] in the middle of the [[Panama Canal]]. The [[island]] was formed when the waters of the [[Chagres River]] were dammed to form the lake in 1913.  When the waters rose, they covered a significant part of the existing [[tropical forest]], but certain hilltops remained as islands in the middle of the lake.

==Forest dynamics plot==
In 1980, a 50-ha [[forest dynamics]] plot was established on Barro Colorado Island by researchers from STRI and [[Princeton University]]. The first census was conducted in 1982 and recorded every free-standing tree and shrub in the plot of more than 1-cm [[diameter at breast height|dbh]], totalling approximately 240,000 stems of 303 different species. It has been recensused every 5 years since 1985, allowing scientists to study the normal dynamics of the forest, as well as extreme events, such as [[El Niño]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctfs.si.edu/site/Barro+Colorado+Island |title=Barro Colorado Island

==Visiting==
Visitors are allowed on Barro Colorado Island. Access is, however, regulated by STRI. To visit the island, people must make a reservation with the staff and arrange for a tour. Tours generally include transportation to and from the island (often by boat from Gamboa), a 2–3 hour guided hike, lunch, and a visit to the museum. Hikes through the island offer the opportunity to spot several animals including monkeys, anteaters, birds and insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visiting Barro Colorado Island|url=http://www.anywherepanama.com/attractions/national-park/barro-colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cosmology}}
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Big Rip''' is a [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]] concerning the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], in which the [[matter]] of the [[universe]], from stars and galaxies to atoms and subatomic particles, and even [[spacetime]] itself, is progressively torn apart by the [[expansion of the universe]] at a certain time in the future. According to the hypothesis, first published in 2003, the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] of the universe and with it all distances in the universe, which is known to be [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating]], will be found to increase exponentially. If this were to happen, the model speculates that eventually in many billions of years' time the scale factor would become [[Infinity|infinitely]] large, pulling even subatomic particles and the fabric of [[spacetime]] apart, ending our universe.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The possibility of sudden [[gravitational singularity|singularities]] and crunch or rip singularities occur only for hypothetical matter with implausible physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativistic Cosmology |first1=George F. R. |last1=Ellis |authorlink1=George F. R. Ellis |first2=Roy |last2=Maartens |first3=Malcolm A. H. |last3=MacCallum |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012 |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=146–147 |isbn=978-0-52138-115-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The hypothesis relies crucially on the type of [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]]. The type that could cause this hypothesis is a constantly increasing form of dark energy. If the dark energy in the universe increases without limit, it could overcome all forces that hold the universe together. The key value{{why|date=December 2016}} is the [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] parameter ''w'', the [[ratio]] between the dark energy pressure and its [[energy density]]. If ''w''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;−1, this dynamical vacuum energy is known as [[phantom energy]], an extreme{{how|date=December 2016}} form of [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].

===Expansion===
{{main|Future of an expanding universe|Heat death of the universe|Timeline of the far future|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

A universe dominated by phantom energy is an [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerating universe]], expanding at an ever-increasing rate. However, this implies that the size of the [[observable universe]] is continually shrinking; the distance to the edge of the observable universe which is moving away at the speed of light from any point moves ever closer. When the size of the observable universe becomes smaller than any particular structure, no interaction by any of the [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] can occur between the most remote parts of the structure. When these interactions become impossible, the structure is "ripped apart". The model implies that after a finite time there will be a final singularity, called the "Big Rip", in which all distances diverge to infinite values.

The authors of this hypothesis, led by [[Robert R. Caldwell]] of [[Dartmouth College]], calculate the time from the present to the end of the universe as we know it for this form of energy to be

:&lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{rip} - t_{0} \approx \frac{2}{3|1+w|H_0\sqrt{1-\Omega_\mathrm{m}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is defined above, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]] and ''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the present value of the density of all the matter in the universe.

==Authors' example==
In their paper, the authors consider a hypothetical example with ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1.5, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;70&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc, and ''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.3, in which case the Big Rip will happen approximately 22 billion years from the present.

For ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1.5, the [[Galaxy|galaxies]] would first be separated from each other. About 60 million years before the Big Rip, gravity would be too weak to hold the [[Milky Way]] and other individual galaxies together. Galaxies would be destroyed as stars separate from the main black hole. Approximately three months before the Big Rip, the [[Solar System]] (or systems similar to our own at this time, as the fate of the Solar System 22 billion years in the future is questionable) would be gravitationally unbound. Planets would be detached from the star's orbit. In the last minutes, stars and planets would be torn apart, and an extremely short amount of time before the Big Rip, [[atom]]s would be destroyed. At the time the Big Rip occurs, even spacetime itself will be ripped apart and the scale factor will be infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observed universe==

Evidence indicates ''w'' to be very close to −1 in our universe, which makes ''w'' the dominating term in the equation. The closer that ''w'' is to −1, the closer the denominator is to zero and the further the Big Rip is in the future. If ''w'' were exactly equal to −1, the Big Rip could not happen, regardless of the values of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Ω''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the latest cosmological data available, the uncertainties are still too large to discriminate among the three cases ''w''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;−1, ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1, and ''w''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;−1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/news/ |title=WMAP 9 Year Mission Results |website=wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | bibcode = 2008MNRAS.383..879A | title = Improved constraints on dark energy from Chandra X-ray observations of the largest relaxed galaxy clusters | author1 = Allen | first1 = S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3700">'''Broadcast Markup Language''', or '''BML''', is an [[XML]]-based standard developed by Japan's [[Association of Radio Industries and Businesses]] as a data broadcasting specification for [[digital television]] broadcasting. It is a data-transmission service allowing text to be displayed on a [[1seg]] TV screen.

The text contains news, sports, weather forecasts, emergency warnings such as [[Earthquake Early Warning (Japan)|Earthquake Early Warning]], etc. free of charge.  It was finalized in 1999, becoming ARIB STD-B24 Data Coding and Transmission Specification for Digital Broadcasting.

The STD-B24 specification is derived from an early draft of [[XHTML]] 1.0 strict, which it extends and alters. Some subset of [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] 1 and 2 is supported, as well as [[ECMAScript]].

Example BML header:
&lt;source lang="dtd"&gt;
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="EUC-JP" ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE bml PUBLIC "+//ARIB STD-B24:1999//DTD BML Document//JA" "bml_1_0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;?bml bml-version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Since version 1.0 in 1999, BML standard has gone through several revisions, and {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, it is on version 5.0. However, due to a large installed user base of receivers which only support the original 1.0 specification, broadcasters are not able to introduce new features defined in later revisions.

&lt;!--[[File:Needlefish is being cleaned by Labroides phthirophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Needlefish]] being cleaned by [[Labroides phthirophagus|Hawaiian cleaner wrasse]]]]--&gt;
'''Cleaning symbiosis''' is a [[mutualism (biology)|mutually beneficial]] association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites and other materials from the surface of the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of [[cleaner fish]], notably [[wrasse]]s but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.

Cleaning behaviour was first described by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in about 420 BC, though his example (birds serving crocodiles) appears to occur only rarely.

The role of cleaning symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty years. Some believe that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], increasing the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of both individuals. Others such as [[Robert Trivers]] hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness, [[reciprocal altruism]]. Others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, a form of [[parasitism]].

Cheating, where either a cleaner sometimes harms its client, or a predatory species [[Mimicry|mimics]] a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating is analogous to [[Batesian mimicry]], as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same [[animal coloration|colours and patterns]], in an example of [[convergent evolution]]. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to [[Müllerian mimicry]], as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.

==History==

{{quote|As [the [[crocodile]]] lives chiefly in the river, it has the inside of its mouth constantly covered with [[leech]]es; hence it happens that, while all the other birds and beasts avoid it, with the trochilus it lives at peace, since it owes much to that bird: for the crocodile, when he leaves the water and comes out upon the land, is in the habit of lying with his mouth wide open, facing the western breeze: at such times the trochilus goes into his mouth and devours the leeches. This benefits the crocodile, who is pleased, and takes care not to hurt the trochilus.&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;}}

Herodotus thus claimed (circa 440 BC) that Nile crocodiles had what would now be called a cleaning symbiosis with the bird he called the ''trochilus'', possibly a [[sandpiper]]; but while he was right about the existence of cleaning symbioses, there is little evidence for it in crocodiles. In 1906 [[Henry Scherren]] quoted John Mason Cook, son of travel agent [[Thomas Cook]], as reporting from Egypt that he had seen some [[spur-winged plover]]s approach a crocodile, which opened its jaws for them:&lt;ref name=Scherren&gt;{{cite book | title=Popular Natural History | publisher=Cassell | author=Scherren, Henry | authorlink=Henry Scherren | year=1906 | page=268  |quote=Mr. J. M. Cook, of the celebrated tourist agency, when in Egypt in 1876, "watched one of these birds, and saw it deliberately go up to a crocodile, apparently asleep, which opened its jaws. The bird hopped in, and the crocodile closed its jaws. in what appeared to be a very short time, probably not more than a minute or two, the crocodile opened its jaws, and we saw the bird go down to the water's edge." There were several of these birds about, and Mr. Cook shot two of them, which Dr. Sclater identified as spur-winged plovers; so that the question as to what bird enters the mouth of the crocodile is now set at rest.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A disputed relationship==

Cleaning symbiosis  is a relationship between a pair of animals of different species, involving the removal and subsequent ingestion of ectoparasites, diseased and injured tissue, and unwanted food items from the surface of the host organism (the client) by the cleaning organism (the cleaner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Losey, G.S. | title=The Ecological Importance of Cleaning Symbiosis | journal=Copeia | year=1972 | pages=820–833 | doi = 10.2307/1442741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its status has been debated by biologists, with viewpoints ranging from pure [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] through to a form of exploitative [[parasitism]] by the cleaner.&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Poulin, Robert |authorlink=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |author2=Grutter, A.S. |year=1996 |title=Cleaning symbiosis: proximate and adaptive explanations |journal=BioScience |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=512–517 |url=http://www.lexagrutter.com/Publications/paper%207.pdf  |doi=10.2307/1312929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine biology|Marine biologist]] Alexandra Grutter explains:&lt;ref name=Grutter24/&gt;
{{quote|Cleaning associations involve cleaner organisms that remove ectoparasites and other material, such as mucus, scales and skin, from the body surfaces of other apparently co-operating animals. The latter are often referred to as hosts, customers, or clients. Cleaning behaviour is one of the most highly developed inter-specific communication systems known, with clients striking elaborate postures which have generally been assumed to make ectoparasites more accessible to cleaners.&lt;ref name=Grutter24/&gt;}}

===Selfless co-operation===

Grutter and her colleague [[Robert Poulin (zoologist)|Robert Poulin]], reviewing over thirty years of debate by biologists on cleaning symbioses, argue that "Cleaning symbioses may not be mutualistic associations but rather one-sided exploitation".&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt; They quote as an example of an early position, C. Limbaugh writing in 1961: "From the standpoint of the philosopher of biology, the extent of cleaning behavior in the ocean emphasizes the role of co-operation in nature as opposed to the tooth-and-claw struggle for existence".&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt;

===Mutual selfishness===
{{further|Reciprocal altruism}}

In 1971, mathematical biologist [[Robert Trivers]] wrote more carefully "Cleaner organisms and their hosts meet the preconditions for the evolution of [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocally altruistic]] behavior. The host's altruism is to be explained as benefiting him because of the advantage of being able quickly and repeatedly to return to the same cleaner" (i.e. mutual selfishness).&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt;

===One-sided exploitation===

By 1987 G. S. Losey wrote less optimistically "Cleaners are nothing but very clever behavioral parasites ... that have taken advantage of the rewarding aspects of tactile stimulation, found in nearly all vertebrates."&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt; Poulin and Grutter remark that "Over the last few decades, ... the opinion of scientists regarding cleaning symbioses has changed, from selfless cooperation, to a mutually beneficial interaction, and finally to a one-sided exploitation."&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt;

==Biological range==

Cleaning symbiosis is known from several groups of animals both in the sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals.&lt;ref name="Grutter24"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cleaning symbioses from the parasites' perspective | author=Grutter, Alexandra S. | journal=Parasitology | year=2002 | volume=124 | pages=S65–S81 | doi=10.1017/S0031182002001488 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of [[American crocodile]]s (''Crocodylus acutus''), geckos eating mosquitoes on [[Aldabra giant tortoise]]s (''Geochelone gigantea'') and scarlet crabs (''[[Grapsus grapsus]]''), and three species of [[Galapagos finch]]es removing ticks from [[marine iguana]]s (''Amblyrhynchus cristatus'').&lt;ref name="MacFarlandReeder"/&gt;

The best known cleaning symbioses are among marine fishes, where several species of small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and [[ectoparasite]] removal service to larger, often predatory fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Curry, O. |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/441/1/curryphd.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |title=Morality as natural history |publisher=[[University of London]] |degree=[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaner species, as shown in the table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure [[obligate symbiont]]s like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.&lt;ref name=Weeks&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weeks, Paul |year=2000 |title=Red-billed oxpeckers: vampires or tickbirds? |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=154–160 |doi=10.1093/beheco/11.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mimicry among cleaner fish==

===Mutual mimicry among cleaner fish===
Many [[cleaner fish]] in different families, such as the Caribbean neon goby (''[[Elacatinus evelynae]]'') and the [[Indo-Pacific]] cleaner wrasse (''[[Labroides dimidiatus]]'') share the distinctive combination of a long narrow body, a longitudinal stripe, a blue colour, and small size. "[[Convergent evolution|Convergent]] signalling among cleaners, using size, stripes and colour, should facilitate their recognition by fish clients."&lt;ref name="Stummer"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.opwall.com/Library/Opwall%20library%20pdfs/Journal%20publications/stummer%20size%20and%20stripes.pdf | title=Size and stripes: how fish clients recognize cleaners |author1=Stummer, Laura E. |author2=Weller, Jennifer A. |author3=Johnson, Magnus L. |author4=Côté, Isabelle M. | journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] | year=2004 | volume=68 |issue=1 | pages=145–150 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is analogous to [[Müllerian mimicry]] where genuinely [[aposematic]] species (such as wasps) mimic each other's warning colours.

===Aggressive mimicry of cleaner fish by blennies===
The [[sabre-toothed blenny]] (''Aspidontus taeniatus'') is a predatory [[blenny]], an [[aggressive mimicry|aggressive mimic]] which accurately resembles the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, not only in colour and pattern, but also in the ritualised dance the cleaner wrasse makes when potential client fish swim nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/express/20060630/finally_en.html|title=Comparative shopping, a fishy invention?|publisher=CORDIS Express|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of providing the cleaning service that it signals, it bites off pieces of healthy skin, [[lepidophage|scales and mucus]] from the host and then swims rapidly away to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Aspidontus|species=taeniatus|year=2007|month=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of aggressive [[mimicry]] in a cleaning symbiosis is analogous to [[Batesian mimicry]], where a harmless "edible mimetic species copies the warning signal of a noxious, aposematic model species, thereby gaining protection from predators".&lt;ref name="CheneyCote"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Frequency-dependent success of aggressive mimics in a cleaning symbiosis |author1=Cheney, Karen L. |author2=Côté, Isabelle M. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] | year=2005 | volume=272 | pages=2635–2639 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3256 | pmc=1559983 | pmid=16321786 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/272/1581/2635.short |jstor=30047878}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559983/pdf/rspb20053256.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; As in Batesian mimicry, the rate of successful attacks on cleaning clients by the bluestriped fangblenny (''[[Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos]]''), which like the sabre-toothed blenny mimic the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (''[[Labroides dimidiatus]]''), is frequency-dependent, meaning that the mimicry is more effective when the [[Cheating (biology)|cheating]] fangblenny is rare compared to the cleaner wrasse. The difference, however, is that the aggressive mimic is inserting itself into a co-operative relationship (between cleaner and client), whereas "Batesian mimics insert themselves into an antagonistic predator–prey interaction (where the models are the unpalatable prey)."&lt;ref name="CheneyCote"/&gt; The fangblenny has evolved an [[opioid]]-containing venom which dulls pain and lowers blood pressure, confusing the bitten host and giving the cheating mimic time to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casewell |first1=Nicholas R. et al |title=The Evolution of Fangs, Venom, and Mimicry Systems in Blenny Fishes |journal=Current Biology |date=2017 |volume=TBA |issue=TBA |pages=TBA |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.02.067 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30269-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="990">'''Collaborative engineering''' is defined by the [[International Journal of Collaborative Engineering]] as a discipline that "studies the interactive process of engineering collaboration, whereby multiple interested [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] resolve conflicts, bargain for individual or collective advantages, agree upon courses of action, and/or attempt to craft joint outcomes which serve their mutual interests."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalID=161 International Journal of Collaborative Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative engineering is quickly becoming a topic of great interest in recent years due to the explosion of internet technologies. This upsurge is partially due to the success of projects such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Linux]] that have proven the efficacy of internet collaboration.

[[File:Macrobius, universe with the earth in the centre.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Universe with the earth in the centre according to Macrobius (''Diagram in folio 25 recto'').]]
'''Commentary on Cicero's Dream of Scipio''' (in [[Latin]] ''Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis'') is a philosophical treatise of [[Macrobius]] based on the [[Somnium Scipionis|famous dream]] narrated in ''[[De re publica|On the republic]]'' of [[Cicero]] (Chapter VI, 9-29), in which [[Scipio Africanus|Scipion the African]] the Old appears  to his adoptive grandson, [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipion Emiliano]], and reveals him his future destination and the one of his country, explains the rewards that await to the [[Virtue|virtuous]] man in another life, describes the universe and the place of the Earth and the man inside the universe. Macrobius, his author, does not offer an exhaustive comment of the text ''ciceroniano'', but it exposes a series of ''theories on the dreams'' from [[Neoplatonism|neoplatónic]] background, on ''the mystic properties of the numbers'', on ''the nature of the'' ''[[soul]]'', on [[astronomy]] and on [[Music]]. Macrobius quotes a lot of authorities, but is little likely that have read them all or at least the majority. [[Plotinus|Plotino]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porfirio]] are his main sources and quotes frequently to [[Virgil]] with ornamental purpose. Nevertheless, the work incorporates ideas of the [[neoplatonism]], that are not conserved  in a direct form in any another place. The style is quite uneven, since Macrobius copies or translates his sources without unifying the style.

A '''composite cross population''' (CCP) is created by crossing a number of plants from different lines, and subsequently bulking [[seed]]s from the resulting offspring. This makes a CCP a population of plants with a lot of inherent genetic diversity, in contrast to [[monoculture]]s where all plants are clones and homozygous at all loci (fully inbred). In recent years CCPs have been proposed as a way to create modern [[landrace]]s of wheat, barley and oats. Research is done to explore whether they are better suited for organic farming than the modern cultivars. 
They are suited for participatory breeding of crops, which is in contrast to cultivars owned by big breeding companies.&lt;ref name="Doring2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Döring|first1=Thomas F.|last2=Knapp|first2=Samuel|last3=Kovacs|first3=Geza|last4=Murphy|first4=Kevin|last5=Wolfe|first5=Martin S.|title=Evolutionary Plant Breeding in Cereals—Into a New Era|journal=Sustainability|date=17 October 2011|volume=2011|issue=3|doi=10.3390/su3101944|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.384.6538&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of using CCPs in plant breeding was initially published in 1956.&lt;ref name=Suneson1956&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miscugli.it/public/componenti/725/files/Suneson_1956%20%28SC%202306%29.pdf|title=An Evolutionary Plant Breeding Method|last=Suneson|first=Coit A.|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yield data for 4 different populations for 8–28 years were presented in the article and after 8–15 years of repeated breeding under natural selection, the populations out-yielded the reference cultivar.

== Stages==

Creating a CCP involves 3 steps: initiation, multiplication and mixture. The population then goes into the maintenance phase.&lt;ref name=Doring2011 /&gt;

===Initiation===
A number of lines, generally 7-30, with interesting properties, such as yield or baking quality, are selected and all possible crosses of them are done. If many lines of different genetic background are used, a huge amount of genetic diversity will be present.

===Multiplication===
Seeds from crosses are sown out and harvested separately for a growing season or two until enough seeds are available.

===Mixture===
All seeds are mixed in equal portions to produce the first CCP generation.

===Maintenance===
The population is grown repeatedly and possibly changes due to natural selection. Each year seeds are saved after harvest, and used as seed for the next growing season. Plants that are successful under the prevailing growing conditions will give more seeds and contribute more to the next generation, compared to less successful plants. Disease will cull susceptible plants and the population will over time become resistant to the common diseases, but only if the initial population has resistance genes present.

== Pros ==
When [[genotype]]s grown together in a diverse population have different profiles of resource use they complement each other in the exploitation of the limiting resource and therefore are subject to smaller between-plant competition.

In case of disease or environmental change some plants will take over when others fail. Yield stability over years and environments can be better than pure lines due to compensation.&lt;ref name=Doring2011 /&gt;

Participatory [[plant breeding]] (PPB) methods represent alternatives aimed to improve local adaptation breeding, to promote genetic diversity, to empower farmers and rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://orgprints.org/6493/1/driebergen.pdf|title=Participatory Plant Breeding Methods for Organic Cereals|last=Desclaux|first=Dominique}}&lt;/ref&gt; In PPB farmers are actively participating in developing new cultivars or populations, e.g. by performing selection.

== Cons ==
Different genotypes may compete with each other in a way that is not beneficial for the population.&lt;ref name=Doring2011 /&gt; A pure line optimized for a certain environment or usage outperforms the CCP under these specific conditions.

There is no reason to believe that the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] selection will work in the desired direction for desired traits such as baking quality.

[[Common bunt|Common Bunt]] is a seed borne disease in wheat. In conventional farming it is controlled by fungicide treatment of seeds. In organic farming seeds can be cleaned by brushing before sowing, but it is also desirable that plants have genetic resistance. A CCP, including crosses of resistant cultivars, was grown with heavy common bunt infection for 5 years and it appeared to get more resistant, but the common bunt's virulence appeared to change at least as fast. The overall result was that infection levels went up.&lt;ref name=BORGEN1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrologica.dk/publikationer/Populations_Vingsted2015.pdf|title=Improving quality and health in diverse populations of wheat|last=Borgen|first=Anders|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic resource ==

CCPs can be a valuable resource of genetic material. They can be used to preserve valuable genetic diversity for future use, or as base for new breading programs. Promising plants can be selected and multiplied, generating new varieties.&lt;ref name=GENEPOOL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-science/article/morphological-diversity-in-a-barley-composite-cross-derived-population-evolved-under-low-input-conditions-and-its-relationship-with-molecular-diversity-indications-for-breeding/42D1BDE0B1DEF438C1EF9E485D0585F3|title=Morphological diversity in a barley composite cross-derived population evolved under low-input conditions and its relationship with molecular diversity: indications for breeding

'''Contemporary archaeology''' is a field of archaeological research that focuses on the most recent (20th and 21st century) past, and also increasingly explores the application of archaeological thinking to the contemporary world. It has also been referred to as the archaeology of the 'contemporary past'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchli |first=Victor |first2=Gavin |last2=Lucas |title=Archaeologies of the Contemporary Past |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=4 January 2002 |pages=208 |isbn=9781134571383 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=xK-BAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |jstor=3527092}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this term in the United Kingdom is particularly associated with the Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory (CHAT) conference group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chat-arch.org |title=CHAT ACT: Agency, Action and Advocacy Moesgaard Museum, Aarhus University, Denmark Friday 26 – Sunday 28 October 2018 |work=Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory |access-date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field forms part of [[historical archaeology]], or the archaeology of the modern period. Unlike [[ethnoarchaeology]], contemporary archaeology studies the recent and contemporary past in its own right, rather than to develop models that can inform the study of the more distant past.

Often informed by anthropological [[material culture studies]], but characterised by putting traditional archaeological methods and practices to new uses, research in this field generally aims to make an archaeological contribution to broader social scientific studies of the contemporary world, focusing especially upon contributing methods of studying material things (objects, landscapes, buildings, material heritage, etc.) to sociological, geographical and political studies of the modern world. The field has developed especially in heritage management, for example through [[English Heritage]]'s "Change and Creation" programme on the landscapes of the later 20th century &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schofield |first=J. |title=The Archaeology of the 20th Century |url=http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927230416/http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[Chartered Institute for Archaeologists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Contemporary Archaeology aims to explore the characteristics of diverse and rapid change across micro and macro scales by using a range of conventional and experimental [[Archaeology]] investigative techniques. Like all archaeological scholarship and practice, Contemporary Archaeology uses both [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] approaches, which can include archaeological modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=David L. |author-link=David L. Clarke |title=Models in Archaeology |publisher=[[Methuen (publisher)|Methuen]] |year=1972 |pages=1055 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=SCFmAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Quentin Lewis recognized, contemporary archaeology has a firmer footing in the UK and Europe than it does in North America, or at least it is not an especially recognizable scholarly niche quite yet in the US.  The work of scholars in the UK and Europe has turned to some materiality that is admittedly distinctive if not unique, such as the extensive scholarship of the landscapes of 20th century warfare (for instance, English Heritage’s ambitious Cold War Monuments project, Gabriel Moshenska’s work on British air raid shelters and children’s homefront experiences of World War II, Heinrich Natho’s study of Norwegian World War II coastal defenses, and Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal’s analysis of Spanish Civil War Monuments); Laura McAtackney’s work on “peace walls” in northern Ireland; Anna Badcock and Robert Johnston’s study of protest camp sites in Derbyshire; and contemporary graffiti (John Schofield has cleverly captivated many journalists and questioned what archaeologists value with his assessment of Sex Pistols graffiti).  Yet for all these distinctive dimensions of British and European heritage we could certainly point to just as many equally interesting material experiences in every corner of North America.  Some of the visibility of contemporary archaeology is inevitably linked to a British and European willingness to conduct material analysis that does not require excavation.  Outside North America a vast number of scholars call themselves archaeologists while studying space, the built environment, and a broad range of material things without necessarily wielding a trowel.  In the US historical archaeology has fashioned a particularly productive niche by focusing on field excavation and everyday materiality, and much of our training is devoted to field methods and analysis of a distinctive range of commodities like ceramics, glass, and faunal remains that are routinely recovered from excavation contexts on nearly any historic period site" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/tag/contemporary-archaeology/ |title=Contemporary Archaeology |date=1 February 2012 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[The Society for Historical Archaeology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a history reaching back as far, at least, as William Rathje's "garbology" project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913924,00.html |title=The Nation: Truth in Garbage |date=26 January 1976 |access-date=13 November 2018 |magazine=[[TIME]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Archaeology remains a new sub-discipline within the university. In remaining focused on archaeology's ability to tell stories that reach beyond official or formal discourse, Contemporary Archaeology has the potential to offer significant political critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Borderline Archaeology: a practise of contemporary archaeology - exploring aspects of creative narratives and performance cultural production |last=Campbell |first=Fiona |last2=Ulin |first2=Jonna |date=11 June 2004 |publisher=[[Göteborgs universitet]] |isbn=91-85245-01-1 |url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/16211/5/gupea_2077_16211_5.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dead hedge''' is a barrier constructed from cut branches, [[sapling]]s, and [[foliage]]. The material can be from pruning, clearing, or forestry activities. Their succession is a [[beetle bank]] or [[hedge]]. 

==Restoration ecology and biological pest control== 
Dead hedges or wind-rows, as they are known in the coppice trade, are useful keeping the compartments of the coppice tidy, keeping the public from certain areas, being an excellent habitat and corridor for wildlife [[habitat conservation]] and [[restoration ecology]], as they offer shelter for small animals, especially birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://handbooks.btcv.org.uk/handbooks/content/chapter/65 |title=Hedging |work=BTCV handbook |author=[[BTCV]] |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be part of a beneficial "biological pest agents" [[habitat]] in [[biological pest control]] programs for [[natural landscape]]s and [[organic gardening]].

{{Attributes of God}}

In [[theology]], '''divine providence''', or just '''providence''', is [[God]]'s intervention in the [[Universe]]. The term ''Divine Providence'' (usually capitalized) is also used as a [[names of God|title of God]]. A distinction is usually made between "general providence", which refers to God's [[God the Sustainer|continuous upholding]] of the existence and [[natural law|natural order]] of the Universe, and "special providence", which refers to God's extraordinary intervention in the life of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Providence.aspx#1O101-Providence |title=Providence |work=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |date= |access-date=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miracle]]s generally fall in the latter category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creation, Providence, and Miracle |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/creation-providence-and-miracle |publisher=[[Reasonable Faith]] |access-date=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word comes from Latin ''providentia'' "foresight, [[prudence]]", from ''pro-'' "ahead" and ''videre'' "to see". The current use of the word has the sense of "knowledge of the future" or [[omniscience]], understood as an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute of God]].

==Catholic theology==
[[Augustine of Hippo]] is perhaps most famously associated with the doctrine of divine providence in the Latin West. Augustine held that since God's governance takes place in the universe comprising a vast multitude of relatively independent individuals differing in nature, function, and end, this implies the continuous control and unifying governance of a single supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm Walker, Leslie. "Divine Providence." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 19 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Christian teaching on providence in the [[High Middle Ages]] was most fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. The concept of providence as care exercised by God over the [[universe]], his foresight and care for its future is extensively developed and explained both by Aquinas himself and modern [[Thomism|Thomists]]. One of the foremost modern Thomists, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] father [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], wrote a study of providence entitled "Providence: God's loving care for man and the need for confidence in Almighty God." In it, he presents and solves, according to Catholic doctrine, the most difficult issues as related to providence.

==Reformed theology==
{{See also|Reformed theology}}
This term is an integral part of [[John Calvin]]'s theological framework known as [[Calvinism]], which emphasizes the [[total depravity]] of man and the complete sovereignty of God. God's plan for the world and every soul that he has created is guided by his will, or providence. According to Calvin, the idea that man has [[free will]] and is able to make choices independently of what God has already determined is based on our limited understanding of God's perfection and the idea that God's purposes can be circumvented. In this mode of thought, providence is related to absolute free will. This concept remains prominent among many [[Protestant]] denominations that identify with Calvinism, the [[Reformed churches]].

==Lutheran theology==

In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theology, divine providence refers to God's preservation of [[ex nihilo|creation]], his cooperation with everything that happens, and his guiding of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''.

Koepsell&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Luther]], divine providence began when God created the world with everything needed for human life, including both physical things and [[natural laws]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/luthersworksvolu009862mbp Luther's Works Vol. 1 Lectures on Genesis Chapters 1-5] page 25, 47&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Luther's Small Catechism]], the explanation of the first article of the [[Apostles' Creed]] declares that everything people have that is good is given and preserved by God, either directly or through other people or things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.html#creed |title=Luther's Small Catechism, The Apostle's Creed |publisher=Bookofconcord.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the services others provide us through family, [[government]], and work, he writes, "we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God."&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/3_tencommandments.html Luther's Large Catechism, First Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt; Since God uses everyone's useful tasks for good, people should look not down upon some useful vocations as being less worthy than others. Instead people should honor others, no matter how lowly, as being the means God uses to work in the world.&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"/&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox theology==
The doctrine of providence in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is set out by St [[John of Tobolsk]]:
"St. John Damascene describes it thus: 'Providence is Divine will which maintains everything and wisely rules over everything' ... It was not by chance that the iniquitous Israeli King Ahab was struck by an arrow that flew in between the seams of his armor. Truly that arrow was directed by the hand of God, just as was the one which struck Julian the Apostate; only for the soldier who let fly the arrow was it accidental. It was not by chance that swallows flew into the home of Tobit and blinded the righteous man. This happened at God’s command, in order to hold Tobit up as an example to succeeding generations, as we learn from the Angel who accompanied his son Tobias. Nothing happens by chance. It was not by chance that Caesar Augustus ordered the census to be taken in the year of Christ’s Nativity. It was not by chance that Christ met with the Samaritan woman at the well in Sychar and spoke with her. All this was foreseen and written down in the books of Divine Providence before the beginning of time.”&lt;ref&gt;http://livingorthodoxfaith.blogspot.co.za/2009/11/divine-providence-by-st-john-of-tobolsk.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swedenborgian theology==
{{See also|The New Church}}
''Divine Providence'' is a book published by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in 1764 which describes his [[systematic theology]] regarding providence, free will, [[theodicy]], and other related topics. Both meanings of providence are applicable in Swedenborg's theology, in that providence encompasses understanding, intent and action. Divine providence relative to man is 'foresight', and relative to the Lord is 'providence'.&lt;ref&gt;S. Warren, Compendium of Swedenborg's Theological Writings, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg proposes that one law of divine providence is that man should act from freedom according to reason, and that man is regenerated according to the faculties of rationality and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. Divine Providence, note 71-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Jewish thought==
{{Main|Divine providence (Judaism)}}
Divine providence ({{lang-he-n|השגחה פרטית}} ''Hashgochoh Protis'' / ''Hashgachah Pratit'' lit. [Divine] supervision of the individual) is discussed throughout [[Rabbinic literature]], and in particular by the classical Jewish philosophers. These writings maintain that divine providence means that God is directing (or even recreating) every minute detail of creation. This analysis thus underpins much of [[Orthodox Judaism]]'s [[world view]], particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world.

==LDS theology==
There is little theological literature on the terms '''provenance''' or '''providence''' in LDS studies. As stated above, Reformed theology relates these terms to predestination, which does have more prominence in LDS theology, if only as a polemical term. 

One particular text that could be interpreted as being related to such terms is in the Book of Abraham. As Abraham is shown the heavens, he is also shown the pre-mortal spirits of mankind. &lt;blockquote&gt;And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng|title=Abraham 3|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The "making of rulers" above is explained as foreordination (in the chapter summary) as opposed to "predestination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/12/i-have-a-question?lang=eng|title=I Have a Question - Ensign Dec. 1990 - ensign|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This differentiation balances free will (or free agency in LDS theology) against Divine intervenion. Noted LDS scholar Richard Draper has described the church's position thusly, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rejects the belief in predestination-that God predetermines the salvation or the damnation of every individual ... The LDS position is based in part on the teachings of Paul that God "will render to every man according to his deeds" and that "there is no respect of persons with God" (Rom. 2:6, 11). These two principles provide a basis for understanding Paul's use of the term "predestination." The term apparently connoted "to be ordained beforehand for godly labor." In the sense that one's potential or calling has been recognized and declared, this interpretation conforms with the Greek term Paul used, ''proorizo'', and does not denote an irreversible or irresistible predetermination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Predestination|title=Predestination - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this does not imply a passive God. In fact, LDS theology favours a more active, interventionist God. In its more recent General Conferences of the church, Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, clearly articulates this, "Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/by-divine-design?lang=eng|title=By Divine Design - By Elder Ronald A. Rasband|last=Rasband|first=By Elder Ronald A.|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasband continues by citing a well-known text from in the Book of Mormon&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng|title=1 Nephi 4|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lds.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which Nephi finds his nemesis unconscious from inebriation in front of him, he concludes, "Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban? Or was it by “divine design”?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the text itself limits the interaction of the Divine to the "Spirit" to commanding Nephi to "Slay him."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to note, though, that God also limits his involvement. Rasband interprets one particular passage from the Book of Mormon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.24-25?lang=eng#23|title=Helaman 4|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as saying that God (through his Spirit) will only intervene based on righteousness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rasband concludes that, "When we are righteous, willing, and able, when we are striving to be worthy and qualified, we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father’s “divine design.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specific examples==

===Text of Scripture===
Those who believe in the [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the original [[biblical manuscript]]s often accompany this belief with a statement about how the biblical text has been preserved so that what we have today is at least substantially similar to what was written. That is, just as God "divinely inspired the text," so he has also "divinely preserved it throughout the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quodlibet.net/weil-inerrancy.shtml |title=Inerrancy and its Implications for Authority: Textual Critical Considerations in Formulating an Evangelical Doctrine of Scripture |journal=[[Quodlibet (journal)|Quodlibet]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] states that the Scriptures, "being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical."&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], I.viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an important argument in the [[King James Only movement|King James Only]] debates. [[Edward F. Hills]] argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed [[Textus Receptus]] must be the closest text to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[autograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''King James Version Defended!'', pp. 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Efficient energy use''', sometimes simply called '''energy efficiency''', is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.

There are many motivations to improve energy efficiency. Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy-efficient technology. Reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important solution is to remove government-led energy subsidies that promote high energy consumption and inefficient energy use in more than half of the countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2010) ‘Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective’, International Journal of Environmental Studies, Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515305&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the ''twin pillars'' of [[sustainable energy]] policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Prindle |first1= Bill |last2= Eldridge |first2= Maggie |last3= Eckhardt |first3= Mike |last4= Frederick |first4= Alyssa |title= The twin pillars of sustainable energy: synergies between energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and policy |date= May 2007 |publisher= American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) |place= Washington, DC, USA |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.545.4606&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date= 2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are high priorities in the sustainable [[energy hierarchy]]. In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate of energy at which domestic energy resources are depleted.

==Overview==
{{Further|Domestic energy consumption}}
Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing [[energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=UNP|location=London|pages=180–181|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; States such as Connecticut and New York have created quasi-public [[Green bank (financial institution)|Green Banks]] to help residential and commercial building-owners finance energy efficiency upgrades that reduce emissions and cut consumers' energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, Hallie. "Working Paper: State Green Banks for Clean Energy" http://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WorkingPaper_StateGreenBanks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovin's [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] points out that in industrial settings, "there are abundant opportunities to save 70% to 90% of the energy and cost for lighting, fan, and pump systems; 50% for electric motors; and 60% in areas such as heating, cooling, office equipment, and appliances." In general, up to 75% of the electricity used in the US today could be saved with efficiency measures that cost less than the electricity itself, the same holds true for home settings. The US Department of Energy has stated that there is potential for energy saving in the magnitude of 90 Billion kWh by increasing home energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |title=Weatherization in Austin, Texas |publisher=Green Collar Operations |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803235602/http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |archivedate=2009-08-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have emphasized this. A report published in 2006 by the [[McKinsey Global Institute]], asserted that "there are sufficient economically viable opportunities for energy-productivity improvements that could keep global energy-demand growth at less than 1 percent per annum"—less than half of the 2.2 percent average growth anticipated through 2020 in a business-as-usual scenario.&lt;ref name= NYT292006&gt;{{cite news|title= Energy Use Can Be Cut by Efficiency, Survey Says.... |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/business/29energy.html |accessdate= November 29, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times |date= November 29, 2006|author= Steve Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy productivity, which measures the output and quality of goods and services per unit of energy input, can come from either reducing the amount of energy required to produce something, or from increasing the quantity or quality of goods and services from the same amount of energy.

The [[Vienna Climate Change Talks 2007]] Report, under the auspices of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), clearly shows "that energy efficiency can achieve real emission reductions at low cost."&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20070831_vienna_closing_press_release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International standard]]s ISO{{nbsp}}17743 and ISO{{nbsp}}17742 provide a documented methodology for calculating and reporting on energy savings and energy efficiency for countries and cities.&lt;ref name="iso-17743"&gt;

==Appliances==
{{See also|green computing|solar lamp|energy saving lamp|power usage effectiveness}}

Modern appliances, such as, [[freezers]], [[oven]]s, [[stove]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, and clothes washers and dryers, use significantly less energy than older appliances. Installing a clothesline will significantly reduce one's energy consumption as their dryer will be used less. Current energy-efficient refrigerators, for example, use 40 percent less energy than conventional models did in 2001. Following this, if all households in Europe changed their more than ten-year-old appliances into new ones, 20 billion kWh of electricity would be saved annually, hence reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by almost 18 billion kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |title=Ecosavings |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070945/http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the corresponding figures would be 17 billion kWh of electricity and {{convert|27000000000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrolux.com/ecosavings_us |title=Ecosavings (Tm) Calculator |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study from [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] the replacement of old appliances is one of the most efficient global measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Pathways to a Low-Carbon Economy: Version 2 of the Global Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Curve|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/sustainability/cost%20curve%20pdfs/pathways_lowcarbon_economy_version2.ashx|accessdate=February 16, 2016|page=7|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern power management systems also reduce energy usage by idle appliances by turning them off or putting them into a low-energy mode after a certain time. Many countries identify energy-efficient appliances using [[energy input labeling]].&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://www.eesi.org/buildings_efficiency_0506 |title=Energy-Efficient Buildings: Using whole building design to reduce energy consumption in homes and offices |publisher=Eesi.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of energy efficiency on peak demand depends on when the appliance is used. For example, an air conditioner uses more energy during the afternoon when it is hot. Therefore, an energy-efficient air conditioner will have a larger impact on peak demand than off-peak demand. An energy-efficient dishwasher, on the other hand, uses more energy during the late evening when people do their dishes. This appliance may have little to no impact on peak demand.

Buildings are an important field for energy efficiency improvements around the world because of their role as a major energy consumer. However, the question of energy use in buildings is not straightforward as the indoor conditions that can be achieved with energy use vary a lot. The measures that keep buildings comfortable, lighting, heating, cooling and ventilation, all consume energy. Typically the level of energy efficiency in a building is measured by dividing energy consumed with the floor area of the building which is referred to as specific energy consumption (SEC) or energy use intensity (EUI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=buildingcontest.eui]&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac \text{Energy consumed}\text{Built area}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the issue is more complex as building materials have [[embodied energy]] in them. On the other hand, energy can be recovered from the materials when the building is dismantled by reusing materials or burning them for energy. Moreover, when the building is used, the indoor conditions can vary resulting in higher and lower quality indoor environments. Finally, overall efficiency is affected by the use of the building: is the building occupied most of the time and are spaces efficiently used — or is the building largely empty? It has even been suggested that for a more complete accounting of energy efficiency, SEC should be amended to include these factors:&lt;ref&gt;Juha Forsström, Pekka Lahti, Esa Pursiheimo, Miika Rämä, Jari Shemeikka, Kari Sipilä, Pekka Tuominen &amp; Irmeli Wahlgren (2011): [http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/tiedotteet/2011/T2581.pdf Measuring energy efficiency]. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{Embodied energy} + \text{Energy consumed} - \text{Energy recovered}}{\text{Built area} \times \text{Utilization rate} \times \text{Quality factor}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a balanced approach to energy efficiency in buildings should be more comprehensive than simply trying to minimize energy consumed. Issues such as quality of indoor environment and efficiency of space use should be factored in. Thus the measures used to improve energy efficiency can take many different forms. Often they include passive measures that inherently reduce the need to use energy, such as better insulation. Many serve various functions improving the indoor conditions as well as reducing energy use, such as increased use of natural light.

A building's location and surroundings play a key role in regulating its temperature and illumination. For example, trees, landscaping, and hills can provide shade and block wind. In cooler climates, designing northern hemisphere buildings with south facing windows and southern hemisphere buildings with north facing windows increases the amount of sun (ultimately heat energy) entering the building, minimizing energy use, by maximizing [[passive solar heating]]. Tight building design, including energy-efficient windows, well-sealed doors, and additional thermal insulation of walls, basement slabs, and foundations can reduce heat loss by 25 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most heat is lost through the walls of your building, in fact about a third of all heat losses occur in this area. [https://www.simplybusinessenergy.co.uk/news/electricity-and-energy-cost-savings-for-small-businesses~188/ Simply Business Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark roofs may become up to 39&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;nbsp;°F) hotter than the most [[reflective surfaces (climate engineering)|reflective white surfaces]]. They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building. US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs. White roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates. Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort of people in the building.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Proper placement of windows and skylights as well as the use of architectural features that reflect light into a building can reduce the need for artificial lighting. Increased use of natural and task lighting has been shown by one study to increase productivity in schools and offices.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Newer fluorescent lights produce a natural light, and in most applications they are cost effective, despite their higher initial cost, with payback periods as low as a few months. [[LED lamp]]s use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Effective energy-efficient building design can include the use of low cost Passive Infra Reds (PIRs) to switch-off lighting when areas are unnoccupied such as toilets, corridors or even office areas out-of-hours. In addition, lux levels can be monitored using daylight sensors linked to the building's lighting scheme to switch on/off or dim the lighting to pre-defined levels to take into account the natural light and thus reduce consumption. Building Management Systems (BMS) link all of this together in one centralised computer to control the whole building's lighting and power requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Energy Efficient Offices - Electrical Contractor Fit-out Article&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis that integrates a residential bottom-up simulation with an economic multi-sector model, it has been shown that variable heat gains caused by insulation and air-conditioning efficiency can have load-shifting effects that are not uniform on the electricity load. The study also highlighted the impact of higher household efficiency on the power generation capacity choices that are made by the power sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12053-015-9392-9 |title=Beyond the end-consumer: how would improvements in residential energy efficiency affect the power sector in Saudi Arabia? |year=2015 |last1=Matar |first1=W |journal=Energy Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of which space heating or cooling technology to use in buildings can have a significant impact on energy use and efficiency. For example, replacing an older 50% efficient [[furnace#Household furnaces|natural gas furnace]] with a new 95% efficient one will dramatically reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and winter natural gas bills. [[Ground source heat pump]]s can be even more energy-efficient and cost-effective. These systems use pumps and compressors to move refrigerant fluid around a thermodynamic cycle in order to "pump" heat against its natural flow from hot to cold, for the purpose of transferring heat into a building from the large thermal reservoir contained within the nearby ground. The end result is that heat pumps typically use four times less electrical energy to deliver an equivalent amount of heat than a direct electrical heater does. Another advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it can be reversed in summertime and operate to cool the air by transferring heat from the building to the ground. The disadvantage of ground source heat pumps is their high initial capital cost, but this is typically recouped within five to ten years as a result of lower energy use.

[[Smart meter]]s are slowly being adopted by the commercial sector to highlight to staff and for internal monitoring purposes the building's energy usage in a dynamic presentable format. The use of Power Quality Analysers can be introduced into an existing building to assess usage, harmonic distortion, peaks, swells and interruptions amongst others to ultimately make the building more energy-efficient. Often such meters communicate by using [[wireless sensor network]]s.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the [[Building Information Modeling]] efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines. But with the development of modern computer technology, a large number of [[building performance simulation]] tools are available on the market. When choosing which simulation tool to use in a project, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=A |last2=Dong |first2=B |last3=Leite |first3=F |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a rating system organized by the [[US Green Building Council]] (USGBC) to promote environmental responsibility in building design. They currently offer four levels of certification for existing buildings (LEED-EBOM) and new construction (LEED-NC) based on a building's compliance with the following criteria: [[Sustainable sites]], [[water efficiency]], energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LEED v4 for Building Design and Construction Checklist |url=http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150226000022/http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 February 2015 |website=USGBC |accessdate=29 April 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, USGBC developed the LEED Dynamic Plaque, a tool to track building performance against LEED metrics and a potential path to recertification. The following year, the council collaborated with [[Honeywell]] to pull data on energy and water use, as well as indoor air quality from a BAS to automatically update the plaque, providing a near-real-time view of performance. The USGBC office in [[Washington, D.C.]] is one of the first buildings to feature the live-updating LEED Dynamic Plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honeywell, USGBC Tool Monitors Building Sustainability|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/10/22/honeywell-usgbc-tool-monitors-building-sustainability/|website=Environmental Leader|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deep energy retrofit]] is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional [[green retrofit|energy retrofits]]. Deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential (“commercial”) buildings. A deep energy retrofit typically results in energy savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeancarassus.zumablog.com/images/2128_uploads/Fuerst_New_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]] has undergone a deep energy retrofit process that was completed in 2013. The project team, consisting of representatives from [[Johnson Controls]], [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], [[Clinton Climate Initiative]], and [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38% and $4.4 million.&lt;ref name=ESB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esbnyc.com/sustainability_energy_efficiency.asp |title=Visit &gt; Sustainability &amp; Energy Efficiency &amp;#124; Empire State Building |publisher=Esbnyc.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into [[superwindow]]s which block heat but pass light. [[Air conditioning]] operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved $17 million of the project's capital cost immediately, partly funding other retrofitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving a gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)]] rating in September 2011, the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States.&lt;ref name="inhabitat1"/&gt;
The [[Indianapolis City-County Building]] recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process, which has achieved an annual energy reduction of 46% and $750,000 annual energy saving.

Energy retrofits, including deep, and other types undertaken in residential, commercial or industrial locations are generally supported through various forms of financing or incentives. Incentives include pre-packaged rebates where the buyer/user may not even be aware that the item being used has been rebated or "bought down". "Upstream" or "Midstream" buy downs are common for efficient lighting products. Other rebates are more explicit and transparent to the end user through the use of formal applications. In addition to rebates, which may be offered through government or utility programs, governments sometimes offer tax incentives for energy efficiency projects. Some entities offer rebate and payment guidance and facilitation services that enable energy end use customers tap into rebate and incentive programs.

To evaluate the economic soundness of energy efficiency investments in buildings, [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or CEA can be used. A CEA calculation will produce the value of energy saved, sometimes called ''[[negawatt]]s'', in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Thus CEA allows comparing the price of negawatts with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Tuominen, Francesco Reda, Waled Dawoud, Bahaa Elboshy, Ghada Elshafei, Abdelazim Negm: [http://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00195-1 Economic Appraisal of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Using Cost-effectiveness Assessment].

==Energy efficiency by country==

===Europe===
{{See also|Energy efficiency in Europe (study)}}
{{Expand section|proper text and additional citations|date=June 2016}}

Energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030.

The first EU-wide target was set in 1998. Member states agreed to improve energy efficiency by 1 percent a year over twelve years. In addition, legislation about products, industry, transport and buildings has contributed to a general energy efficiency framework. More effort is needed to address heating and cooling: there is more heat wasted during electricity production in Europe than is required to heat all buildings in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heatroadmap.eu/|title=Heat Roadmap Europe|website=www.heatroadmap.eu|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, EU energy efficiency legislation is estimated to deliver savings worth the equivalent of up to 326 million tons of oil per year by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU set itself a [[EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012|20% energy savings target]] by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, but member states decide individually how energy savings will be achieved. At an EU summit in October 2014, EU countries agreed on a new energy efficiency target of 27% or greater by 2030. One mechanism used to achieve the target of 27% is the 'Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates|url=http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/white-certificates|website=Europa.EU|publisher=Europa.eu|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing debate around the 2016 Clean Energy Package also puts an emphasis on energy efficiency, but the goal will probably remain around 30% greater efficiency compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this will not be enough for the EU to meet its Paris Agreement goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels.

===Australia===
The [[Australian national government]] is actively leading the country in efforts to increase their energy efficiency, mainly through the government's [[Department of Industry and Science]]. In July 2009, the [[Council of Australian Governments]], which represents the individual states and territories of Australia, agreed to a National Strategy on Energy Efficiency (NSEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Strategy on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Industry.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913191712/http://www.industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a ten-year plan accelerate the implementation of a nationwide adoption of energy-efficient practices and a preparation for the country's transformation into a [[low carbon]] future. There are several different areas of energy use addressed within the NSEE. But, the chapter devoted to the approach on energy efficiency that is to be adopted on a national level stresses four points in achieving stated levels of energy efficiency. They are:
*To help households and businesses transition to a low carbon future
*To streamline the adoption of efficient energy
*To make buildings more energy-efficient
*For governments to work in partnership and lead the way to energy efficiency

The overriding agreement that governs this strategy is the National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Fif.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://www.federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312005515/http://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This document also explains the role of both the [[commonwealth]] and the individual states and territories in the NSEE, as well provides for the creation of benchmarks and measurement devices which will transparently show the nation's progress in relation to the stated goals, and addresses the need for funding of the strategy in order to enable it to move forward.

===Canada===

In August 2017, the Government of Canada released [https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/emmc/pdf/Building_Smart_en.pdf Build Smart - Canada's Buildings Strategy], as a key driver of the [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change], Canada's national climate strategy.

The Build Smart strategy seeks to dramatically increase the energy-efficiency performance of existing and new Canadian buildings, and establishes five goals to that end:
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a “net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop a model code for existing buildings by 2022, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt the code.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work together with the aim of requiring labelling of building energy use by as early as 2019.
*The federal government will set new standards for heating equipment and other key technologies to the highest level of efficiency that is economically and technically achievable.
*Provincial and territorial governments will work to sustain and expand efforts to retrofit existing buildings by supporting energy efficiency improvements and by accelerating the adoption of high-efficiency equipment while tailoring their programs to regional circumstances.

The strategy details a range of activities the Government of Canada will pursue, and investments it will make, in support of the goals. As of early 2018, only one of Canada's 10 provinces and three territories, British Columbia, has developed a policy in support of federal government's goal to reach net zero energy ready ambitions: the [[BC Energy Step Code]].

Local British Columbia governments may use the BC Energy Step Code, if they wish, to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. The regulation and standard is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032.

Efforts to reduce final energy consumption in transport sector have not been successful, with a growth of 1.7% between 2005–2014. This growth is due to both road passenger and road freight transport. Both sectors increased their overall distance travelled to record the highest figures ever for Germany. Rebound effects played a significant role, both between improved vehicle efficiency and the distance travelled, and between improved vehicle efficiency and an increase in vehicle weights and engine power.&lt;ref name="loeschel-etal-2015"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency. The policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures. The central short-term measures of NAPE include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency, the raising of funding for building renovation, the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector, and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry. German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

On 12 August 2016, the German government released a [[green paper]] on energy efficiency for public consultation (in German).&lt;ref name="bmwi-2016-press-release"&gt;

A 2011 [[Energy Modeling Forum]] study covering the United States examines how energy efficiency opportunities will shape future fuel and electricity demand over the next several decades. The US economy is already set to lower its energy and carbon intensity, but explicit policies will be necessary to meet climate goals. These policies include: a carbon tax, mandated standards for more efficient appliances, buildings and vehicles, and subsidies or reductions in the upfront costs of new more energy-efficient equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Industry==
Industries use a large amount of energy to power a diverse range of manufacturing and resource extraction processes. Many industrial processes require large amounts of heat and mechanical power, most of which is delivered as [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|petroleum fuels]], and [[electricity]]. In addition some industries generate fuel from waste products that can be used to provide additional energy.

Because industrial processes are so diverse it is impossible to describe the multitude of possible opportunities for energy efficiency in industry. Many depend on the specific technologies and processes in use at each industrial facility. There are, however, a number of processes and energy services that are widely used in many industries.

Various industries generate [[steam]] and electricity for subsequent use within their facilities. When electricity is generated, the heat that is produced as a by-product can be captured and used for process steam, heating or other industrial purposes. Conventional electricity generation is about 30% efficient, whereas combined heat and power (also called [[co-generation]]) converts up to 90 percent of the fuel into usable energy.&lt;ref name=indust&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://ladoma.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Energy-Efficiency-Fact-Sheet.pdf |title=Industrial Energy Efficiency: Using new technologies to reduce energy use in industry and manufacturing |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced boilers and furnaces can operate at higher temperatures while burning less fuel. These technologies are more efficient and produce fewer pollutants.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

Over 45 percent of the fuel used by US manufacturers is burnt to make steam. The typical industrial facility can reduce this energy usage 20 percent (according to the [[US Department of Energy]]) by insulating steam and condensate return lines, stopping steam leakage, and maintaining steam traps.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s usually run at a constant speed, but a [[variable speed drives|variable speed drive]] allows the motor's energy output to match the required load. This achieves energy savings ranging from 3 to 60 percent, depending on how the motor is used. Motor coils made of [[superconducting]] materials can also reduce energy losses.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt; Motors may also benefit from [[voltage optimisation]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Industry uses a large number of [[pumps]] and [[compressors]] of all shapes and sizes and in a wide variety of applications. The efficiency of pumps and compressors depends on many factors but often improvements can be made by implementing better [[process control]] and better maintenance practices. Compressors are commonly used to provide [[compressed air]] which is used for sand blasting, painting, and other power tools. According to the US Department of Energy, optimizing compressed air systems by installing variable speed drives, along with preventive maintenance to detect and fix air leaks, can improve energy efficiency 20 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

==Transportation==

===Automobiles===
{{Main|Fuel economy in automobiles}}

[[File:NYPD Traffic Enforcement RMP In White.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Prius]] used by [[NYPD#Traffic Enforcement|NYPD Traffic Enforcement]]]]

The estimated energy efficiency for an automobile is 280 Passenger-Mile/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Btu.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Dorf, ''The Energy Factbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to enhance a vehicle's energy efficiency. Using improved [[aerodynamics]] to minimize drag can increase vehicle [[fuel efficiency]]. Reducing vehicle weight can also improve fuel economy, which is why [[composite materials]] are widely used in car bodies.

More advanced tires, with decreased tire to road friction and rolling resistance, can save gasoline. Fuel economy can be improved by up to 3.3% by keeping tires inflated to the correct pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml |title=Tips to improve your Gas Mileage |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing a clogged air filter can improve a cars fuel consumption by as much as 10 percent on older vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On newer vehicles (1980s and up) with fuel-injected, computer-controlled engines, a clogged air filter has no effect on mpg but replacing it may improve acceleration by 6-11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/Air_Filter_Effects_02_26_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamics also aid in efficiency of a vehicle. The design of a car impacts the amount of gas needed to move it through air. Aerodynamics involves the air around the car, which can affect the efficiency of the energy expended. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/what-makes-a-car-fuel-efficient|title=What Makes a Fuel Efficient Car? The 8 Most Fuel Efficient Cars|work=CarsDirect|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turbocharger]]s can increase fuel efficiency by allowing a smaller displacement engine. The 'Engine of the year 2011' is a Fiat 500 engine equipped with an MHI turbocharger. "Compared with a 1.2-liter 8v engine, the new 85 HP turbo has 23% more power and a 30% better performance index. The performance of the two-cylinder is not only equivalent to a 1.4-liter 16v engine, but fuel consumption is 30% lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat 875cc TwinAir named International Engine of the Year 2011|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/fiat-20110520.html|website=Green Car Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient vehicles may reach twice the fuel efficiency of the average automobile. Cutting-edge designs, such as the diesel [[Mercedes-Benz Bionic]] concept vehicle have achieved a fuel efficiency as high as {{convert|84|mpgus}}, four times the current conventional automotive average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pd{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream trend in automotive efficiency is the rise of [[electric vehicle]]s (all@electric or hybrid electric). Hybrids, like the [[Toyota Prius]], use [[regenerative braking]] to recapture energy that would dissipate in normal cars; the effect is especially pronounced in city driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nom * |url=https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |title=La Prius de Toyota, une référence des voitures hybrides &amp;#124; L'énergie en questions |publisher=Lenergieenquestions.fr |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017080726/https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plug-in hybrid]]s also have increased battery capacity, which makes it possible to drive for limited distances without burning any gasoline; in this case, energy efficiency is dictated by whatever process (such as coal-burning, hydroelectric, or renewable source) created the power. Plug-ins can typically drive for around {{convert|40|mi}} purely on electricity without recharging; if the battery runs low, a gas engine kicks in allowing for extended range. Finally, all-electric cars are also growing in popularity; the [[Tesla Model S]] sedan is the only high-performance all-electric car currently on the market.

===Street lighting===
Cities around the globe light up millions of streets with 300 million lights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2763639/global_led_and_smart_street_lighting_market&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities are seeking to reduce [[street light]] power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours or switching to LED lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/on_your_streets/street-lighting.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the high luminous efficiency of LEDs will lead to real reductions in energy, as cities may end up installing extra lamps or lighting areas more brightly than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C. C. M.|last2=Hänel|first2=A.|last3=Hölker|first3=F.|title=Redefining efficiency for outdoor lighting|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2014|volume=7|issue=6|pages=1806|doi=10.1039/C4EE00566J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
{{Main|Fuel economy in aircraft|Environmental impact of aviation}}

There are several ways to reduce energy usage in air transportation, from modifications to the planes themselves, to how air traffic is managed. As in cars, turbochargers are an effective way to reduce energy consumption; however, instead of allowing for the use of a smaller-displacement engine, turbochargers in jet turbines operate by compressing the thinner air at higher altitudes. This allows the engine to operate as if it were at sea-level pressures while taking advantage of the reduced drag on the aircraft at higher altitudes.

Air traffic management systems are another way to increase the efficiency of not just the aircraft but the airline industry as a whole. New technology allows for superior automation of takeoff, landing, and collision avoidance, as well as within airports, from simple things like HVAC and lighting to more complex tasks such as security and scanning.

==Alternative fuels==

==Energy conservation==
{{Main|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Illust passive solar d1.gif|thumb|250px|right|Elements of [[Passive solar building design|passive solar energy design]], shown in a direct gain application]]

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in including active efforts to decrease energy consumption, for example through [[behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]], in addition to using energy more efficiently. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements are heating a room less in winter, using the car less, air-drying your clothes instead of using the dryer, or enabling energy saving modes on a computer. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. et al. (2009).[http://www.pnas.org/content/106/44/18452.full Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions]. PNAS. 106(44).&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy conservation is a challenge requiring policy programmes, technological development and behavior change to go hand in hand. Many energy [[intermediary]] organisations, for example governmental or non-governmental organisations on local, regional, or national level, are working on often publicly funded programmes or projects to meet this challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Breukers, Heiskanen, et al. (2009). Interaction schemes for successful demand-side management. Deliverable 5 of the [http://www.energychange.info/index.php CHANGING BEHAVIOUR] project. Funded by the EC (#213217).&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have also engaged with the issue of energy conservation and have provided guidelines for realizing behavior change to reduce energy consumption while taking technological and policy considerations into account.&lt;ref&gt;Kok, G., Lo, S.H., Peters, G.J. &amp; R.A.C. Ruiter (2011), Changing Energy-Related Behavior: An Intervention Mapping Approach, Energy Policy, 39:9, 5280-5286, doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.036&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory maintains a comprehensive list of apps useful for energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.openei.org/apps/ |title=National Renewable Energy Laboratory. (2012) |publisher=En.openei.org |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

==Sustainable energy==
{{Main|Sustainable energy}}

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the “twin pillars” of a sustainable [[energy policy]]. Both strategies must be developed concurrently in order to stabilize and reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. Efficient energy use is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising [[clean energy]] supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too rapidly, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total carbon emissions; a reduction in the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. A sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111000420/http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df=}}([[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Lieef (www.Lieef.com) have started reporting ESG metrics on behalf of companies, and investment funds, in an effort to increase transparency in the space which to date has increased in importance, but has not found a unified measurement tool. In addition, the majority of companies that report sustainability do so on a 'net' basis, and do not reflect their carbon emissions, and separate those emissions from their activities that offset those emissions, such as buying renewable credits and green power..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Lieef.com/ |title=Lieef.com; Lieef inc |publisher=Lieef.com |date=2018-05-28 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebound effect==
{{Further|Rebound effect (conservation)|Jevons' paradox}}
If the demand for energy services remains constant, improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models. This is because they make energy services cheaper, and so consumption of those services increases. For example, since fuel efficient vehicles make travel cheaper, consumers may choose to drive farther, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011).

[[File:EFMS.pdf|thumb|EFMS]]
'''Energy and facility management software''' is a term used to refer to an enterprise-wide platform for handling technical data related to buildings and stems from the merger of [[Energy management software|EMS]] (energy management software), [[Computer-aided facility management|CAFM]] (Computer Aided Facility Management) and [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software). As such it involves the gathering and processing or information that is required for maintaining acceptable indoor comfort level while minimizing energy use.

==Purpose==
An EFMS serves a dual purpose:

*'''Tactical:''' On a day-to-day operational level an EFMS will help improve comfort level where required while minimizing energy consumption. Should comfort level not be an issue, the EFMS will focus processes and resources on reducing energy spending.
*'''Strategic:''' On a mid-to-long term scope an EFMS will support the development strategy of the organization with information that will support managerial decisions such as systems, vendors or processes efficiencies, ratings and critical areas etc.

== Method ==

=== Information Classes ===
To achieve its purpose an EFMS integrates several informational classes in a common processing environment, mainly:

*'''Energy consumption information''' information commonly handled by an EMS and derived from online metering devices (such as [[Electric energy meter|Energy meters]], [[Gas meter]]s).
*'''System information''' such as [[HVAC|HVAC systems]] settings, sensor readings etc. commonly resident in a [[Building Management System|BMS]].
*'''Assets Information''', such as building size, floor number and area, cooling capacity of installed [[HVAC|HVAC systems]], maintenance logs etc. commonly found in a CAFM system.
*'''Weather information''' commonly derived from internet weather feeds or locally installed sensors.
*'''Occupancy / Use information''' such as room occupancy of a hotel or customers served at a retail store commonly found in an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]].
*'''Utility bills information''' commonly resident in an [[Energy accounting software|EAS]] (Energy Accounting Software).

=== Components ===
An EFMS should be consisted of at least the following modules:

*'''Visualization / Dashboard Module''' which will present graphical or table illustrations of energy information (from EMS), system information (from BMS) and Billing information (from EAS).
*'''Alarming Module''' which will create and manage alarms based on given threshold values and / or Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis detection methods.
*'''Work Order Module''' which will create and manage notifications of alarms directed towards appropriate users. The Work Order Module will manage actions of users related to each fault along the Fault Cycle (birth, detection, diagnosis, action, evaluation).
*'''Data Sources Module''' which will manage the connection to and synchronization with the various data sources such as energy management systems and metering devices, [[Building Management System|BMS]], [[Energy accounting software|EAS]], [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] etc.
*'''Reporting Module''' which will manage the creation and distribution of energy and facility reports.

=== Processes ===
The processes performed in an EFMS fall under the categories of:
*'''Entry Processes''' which may be ''tactical'' such as the automated synchronization with a BMS or ERP or ''ad hoc'' such as the manual entry of utility bills data or the upload of a maintenance log.
*'''FDD Processes''' (''Faults Detection &amp; Diagnosis'') which may include sub-processes for setting various thresholds, selecting from a list of rules which ones should be applied to each specific building / installation and the tactical application of rule sets and threshold values to an FDD scanning process of building related data.
*'''Work Order Processes''' which include processes for relaying alerts and faults to users and managing the actions they undertake until the issue is resolved.
*'''Reporting Processes''' which involve tactical creation of visualization elements and reports or ad hoc querying processes for data mining and faults investigation.

==Applications==
Applications of integrated EFMS suites will benefit mostly organizations with either very large and busy facilities, such as malls, hotel complexes and transportation hubs the complexity of which challenges operational efficiency and organizations with many buildings dispersed across remote locations such as retail chains, restaurant chains, banks and food store chains which operate medium-sized buildings that stretch [[facility management]] operations to high costs.

Commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options. The [http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=622/pagename=alpha_list_sub Department of Energy (DOE) Software Directory] describes EnergyActio software, a cloud based platform designed for this purpose.

'''Engineers Without Borders Ireland''' is an [[international development]] organisation for students and professionals from [[Ireland]] who share a common interest in [[sustainable development]] through engineering and [[appropriate technologies]].

The organisation was initially founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week project in the [http://www.sonairte.ie/ Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre] in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a lull in activities, a small group of engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions led to the formation of EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/history EWB-Ireland Website - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, EWB-Ireland has branches in [[University College Dublin]] and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/branches EWB Ireland Website - Branches]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">In [[second language acquisition]], '''error treatment''' refers to the way teachers respond to learners' [[Speech error|linguistic errors]] made in the course of learning a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Rod|authorlink=Rod Ellis|title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=701}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many error treatment studies seek to address issues like when, how, and by whom such errors should be corrected.

== Types ==
Craig Chaudron (1977) has pointed out four types of treatment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Chaudron|title=A descriptive model of discourse in the corrective treatment of learners' errors|journal=Language Learning|date=January 1977|volume=27|issue=1|pages=29–46|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1977.tb00290.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Treatment that creates an autonomous ability in learners to correct themselves on any item
* Treatment that elicits a correct response from the learners
*Any reaction/treatment by a teacher that demands improvement
*Positive or negative reinforcement involving the expression of approval or disapproval

== Terminologies ==
A number of terms are used to discuss the various areas of error treatment, though the differences among these terms are very subtle.

=== Feedback ===
It has characteristics of constructive criticism which may be positive or negative usually from a more informed source.

=== Correction ===
In correcting errors, correction is a post-production exercise and basically deals with the linguistic errors.&lt;ref name=Ellis584&gt;Ellis, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt; Often in the form of feedback, it draws learners' attention to the mistakes they have made and acts as a reminder of the correct form of language.

=== Repair ===
Errors that cause "communication difficulties" are likely to be "repaired" either by speaker or listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allwright |first1=Dick |last2=Bailey |first2=Kathleen M.|title=Focus on the Language classroom |url= |accessdate= |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-26909-1 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term repair, which includes correction, is an attempt to identify and correct the communication difficulties.

== Role of teachers and learners ==
The role of teachers and that of learners in correcting errors are of great importance. This tries to answer the question as to ''who'' should indicate and fix the error. The phenomenon is known as "self" and "other". Depending on who indicates and fixes the error either in conversation or in classroom, there can be four possible ways of error correction:&lt;ref&gt;Allwright, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
* self-initiated other-completed
* self-initiated self-completed
* other-initiated self-completed
* other-initiated other-completed
According to Van Lier (1988), in naturally occurring conversation, self-initiated and self-completed repair occurs while in teacher-dominated classroom, other-initiated and other-completed repair can be sought for.

== Description ==
Much of the studies on error treatment have focused on the following three issues:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Michael Byram |encyclopedia=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning |publisher= |year=2004 |isbn=9780415332866|page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the type of errors that should be treated/corrected
* who performs the correction
* when and how corrections should be made

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3084">'''Falconer's formula''' is a mathematical [[formula]]  that is used used in [[twin studies]] to estimate the relative contribution of genetics vs. environment to variation in a particular [[trait (biology)|trait]] (that is, the [[heritability]] of the trait)  based on the difference between [[twin]] [[correlation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weber |first1=Wendell W. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacogenetics |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-971216-8 |pages=107–8 |edition=2nd | chapter = Chapter 5: Genetics in Pharmacology: Twin Studies | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvK8BKbeNWAC&amp;pg=PA107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first proposed by the Scottish geneticist [[Douglas Scott Falconer|Douglas Falconer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Falconer DS, Mackay TF | title = Introduction to quantitative genetics | date = 1998 | publisher = Longman Group, Ltd. | location = Essex | isbn = 978-0-582-24302-6 | edition = 4th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula is

: H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2(r&lt;sub&gt;mz&lt;/sub&gt; - r&lt;sub&gt;dz&lt;/sub&gt;)

where H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the broad sense heritability, r&lt;sub&gt;mz&lt;/sub&gt; is the (monozygotic, MZ) identical twin correlation, and r&lt;sub&gt;dz&lt;/sub&gt; is the (dizygotic, DZ) [[fraternal twin]] correlation. The correlation of same sex MZ twins is always higher than the DZ twin correlation with various sexes and thus all [[gender differences]] are evaluated as heritable. To avoid this error, only genetic studies comparing MZ twins with the same sex DZ twins are valid. Correlations between A = h&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (additive genetics) and C (common environment) must be included in the derivation shown below.

:''r''&lt;sub&gt;mz&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A'' + ''C'' + 2 Corr(''A'',''C'')

:''r''&lt;sub&gt;dz&lt;/sub&gt; = ½''A'' + ''C'' + 2 Corr(½''A'',''C'')

Falconer's formula is based on assumptions that have been widely criticized as flawed. For example, it only calculates narrow-sense heritability, meaning it assumes that all genetic effects are additive; this assumption does not comport with the functioning of genes in real biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gordon H, Trier Moller F, Andersen V, Harbord M | title = Heritability in inflammatory bowel disease: from the first twin study to genome-wide association studies | journal = Inflammatory Bowel Diseases | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 1428–34 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25895112 | pmc = 4450891 | doi = 10.1097/mib.0000000000000393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula also overestimates broad-sense heritability due to an overestimation of dominance variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvK8BKbeNWAC |title=Pharmacogenetics | edition = 2nd | volume = 55 | series = Oxford Monographs on Medical Genetics |last=Weber |first=Wendell | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008-04-02 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-971216-8 |pages=107–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abies procera 'Glauca' - 20101120-02.jpg|thumb|right|Seedlings of ''[[Abies procera]]'' sometimes arise that have attractive silvery-blue foliage. The name ''Abies procera'' Rehder forma ''glauca'' (Ravenscr.) Rehder has been created for these. However, if the plants are selectively propagated for the [[horticulture]] trade, a [[cultivar]] name is generally used instead.]]

In [[botanical nomenclature]], a '''''form''''' (''forma'', plural ''formae'') is one of the "secondary" [[taxonomic rank]]s, below that of [[Variety (biology)|variety]], which in turn is below that of species; it is an [[infraspecific taxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }} Chapter I. Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; If more than three ranks are listed in describing a taxon, the "classification" is being specified, but only three parts make up the "name" of the taxon: a [[genus]] name, a [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], and an [[infraspecific epithet]].

The abbreviation "f." or the full "forma" should be put before the infraspecific epithet to indicate the rank. It is not italicised.

For example:
* ''[[Acanthocalycium]] spiniflorum'' f. ''klimpelianum'' or
** ''Acanthocalycium spiniflorum'' forma ''klimpelianum'' (Weidlich &amp; Werderm.) Donald
* ''[[Crataegus aestivalis]]'' (Walter) Torr. &amp; A.Gray var. ''cerasoides'' Sarg. f. ''luculenta'' Sarg. is a classification of a plant whose name is:
** ''Crataegus aestivalis'' (Walter) Torr. &amp; A.Gray f. ''luculenta'' Sarg.

A form usually designates a group with a noticeable morphological deviation. The usual taxonomic practice is that the individuals classified within the form are not necessarily known to be closely related (they may not form a [[clade]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hamilton, C.W. |author2=Reichard, S.H. |year=1992 |title=Current Practice in the Use of Subspecies, Variety, and Forma in the Classification of Wild Plants |journal=Taxon |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=485–498 |jstor=1222819 |doi=10.2307/1222819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, white-flowered plants of species that usually have coloured flowers can be grouped and named (e.g., as "f. ''alba''"). '''''Formae apomicticae''''' are sometimes named among plants that reproduce asexually, by [[apomixis]]. There are theoretically countless numbers of forms based on minor genetic differences, and only a few that have particular significance are likely to be named.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83508">'''Gaseous signaling molecules''' are [[gas]]eous [[molecule]]s that are either [[biosynthesis|synthesised]] internally ([[endogenous]]ly) in the [[organism]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] or [[cell (biology)|cell]] or are received by the organism, tissue or cell from outside (say, from the atmosphere or [[hydrosphere]], as in the case of [[oxygen]]) and that are used to transmit chemical signals which induce certain physiological or biochemical changes in the organism, tissue or cell. The term is applied to, for example, [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[ammonia]], [[methane]], [[hydrogen]], [[ethylene]], etc.

Many, but not all, gaseous signaling molecules are called '''gasotransmitters'''.&lt;!--Bolded due to redirect, per MOS:BOLD--&gt;

The biological roles of each of the gaseous signaling molecules are in short outlined below.

== Gaseous signaling molecules as gasotransmitters ==

Gasotransmitters is a subfamily of endogenous molecules of gases or gaseous signaling molecules, including NO, CO, {{chem|H|2|S}}.&lt;ref name="GTs"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mustafa AK, Gadalla MM, Snyder SH | title = Signaling by gasotransmitters | journal = Sci Signal | volume = 2 | issue = 68 | pages = re2 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19401594 | pmc = 2744355 | doi = 10.1126/scisignal.268re2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These particular gases share many common features in their production and function but carry on their tasks in unique ways, which differ from classical signaling molecules, in the human body. In 1981, it was first suggested from clinical work with nitrous oxide that a gas had a direct action at pharmacological receptors and thereby acted as a neurotransmitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillman MA, Lichtigfeld FJ |title=A comparison of the effects of morphine sulphate and nitrous oxide analgesia on chronic pain states in man |journal=J.

Sci. |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=41–5 |date=January 1981 |pmid=7205318 |doi=10.1016/0022-510X(81)90186-6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillman MA, Lichtigfeld FJ |title=The similarity of the action of nitrous oxide and morphine |journal=Pain |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=110 |date=February 1981 |pmid=7232008 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(81)90054-3  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillman MA, Lichtigfeld FJ |title=Nitrous oxide interacts with opioid receptors: more evidence |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=483–4 |date=May 1983 |pmid=6301312 |doi= 10.1097/00000542-198305000-00021|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In vitro experiments confirmed these observations&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daras | first1 = C | last2 = Cantrill | first2 = R | last3 = Gillman | first3 = MA | year = 1983| title = (3H)Naloxone displacement: evidence for nitrous oxide as opioid receptor agonist | url = | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 177–178 | doi=10.1016/0014-2999(83)90626-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were replicated at NIDA later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ori | first1 = C. | last2 = Ford-Rice | first2 = F | last3 = London | first3 = E.D. | year = 1989 | title = Effects of nitrous oxide and halothane on mu and kappa opioid receptors in guinea-pig brain | url = | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 541–544 | doi=10.1097/00000542-198903000-00027}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The terminology and characterization criteria of “gasotransmitter” were firstly introduced in 2002.&lt;ref name="Wang 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = R | year = 2002 | title = Two's company, three's a crowd - Can {{chem|H|2|S}} be the third endogenous gaseous transmitter? | url = | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 13| pages = 1792–1798 | doi=10.1096/fj.02-0211hyp | pmid=12409322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For one gas molecule to be categorized as a gasotransmitters, all of the following criteria should be met.&lt;ref&gt;Wang R (ed) (2004) Signal Transduction and the Gasotransmitters: NO, CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in Biology and Medicine. Humana Press, New Jersey, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang 2002" /&gt;
# It is a small molecule of gas;
# It is freely permeable to membranes.  As such, its effects do not rely on the cognate membrane receptors. It can have endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects.  In their endocrine mode of action, for example, gasotransmitters can enter the blood stream; be carried to remote targets by scavengers and released there, and modulate functions of remote target cells;
# It is endogenously and enzymatically generated and its production is regulated;
# It has well defined and specific functions at physiologically relevant concentrations.  Thus, manipulating the endogenous levels of this gas evokes specific physiological changes;
# Functions of this endogenous gas can be mimicked by its exogenously applied counterpart;
# Its cellular effects may or may not be mediated by second messengers, but should have specific cellular and molecular targets.

In 2011, a [http://www.gasotransmitters.eu European Network on Gasotransmitters (ENOG)] was formed. The aim of the network is to promote research on NO, CO and {{chem|H|2|S}} in order to better understand the biology of gasotransmitters and to unravel the role of each mediator in health and disease. Moreover, the network aims to contribute to the translation of basic science knowledge in this area of research into therapeutic or diagnostic tools.

== Oxygen ==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
&lt;!--- To do ---&gt;

== Carbon dioxide ==
{{see also|Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules}}

Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its levels are high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.

Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].

Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels.&lt;ref name='solarnav'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/solar_cola/carbon_dioxide.htm |title=Carbon dioxide |accessdate=2007-10-12 |work=solarnavigator.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure of 40&amp;nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.

== Nitric oxide ==

{{Main|Biological functions of nitric oxide}}

NO is one of the few gaseous signalling molecules known and is additionally exceptional due to the fact that it is a radical gas. It is a key [[vertebrate]] [[signal transduction|biological messenger]], playing a role in a variety of biological processes.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Richard, [http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_weller_could_the_sun_be_good_for_your_heart.html Could the sun be good for your heart?] TedxGlasgow. Filmed March 2012, posted January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is a known bioproduct in almost all types of organisms, ranging from bacteria to plants, fungi, and animal cells.&lt;ref&gt;Roszer, T (2012) The Biology of Subcellular Nitric Oxide. {{ISBN|978-94-007-2818-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitric oxide, known as the '[[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]]', or 'EDRF', is biosynthesized endogenously from [[L-arginine]], [[oxygen]], and [[NADPH]] by various [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) [[enzyme]]s.  Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make nitric oxide. The [[endothelium]] (inner lining) of [[blood vessel]]s uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding [[smooth muscle]] to relax, thus resulting in [[vasodilation]] and increasing blood flow.

Nitric oxide can contribute to [[reperfusion injury]] when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion (following a period of [[ischemia]]) reacts with [[superoxide]] to produce the damaging oxidant [[peroxynitrite]]. In contrast, inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to help survival and recovery from [[paraquat]] poisoning, which produces lung tissue-damaging superoxide and hinders NOS metabolism.

Two important biological reaction mechanisms of nitric oxide are S-[[nitrosation]] of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of [[thiol]] groups, including [[cysteine]] residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-[[Nitrosation]] is a mechanism for dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein.&lt;ref&gt;van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (eds.) (2007) ''Radicals for life: The various forms of nitric oxide''. Elsevier, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|978-0-444-52236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO is referred to as a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.&lt;ref&gt;van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (2004) "Nitric Oxide", in ''Encyclopedia of Analytical Science'', 2nd ed., Elsevier, {{ISBN|0127641009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several mechanisms by which NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as [[ribonucleotide reductase]] and [[aconitase]], activation of the soluble [[guanylate cyclase]], ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group [[nitrosylation]], and iron regulatory factor activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7658698|year=1995|last1=Shami|first1=PJ|last2=Moore|first2=JO|last3=Gockerman|first3=JP|last4=Hathorn|first4=JW|last5=Misukonis|first5=MA|last6=Weinberg|first6=JB|title=Nitric oxide modulation of the growth and differentiation of freshly isolated acute non-lymphocytic leukemia cells|volume=19|issue=8|pages=527–33|journal=Leukemia Research|doi=10.1016/0145-2126(95)00013-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; NO has been demonstrated to activate [[NF-κB]] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kaibori M. |author2=Sakitani K. |author3=Oda M. |author4=Kamiyama Y. |author5=Masu Y. |author6=Okumura T. |year=1999|title=Immunosuppressant FK506 inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression at a step of NF-κB activation in rat hepatocytes|journal=J.

It was found that NO acts through the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic-GMP. Cyclic-GMP activates [[protein kinase G]], which causes reuptake of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ensures that the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=174|year=2003|last1=Rhoades|first1=RA|last2=Tanner|first2=GA|title=Medical physiology 2nd edition|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.

In mammals, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

There is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.&lt;ref name="clinical-trial"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrogen sulfide ==

{{main|Biological functions of hydrogen sulfide}}

Hydrogen sulfide is produced in small amounts by some cells of the [[mammal]]ian body and has a number of biological signaling functions. (Only two other such gases are currently known: [[nitric oxide]] (NO) and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO).)

The gas is produced from [[cysteine]] by the [[enzyme]]s [[cystathionine beta-synthase]] and [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]]. It acts as a relaxant of [[smooth muscle]] and as a [[vasodilator]]&lt;ref name="lefer" /&gt; and is also active in the [[brain]], where it increases the response of the [[NMDA receptor]] and facilitates [[long term potentiation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Eventually the gas is converted to sulfite in the [[mitochondria]] by thiosulfate reductase, and the sulfite is further oxidized to [[thiosulfate]] and [[sulfate]] by [[sulfite oxidase]]. The sulfates are excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name="Kamoun"&gt;{{Cite journal

Though both [[nitric oxide]] (NO) and hydrogen sulfide have been shown to relax blood vessels, their mechanisms of action are different: while NO activates the enzyme [[guanylyl cyclase]], {{chem|H|2|S}} activates [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel]]s in smooth muscle cells. Researchers are not clear how the vessel-relaxing responsibilities are shared between nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. However, there exists some evidence to suggest that nitric oxide does most of the vessel-relaxing work in large vessels and hydrogen sulfide is responsible for similar action in smaller blood vessels.&lt;ref name="sciam1"&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=toxic-gas-lifesaver Toxic Gas, Lifesaver]", ''Scientific American'', March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, {{chem|H|2|S}} reacts with intracellular [[S-Nitrosothiol|S-nitrosothiols]] to form the smallest S-nitrosothiol (HSNO), and a role of hydrogen sulfide in controlling the intracellular S-nitrosothiol pool has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[trisomy 21]] (Down syndrome) the body produces an excess of hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="Kamoun" /&gt; Hydrogen sulfide is also involved in the disease process of [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]]. The [[beta cell]]s of the [[pancreas]] in type 1 diabetes produce an excess of the gas, leading to the death of these cells and to a reduced production of insulin by those that remain.&lt;ref name="sciam1" /&gt;

In 2005, it was shown that [[mus musculus|mice]] can be put into a state of [[suspended animation]]-like [[hypothermia]] by applying a low dosage of hydrogen sulfide (81 [[parts per million|ppm]] {{chem|H|2|S}}) in the air. The breathing rate of the animals sank from 120 to 10 breaths per minute and their temperature fell from 37&amp;nbsp;°C to just 2&amp;nbsp;°C above ambient temperature (in effect, they had become [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]). The mice survived this procedure for 6 hours and afterwards showed no negative health consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/science/nature/4469793.stm Mice put in 'suspended animation'], BBC News, 21 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 it was shown that the [[blood pressure]] of mice treated in this fashion with hydrogen sulfide did not significantly decrease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4469793.stm Gas induces 'suspended animation'], BBC News, 9 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar process known as [[hibernation]] occurs naturally in many [[mammal]]s and also in [[toad]]s, but not in mice. (Mice can fall into a state called [[torpor|clinical torpor]] when food shortage occurs). If the {{chem|H|2|S}}-induced hibernation can be made to work in humans, it could be useful in the emergency management of severely injured patients, and in the conservation of donated organs. In 2008, hypothermia induced by hydrogen sulfide for 48 hours was shown to reduce the extent of brain damage caused by experimental [[stroke]] in rats.&lt;ref name="Florian"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Florian B, Vintilescu R, Balseanu AT, Buga AM, Grisk O, Walker LC, Kessler C, Popa-Wagner A |title=Long-term hypothermia reduces infarct volume in aged rats after focal ischemia |journal=Neurosci.

As mentioned above, hydrogen sulfide binds to [[Cytochrome c oxidase|cytochrome oxidase]] and thereby prevents oxygen from binding, which leads to the dramatic slowdown of [[metabolism]]. Animals and humans naturally produce some hydrogen sulfide in their body; researchers have proposed that the gas is used to regulate metabolic activity and body temperature, which would explain the above findings.&lt;ref&gt;Mark B. Roth and Todd Nystul. Buying Time in Suspended Animation. ''Scientific American, 1 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Two recent studies cast doubt that the effect can be achieved in larger mammals. A 2008 study failed to reproduce the effect in pigs, concluding that the effects seen in mice were not present in larger mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Jia |authorlink= |author2=Zhang, Gencheng |author3=Cai, Sally |author4= Redington, Andrew N  |date=January 2008 |title=Effect of inhaled hydrogen sulfide on metabolic responses in anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated piglets |journal=[[Pediatric Critical Care Medicine]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=110–112 |id= |url=http://www.pccmjournal.com/pt/re/pccm/abstract.00130478-200801000-00021.htm |accessdate= 2008-02-07 |quote=H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S does not appear to have hypometabolic effects in ambiently cooled large mammals and conversely appears to act as a hemodynamic and metabolic stimulant. |doi=10.1097/01.PCC.0000298639.08519.0C |pmid=18477923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise a paper by Haouzi et al. noted that there is no induction of hypometabolism in sheep, either.&lt;ref name="pmid17980679"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Haouzi P, Notet V, Chenuel B, Chalon B, Sponne I, Ogier V | title=H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S induced hypometabolism in mice is missing in sedated sheep | journal=Respir Physiol Neurobiol | year= 2008 | volume= 160 | issue= 1 | pages= 109–15 | pmid=17980679 | doi=10.1016/j.resp.2007.09.001  | displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the February 2010 [[TED (conference)|TED]] conference, [[Mark Roth (scientist)|Mark Roth]] announced that hydrogen sulfide induced hypothermia ''in humans'' had completed [[Clinical trial#Phases|Phase I]] clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/mark_roth_suspended_animation.html|title=Mark Roth: Suspended animation is within our grasp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical trials commissioned by the company he helped found, Ikaria, were however withdrawn or terminated by August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IK-1001 (Sodium Sulfide (Na2S) for Injection) in Subjects With Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01007461|publisher=[[ClinicalTrials.gov]]|date=2010-11-04|quote=This study has been withdrawn prior to enrollment.

== Sulfur dioxide ==

The role of sulfur dioxide in mammalian biology is not yet well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=D. |url=http://benthamscience.com/mrmc/contabs/mrmc10-11.html#4 |title=Sulfur dioxide: a novel gaseous signal in the regulation of cardiovascular functions |journal=Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue= 11|pages=1039–1045 |pmid=20540708 |last2=Jin |first2=H |last3=Tang |first3=C |last4=Du |first4=J |doi=10.2174/1389557511009011039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sulfur dioxide blocks nerve signals from the [[pulmonary stretch receptors]] and abolishes the [[Hering–Breuer reflex|Hering–Breuer inflation reflex]].

It was shown that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a role in diminishing an experimental [[lung]] damage caused by [[oleic acid]]. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an [[enzyme]] that produces endogenous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding [[acetylcysteine]] or [[glutathione]] to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen S, Zheng S, Liu Z, Tang C, Zhao B, Du J, Jin H |title=Endogenous sulfur dioxide protects against oleic acid-induced acute lung injury in association with inhibition of oxidative stress in rats.|journal=Lab. Invest.|date=Feb 2015|volume=95|issue=2|pages=142–156|doi=10.1038/labinvest.2014.147|pmid=25581610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered that endogenous sulfur dioxide plays a significant physiological role in regulating [[cardiac]] and [[blood vessel]] function, and aberrant or deficient sulfur dioxide metabolism can contribute to several different cardiovascular diseases, such as [[arterial hypertension]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], [[stenocardia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tian H.|title=Advances in the study on endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Chin Med J|date=Nov 2014|volume=127|issue=21|pages=3803–3807|pmid=25382339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was shown that in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to congenital heart diseases the level of [[homocysteine]] is higher and the level of endogenous sulfur dioxide is lower than in normal control children. Moreover, these biochemical parameters strongly correlated to the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Authors considered homocysteine to be one of useful biochemical markers of disease severity and sulfur dioxide metabolism to be one of potential therapeutic targets in those patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yang R, Yang Y, Dong X, Wu X, Wei Y |title=Correlation between endogenous sulfur dioxide and homocysteine in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease|language=chinese|journal=Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi|date=Aug 2014|volume=52|issue=8|pages=625–629|pmid=25224243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also has been shown to lower the [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] rate of endothelial [[smooth muscle]] cells in blood vessels, via lowering the [[MAPK]] activity and activating [[adenylyl cyclase]] and [[protein kinase A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu D, Huang Y, Bu D, Liu AD, Holmberg L, Jia Y, Tang C, Du J, Jin H |title=Sulfur dioxide inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via suppressing the Erk/MAP kinase pathway mediated by cAMP/PKA signaling.|journal=Cell Death Dis.|date=May 2014|volume=5|issue=5|pages=e1251|doi=10.1038/cddis.2014.229|pmid=24853429|pmc=4047873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth muscle cell proliferation is one of important mechanisms of hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels and their [[stenosis]], so it is an important pathogenetic mechanism in arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.

Endogenous sulfur dioxide in low concentrations causes endothelium-dependent [[vasodilation]]. In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent vasodilation and has a negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent [[calcium channel]]s and L-type ("dihydropyridine") calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent antiinflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang XB, Jin HF, Tang CS, Du JB |title=The biological effect of endogenous sulfur dioxide in the cardiovascular system.|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|date=16 Nov 2011|volume=670|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.08.031|pmid=21925165|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous sulfur dioxide also diminishes myocardial damage, caused by [[isoproterenol]] [[adrenergic]] hyperstimulation, and strengthens the myocardial antioxidant defense reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liang Y, Liu D, Ochs T, Tang C, Chen S, Zhang S, Geng B, Jin H, Du J |title=Endogenous sulfur dioxide protects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury and increases myocardial antioxidant capacity in rats.|journal=Lab. Invest.|date=Jan 2011|volume=91|issue=1|pages=12–23|doi=10.1038/labinvest.2010.156|pmid=20733562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfur dioxide expelled from the gastrointestinal tract (through the process of flatulence) is thought to be one of the main constituents to the unpleasant smell colloquially referred to as a "fart".

== Hydrogen cyanide ==

Some authors have shown that [[neuron]]s can produce [[hydrogen cyanide]] upon activation of their [[opioid]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] by endogenous or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that neuronal production of HCN activates [[NMDA receptor]]s and plays a role in [[signal transduction]] between neuronal cells ([[neurotransmission]]). Moreover, increased endogenous neuronal HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid [[analgesia]], as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered endogenous HCN to be a neuromodulator.&lt;ref name="pmid9369328"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Borowitz JL, Gunasekar PG, Isom GE |title=Hydrogen cyanide generation by mu-opiate receptor activation: possible neuromodulatory role of endogenous cyanide|journal=Brain Res.|date=12 Sep 1997|volume=768|issue=1–2|pages=294–300|pmid=9369328|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(97)00659-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also shown that, while stimulating [[muscarinic]] [[cholinergic]] receptors in cultured [[pheochromocytoma]] cells ''increases'' HCN production, in a living organism (''in vivo'') muscarinic cholinergic stimulation actually ''decreases'' HCN production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gunasekar PG, Prabhakaran K, Li L, Zhang L, Isom GE, Borowitz JL |title=Receptor mechanisms mediating cyanide generation in PC12 cells and rat brain.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010204000094|journal=Neurosci Res.|date=May 2004|volume=49|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.1016/j.neures.2004.01.006|pmid=15099699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leukocyte]]s generate HCN during [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid9369328" /&gt;

The [[vasodilatation]], caused by [[sodium nitroprusside]], has been shown to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to [[nitroglycerine]] and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith RP, Kruszyna H |title=Toxicology of some inorganic antihypertensive anions.|journal=Fed Proc.|date=Jan 1976|volume=35|issue=1|pages=69–72|pmid=1245233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ammonia ==

Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=10323059 |title=PubChem Substance Summary|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]], as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zschocke, Johannes |author2=Georg Hoffman|title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Friedrichsdorf, Germany: Milupa GmbH|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]], which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rose, Burton |author2=Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1994|isbn=978-0-683-07354-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methane ==

Some authors have shown that endogenous [[methane]] is produced not only by the [[intestinal flora]] and then absorbed into the [[blood]], but also is produced - in small amounts - by [[eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the endogenous methane production rises during an experimental [[mitochondria]]l [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], for example, [[sodium azide]] intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of intercellular signals of hypoxia and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eszter Tuboly |author2=Andrea Szabó |author3=Dénes Garab |author4=Gábor Bartha |author5=Ágnes Janovszky |author6=Gábor Ero″s |author7=Anna Szabó |author8=Árpád Mohácsi |author9=Gábor Szabó |author10=József Kaszaki |author11=Miklós Ghyczy |author12=Mihály Boros |title=Methane biogenesis during sodium azide-induced chemical hypoxia in rats|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Other authors have shown that cellular methane production also rises during [[sepsis]] or [[bacteria]]l [[endotoxemia]], including an experimental imitation of endotoxemia by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tuboly E, Szabó A, Erős G, Mohácsi A, Szabó G, Tengölics R, Rákhely G, Boros M |title=Determination of endogenous methane formation by photoacoustic spectroscopy.|journal=J Breath Res.|date=Dec 2013|volume=7|issue=4|doi=10.1088/1752-7155/7/4/046004|pmid=24185326|pages=046004|bibcode = 2013JBR.....7d6004T |url=http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/4032/1/Tuboly_JBR_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other researchers have shown that methane, produced by the intestinal flora, is not fully "biologically neutral" to the intestine, and it participates in the normal physiologic regulation of [[peristalsis]]. And its excess causes not only belching, flatulence and belly pain, but also functional constipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sahakian AB, Jee SR, Pimentel M |title=Methane and the gastrointestinal tract.|journal=Dig Dis Sci|date=Aug 2010|volume=55|issue=8|pages=2135–2143|doi=10.1007/s10620-009-1012-0|pmid=19830557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethylene ==

[[File:Ethylene Signal Transduction.svg|thumb|An ethylene signal transduction pathway. Ethylene permeates the membrane and binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum.  The receptor releases the repressed EIN2.  This then activates a signal transduction pathway which activates a regulatory genes that eventually trigger an Ethylene response. The activated DNA is transcribed into mRNA which is then translated into a functional enzyme that is used for ethylene biosynthesis.]]
Ethylene serves as a [[plant hormone|hormone]] in [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lin, Z. |author2=Zhong, S. |author3=Grierson, D. |title=Recent advances in ethylene research |journal=J.

Commercial ripening rooms use "catalytic generators" to make ethylene gas from a liquid supply of ethanol. Typically, a gassing level of 500 to 2,000 ppm is used, for 24 to 48 hours. Care must be taken to control carbon dioxide levels in ripening rooms when gassing, as high temperature ripening ({{convert|20|C|F|disp=x|; }}){{citation needed|date=February 2014}} has been seen to produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels of 10% in 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ne-postharvest.com/ripening.htm#controlledatmosphereripening External Link to More on Ethylene Gassing and Carbon Dioxide Control]. ne-postharvest.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene has been used since the ancient Egyptians, who would gash figs in order to stimulate ripening (wounding stimulates ethylene production by plant tissues). The ancient Chinese would burn [[incense]] in closed rooms to enhance the ripening of pears. In 1864, it was discovered that gas leaks from street lights led to stunting of growth, twisting of plants, and abnormal thickening of stems.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow showed that the active component was ethylene.&lt;ref name="Neljobov_1901"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neljubov D. | title = Uber die horizontale Nutation der Stengel von Pisum sativum und einiger anderen Pflanzen | journal = Beih Bot Zentralbl | volume = 10 | pages = 128–139 | year = 1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Doubt discovered that ethylene stimulated [[abscission]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="Doubt_1917"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Doubt, Sarah L.| title = The Response of Plants to Illuminating Gas | journal = Botanical Gazette | jstor= 2469142 | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 209–224 | year = 1917  | doi = 10.1086/332006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until 1934 that Gane reported that plants synthesize ethylene.&lt;ref name="Gane_1934"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gane R. | title = Production of ethylene by some fruits | journal = Nature| volume = 134| issue = 3400| pages = 1008| year = 1934  | doi = 10.1038/1341008a0 | bibcode = 1934Natur.134.1008G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Crocker proposed that ethylene was the plant hormone responsible for fruit ripening as well as [[senescence]] of vegetative tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker W, Hitchcock AE, Zimmerman PW.

[[File:Yang-cycle.png|thumb|left|The Yang cycle]]
Ethylene is produced from essentially all parts of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, tubers, and seeds.
Ethylene production is regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental factors. During the life of the plant, ethylene production is induced during certain stages of growth such as [[germination]], [[ripening]] of fruits, [[abscission]] of leaves, and [[senescence]] of flowers. Ethylene production can also be induced by a variety of external aspects such as mechanical wounding, environmental stresses, and certain chemicals including auxin and other regulators.&lt;ref name=Yang_1984&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang, S. F. |author2=Hoffman N. E. | title = Ethylene biosynthesis and its regulation in higher plants | journal = Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. | volume = 35 | pages = 155–89 | year = 1984 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pp.35.060184.001103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from the amino acid [[methionine]] to [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-methionine]] (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met Adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] (ACC) by the enzyme [[1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase|ACC synthase]] (ACS). The activity of ACS determines the rate of ethylene production, therefore regulation of this [[enzyme]] is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves the action of the enzyme [[Aminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase|ACC-oxidase]] (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of [[auxin]]s, especially [[indole acetic acid]] (IAA) and [[cytokinin]]s.

Ethylene is perceived by a family of five transmembrane [[protein dimer]]s such as the ETR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; protein in ''Arabidopsis''. The [[gene]] [[encoding]] an ethylene receptor{{which|date=September 2013}} has been cloned in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and then in [[tomato]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in the ''Arabidopsis'' and [[tomato]] [[genome]]s. Mutations in any of the [[gene family]], which comprises five receptors in ''Arabidopsis'' and at least six in tomato, can lead to insensitivity to ethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and pathogen attack can induce ethylene formation in plants. In flooding, roots suffer from lack of oxygen, or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]], which leads to the synthesis of [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes [[nastic movements]] (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planthormones.info/epinasty.htm Explaining Epinasty]. planthormones.inf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene in plant induces such responses:
* Seedling triple response, thickening and shortening of [[hypocotyl]] with pronounced apical hook.
* In [[pollination]], when the pollen reaches the stigma, the precursor of the ethene, [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|ACC]], is secreted to the petal, the ACC releases ethylene with ACC oxidase.
* Stimulates leaf and flower [[senescence]]
* Stimulates senescence of mature [[xylem]] cells in preparation for plant use
* Induces leaf [[abscission]]
* Induces seed [[germination]]
* Induces [[root hair]] growth — increasing the efficiency of water and mineral absorption
* Induces the growth of [[adventitious root]]s during flooding
* Stimulates epinasty — leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] grows out, leaf hangs down and curls into itself
* Stimulates [[fruit ripening]]
* Induces a [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] rise in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] in some fruit which causes a release of additional ethylene.
* Affects [[gravitropism]]
* Stimulates nutational bending

Small amounts of endogenous ethylene are also produced in [[mammals]], including [[human]]s, due to lipid peroxidation. Some of endogenous ethylene is then oxidized to [[ethylene oxide]], which is able to [[alkylation|alkylate]] [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s, including [[hemoglobin]] (forming a specific adduct with its N-terminal [[valine]], N-hydroxyethyl-valine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Filser JG, Denk B, Törnqvist M, Kessler W, Ehrenberg L|title=Pharmacokinetics of ethylene in man; body burden with ethylene oxide and hydroxyethylation of hemoglobin due to endogenous and environmental ethylene.|journal=Arch Toxicol.|date=1992|volume=66|issue=3|pages=157–163|pmid=1303633|doi=10.1007/bf01974008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Endogenous ethylene oxide, just as like environmental (exogenous) one, can alkylate [[guanine]] in DNA, forming an adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine, and this poses an intrinsic carcinogenic risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Bolt HM, Leutbecher M, Golka K|title=A note on the physiological background of the ethylene oxide adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine in DNA from human blood.|journal=Arch Toxicol.|date=1997|volume=71|issue=11|pages=719–721|pmid=9363847|doi=10.1007/s002040050451}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also mutagenic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Csanády GA, Denk B, Pütz C, Kreuzer PE, Kessler W, Baur C, Gargas ML, Filser JG|title=A physiological toxicokinetic model for exogenous and endogenous ethylene and ethylene oxide in rat, mouse, and human: formation of 2-hydroxyethyl adducts with hemoglobin and DNA.|journal=Toxicol Appl Pharmacol|date=May 15, 2000|volume=165|issue=1|pages=1–26|pmid=10814549|doi=10.1006/taap.2000.8918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Thier R, Bolt HM|title=Carcinogenicity and genotoxicity of ethylene oxide: new aspects and recent advances.|journal=Crit Rev Toxicol.|date=Sep 2000|volume=30|issue=5|pages=595–608|pmid=11055837|doi=10.1080/10408440008951121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[gene]] is said to be polymorphic if more than one [[allele]] occupies that gene’s [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] within a population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Genetic_polymorphism&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having more than one allele at a specific locus, each allele must also occur in the population at a rate of at least 1% to generally be considered polymorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10002399/|title=Genetic Testing Report-Glossary|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene polymorphisms can occur in any region of the genome. The majority of polymorphisms are silent, meaning they do not alter the function or expression of a gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/pages/about/od/opg/multi-ic_symposia/may2007/techissues.pdf|title=Technologic Issues in GWAS and Follow-up Studies|last=Chanock|first=Stephen|date=2017-05-22|website=Genome.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polymorphism is visible. For example, in dogs the E locus, can have any of five different alleles, known as E, E&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;, E&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;, and e.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/masks.html&lt;/ref&gt; Varying combinations of these alleles contribute to the pigmentation and patterns seen in dog coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animalgenetics.us/Canine/Canine-color/ELocus.asp|title=E-Locus (Recessive Yellow, Melanistic Mask Allele)|website=www.animalgenetics.us|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A polymorphic variant of a gene can lead to the abnormal expression or to the production of an abnormal form of the protein; this abnormality may cause or be associated with disease.  For example, a polymorphic variant of the enzyme [[CYP4A11]] in which [[thymidine]] replaces [[cytosine]] at the gene's nucleotide 8590 position encodes a CYP4A11 protein that substitutes phenylalanine with serine at the protein's amino acid position 434.&lt;ref name="pmid23584425" /&gt;  This variant protein has reduced enzyme activity in metabolizing [[arachidonic acid]] to the blood pressure-regulating [[eicosanoid]], [[20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]. A study has shown that humans bearing this variant in one or both of their CYP4A11 genes have an increased incidence of [[hypertension]], ischemic [[stroke]], and [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref name="pmid23584425"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu CC, Gupta T, Garcia V, Ding Y, Schwartzman ML | title = 20-HETE and blood pressure regulation: clinical implications | journal = Cardiology in Review | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | year = 2014 | pmid = 23584425 | pmc = 4292790 | doi = 10.1097/CRD.0b013e3182961659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably, the genes coding for the [[Major histocompatibility complex|Major Histocompatibility Complex]] ([[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]]) are in fact the most polymorphic genes known. MHC molecules are involved in the immune system and interact with [[T cell|T-cells]]. There are more than 800 different [[alleles]] of human [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] class I and II genes, and it has been estimated that there are 200 variants at the HLA-B HLA-DRB1 loci alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodmer|first=J.

Some polymorphism may be maintained by [[balancing selection]].

== Differences between gene polymorphism and mutation ==
A rule of thumb that is sometimes used is to classify genetic variants that occur below 1% allele frequency as [[mutation|mutations]] rather than polymorphisms&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thebalance.com/genetic-polymorphism-what-is-it-375594&lt;/ref&gt;. However, since polymorphisms may occur at low allele frequency, this is not a reliable way to tell new mutations from polymorphisms  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karki|first=Roshan|last2=Pandya|first2=Deep|last3=Elston|first3=Robert C.|last4=Ferlini|first4=Cristiano|date=2015-07-15|title=Defining "mutation" and "polymorphism" in the era of personal genomics|journal=BMC Medical Genomics|volume=8|doi=10.1186/s12920-015-0115-z|issn=1755-8794|pmc=4502642|pmid=26173390}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Identification ==

Polymorphisms can be identified in the laboratory using a variety of methods. Many methods employ [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] to amplify the sequence of a gene. Once amplified, polymorphisms and mutations in the sequence can be detected by [[DNA sequencing]], either directly or after screening for variation with a method such as [[Single-strand conformation polymorphism|single strand conformation polymorphism analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6475/|title=Genetics, Mutations, and Polymorphisms|last=Bull|first=Laura|date=2013|publisher=Landes Bioscience|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

A polymorphism can be any sequence difference. Examples include:

* [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]] are a single nucleotide changes that happen in the genome in a particular location. The single nucleotide polymorphism is the most common form of genetic variation.&lt;ref&gt;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/snp&lt;/ref&gt;
  
* [[Indel|Small-scale insertions/deletions (Indels)]] consist of insertions or deletions of bases in DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid21460062"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mills RE, Pittard WS, Mullaney JM, Farooq U, Creasy TH, Mahurkar AA, Kemeza DM, Strassler DS, Ponting CP, Webber C, Devine SE | title = Natural genetic variation caused by small insertions and deletions in the human genome | journal = Genome Research | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 830–9 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21460062 | pmc = 3106316 | doi = 10.1101/gr.115907.110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Polymorphic repetitive elements. Active [[Transposable element|transposable elements]] can also cause polymorphism by inserting themselves in new locations. For example, repetitive elements of the [[Alu element|Alu]] and [[LINE1]] families cause polymorphisms in human genome.&lt;ref name="pmid20858594"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullaney JM, Mills RE, Pittard WS, Devine SE | title = Small insertions and deletions (INDELs) in human genomes | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = R2 | pages = R131–6 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20858594 | pmc = 2953750 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddq400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Microsatellite|Microsatellites]] are repeats of 1-6 base pairs of DNA sequence. Microsatellites are commonly used as a molecular markers especially for identifying the relationship between alleles&lt;ref&gt;http://www.majordifferences.com/2013/11/difference-minisatellite-and.html#.WMDEohiZMb0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical significance ==

=== Lung cancer ===

Polymorphisms have been discovered in multiple XPD exons. XPD refers to ‘’’xeroderma pigmentosum group D’’’ and is involved in a DNA repair mechanism used during DNA replication. XPD works by cutting and removing segments of DNA that have been damaged due to things such as cigarette smoking and inhalation of other environmental carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hou|first=S.-M.|date=2002-04-01|title=The XPD variant alleles are associated with increased aromatic DNA adduct level and lung cancer risk|url=https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/23/4/599/2608203|journal=Carcinogenesis|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=599–603|doi=10.1093/carcin/23.4.599|issn=0143-3334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln are the two common polymorphisms of XPD that result in a change in a single amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=Qin|last2=Zhang|first2=Chi|last3=Yang|first3=Xi|last4=Zhu|first4=Hongcheng|last5=Yang|first5=Baixia|last6=Cai|first6=Jing|last7=Cheng|first7=Hongyan|last8=Ma|first8=Jianxin|last9=Lu|first9=Jing|date=2013-11-15|title=Polymorphisms in XPD Gene Could Predict Clinical Outcome of Platinum-Based Chemotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A Meta-Analysis of 24 Studies|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079864|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e79864|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0079864|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variation in Asn and Gln alleles is has been related to individuals having a reduced DNA repair efficiency.&lt;ref name="pmid156159082"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=ERCC2 /XPD gene polymorphisms and lung cancer: a HuGE review|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=161|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1093/aje/kwi018|pmid=15615908|vauthors=Benhamou S, Sarasin A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have been conducted to see if this diminished capacity to repair DNA is related to an increased risk of lung cancer. These studies examined the XPD gene in lung cancer patients of varying age, gender, race, and [[pack-year]]s.

=== Asthma ===

Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the lungs and more than 100 loci have been identified as contributing to the development and severity of the condition.&lt;ref name="pmid236375492"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Genetic polymorphisms and associated susceptibility to asthma|journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=6|issue=|pages=253–65|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S28156|pmc=3636804|pmid=23637549|vauthors=March ME, Sleiman PM, Hakonarson H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using the traditional linkage analysis, these asthma correlated genes were able to be identified in small quantities using [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS). There have been a number of studies looking into various polymorphisms of asthma-associated genes and how those polymorphisms interact with the carrier's environment.

The '''Hemispherical Resonator Gyroscope''' (HRG), also called ''wine-glass gyroscope'' or ''mushroom gyro'', is a compact, low noise, high performance angular rate or rotation sensor.  An HRG is made using a thin solid-state hemispherical shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused-quartz structures that surround the shell. The gyroscopic effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural standing waves. An HRG has no moving parts, is very compact, is extremely reliable and very accurate.

== Operation ==

The HRG makes use of a small thin solid-state hemispherical shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by dedicated electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate [[fused quartz]] structures that surround the shell.

For a single-piece design (i.e., the hemispherical shell and stem form a monolithic part&lt;ref&gt;https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/resonator-hemispherical-resonator-gyro&lt;/ref&gt;) made from high-purity [[fused quartz]], it is possible to reach a [[Q-factor]] of over 30-50 million in vacuum, thus the corresponding random walks are extremely low. The [[Q-factor]] is limited by the coating (extremely thin film of gold or platinum) and by fixture losses.&lt;ref&gt;Sarapuloff S.A., Rhee H.-N., and Park S.-J. Avoidance of Internal Resonances in Hemispherical Resonator Assembly from Fused Quartz Connected by Indium Solder //Proceedings of the 23rd KSNVE (Korean Society for Noise &amp; Vibration Engineering) Annual Spring Conference. Yeosu-city, 24–26 April 2013. – P.835-841.&lt;/ref&gt; Such resonators have to be fine-tuned by ion-beam micro-erosion of the glass or by laser ablation in order to be perfectly dynamically balanced. When coated, tuned and assembled within the housing, the [[Q-factor]] remains over 10 million.

In application to the HRG shell, Coriolis forces cause a [[precession]] of vibration patterns around the [[axis of rotation]]. It causes a slow precession of a [[standing wave]] around this axis, with an angular rate that differs from input one. This is the wave inertia effect, discovered in 1890 by British scientist [[George Hartley Bryan]] (1864–1928).&lt;ref&gt;Bryan G.H. On the Beats in the Vibrations of a Revolving Cylinder or Bell //Proc. of Cambridge Phil. Soc. 1890, Nov. 24. Vol.VII. Pt.III. - P.101-111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, when subject to rotation around the shell symmetry axis, the standing wave does not rotate exactly with the shell, but the difference between both rotations is nevertheless perfectly proportional to the input rotation. The device is then able to sense rotation.

The electronics which sense the standing waves are also able to drive them. Therefore, the gyros can operate in either a “whole angle mode” that sense the standing waves' position or a “force rebalance mode” that holds the standing wave in a fixed orientation with respect to the gyro.

Originally used in space applications (Attitude and Orbit Control Systems for spacecrafts)&lt;ref&gt;https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/housing-hemispherical-resonator-gyroscope-hrg&lt;/ref&gt;, HRG is now used in advanced [[Inertial navigation system]], in Attitude and Heading Reference System and [[HRG gyrocompass|gyrocompass]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicnow.com/view/601813DEDD48CD206D9593E2722478364FBC1BB7?2017-05-03-12:01:11+01:00-xxx5199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

The HRG is extremely reliable because of its extremely simple hardware. It has no moving parts; its core is made of a monolithic part which includes the hemispherical shell and its stem.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/HRG/Documents/hrg.pdf The Hemispherical Resonator Gyro: From Wineglass to the Planets, David M. Rozelle]&lt;/ref&gt; They demonstrated outstanding reliability since their initial use in 1996 on the [[NEAR_Shoemaker]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/HRG/ Hemispherical Resonator Gyro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.azosensors.com/news.aspx?newsID=9185&lt;/ref&gt;

The HRG is extremely accurate&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/HRG/Documents/hrg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8358163/&lt;/ref&gt; and is not sensitive to external environmental perturbations. The resonating shell weighs only a few grams and it is perfectly balanced which makes it insensitive to vibrations, accelerations and shocks.

The HRG exhibits superior SWAP (Size, Weight &amp; Power) characteristics compared to other gyroscope technologies.

The HRG generates neither acoustic nor radiated noise because the resonating shell is perfectly balanced and operates under vacuum.

The material of the resonator, the [[fused quartz]], is naturally radiation hard in any space environment. This confers intrinsic immunity to deleterious space radiation effects to the HRG resonator.   

Thanks to the extremely high Q-factor of the resonating shell, the HRG has an extremely low angular random walk and extremely low power dissipation.

The HRG, unlike optical gyros ([[Fibre optic gyroscope|FOG]] and [[Ring laser gyroscope|RLG]]), has inertial memory: if the power is lost for a short period of time (typically few seconds), the sentitive element integrates the input motion (angular rate) so that when the power returns, the HRG signals the angle turned in the interval of power loss.

== Disadvantages ==

The HRG is a very high-tech device which requires sophisticated manufacturing tools. The control electronics required to sense and drive the standing waves, is somewhat sophisticated. This high level of sophistication strongly limits the dissemination of this technology and only few companies were able to develop it. Up to now, only two companies are manufacturing HRG in series: Northrop Grumman Corporation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/HRG/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and Safran&lt;ref&gt;https://www.safran-electronics-defense.com/hrg-crystal&lt;/ref&gt;.

Classical HRG is relatively expensive due to the cost of the precision ground and polished hollow quartz hemispheres. Costs are dramatically reduced due to design changes and engineering controls. Rather than depositing electrodes on an internal hemisphere that must perfectly match the shape of the outer resonating hemisphere, electrodes are deposited on a flat plate that matches the equatorial plan of the resonating hemisphere.

[[File:Penn Station2.jpg|thumb|[[Demolition]] of the former [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Penn Station]] concourse raised public awareness about preservation]]
&lt;!--the term historic preservation is seemingly almost exclusively found in United States English; other terms are used in other English speaking cultures, though certain non-English phrases may directly transliterate as "Historic Preservation"; as a result of the ambiguous usage of the term, this was chosen as the primary article; other potential meanings are referenced in the hatnote; see discussion pages for details.--&gt;

'''Historic preservation''' (US), '''heritage preservation''' or '''heritage conservation''' (UK), is an endeavour that seeks to preserve, conserve and protect buildings, objects, landscapes or other artifacts of historical significance.
This term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===England===
In [[England]], [[Antiquary|antiquarian]] interests were a familiar gentleman's pursuit since the mid 17th century, developing in tandem with the rise in scientific curiosity. Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] were often also Fellows of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

[[File:Castle Berkhamsted cz.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of Berkhamsted from the Norman Castle's Motte|The ruins of Berkhamsted castle (viewed from its Norman motte) and Berkhamsted Common were the location of two successful early preservation events in the nineteenth century. (Enlarged: A train passes Berkhamsted castle, on an embankment that was once part of the castle's outer defences.)]]Many historic sites were damaged as the railways began to spread across the UK; including [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity Hospital]] and its church in Edinburgh, [[Furness Abbey]], [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]] and [[Northampton Castle]], and the ancient walls of York, Chester and Newcastle. In 1833 [[Berkhamsted Castle]] became the first historic site in England officially protected by statute under the London and Birmingham Railway Acts of 1833{{ndash}}1837, though the new railway line in 1834 did demolish the castle's gatehouse and outer earthworks to the south.&lt;ref name="Wheeler1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wheeler|title=Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-cloud of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNxRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4377-2|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early preservation event also occurred at [[Berkhamsted]]. In 1866, Lord Brownlow who lived at [[Ashridge]], tried to enclose the adjoining Berkhamsted Common with {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=on}} steel fences in an attempt to claim it as part of his estate. In England from early Anglo-Saxon times, [[Common land]] was an area of land which the local community could use as a resource. Across England between 1660 and 1845, 7 million acres of Common land had been [[enclosure|enclosed]] by private land owners by application to parliament. On the night of 6 March 1866, [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus Smith]] MP led gangs of local folk and hired men from London's East End in [[direct action]] to break the enclosure fences and protect Berkhamsted Common for the people of Berkhamsted in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.&lt;ref name=Cobb1893p26&gt;{{harvnb|Cobb|1883|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood2006p245&gt;{{harvnb|Sherwood|2008|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birtchnell1988psNone&gt;{{harvnb|Birtchnell|1988|ps=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]] (later co-founder of the [[National Trust]] in 1895) and the [[Commons Preservation Society]] succeed in legal action that ensured protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.&lt;ref name="commons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Shaw-Lefevre on the Preservation of Commons|newspaper=The Times|date=11 December 1886|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashbrook |first=Kate |url=http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kate-Ashbrook.pdf|title=Modern commons: a protected open space?|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/news/more-news/exhibition-and-commemorative-walk-marks-anniversary-of-battle-to-save-berkhamsted-common-1-7006636 | title=Exhibition and commemorative walk marks anniversary of battle to save Berkhamsted Common | publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd. | work=Hemel Gazette | date=12 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Lubbock72.jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|[[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], MP was a moving force behind the implementation of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882.]]By the mid 19th century, much of [[UK|Britain's]] unprotected cultural heritage was being slowly destroyed. Even well-meaning archaeologists like [[William Greenwell]] excavated sites with virtually no attempt at their preservation, [[Stonehenge]] came under increasing threat by the 1870s. Tourists were chipping off parts of the stones or carving their initials into the rock. The private owners of the monument decided to sell the land to the [[London and South-Western Railway]] as the monument was "not the slightest use to anyone now"{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], an MP and botanist emerged as the champion of the country's national heritage. In 1872 he personally bought private land that housed ancient monuments in [[Avebury]], [[Silbury Hill]] and elsewhere, from the owners who were threatening to have them cleared away to make room for housing. Soon, he began campaigning in Parliament for legislation to protect monuments from destruction. This finally led to the legislative milestone under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[William Gladstone]] of the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]]. The first government appointed inspector for this job was the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt-Rivers]]. This legislation was regarded by conservative political elements as a grave assault on the individual rights of property of the owner, and consequently, the inspector only had the power to identify endangered landmarks and offer to purchase them from the owner with his consent. The Act only covered ancient monuments and explicitly did not cover historic buildings or structures. In 1877 the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] was founded by the [[Arts and Crafts]] designer [[William Morris]] to prevent the destruction of historic buildings, followed by the [[National Trust]] in 1895 that bought estates from their owners for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Bill. "At Home: A Short History of Private Life" Transworld Publishers, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had only given legal protection to prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] took this further by empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. Further updates were made in [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910|1910]].

[[File:Tattershall Castle, 2006.jpg|left|200px|upright|thumbnail|[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], preserved at personal expense by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] and a catalyst for [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913|broader heritage protection laws]].]]
[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], [[Lincolnshire]], a medieval [[manor house]] had been put up for sale in 1910 with its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, still intact. However, when an American bought the house they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. The former viceroy of [[India]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]], was outraged at this cultural destruction and stepped in to buy back the castle and reinstall the fireplaces. After a nationwide hunt for them they were finally found in London and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468|title=The man who demolished Shakespeare's house|publisher=BBC News Magazine|author=Denise Winterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle&lt;ref name=Adrian&gt;{{cite book|title=English Castles: A Guide by Counties|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|author=Adrian Pettifer|pages=145–7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] on his death in 1925. His experience at Tattershall influenced Lord Curzon to push for tougher heritage protection laws in Britain, which saw passage as the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].

The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term "monument" was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Trust====
{{one source section|date=October 2017}}
The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] was founded in 1894 by [[Octavia Hill]], [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]], and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Hardwicke Canon Rawnsley]] as the first organisation of its type in the world. Its formal purpose is: &lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and [[Tenement (law)|tenements]] (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest and, as regards lands, for the preservation of their natural aspect, features and animal and plant life. Also the preservation of furniture, pictures and chattels of any description having national and historic or artistic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/documents/download-national-trust-acts-1907-1971-post-order-2005.pdf | title=The National Trust Acts  1907 - 1971, as varied by a Parliamentary Scheme implemented by  The Charities (National Trust) Order 2005 | publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] | accessdate=10 November 2017 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings; its first property was [[Alfriston Clergy House]] and its first [[nature reserve]] was [[Wicken Fen]]. Its first archaeological monument was [[White Barrow]]. The focus on [[English country house|country houses]] and gardens, which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties, came about in the mid 20th century, when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them.

The Town and Country Planning Act 1944 and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] took steps toward historic preservation on an unprecedented scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Concern about the demolition of historic buildings arose in institutions such as the pressure group [[the Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings]], which appealed against demolition and neglect on a case by case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sphb.org.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104238/http://www.sphb.org.uk/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-21 |title=The Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings (SPHB)|publisher=sphb.org.uk|accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Heritage====
[[English Heritage]] formed in 1983, is a registered charity that looks after the National Heritage Collection in England.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Era for English Heritage|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/new-era-for-englands-heritage1|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprises over 400 of England's historic buildings, monuments and sites spanning more than 5,000 years of history. Within its portfolio are [[Stonehenge]], [[Dover Castle]], [[Tintagel Castle]] and the best preserved parts of [[Hadrian's Wall]].

Originally English Heritage was the operating name of an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]], officially titled the [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]], that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties.&lt;ref name="EH History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-history/|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999 the organisation merged with the [[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]] and the National Monuments Record (England), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England's historic environment. On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: [[Historic England]], which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new [[English Heritage Trust]], a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph EHT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|title=Does our history have a future in the hands of the English Heritage Trust?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11441254/Does-our-history-have-a-future-in-the-hands-of-the-English-Heritage-Trust.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government gave the new charity an £80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state.

[[File:MountVernonrear.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Mount Vernon]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]], near [[Alexandria, Virginia]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the United States one of the first historic preservation efforts was the
[[Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site]], in [[Newburgh, New York]]. This property has the distinction of being the first-ever property designated and operated as a historic site by a U.S. state, having been so since 1850.

Another early historic preservation undertaking was that of George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Diane. "America's Preservation Ethos: A Tribute to Enduring Ideals." ''A Richer Heritage: Historic Preservation in the Twenty-First Century.'' ed. Robert Stipe. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1889, the Richmond, Virginia-based [[Preservation Virginia]] (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Helium Studio |url=http://apva.org/aboutus/ |title=Preservation Virginia |publisher=Apva.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008020715/http://www.apva.org/AboutUs/ |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, James Michael. ''Preserving the Old Dominion: historic preservation and Virginia traditionalism''. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1993. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society]] was formed in 1895 as the first American organization of its kind in the United States that did not limit its activities to a single historic place or object. The Society operated as a national organization to: protect the natural scenery and the preservation of historic landmarks; to preserve landmarks and records of the past or present; to erect memorials and promote appreciation of the scenic beauty of America.&lt;ref&gt;"Scenic and Historic America: Bulletin of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society." ASHPS 2.1 (March 1930):3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles E. Peterson]] was an influential figure in the mid-20th century establishing the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS), advising on the establishment of [[Independence National Historical Park]], helping with the first graduate degree program in historic preservation in the United States at [[Columbia University]], and author.

The architectural firm of Simons &amp; Lapham (Albert Simons and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]) was an influential supporter of the nation's first historic preservation ordinance in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1930, affording that city a regulatory means by which to prevent the destruction of its historic building stock. In 1925, efforts to preserve the historic buildings of the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]] led to the creation of the Vieux Carré Commission and later, to the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins, ''Documentation of the Architecture of the Architecture of Samuel Lapham and the Firm of Simons &amp; Lapham'', Masters of Fine Arts in Historic Preservation Thesis, Savannah College of Art &amp; Design, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Scott S. (2010). Madame Vieux Carré: the French Quarter in the Twentieth Century. University of Mississippi. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1601 14th Street NW montage.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The preservation of this historic building in Washington, D.C. resulted in an award for Excellence in Historic Preservation by the local government.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dgs.dc.gov/release/dgs-mayor-gray-announces-winners-historic-preservation-awards |title=Mayor Gray Announces Winners of Historic Preservation Awards |publisher=Government of the District of Columbia |accessdate=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The US [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], another privately funded [[non-profit organization]], began in 1949 with a handful of structures and has developed goals that provide "leadership, education, advocacy, and resources to save America's diverse historic places and revitalize our communities" according to the Trust's mission statement.  In 1951 the Trust assumed responsibility for its first museum property, [[Woodlawn Plantation]] in [[northern Virginia]]. Twenty-eight sites in all have subsequently become part of the National Trust, representing the [[cultural diversity]] of American history.  In New York City, the destruction of [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in 1964 shocked many nationwide into supporting preservation. The 1960s proved advantageous with new laws and international agreements extending preservation "from ancient monuments to whole districts and buildings a few decades old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an international level, the New York-based [[World Monuments Fund]] was founded in 1965 to preserve historic sites all over the world.

Under the direction of [[James Marston Fitch]], the first advanced-degree historic preservation program began at [[Columbia University]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Murtagh, William J. ''Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in America''. New York: Sterling Publishing, Co., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It became the model on which most other graduate historic preservation programs were created.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomlan. "Historic Preservation Education: Alongside Architecture in Academia." ''Journal of Architectural Education'', Vol. 47, No. 4. (1994): 187-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other programs were to follow before 1980: M.A. in Preservation Planning from Cornell (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation from [[University of Vermont|the University of Vermont]] (1975); M.S. in Historic Preservation Studies from [[Boston University]] (1976); M.S. in Historic Preservation from [[Eastern Michigan University]] (1979) and M.F.A. in Historic Preservation was one of the original programs at [[Savannah College of Art &amp; Design]]. James Marston Fitch also offered guidance and support towards the founding of the Master of Preservation Studies Degree within the Tulane School of Architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.tulane.edu|title=Tulane School of Architecture -|website=architecture.tulane.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architecture.tulane.edu/programs/degrees/mps-master-preservation-studies|title=Master of Preservation Studies|website=Tulane School of Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M.Sc. in Building Conservation degree program is offered by the School of Architecture at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in Troy, New York. In 2005, Clemson University and the College of Charleston created an M.S. degree program based in Charleston, SC. The first undergraduate programs (B.A.) appeared in 1977 from [[Goucher College]] and [[Roger Williams University]] (then called Roger Williams College), followed by [[Mary Washington College]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;''Preservation News'' (Oct 1, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013}} there were more than fifty historic preservation programs offering certificates, associate, bachelor's, and master's degrees in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpe.us/academic-programs/#.UqsZqvSry-M|title=Home Page|date=13 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Heritage conservation in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the phrase "heritage preservation" is sometimes seen as a specific approach to the treatment of historic places and sites, rather than a general concept of conservation. "Conservation" is taken as the more general term, referring to all actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life.

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|central government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organisation for heritage buildings and landscapes.

=== The Netherlands ===
[[Victor de Stuers]] is widely considered the man who started historic preservation in the Netherlands. In 1875 the first national department for conservation was established&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/stuersv|title=Dictionary of Art Historians|website=arthistorians.info|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and de Stuers was  appointed as the first legal secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs as chief of the brand new Department of Arts and Sciences. He was the driving force behind ''[[Monumentenzorg]]'' (Foundation for Historic Preservation), helped found the ''[[Rijksmuseum]]'' (National Museum) and the ''Rijksarchief'' (National Archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerkindenhaag.nl/agendaberichten/victor-de-stuers-vader-van-monumentenzorg-en-rijksmuseum/|title=Victor de Stuers, vader van Monumentenzorg en Rijksmuseum - Kerk in Den Haag|website=www.kerkindenhaag.nl|language=nl|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/stuers|title=Stuers, jhr.

However, it was not until the 20th century that there was national legislation on historic preservation. In 1961 the [[:nl:Monumentenwet|''Monumentenwet'']] (“Monuments Act”) was passed. It defined that any physical building or space that was at least fifty years old and “which are of general interest because of their beauty, their meaning to science or their social value” and must thus be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/till014sche01_01/till014sche01_01_0031.php|title=J.A.C.

In 1973, the NGO ''Monumentenwacht'' (“Monument Watch”) was founded with the purpose of providing preventative measures of maintenance for historic buildings. As the majority of the historic preservation programs in the Netherlands, this program is decentralized, managed on the provincial level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcmt.org.uk/sites/default/files/migrated-reports/629_1.pdf|title=Devlin, H. (2005). European initiatives in preventative maintenance for historic buildings. Retrieved from www.wcmt.org.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of heritage buildings can subscribe to the services of Monumentenwacht and receive regular visits for inspection. The costs are covered through a combination of national and provincial subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weaver |first=Martin E. |authorlink=Martin E.

A special kind of preservation that takes place in the Netherlands is the preservation of maritime heritage. Maritime trade was the Dutch specialty which shaped much of their culture and as a country that is 50% under sea level the Dutch history is closely intertwined with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24|title=Flood Risk Management in Europe|first1=L.M.|last1=Bouwer|first2=P.|last2=Vellinga|date=20 October 2018|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=469–484|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are maritime museums in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam that tell the story of the Dutch maritime heritage, but there is not much legal documentation on how to preserve it. For example, according to Sarah Dromgoole, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/people/sarah.dromgoole&lt;/ref&gt; shipwrecks from [[Dutch East India Company|The Dutch East India Company]] are found all around the world, which are still property of the Netherlands, but the Dutch government rarely takes responsibility for this property that is found outside of their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=nuSwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=monumentenwet+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4JlsRABjN&amp;sig=wZoBBeGGK6nlqU1VABsCB6PPbfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrruD1h67XAhWEl5QKHZP_CjsQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=monumentenwet%201961&amp;f=false|title=The Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage: National Perspectives in Light of the UNESCO Convention 2001 - Second Edition|last=Dromgoole|first=Sarah|date=2006-06-30|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789047410454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macedonia ===
In Macedonia, historic preservation falls under the overarching category of cultural heritage preservation according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage (Закон за заштита на културното наследство). According to this law, which the Macedonian Parliament approved in March 2004, there are three types of cultural heritage: immovable, movable, and intangible. Historical preservation is represented by the protection of monuments and monumental entireties under immovable cultural heritage, and historical items under movable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzkn.gov.mk/dokumenti/Law%20on%20Cultural%20Heritage.pdf “Закон за заштита на културното наследство” (PDF)]. „Сл. Весник на Република Македонија“ бр.20/04. (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this Law was the first nation-wide establishment of regulations for historic preservation since the Republic of Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, several organizations throughout the 20th century have encompassed efforts of historic preservation.

The “Central office for protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia” has existed since 1949. In 1960, the Central Office was renamed to “National office for protection of cultural monuments”, and granted the status of an independent cultural institution, with authority to execute activities of historic preservation. After the establishment of the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage in 2004, the Ministry of Culture once again renamed the office to “National center for conservation” and narrowed down its responsibilities to dealing solely with preservation of immovable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jovcevska, Biljana.

Other organizations which have contributed to the efforts of historic preservation are the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS and the NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum-Ohrid.

The [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)]] established their branch in Macedonia in 1995 through the initiative of 43 conservationists from Macedonia. The guiding principles of the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS are raising the national consciousness about the importance of historic and cultural heritage, decentralization of the discourse about heritage, and effective monitoring of the status of cultural and historic heritage in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org.mk/AboutUs.aspx “ICOMOS Macedonia About Us”]. icomos.org.mk (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum - Ohrid is the second oldest institutions for historical preservation established in 1952. In 1956 the Institute was granted authority to protect movable and immovable cultural and historic heritage in the Ohrid region. The Institute has since executed numerous efforts for historic preservation, most notably aiding the recognition of the city of Ohrid as a UNESCO site of cultural heritage in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muzejohrid.mk/istorija “Историја”].

Today, the main authority for historic preservation is the Cultural Heritage Protection Office (Управа за заштита на културно наследство). The Office is an independent governmental organization under the Ministry of Culture, divided into three departments:
#Identification, Protection and Use of Cultural Heritage
#Prevention and Supervision
#Documentation, International Cooperation and Administrative Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001881/188172eo.pdf "Cultural Heritage in South-East Europe: Macedonia (Former Yugoslav Republic of)" (PDF)].

=== Israel ===
In Israel, there are currently two laws concerning historic preservation, [[Antiquities Law of the State of Israel of 1978|Antiquities Law of the State of Israel]] (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000490|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planning and Building Law (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/1998/Pages/Planning%20and%20Building%20Law-%201965.aspx|title=Summay of the law in English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws were adapted from the British law that was implemented during the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]].

However, these laws are not comprehensive and limited in scope: the Antiquities Law only applies itself to buildings or artifacts dated before 1700 BC. So while efforts discovering and protecting anything older than 1700 BC are well protected, anything from later historical periods is not under the protection of this law. The Planning and Building Law discusses the overall management and regulation of land use in Israel. It has been through several changes and amendments specifically regarding preservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000613|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; but over the years it hasn't been enforced and many historical sites were destroyed, as the state was prioritizing developmental and economic interests.

During the 1960s, the issue of preservation was gaining public awareness, and as a response to the destruction of [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] (one of the first educational institutions in Israel) in 1959, a wave of shock and anger led to extensive public debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yossi Klein Halevi|Klein Halevi, Yossi]] (2011). [http://www.kotar.co.il/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=96782691#6.2693.6.default האמרקניזציה של תל אביב].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was established, at the recommendation of the Knesset and the Committee of Education. Its aims include locating remains of historic settlements, protect and conserve them as well as developing conservation principles that are specific to Israel’s historic situations and are aligned with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.shimur.org/viewStaticPage.aspx?pageID=258|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council used to operate under the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]] but in 2008 registers as an independent non-profit. Today, it is the organization responsible for the most historical preservation endeavors as well as efforts to add amendments to existing laws to provide a comprehensive and effective framework for preservation in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shimur.org/viewArticle.aspx?articleID=165|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites: Historical context on the Council's work and outline of future plans [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different, separate effort in preservation comes from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF). The IDF surveyed 94 military bases and found that about 80 of them include sites worth preserving, and for each of these bases there is a preservation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.il/building/engineering/Pages/preservation.aspx The Ministry of Defense statement regarding preservation within IDF bases [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF is working towards maintaining these building as well as communicating their value to the soldiers in these bases. Buildings include [[Knights Templar]] sites, old military bases used by the British or German or buildings from the Ottoman period.

A historic district in the [[United States]] is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, [[Contributing property|contributing]] and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] designates historic districts through the [[U.S. Department of Interior]], under the auspices of the [[National Park Service]]. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm Federal, State and Local Historic Districts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015030933/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm |date=2006-10-15 }}, TOOLBOX, FAQ, National Park Service.

These include "Main Street" programs that can be used to redevelop rural downtowns. Using historic preservation programs as an economic development tool for local governments in rural areas has enabled some of those areas to take advantage of their history and develop a tourism market that in turn provides funds for maintaining an economic stability that these areas would not have seen otherwise.&lt;ref name="rdp"&gt;[http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=IND20529991 Stenberg, Peter L.

A similar concept exists in the United Kingdom: a [[Conservation area]] is designated in accordance with the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]] in order to protect a zone in which there are buildings of architectural or [[cultural heritage]] interest.

==National Parks==
{{main|National Park}}

In 1835, the English poet [[William Wordsworth]] described the [[Lake District]] as a "sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Guide+through+the+District+of+the+Lakes%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sort%20of%20national%20property%20in%20which%20every%20man%20has%20a%20right%20and%20interest%20who%20has%20an%20eye%20to%20perceive%20and%20a%20heart%20to%20enjoy&amp;f=false|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, the United States that led the world in the creation of [[United States National Park|National Parks]], areas of unspoiled natural wilderness, where the intrusion of civilization are intentionally minimal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The department of the interior designated several areas of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] as the first historic park in the United States national park system. It became designated as the [[Morristown National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/morr/ |title=Morristown National Historical Park - Morristown National Historical Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community had permanent settlements that date to 1715, is termed the military capital of the American Revolution, and contains many designations of sites and locations. The park includes three major sites in Morristown.

In the United Kingdom, [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] the [[ambassador]] to the US praised the system of National Parks and campaigned to have them introduced in Great Britain. Little came of it until mounting public pressure during the early 20th century from the [[Ramblers' Association]] and other groups led to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].

== UNESCO ==
According to UNESCO’s 1972 World Heritage Convention, landscapes and sites of outstanding universal value can be designated as [[World Heritage Site]]s. The World Heritage Convention encompasses historic preservation under the category of “cultural heritage”. According to Article 1 of the Convention, monuments, groups of buildings, and sites “which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science” are to be designated cultural heritage.

A requirement of such designation is that the designating nation has appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures in place to identify, protect, conserve, present, and rehabilitate world heritage sites. However, according to Article 6 of the Convention, while sovereignty of the State where the site is located is not to be compromised, the State acknowledges that protection of heritage sites is a duty of the entire international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage convention’s counterpart, The World Heritage Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/committee/ The World Heritage Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt; is the body responsible for the practical implementation of the Convention as well as managing and deciding how to use the World Heritage Fund. The Committee also gets to have the final say when determining whether a property will be included in the World Heritage List.

The Committee meets once a year and includes representatives from 21 states that are part of the States Parties. Yearly reports are available to the public on the World Heritage website and include outlines of decisions made, outcomes, working documents and various reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/ All available reports of the Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential challenges ==
Although preservation efforts can have benefits for the owners of historical buildings, such as tax cuts and subsidies, there are also drawbacks.

One such drawback is that after a neighborhood has been designated to be historically preserved, there is less construction. On the long term this can affect the value of property and investment in housing, both in the neighborhood itself and the neighborhoods directly surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nber.org.ccl.idm.oclc.org/papers/w20446.pdf)%20(http://readings.sipx.com/in-efa1d268-3446-11e4-b0d4-22000a890e29/c-a5bb0b99-34dc-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b/x-18c7cf2c-4b0a-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b.pdf?Expires=1510044499&amp;Signature=OYOvpPRjsvsdxGk8mFJuuvpqTmeZ2aWRa5PyPPJ3HEyNSDr36kObybQETDowEcAnOP10WnB82VVejixBL~YiqGuKe6ZJ-fFchJ2tcVcrt4A7QNKhALWi1jE0z2XkqC8tZxb6picEAwMJ3MhUCtEHoA8-kajtxQQaA9QgAjfzX~4_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIVBE35QX7A7QYJEA|title=Preserving History or Hindering Growth? The Heterogeneous Effects of Historic Districts on Local Housing Markets in New York City|last=Been, Gould Ellen, Gedal, Glaeser, &amp; McCabe|first=Vicki, Ingrid, Michael, Edward, Brian J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second concern that has been raised is that buildings that need to be historically preserved are sometimes still inhabited. In some cases their inability to make changes to the building can lead to dangerous or unhealthy situations for residents.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. (2012). The politics and heritage of race and space in San Francisco’s Chinatown. In D. F. Ruggles (Ed.), ''On location'' (pp. 37–59). New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not true that nothing could be changed or renovated, but the owner of the building would need to ask permission at the appropriate preservation society, slowing the process down severely. The exact policies are country dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. (2016). Getting Away From “No”: Straight Talk to Local Advocates. ''Forum Journal'' 30(2), 46-49.

==Careers==
Although volunteers continue to play a large role in historic preservation activities, the field has seen an increased level of professionalization. Today, there are many career options in historic preservation in the public, non-profit and private sectors. Institutes of secondary education (universities, colleges, etc.) in the United States offer both certificate and degree ([[Associate in Applied Science|A.A.S]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]], [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]], [[Masters of Design Studies|M.D.S]], [[Master of Historic Preservation|M.H.P.]], [[Master of Science|M.S.]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) programs in historic preservation. Some pupils—at schools with such programmes available—choose to enroll in "joint degree" programs, earning a degree in historic preservation along with one in another, related subject, often an [[Master of Architecture|MArch]], [[Master of Urban Planning|MUP]] or [[Juris Doctor|JD]] degree.

Possible career fields include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12361">Introduced by [[William Benoit]], '''image restoration theory''' outlines strategies that can be employed to restore image in an event where reputation has been damaged. Image restoration theory can be applied as an approach for understanding personal or organizational crisis situations.

Benoit outlines this theory in ''Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies''.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, William.outlines (1995). ''Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies''. New York: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic concepts of image restoration theory ==

Two components must be present in a given attack to the image of an individual or organization: 
# The accused is held responsible for an action, and
# the act is considered offensive.

Image restoration theory is grounded in two fundamental assumptions.

# '''Communication is a goal directed activity'''. Communicators may have multiple goals that are not collectively compatible, but people try to achieve goals that are most important to them at the time, with reasonable cost. 
# '''Maintaining a favorable reputation is a key goal of communication'''. Because face, image, or reputation is valued as important, individuals or organizations are motivated to take action when it is compromised.

Perception is fundamental to image restoration, as the accused actor will not engage in a defensive strategy unless the perception exists that he is at fault. The actor who committed the wrongful act must decide on the strategy of best course based on their specific situation. Factors such as credibility, audience perceptions, and the degree of offensiveness of the act must be taken into account.

== Theoretical framework ==
The theory of image restoration builds upon theories of [[Apologetics|apologia]] and accounts. Apologia is a formal defense or justification of an individual’s opinion, position, or actions,&lt;ref&gt;Fearn-Banks, Kathleen. (2009). ''Crisis Communications: A Casebook Approach''. Mahweh: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; and an account is a statement made by an individual or organization to explain unanticipated or transgressive events.

Benoit claims that these treatments of image restoration focus on identifying options rather than prescribing solutions. He grounds image restoration theory on a comprehensive literature review of apologia and accounts theories.

Specific influences of image restoration theory include Rosenfield’s (1968) theory of analog, Ware and Linkugel's (1973) theory of apologia;&lt;ref&gt;http://changingminds.org/techniques/conversation/excusing/apologia.htm#war&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Burke]]'s (1970) theory of goals and purification; Ryan's (1982) kategoria and apologia; Scott and Lyman's (1968) analysis of accounts; [[Goffman]]’s (1967) remedial moves; Schonbach's (1980) updated analysis of Scott and Lyman’s (1968) theory; and Schlenker’s (1980) analysis of impression management and accounts.

== Typology of image restoration strategies ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Strategy !! Explanation
|-
| '''Denial''' || The accused may ''simply deny'' that the act occurred, or ''shift the blame'' to the 'real' culprit
|-
| '''Evading responsibility''' || When unable to deny performing the act in question, the accused may attempt to evade responsibility. This strategy has four components.

''Provocation'': the actor may claim that the act was committed in response to another wrongful act. 
&lt;br/&gt;''[[Defeasibility]]'': the actor pleads a lack of knowledge or control about important factors related to the offensive act
&lt;br/&gt;''Make an excuse based on accidents'': the actor may make an excuse for factors beyond their control
&lt;br/&gt;''Suggest the action was justified based on good intentions'': the actor asks not to be held fully responsible based on their good, rather than evil motives in committing the act.

|-
| '''Reducing offensiveness''' || The accused may attempt to reduce the degree of negative feeling experienced by the audience. This strategy has six components.

''Bolstering'': used to mitigate the negative effects by strengthening the audience’s positive idea of the accused. They may remind the audience of previous good acts or good reputation. 
&lt;br/&gt;''Minimization'': attempts convince the audience that the act in question is less serious as it appears.
&lt;br/&gt;''Differentiation'': the act is distinguished from other more offensive acts to lessen the audience’s negative feelings by comparison.
&lt;br/&gt;''Transcendence'': the act is placed in a broad context to place it in a different, less offensive frame of reference.  
&lt;br/&gt;''Attacking accuser'': the actor attacks their accusers, to question the credibility of the source of the accusations
&lt;br/&gt;''Compensation'': the actor offers to redress the victims of their action to offset negative feelings towards them.

|-
| '''Corrective action''' || The accused claims that they will correct the problem. This can involve restoring the situation to its prior state, or promising to make changes to prevent its reoccurrence. 
|-
| '''Mortification''' || The accused admits responsibility and asks for forgiveness.

== Case studies ==

=== Case studies by Benoit ===

Based on several case studies by Benoit and his colleagues, Coombs (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; cited a number of prescriptive recommendations for the use of crisis strategies (Benoit, 1995;&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, W. L. (1995). Accounts, excuses, and apologies: A theory of image restoration. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Brinson &amp; Benoit, 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Brinson, S. L., &amp; Benoit, W.L. (1996). Dow Corning’s image repair strategies in the breast implant crisis. Communication Quarterly, 44(1), 29-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 1999&lt;ref&gt;Brinson, S. L., &amp; Benoit, W. L. (1999). The tarnished star: Restoring Texaco’s damaged public image. Management Communication Quarterly, 12, 483-510.&lt;/ref&gt;). 1) The dominant recommendation is for an organization to immediately admit fault/accept responsibility, 2) Corrective actions should be taken and an organization need to publicize those actions, 3) Bolstering, which is directly related to the charge, is the most effective strategy, and 4) If the organization was innocent, Denial is an effective strategy. “Image restoration theory is the dominant line of research generating these recommendations. The most common recommendations suggest using the mortification and corrective action crisis response when an organization is guilty.” (Coombs, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;191)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here representative case studies by Benoit and his colleagues are introduced.

=== Limitation of Image repair theory – Coombs ===

Even though image restoration theory represented the use of mortification (accepting responsibility) and corrective action, there might be alternative recommendation. For instance, his studies using [[situational crisis communication theory]] found no support for always using mortification and corrective action. Also, the mortification and corrective action strategies had no greater effect than a simple bolstering strategy in a criminal violation crisis such as racial discrimination (Coombs, 2006&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Additionally, in terms of the limitation of case studies in image restoration theory, Coombs (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that closer scrutiny with insights should be taken before offering strategies to crisis managers as facts. In order to gaining additional insights into the use of crisis responses, he pointed out many similar crises should be examined for patterns of strategy use and effect and “a large number of cases could be coded and subjected to loglinear analysis in order to identify patterns.” (Coombs, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;191-192)&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, W. T. (2006). Crisis Management: A communicative approach. In C. H. Botan &amp; V. Hazleton (Eds.), Public Relations Theory II (171-197). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Cola Wars ===
Coca-Cola and Pepsi’s longstanding competition&lt;ref&gt;[[Cola Wars]]&lt;/ref&gt; reached its peak when Coke and Pepsi placed advertisements in Nation’s Restaurant News with unmistakable attacks from both sides.

Benoit analyses advertisements from both companies from 1990-1992 to address the persuasive strategies of Coke and Pepsi to determine recommendations for image restoration following an attack. He advises that companies should avoid making false claims, provide adequate support for claims, and develop themes throughout a campaign, and avoid arguments that might backfire.

An '''Individualized Family Service Plan''' (IFSP) is a plan for special services for young children with developmental delays. An IFSP only applies to children from birth to three years of age. Once a child turns 3 years old, an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) is put into place. This program was created by US Public Law 99-457.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The IFSP is developed with service coordinator for a [[Part C]] eligible child and family.
The service is available "Part C" (formerly Part H) of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]]  (IDEA)
The IFSP  is set up to identify individualized supports and services that will enhance the child’s development. The IFSP is usually done at 6 month intervals but can be done more often if necessary.

The plan must include: an assessment of child's present level of development; a statement of goals; support services that will be put in place to achieve those goals; date services will begin; name and identification of the service coordinator.

'''How an IFSP is different from an IEP:'''

An ''IFSP'' revolves around the family since it is the only constant a child has in their life. An ''IEP'' strictly revolves around the student, because it's the child's education which is being discussed. Therefore, the goals that are put into place within an ''IFSP'' are targeted towards the family versus the goals within an ''IEP'', which are targeted specifically towards the student. An ''IFSP'' includes the locations of natural environments, such as home, parks, child care, and gym classes. This focus creates opportunities for learning interventions in everyday routines and activities. 

'''How an IFSP is different from an IPP:'''

''IFSP'' stands for Individualized Family Service Plan, and is reserved for children aged 0–3. The same center that supplies children 0-3 with an IFSP also supplies adults and older children with an IPP, or Individual Program Plan.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Legal mobilisation''' is a tool available to paralegal and [[advocacy]] groups, to achieve [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]] by supporting a marginalized issues of a stakeholder, in negotiating with the other concerned agencies and other stakeholders, by strategic combined use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] along with [[advocacy]], media engagement and social mobilisation.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date= 1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Frances Kahen Zemans (1983) '' the Legal mobilisation is "a desire or want, which is translated into a demand as an assertion of one's rights".'' &lt;ref name=Zemans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zemans|first1=Frances|title=Legal Mobilization: The Neglected Role of the Law in the Political System|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=Sep 1983|publisher=American Political Science Association|location=USA|volume= 77|issue=3|jstor=1957268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lisa Vanhala (November 2011) Legal mobilisation in its  narrowest sense, may refer to high-profile litigation efforts for (or, arguably, against) [[social change]] or more '''broadly, term legal mobilisation has been used to describe any type of process by which an individual or collective actors invoke legal norms, discourse, or symbols to influence policy or behavior.'''&lt;ref name=Vanhala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanhala|first1=Lisa|title=Legal Mobilization|journal=Political Science|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 November 2014|ISBN= 9780199756223|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0031|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically means that there are policies or regulations to mobilize around and a mechanism by which to do so.&lt;ref name=Pettinicchio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinicchio|first1=David|title=The When, Why, and How of Legal Mobilization|website=Mobilizing Ideas|url=http://mobilizingideas.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/the-when-why-and-how-of-legal-mobilization/|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative activity does create an opportunity for legal mobilization.

'''Message-oriented middleware''' ('''MOM''') is software or hardware infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between [[distributed system]]s. MOM allows [[modular programming|application modules]] to be distributed over heterogeneous platforms and reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple [[operating system]]s and [[network protocol]]s. The [[middleware]] creates a distributed communications layer that insulates the [[application developer]] from the details of the various operating systems and network interfaces. [[API]]s that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by MOM.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2004. [http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/1652511/4338215212/cce0f06f047faa57879a1fc36a8e8d6d754d2f6a/dl.pdf "Message-Oriented Middleware"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. In Middleware for Communications, ed. Qusay H Mahmoud, 1-28. Chichester, England: John Wiley and Sons. {{doi|10.1002/0470862084.ch1}}. {{ISBN|978-0-470-86206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This middleware layer allows software components (applications, Enterprise JavaBeans, servlets, and other components) that have been developed independently and that run on different networked platforms to interact with one another. Applications distributed on different network nodes use the application interface to communicate. In addition, by providing an administrative interface, this new, virtual system of interconnected applications can be made reliable and secure.&lt;ref name="oracle"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Message Oriented Middleware |url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19340-01/820-6424/aeraq/index.html |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOM provides software elements that reside in all communicating components of a client/server architecture and typically support asynchronous calls between the client and server applications.  MOM reduces the involvement of application developers with the complexity of the master-slave nature of the client/server mechanism.

==Middleware categories==

*[[Remote Procedure Call]] or RPC-based middleware
*[[Object Request Broker]] or ORB-based middleware
*Message Oriented Middleware or MOM-based middleware

All these models make it possible for one software component to affect the behavior of another component over a network. They are different in that RPC- and ORB-based middleware create systems of tightly coupled components, whereas MOM-based systems allow for a [[loose coupling|looser coupling]] of components. In an RPC- or ORB-based system, when one procedure calls another, it must wait for the called procedure to return before it can do anything else. In these [[synchronous messaging]] models, the middleware functions partly as a super-linker, locating the called procedure on a network and using network services to pass function or method parameters to the procedure and then to return results.&lt;ref name=oracle/&gt;

==Advantages==

Central reasons for using a message-based communications [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] include its ability to store (buffer), route, or transform [[message]]s while conveying them from senders to receivers.

Another advantage of messaging provider mediated messaging between clients is that by adding an administrative interface, you can monitor and tune performance. Client applications are thus effectively relieved of every problem except that of sending, receiving, and processing messages. It is up to the code that implements the MOM system and up to the administrator to resolve issues like interoperability, reliability, security, scalability, and performance.

===Asynchronicity===
Using a MOM system, a client makes an API call to send a message to a destination managed by the provider. The call invokes provider services to route and deliver the message. Once it has sent the message, the client can continue to do other work, confident that the provider retains the message until a receiving client retrieves it. The message-based model, coupled with the mediation of the provider, makes it possible to create a system of loosely coupled components.

MOM comprises a category of inter-[[application software|application]] [[communication software]] that generally relies on [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] [[message passing|message-passing]], as opposed to a [[request-response]] architecture.  In asynchronous systems, [[message queue]]s provide temporary storage when the destination program is busy or not connected.  In addition, most asynchronous MOM systems provide [[persistent storage]] to [[backup|back up]] the message queue.  This means that the sender and receiver do not need to connect to the network at the same time ([[asynchrony (computing)|asynchronous delivery]]), and problems with intermittent connectivity are solved.  It also means that should the receiver application fail for any reason, the senders can continue unaffected, as the messages they send will simply accumulate in the [[message queue]] for later processing when the receiver restarts.

===Routing===
Many message-oriented middleware implementations depend on a [[message queue]] system.  Some implementations permit routing logic to be provided by the messaging layer itself, while others depend on client applications to provide routing information or allow for a mix of both paradigms.  Some implementations make use of [[Broadcasting (networks)|broadcast]] or [[multicast]] distribution paradigms.

===Transformation===
In a message-based middleware system, the message received at the destination need not be identical to the message originally sent. A MOM system with built-in intelligence can [[Data transformation|transform]] messages en route to match the requirements of the sender or of the recipient.&lt;ref name="MOM"&gt;[http://www.edwardcurry.org/web_publications/curry_DEBS_04.pdf E. Curry, D. Chambers, and G. Lyons, "Extending Message-Oriented Middleware using Interception", presented at Third International Workshop on Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS '04), ICSE '04, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the routing and broadcast/[[multicast]] facilities, one application can send a message in its own native format, and two or more other applications may each receive a copy of the message in their own native format. Many modern MOM systems provide sophisticated message transformation (or mapping) tools which allow [[software developer|programmer]]s to specify transformation rules applicable to a simple [[graphical user interface|GUI]] [[drag-and-drop]] operation.

==Disadvantages==

The primary disadvantage of many message-oriented middleware systems is that they require an extra component in the [[software architecture|architecture]], the message transfer agent ([[message broker]]).  As with any [[system]], adding another component can lead to reductions in [[computer performance|performance]] and reliability, and can also make the system as a whole more difficult and expensive to [[software maintenance|maintain]].

In addition, many inter-application communications have an intrinsically [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]] aspect, with the sender specifically wanting to wait for a reply to a message before continuing (see [[real-time computing]] and [[near real time|near-real-time]] for extreme cases). Because message-based [[data communication|communication]] inherently functions asynchronously, it may not fit well in such situations.  That said, most MOM systems have facilities to group a request and a response as a single pseudo-synchronous transaction.

With a synchronous messaging system, the calling function does not return until the called function has finished its task. In a [[loose coupling|loosely coupled]] asynchronous system, the calling client can continue to load work upon the recipient until the resources needed to handle this work are depleted and the called component fails. Of course, these conditions can be minimized or avoided by monitoring performance and adjusting message flow, but this is work that is not needed with a synchronous messaging system. The important thing is to understand the advantages and liabilities of each kind of system. Each system is appropriate for different kinds of tasks. Sometimes, a combination of the two kinds of systems is required to obtain the desired behavior.

==Standards==
Historically, there was a lack of [[standardization|standards]] governing the use of message-oriented middleware that has caused problems.  Most of the major vendors have their own implementations, each with its own [[application programming interface]] (API) and management tools.

One of the long-standing standards for message oriented middleware is X/Open group's XATMI specification (Distributed Transaction Processing: The XATMI Specification) which standardizes API for [[interprocess communication]]s. Known implementations for this API is ATR Baltic's [[Enduro/X]] middleware and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s [[Tuxedo (software)|Tuxedo]].

The [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol]] (AMQP) is an approved [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amqp.org/node/102 1.0 Becomes OASIS Standard]. AMQP (2012-10-31). Retrieved on 2014-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=64955 ISO/IEC 19464:2014]&lt;/ref&gt; standard that defines the protocol and formats used between participating application components, so implementations are interoperable.  AMQP may be used with flexible routing schemes, including common [[Messaging pattern|messaging paradigms]] like [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]], [[Fan-out (software)|fan-out]], [[publish/subscribe]], and [[request-response]] (note that these are intentionally omitted from v1.0 of the protocol standard itself, but rely on the particular implementation and/or underlying network protocol for routing). It also supports transaction management, queuing, distribution, security, management, clustering, federation and heterogeneous multi-platform support. Java applications that use AMQP are typically written in Java JMS. Other implementations provide APIs for C#, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby, and other languages.

The [[High-level architecture|High-Level Architecture]] (HLA IEEE 1516) is an [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] and [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization|SISO]] standard for simulation interoperability. It defines a set of services, provided through an API in C++ or Java. The services offer publish/subscribe based information exchange, based on a modular Federation Object Model. There are also services for coordinated data exchange and time advance, based on logical simulation time, as well as synchronization points. Additional services provide transfer of ownership, data distribution optimizations and monitoring and management of participating Federates (systems).

The [[MQ Telemetry Transport]] (MQTT) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) supported by the OASIS organization. It provides a lightweight publish/subscribe reliable messaging transport protocol on top of TCP/IP suitable for communication in M2M/IoT contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

The [[Object Management Group]]'s [[Data Distribution Service| Data Distribution Service (DDS)]] provides message-oriented [[Publish–subscribe pattern|Publish/Subscribe (P/S)]] middleware standard that aims to enable scalable, real-time, dependable, high performance and interoperable data exchanges between publishers and subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems (DDS), Object Management Group, version 1.2, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The standard provides interfaces to C++, C++11, C, Ada, Java and Ruby.

The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ([[XMPP]]) is a communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). Designed to be extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet of Things applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services.  Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software license; although many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software, numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions.  XMPP-based software is deployed widely across the Internet, according to the XMPP Standards Foundation, and forms the basis for the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Capabilities Framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/UCCO/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/UCCO/UCR2013/01_Framework_2013.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040719/http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/UCCO/~/media/Files/DISA/Services/UCCO/UCR2013/01_Framework_2013.pdf|date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Java EE]] programming environment provides a standard API called [[Java Message Service|JMS]] (Java Message Service), which is implemented by most MOM vendors and aims to hide the particular MOM API implementations; however, JMS does not define the format of the messages that are exchanged, so JMS systems are not interoperable.

A similar effort is with the actively evolving [[OpenMAMA]] project, which aims to provide a common API, particularly to C clients. However, at the moment (August 2012) it is primarily appropriate for distributing market-oriented data (e.g. stock quotes) over pub-sub middleware.

==Message queuing==
{{see also|Message queuing service}}
[[Message queue]]s allow the exchange of information between distributed applications. A message queue can reside in memory or disk storage. Messages stay in the queue until the time they are processed by a service consumer. Through the message queue, the application can be implemented independently - they do not need to know each other's position, or continue to implement procedures to remove the need for waiting to receive this message.&lt;ref name=tutorialsto&gt;http://www.tutorialsto.com/software/engineering/middleware/message-oriented-middleware-and-the-websphere-mq-introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MusicEase''' is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[WYSIWYG]] [[scorewriter]] created by Gary Rader and produced by MusicEase Software (formerly known as Grandmaster). It enables computers using [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] to produce [[musical notation]] and listen to them in [[MIDI]].

==Brief history==

MusicEase was initially created under [[DOS]] using muLisp The first version appeared in 1987 and was completely controlled by the keyboard.&lt;ref name="rothstein"&gt;Rothstein, Joseph (1989), "''Grandmaster MusicEase Notation Software''". MIT Computer Music Journal, Volume 13, Number 2, pp.94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothstein2"&gt;Rothstein, Joseph (1989), "''MusicEase Notation Software for IBM PCs''". MIT Computer Music Journal, Volume 13, Number 3, pp.105-106.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, a Windows version was created using [[Allegro Common Lisp]]. Toolbars and mouse support were then added. During the ensuing years, additional functionality was added as new versions were produced. In 2013, version 9.0 was released for both Windows and the Mac.

==Functionality==

MusicEase is both a music score editor and an automatic accompaniment generator. As a score editor, the user can create, edit, play and print high quality music notation. The user sees on the computer screen the musical score exactly as it will be printed out. As an automatic accompaniment creator/generator, it allows the user to quickly create accompaniment styles using the full range of notational functionality and to easily apply a style to a melody to add an accompaniment consisting of any number of general MIDI instruments including drums.

MusicEase is a constraint-based system with a large amount of knowledge of music notation. This allows it to handle intelligently many of the details of scoring automatically.&lt;ref name="rader"&gt;Rader, Gary (1994) "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp;jsessionid=GGpHPDpWmznlQ4sfBNkmQ1Why1SwLKdQqGxKyZp9S7Yd2fYlT6fQ!-996370577?arnumber=369308&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications ''Helping naive users create publication quality music scores'']". TENCON '94. IEEE Region 10's Ninth Annual International Conference. Theme: Frontiers of Computer Technology. Proceedings of 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="rader2"&gt;Rader, Gary (1996) "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=620470 ''Creating Printed Music Automatically'']". IEEE Computer, Volume 29, Issue 6, June 1996,
pp. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, bar lines are inserted automatically according to the current [[Meter (music)|meter]] (time signature). If the user changes the time signature, the bar line placements change automatically, and beam scopes are automatically recomputed as directed by the new time signature. (Users can also insert [[Bar (music)|barlines]] themselves wherever they like.) [[Slur (music)|Slurs]] and [[phrase mark]]s can often be inserted with a single keystroke combination. The end points, shape, direction and location (above or below the included notes) are automatically determined. The result is that users can create professional looking scores easily and quickly without knowing [[music engraving]]/music copyist rules. (Generally no one can create engraver quality printed music without having explicitly been trained in music copyist techniques. And incorrectly notated music is harder for trained musicians to play.)

Jerry Pournelle, reviewer for Byte Magazine, says ''The samples [of music printouts from MusicEase] I have seen, and a couple I have produced, are sure in the same league as hand engraved.''&lt;ref name="pournelle"&gt;Pournelle, Jerry (1990) "[https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1990-12/1990_12_BYTE_15-13_State_of_the_Art_Advanced_Graphics#page/n121/mode/2up/search/musicease ''MusicEase'']". Byte Magazine, Volume 15, Number 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many people are familiar with [[word processors]], the notation aspect of MusicEase is designed to work much like a word processing program. For instance, pressing the G key enters the note G. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) then deletes this note. Pressing the Enter key begins a new system. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) at the beginning of a system appends it to the previous system. Blocks can be cut from one location and pasted into another location and then everything can be reformatted with just several keystrokes (using MusicEase's cast-off function which redetermines system breaks so that the density of notes in each system is roughly the same followed by the justify function to stretch/shrink all staves so they horizontally span from the left margin to the right margin.) Most functions are invoked via key presses which allows fast content entry as opposed to using the mouse to drag music notational elements from palettes to staves which generally requires more effort.

MusicEase supports a number of additional generally useful functions such as true [[Transposition (music)|transposition]] (as opposed to just shifting existing configurations up or down on the staff), [[Part (music)|part extraction]] (any combination of system staves can be extracted), scaling of the music to a large range of sizes, [[Melodic inversion|inverting]] or [[Retrograde (music)|retrograding]] selected blocks of notes, combining 2 staves containing single voices into a single staff containing mixed single and double [[Stem (music)|stemmed]] voicing and ''vice versa'' (splitting a single staff with several voices into 2 separate staves, each containing a single voice), automatically adding chord fret diagrams, using any computer fonts for verses, titles, etc., [[unicode]] text support, and displaying music as [[tablature]] and/or as [[shape note]]s (4 or 7 shape systems --- the shapes associated with scale degrees can be fully customized.)

==Most notable features==

==Prominent uses==
MusicEase was used by University of Colorado at Boulder Professor Emeritus of Music [[Karl Kroeger]] to create much of the music in ''[http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/resource/chap01.html Music of the New American Nation - Sacred Music from 1780 to 1820]'', for which he was the main editor. Professor Kroeger states, ''In particular, I acknowledge my debt to Gary M. Rader, developer of the MusicEase music notation software used for the musical scores''&lt;ref name="kroeger"&gt;Kroeger, Karl, (ed.) (1995) ''Music of the New American Nation - Sacred Music from 1780 to 1820'', Volume 3, p. ix, Garland Publishing, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

MusicEase Software's virtual songbook technology was created using MusicEase Professional. It allows a single piece of music to be ramified in many different ways (e.g., just verses or just the music displayed). [[Integrity Music]], a major publisher of praise-worship music, used this functionality for the transposable sheet music versions of many of its recent products: e.g., the CD-Rom versions of its [[Hosanna! Music]] songbooks, versions 3 and 4 of its Worship Software, music available via its worshipleaderassistant.com and Worship Kitchen websites, and various iWorship CD-Rom songbooks.

The "Shout Music Manager" by Media Shout included this virtual songbook technology to provide transposable, customizable printed music.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">'''Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)''' refers to a set of policies and actions that countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The term recognizes that different countries may take different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It also emphasizes financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries to reduce emissions.

NAMA was first used in the [[Bali Action Plan]] as part of the [[Bali Road Map]] agreed at the [[Bali Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali]] in December 2007, and also formed part of the [[Copenhagen Accord]] issued following the [[COP 15|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]] (COP 15) in December 2009.

==History of the use of NAMA in international agreements==

===Bali Action Plan (December 2007)===
The [[Bali Action Plan]] is centered on four main building blocks: (i) Mitigation, (ii) Adaptation, (iii) Technology, and (iv) Financing, with NAMA forming an important part of the mitigation component. 
The Bali Action Plan called for future discussions to address:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/climatechange/docs/UNDP_BAP_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions by all developed countries, and;''
* ''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.''.

===Copenhagen Climate Conference (December 2009)===
The [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] did not produce the global agreement envisaged in the Bali Road Map. The Copenhagen Accord, however, did retain the concept of NAMA, but in a narrower definition only applying to Non-Annex 1 countries, and did not specify what form they should take:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c2es.org/copenhagen-accord&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Non-Annex I Parties to the Convention will implement mitigation actions … consistent with Article 4.1 and Article 4.7 and in the context of sustainable development … Non-Annex I Parties will communicate information on the implementation of their actions through National Communications, with provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure that national sovereignty is respected. '''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' seeking international support will be recorded in a registry along with relevant technology, finance and capacity building support. Those actions supported will be added to the list in appendix II. These supported '''nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' will be subject to international measurement, reporting and verification in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Conference of the Parties.''

==What is meant by Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action?==
* Different countries, different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities 
* Developing countries will effectively implement national action depending on the effective implementation of the commitments by developed countries in providing financial resources and transfer of technology. 
* The priorities of developing countries are economic and social development and poverty eradication.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/39/16/40633672.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
India has argued that NAMA means ''voluntary reductions'' by developing countries that ''require to be supported and enabled'' by technology transfer from developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/india100209b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition, NAMAs will vary by country. Indonesia, for example, might focus on integrating climate change policy with other aspects of economic development, such as progressive reduction in oil subsidies, poverty reduction through promotion of alternative income to reduce [[illegal logging]], and exploit more fully the country’s renewable resources, especially geothermal.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

==Implementation of NAMA==
In 2010, no NAMAs were implemented yet. The [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] under the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] is regarded a precedor of a future NAMA mechanism and already operational.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter C. and Schibli R., If you want a Nama tomorrow, you need a POA today (March 2011), Trading Carbon, Reuters. Available at: http://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/110300_Namas_TradingCarbon_SPcs-rs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of NAMA submissions==
As of September 2012, about 50 countries have submitted information of their NAMA to the UNFCCC. The detailed contents of their submissions vary greatly on each country, ranging from their intention to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, target sectors, specific actions to be taken, to GHG emissions reduction targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmechanisms.org/e/namainfo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2012 "Submission of more information by developing country Parties, subject to availability, relating to nationally appropriate mitigation actions, including underlying assumptions and methodologies, sectors and gases covered, global warming potential values used, support needs for implementation of nationally appropriate mitigation actions and estimated mitigation outcomes. Submissions from Parties." FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/MISC.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2011 "Compilation of information on nationally appropriate mitigation actions to be implemented by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention." FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/INF.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of NAMA==
Some have criticized NAMA as heading away from [[carbon pricing]] and encouraging enormous subsidy programs funded by developed countries and implemented on a voluntary basis by developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stoft, Steven E., Beyond Kyoto: Flexible Carbon Pricing for Global Cooperation (October 23, 2009).

'''Patch dynamics''' is an ecological perspective that the structure, function, and dynamics of ecological systems can be understood through studying their interactive patches.  Patch dynamics, as a term, may also refer to the spatiotemporal changes within and among patches that make up a landscape.  Patch dynamics is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic systems across organizational levels and spatial scales.  From a patch dynamics perspective, populations, communities, ecosystems, and landscapes may all be studied effectively as mosaics of patches that differ in size, shape, composition, history, and boundary characteristics.  

The idea of patch dynamics dates back to the 1940s when plant ecologists studied the structure and dynamics of vegetation in terms of the interactive patches that it comprises.  A mathematical theory of patch dynamics was developed by Simon Levin and Robert Paine in the 1970s, originally to describe the pattern and dynamics of an intertidal community as a patch mosaic created and maintained by tidal disturbances.  Patch dynamics became a dominant theme in ecology between the late 1970s and the 1990s.  

'''Patch dynamics''' is a conceptual approach to [[ecosystem]] and habitat analysis that emphasizes dynamics of [[heterogeneity]] within a system (i.e. that each area of an ecosystem is made up of a mosaic of small 'sub-ecosystems').&lt;ref name=Pickett1985&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickett|first1=Steward T.A.|last2=White|first2=P.S.|title= The Ecology of Natural Disturbance and Patch Dynamics|publisher= Academic Press|year=1985|isbn=0123960215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diverse patches of habitat created by natural [[disturbance regimes]] are seen as critical to the maintenance of this [[diversity (ecology)]]. A ''habitat patch'' is any discrete area with a definite shape, spatial and configuration used by a species for breeding or obtaining other resources. ''Mosaics'' are the patterns within landscapes that are composed of smaller elements, such as individual forest stands, shrubland patches, highways, farms, or towns.

== Patches and mosaics ==

Historically, due to the short time scale of human observation, mosaic landscapes were perceived to be [[punctuated equilibrium|static]] patterns of human population mosaics.&lt;ref name=Bogin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Barry|title=Patterns of human growth|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521564380|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ScfPjwF3BngC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus centered on the idea that the status of a particular [[population]], [[community]], or [[ecosystem]] could be understood by studying a particular patch within a mosaic. However, this perception ignored the conditions that interact with, and connect patches. In 1979, Bormann and Likens coined the phrase ''shifting mosaic'' to describe the theory that landscapes change and fluctuate, and are in fact dynamic. This is related to the battle of cells that occurs in a [[Petri dish]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

''Patch dynamics'' refers to the concept that [[landscapes]] are dynamic.&lt;ref name=Pickett1985/&gt; There are three states that a patch can exist in: ''potential'', ''active'', and ''degraded''. Patches in the ''potential'' state are transformed into active patches through [[colonization]] of the patch by [[dispersal (ecology)|dispersing species]] arriving from other ''active'' or ''degrading'' patches. Patches are transformed from the ''active'' state to the ''degraded'' state when the patch is abandoned, and patches change from ''degraded'' to ''potential'' through a process of [[recovery (ecology)|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Justin P.|first2=W.S.C. |last2=Gurney |first3= Jones |last3= C.G.

|archivedate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logging, fire, farming, and [[afforestation|reforestation]] can all contribute to the process of colonization, and can effectively change the shape of the patch. ''Patch dynamics'' also refers to changes in the structure, function, and composition of individual patches that can, for example, effect the rate of [[nutrient cycling]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

Patches are also linked, although separated from other patches, migration occurs from one patch to another{{Vague|date=January 2010}}. This migration maintains the population of some patches, and can be the mechanism by which some plant species spread. This implies that ecological systems within landscapes are open, rather than closed and isolated. (Pickett, 2006)

== Conservation efforts ==
Recognizing the patch dynamics within a system is needed for [[conservation (ecology)]] efforts to succeed. Successful conservation includes understanding how a patch changes and predicting how they will be affected by external forces{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. These externalities include natural effects, such as [[land use]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], [[ecological restoration|restoration]], and [[Ecological succession|succession]], and the effects of human activities. In a sense, conservation is the active maintenance of patch dynamics (Pickett, 2006). The analysis of patch dynamics could be used to predict changes in biodiversity of an ecosystem. When patches of species can be tracked, it has been shown that fluctuations on the biggest patch (the most dominant species) can be used as an early warning of a  [[Biodiversity]] collapse &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saravia|first=Leonardo A.|last2=Momo|first2=Fernando R.|date=2017-07-01|title=Biodiversity collapse and early warning indicators in a spatial phase transition between neutral and niche communities|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/1589/|journal=Oikos|language=en|volume=|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/oik.04256|issn=1600-0706|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That means that if external conditions, like [[climate change]] and [[habitat fragmentation]], change the internal dynamics of patches a sharp reduction in biodiversity can be detected before it is produced &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrado|first=Raffaele|date=2014|title=Early warning signals of desertification transitions in semiarid ecosystems|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.062705|journal=Physical Review E|volume=90|issue=6|doi=10.1103/physreve.90.062705}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Perception''' (from the [[Latin]] ''perceptio'') is the organization, identification, and interpretation of [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] in order to represent and understand the presented information, or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher = Worth Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All perception involves signals that go through the [[nervous system]], which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"&gt;Goldstein (2009) pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; For example, vision involves [[photon|light]] striking the [[retina]] of the [[eye]], smell is mediated by [[Olfactory system#Peripheral|odor molecules]], and [[hearing]] involves [[sound wave|pressure waves]].

Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it's also shaped by the recipient's [[Perceptual learning|learning]], [[memory]], [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]], and [[attention]].&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010" /&gt;

Perception can be split into two processes, &lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Douglas A. |title = Essentials of Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |date=5 March 2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-90693-3 |pages=123–124 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170102091148/https://books.google.com/books?id=rd77N0KsLVkC&amp;pg=PA123 |archivedate=2 January 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) processing the sensory input, which transforms these low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition), (2) processing which is connected with a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as [[attention]]) that influence perception.

Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness. &lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;

Since the rise of [[experimental psychology]] in the 19th century, [[perceptual psychology|psychology's understanding of perception]] has progressed by combining a variety of techniques.&lt;ref name="mind_perception"&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard]]. "Perception" in Gregory, Zangwill (1987) pp.&amp;nbsp;598–601.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychophysics]] quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Fechner|Gustav Theodor Fechner]]. Elemente der Psychophysik. Leipzig 1860.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensory neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception. Perceptual systems can also be studied [[computation]]ally, in terms of the information they process. [[Philosophy of perception|Perceptual issues in philosophy]] include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

Although the senses were traditionally viewed as passive receptors, the study of [[illusion]]s and [[ambiguous image]]s has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt; There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of [[hypothesis]] testing, analogous to [[science]], or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.&lt;ref name="mind_perception" /&gt;

The [[perceptual system]]s of the [[brain]] enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. Human and animal brains are structured in a [[cognitive module|modular way]], with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of [[Sensory Maps|sensory maps]], mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface. These different modules are interconnected and influence each other. For instance, [[taste]] is strongly influenced by smell.&lt;ref name="DeVereCalvert2010_33" /&gt;

== Process and terminology ==
&lt;!-- linked from disambiguation: update or define {{Anchor|Process and terminology}} if changed --&gt;
The process of perception begins with an object in the real world, termed the ''distal stimulus'' or ''distal object''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; By means of light, sound or another physical process, the object stimulates the body's sensory organs. These sensory organs transform the input energy into neural activity—a process called ''transduction''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pomerantz" /&gt; This raw pattern of neural activity is called the ''proximal stimulus''.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5"/&gt; These neural signals are transmitted to the brain and processed.&lt;ref name="Goldstein5" /&gt; The resulting mental re-creation of the distal stimulus is the ''percept''.

An example would be a shoe. The shoe itself is the distal stimulus. When light from the shoe enters a person's eye and stimulates the retina, that stimulation is the proximal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |title = Sensation and Perception |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110510081956/http://www.learner.org/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html |archivedate = 10 May 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of the shoe reconstructed by the brain of the person is the percept. Another example would be a telephone ringing. The ringing of the telephone is the distal stimulus. The sound stimulating a person's auditory receptors is the proximal stimulus, and the brain's interpretation of this as the ringing of a telephone is the percept. The different kinds of sensation such as warmth, sound, and taste are called ''[[stimulus modality|sensory modalities]]''.&lt;ref name="pomerantz"&gt;Pomerantz, James R. (2003): "Perception: Overview".

Psychologist [[Jerome Bruner]] has developed a model of perception. According to him, people go through the following process to form opinions:&lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan S. &amp; Gary J. (2011). Perception, Attribution, and Judgment of Others. Organizational Behaviour: Understanding and Managing Life at Work,  Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

# When we encounter an unfamiliar target, we are open to different informational cues and want to learn more about the target.
# In the second step, we try to collect more information about the target. Gradually, we encounter some familiar cues which help us categorize the target.
# At this stage, the cues become less open and selective. We try to search for more cues that confirm the categorization of the target. We also actively ignore and even distort cues that violate our initial perceptions. Our perception becomes more selective and we finally paint a consistent picture of the target.

According to [[Alan Saks]] and [[Gary Johns]], there are three components to perception.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;

# The Perceiver, the person who becomes aware about something and comes to a final understanding. There are 3 factors that can influence his or her perceptions: experience, motivational state and finally emotional state. In different motivational or emotional states, the perceiver will react to or perceive something in different ways. Also in different situations he or she might employ a "perceptual defence" where they tend to "see what they want to see".
# The Target. This is the person who is being perceived or judged. "Ambiguity or lack of information about a target leads to a greater need for interpretation and addition."
# The Situation also greatly influences perceptions because different situations may call for additional information about the target.

Stimuli are not necessarily translated into a percept and rarely does a single stimulus translate into a percept. An ambiguous stimulus may be translated into multiple percepts, experienced randomly, one at a time, in what is called ''[[multistable perception]]''. And the same stimuli, or absence of them, may result in different percepts depending on subject's culture and previous experiences. Ambiguous figures demonstrate that a single stimulus can result in more than one percept; for example the [[Rubin vase]] which can be interpreted either as a vase or as two faces. The percept can bind sensations from multiple senses into a whole. A picture of a talking person on a television screen, for example, is bound to the sound of speech from speakers to form a percept of a talking person. "'''Percept'''" is also a term used by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz' ''Monadology''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bergson]], [[Deleuze]], and [[Guattari]]&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari's ''What is Philosophy?''&lt;/ref&gt; to define perception independent from perceivers.

==Reality==
In the case of visual perception, some people can actually see the percept shift in their [[mind's eye]].&lt;ref name=Wettlaufer2003&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wettlaufer | first = Alexandra K. | year = 2003 | title = In the mind's eye : the visual impulse in Diderot, Baudelaire and Ruskin, pg. 257 | isbn = 90-420-1035-5 | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, who are not [[Picture thinking|picture thinkers]], may not necessarily perceive the 'shape-shifting' as their world changes. The 'esemplastic' nature has been shown by experiment: an [[ambiguous image]] has multiple interpretations on the perceptual level.

This confusing ambiguity of perception is exploited in human technologies such as [[camouflage]], and also in biological [[mimicry]], for example by [[European peacock|European peacock butterflies]], whose wings bear [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] that birds respond to as though they were the eyes of a dangerous predator.

There is also evidence that the brain in some ways operates on a slight "delay", to allow nerve impulses from distant parts of the body to be integrated into simultaneous signals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 The Secret Advantage Of Being Short] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521081301/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104183551 |date=21 May 2009 }} by Robert Krulwich.

Perception is one of the oldest fields in psychology. The oldest quantitative laws in psychology are [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]] – which states that the smallest noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the intensity of the reference – and [[Weber-Fechner law|Fechner's law]] which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the physical stimulus and its perceptual counterpart (for example, testing how much darker a computer screen can get before the viewer actually notices). The study of perception gave rise to the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] school of psychology, with its emphasis on [[Holism|holistic]] approach.

===Constancy===
{{main article|Subjective constancy|}}
''Perceptual constancy'' is the ability of perceptual systems to recognize the same object from widely varying sensory inputs.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt;{{rp|118–120}}&lt;ref name="AtkinsonAtkinson1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rita L.|last2=Atkinson|first2=Richard C.|last3=Smith|first3=Edward E.|title=Introduction to psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=March 1990|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0-15-543689-3|pages=177–183|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162907/http://books.google.com/books?id=Nw54PwAACAAJ|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, individual people can be recognized from views, such as frontal and profile, which form very different shapes on the retina. A coin looked at face-on makes a circular image on the retina, but when held at angle it makes an elliptical image.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt; In normal perception these are recognized as a single three-dimensional object. Without this correction process, an animal approaching from the distance would appear to gain in size.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sonderegger |first=Theo |title = Psychology |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA45 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |date=16 October 1998 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-8220-5327-9 |pages=43–46 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162741/http://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA45 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc_constancy" /&gt; One kind of perceptual constancy is ''[[color constancy]]'': for example, a white piece of paper can be recognized as such under different colors and intensities of light.&lt;ref name="enc_constancy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein|first=E.

===Grouping===
{{main article|Principles of grouping}}

[[File:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of Closure. The human brain tends to perceive complete shapes even if those forms are incomplete.]]

The ''principles of grouping'' (or ''Gestalt laws of grouping'') are a set of principles in [[psychology]], first proposed by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] to explain how humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to [[perceive]] patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are [[Principles of grouping|organized into six categories]]: ''proximity, similarity, closure, good continuation, common fate'' and ''good form''.

The principle of ''proximity'' states that, all else being equal, perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that are far apart as two separate objects. The principle of ''similarity'' states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their [[visual]] texture and resemblance. The principle of ''closure'' refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. The principle of ''good continuation'' makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. The principle of ''common fate'' groups stimuli together on the basis of their movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured. The principle of ''good form'' refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, [[color]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Peter O.

===Contrast effects===
{{main article|Contrast effect}}

A common finding across many different kinds of perception is that the perceived qualities of an object can be affected by the qualities of context. If one object is extreme on some dimension, then neighboring objects are perceived as further away from that extreme. "Simultaneous contrast effect" is the term used when stimuli are presented at the same time, whereas "successive contrast" applies when stimuli are presented one after another.&lt;ref name="Corsini2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=The dictionary of psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-58391-328-4|page=219|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162655/http://books.google.com/books?id=0uxnglHzYaoC&amp;pg=PA219|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrast effect was noted by the 17th Century philosopher [[John Locke]], who observed that lukewarm water can feel hot or cold, depending on whether the hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=Laura H. |title=Contrast in judgments of mental health |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TYn5VHp9jioC&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-91314-6 |page=1 |deadurl=no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163219/http://books.google.com/books?id=TYn5VHp9jioC&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th Century, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception, and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas.&lt;ref name="Kushner2008" /&gt; These effects shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness, but other kinds of perception, including how heavy an object feels.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Plous|first=Scott|title=The psychology of judgment and decision making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|accessdate=24 March 2011|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-050477-6|pages=38–41|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162735/http://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment found that thinking of the name "Hitler" led to subjects rating a person as more hostile.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B.|title=Social cognition: understanding self and others |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA421 |accessdate=24 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2 |page=421|deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163155/http://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA421 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was pleasant or unpleasant.&lt;ref name="Popper2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Arthur N.|title=Music Perception |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYXd3CF1_vkC&amp;pg=PA150 |accessdate=24 March 2011 |date=30 November 2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-6113-6 |page=150 |deadurl=no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163046/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZYXd3CF1_vkC&amp;pg=PA150 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to be similar to each other: a television reporter can seem smaller when interviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tall building.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"/&gt; In the brain, brightness contrast exerts effects on both neuronal firing rates and neuronal synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biederlack|first1=J.|first2=M.|last2=Castelo-Branco |first3=S.|last3=Neuenschwander|first4=D.W.|last4=Wheeler|first5= W.|last5=Singer|first6=D.|last6=Nikolić |year=2006 |title=Brightness induction: Rate enhancement and neuronal synchronization as complementary codes |journal=Neuron |volume=52 |pages=1073–1083 |doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.012 |pmid=17178409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of experience==
{{main article|Perceptual learning}}

With experience, [[organism]]s can learn to make finer perceptual distinctions, and learn new kinds of categorization. Wine-tasting, the reading of X-ray images and music appreciation are applications of this process in the [[human]] sphere. [[Research]] has focused on the relation of this to other kinds of [[learning]], and whether it takes place in peripheral [[sensory perception|sensory]] systems or in the brain's processing of sense information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sumner|first=Meghan|title=The Effect of Experience on the Perception and Representation of Dialect Variants|work=Journal of Memory and Language|publisher=Elsevier Inc., 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2015 |url = http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202011511/http://web.stanford.edu/~sumner/Publications/2009_Sumner_JML.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Empirical]] [[research]] show that specific practices (such as [[yoga]], [[mindfulness]], [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]], [[meditation]], Daoshi and other mind-body disciplines) can modify human perceptual modality. Specifically, these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external (exteroceptive field) towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals ([[proprioception]]). Also, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent [[yoga]] practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Increasing self-transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fiori| first1=Francesca |last2=David|first2=Nicole |last3=Aglioti|first3=Salvatore Maria|title=Processing of proprioceptive and vestibular body signals and self-transcendence in Ashtanga yoga practitioners|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |date=2014|volume=8 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734|url=http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/Abstract.aspx?s=537&amp;name=human_neuroscience&amp;ART_DOI=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'' or just ''set'' is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Weiten|first=Wayne|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163032/http://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of how perception can be shaped by "top-down" processes such as drives and expectations.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171–172|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162432/http://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"/&gt; They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|title=Beginning Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24–27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163023/http://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as "sael". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as "seal", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as "sail".&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

Sets can be created by [[motivation]] and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous figures so that they see what they want to see.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"/&gt; For instance, how someone perceives what unfolds during a sports game can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams.&lt;ref name="BlockYuker2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=J.

They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"/&gt;

Perceptual set has been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as "warm" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word "warm" is replaced by "cold".{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience is more likely to find them amusing.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt; Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;

One classic psychological experiment showed slower reaction times and less accurate answers when a deck of [[playing cards]] reversed the color of the [[Suit (cards)|suit]] symbol for some cards (e.g. red spades and black hearts).&lt;ref&gt;"On the Perception of Incongruity: A Paradigm" by Jerome S. Bruner and Leo Postman. ''Journal of Personality'', 18, pp. 206-223. 1949.

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] explains that perception, although it occurs quickly, is not simply a bottom-up process (where minute details are put together to form larger wholes). Instead, our brains use what he calls '[[predictive coding]]'. It starts with very broad constraints and expectations for the state of the world, and as expectations are met, it makes more detailed predictions (errors lead to new predictions, or [[learning]] processes). Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely "unbiased, unfiltered" perception, but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|title= Predictive Coding|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205173145/http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|archivedate= 5 December 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Indeed, predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference-making process about the physical world, such as with perceptual constancy examples.

==Theories==

===Perception as direct perception===
[[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitive theories]] of perception assume there is a poverty of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. This (with reference to perception) is the claim that [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] are, by themselves, unable to provide a unique description of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, James V. (2012): "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HZf6AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vision and Brain: How we perceive the world]", Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 155-178.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensations require 'enriching', which is the role of the mental model. A different type of theory is the perceptual [[Ecological psychology|ecology]] approach of [[James J. Gibson]]. Gibson rejected the assumption of a [[poverty of stimulus]] by rejecting the notion that perception is based upon sensations&amp;nbsp;– instead, he investigated what information is actually presented to the perceptual systems. His theory "assumes the existence of stable, unbounded, and permanent stimulus-information in the [[ambient optic array]]. And it supposes that the visual system can explore and detect this information. The theory is information-based, not sensation-based."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J. (2002): "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f594/23f1a766380ff945fc401b976618a2b2a92a.pdf A Theory of Direct Visual Perception]". In: Alva Noë/Evan Thompson (Eds.), ''Vision and Mind. Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception'', Cambridge, MIT Press, pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; He and the psychologists who work within this [[paradigm]] detailed how the world could be specified to a mobile, exploring organism via the lawful projection of information about the world into energy arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokolowski|first=Robert|title=Phenomenology of the Human Person|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521717663|pages=199–200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925011659/https://books.google.com/books?id=NIEJt5afhwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Specification" would be a 1:1 mapping of some aspect of the world into a perceptual array; given such a mapping, no enrichment is required and perception is [[direct perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Robert J.|title=James Gibson's Passive Theory of Perception: A Rejection of the Doctrine of Specific Nerve Energies|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|date=December 1976|volume=37|issue=2|pages=218–233|url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|doi=10.2307/2107193|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613180128/http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/richards/James%20Gibson's%20Passive%20Theory%20of%20Perception.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception-in-action===
An ecological understanding of perception derived from Gibson's early work is that of "perception-in-action", the notion that perception is a requisite property of animate action; that without perception, action would be unguided, and without action, perception would serve no purpose. Animate actions require both perception and motion, and perception and movement can be described as "two sides of the same coin, the coin is action". Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities, which he calls "invariants", already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is to home in upon them. A view known as [[Constructive perception|constructivism]] (held by such philosophers as [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]]) regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the "entity", which is therefore far from being invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Consciousness in Action, S. L. Hurley, illustrated, Harvard University Press, 2002, 0674007964, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glasersfeld considers an "invariant" as a target to be homed in upon, and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve. The invariant does not and need not represent an actuality, and Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or [[fear processing in the brain|feared]] by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on. This [[social constructionist]] theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London: RoutledgeFalmer; Poerksen, Bernhard (ed.) (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-_EsHHxHYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Certainty of Uncertainty: Dialogues Introducing Constructivism],'' Exeter: Imprint Academic; Wright. Edmond (2005). ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A mathematical theory of perception-in-action has been devised and investigated in many forms of controlled movement, and has been described in many different species of organism using the [[General Tau Theory]]. According to this theory, tau information, or time-to-goal information is the fundamental 'percept' in perception.

===Evolutionary psychology (EP) and perception===
Many philosophers, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 4, pp. 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects, with larger animals making and hearing lower-frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher-frequency sounds.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4" /&gt; Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prospagnosia).&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt; EP suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 4"/&gt;

===Closed-loop perception===
Here perception is proposed to be a dynamic motor-sensory closed-loop process in which information flows through the environment and the brain in continuous loops&lt;ref name="Dewey1"&gt; Dewey, J.

==Physiology==
{{main article|Sensory system}}
A ''sensory system'' is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing [[sense|sensory]] information. A sensory system consists of [[sensory receptor]]s, [[neural pathway]]s, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for [[vision (sense)|vision]], [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[somatic sensation]] (touch), [[taste]] and [[olfaction]] (smell). It has been suggested that the immune system is an overlooked sensory modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bedford|first=F. L. | year = 2011 | title = The missing sensory modality: the immune system | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 40 | issue = 10| pages = 1265–1267 | doi = 10.1068/p7119|pmid=22308900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, senses are [[transducers]] from the physical world to the realm of the mind.

The [[receptive field]] is the specific part of the world to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; the light that each [[Rod cell|rod]] or [[Cone cell|cone]] can see, is its receptive field.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw: ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Receptive fields have been identified for the [[visual system]], [[auditory system]] and [[somatosensory system]], so far.
Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes, but also to "Interoception", considered as the process of receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals. Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism’s well being and survival. Interoception is an iterative process, requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self-regulation. Afferent sensory signals continuously interact with higher order cognitive representations of goals, history, and environment, shaping emotional experience and motivating regulatory behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farb N. |author2=Daubenmier J. |author3=Price C.

==Types==

===Vision===
{{main article|Visual perception}}

In many ways, vision is the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused in a way which sorts it on the retina according to direction of origin. A dense surface of photosensitive cells, including rods, cones, and [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells]] captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain. In total, about 15 differing types of information are then forwarded to the brain proper via the optic nerve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Eye Smarter than Scientists Believed: Neural Computations in Circuits of the Retina | first1=Tim|last1=Gollisch|first2=Markus|last2=Meister | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages=150–164 | date= 28 January 2010 | journal = Neuron | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.12.009| pmid=20152123| pmc=3717333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
[[File:Anatomy of the Human Ear en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of the human ear. (The length of the auditory canal is exaggerated in this image)]]
{{main article|Hearing (sense)}}
Hearing (or ''audition'') is the ability to perceive [[sound]] by detecting [[vibration]]s. Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called [[Audio frequency|audio]] or ''sonic''. The range is typically considered to be between 20&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | title = Frequency Range of Human Hearing | work = The Physics Factbook | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090921163910/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml | archivedate = 21 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]], while frequencies below audio are referred to as [[infrasound|infrasonic]]. The [[auditory system]] includes the [[ear|outer ears]] which collect and filter sound waves, the [[ear|middle ear]] for transforming the sound pressure ([[impedance matching]]), and the [[ear|inner ear]] which produces neural signals in response to the sound. By the ascending [[auditory pathway]] these are led to the [[primary auditory cortex]] within the [[temporal lobe]] of the human brain, which is where the auditory information arrives in the [[cerebral cortex]] and is further processed there.

Sound does not usually come from a single source: in real situations, sounds from multiple sources and directions are superimposed as they arrive at the ears. Hearing involves the computationally complex task of separating out the sources of interest, often estimating their distance and direction as well as identifying them.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy" /&gt;

===Touch===
{{main article|Haptic perception}}

''Haptic perception'' is the process of recognizing objects through touch. It involves a combination of [[somatosensory]] perception of patterns on the skin surface (e.g., edges, curvature, and texture) and [[proprioception]] of hand position and conformation. People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klatzky|first1=R. L.|last2=Lederman|first2=S. J.|last3=Metzger|first3=V.

J.|last2=Klatzky|first2=R. L. |year=1987 |title=Hand movements: A window into haptic object recognition |journal=Cognitive Psychology |issue=3 |pages=342–368 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(87)90008-9 |volume=19 |pmid=3608405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.&lt;ref name=Robles-de-la-torre2001&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Robles-de-la-torre | first1 = Gabriel | last2 = Hayward | first2 = Vincent | year = 2001 | title = Force can overcome object geometry in the perception of shape through active touch | journal = Nature | pmid = 11473320 | volume = 412 | issue = 6845 | pages = 445–448 | doi = 10.1038/35086588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson defined the haptic system as "The sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=J.J. |year=1966 |title=The senses considered as perceptual systems. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-313-23961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson and others emphasized the close link between haptic perception and body movement: haptic perception is active exploration. The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of [[extended physiological proprioception]] according to which, when using a tool such as a stick, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.

===Taste===
{{main article|Taste}}

Taste (or, the more formal term, ''gustation'') is the ability to perceive the [[flavor]] of substances including, but not limited to, [[food]]. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called ''[[taste bud]]s'', or ''gustatory calyculi'', concentrated on the upper surface of the [[tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 Human biology (Page 201/464)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102150409/https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC&amp;lpg=PA201 |date=2 January 2017 }} Daniel D.

''Social perception'' is the part of perception that allows people to understand the individuals and groups of their social world, and thus an element of [[social cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Smith, D. M. Mackie (2000). ''Social Psychology''. Psychology Press, 2nd ed., p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speech====
{{main article|Speech perception}}
[[File:Spectrogram of I owe you.png|right|thumb|Though the phrase "I owe you" can be heard as three distinct words, a [[spectrogram]] reveals no clear boundaries.]]
''Speech perception'' is the process by which spoken languages are heard, interpreted and understood. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. The sound of a word can vary widely according to words around it and the tempo of the speech, as well as the physical characteristics, [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] and mood of the speaker. Listeners manage to perceive words across this wide range of different conditions. Another variation is that [[reverberation]] can make a large difference in sound between a word spoken from the far side of a room and the same word spoken up close. Experiments have shown that people automatically compensate for this effect when hearing speech.&lt;ref name="eop_constancy"&gt;{{cite book|first=Brian C.

The process of perceiving speech begins at the level of the sound within the auditory signal and the process of [[Hearing (sense)|audition]]. The initial auditory signal is compared with visual information — primarily lip movement — to extract acoustic cues and phonetic information. It is possible other sensory modalities are integrated at this stage as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Lawrence D.|last=Rosenblum | editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Pisoni|editor2-first=Robert|editor2-last=Remez | chapter = Primacy of Multimodal Speech Perception | page = 51 | title = The Handbook of Speech Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EwY15naRiFgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22Primacy+of+Multimodal+Speech+Perception%22&amp;ots=0OZ7x69V2R&amp;sig=EqQJlEfphDzrJA32aI1DD4Ku50I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Primacy%20of%20Multimodal%20Speech%20Perception%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This speech information can then be used for higher-level language processes, such as word recognition.

Speech perception is not necessarily uni-directional. That is, higher-level language processes connected with [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], or [[semantics]] may interact with basic speech perception processes to aid in recognition of speech sounds.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} It may be the case that it is not necessary and maybe even not possible for a listener to recognize phonemes before recognizing higher units, like words for example. In one experiment, Richard M. Warren replaced one phoneme of a word with a cough-like sound. His subjects restored the missing speech sound perceptually without any difficulty and what is more, they were not able to identify accurately which phoneme had been disturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren|first=R.

====Faces====
{{main article|Face perception}}
''Facial perception'' refers to cognitive processes specialized for handling human faces, including perceiving the identity of an individual, and facial expressions such as emotional cues.

====Social touch====
{{main article | Somatosensory system#Neural processing of social touch}}
The somatosensory cortex encodes incoming sensory information from receptors all over the body. [[Affective touch]] is a type of sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature, such as a physical human touch. This type of information is actually coded differently than other sensory information. Intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex, but the feeling of pleasantness associated with affective touch activates the anterior cingulate cortex more than the primary somatosensory cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data shows that increased blood oxygen level contrast (BOLD) signal in the anterior cingulate cortex as well as the prefrontal cortex is highly correlated with pleasantness scores of an affective touch. Inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits the perception of affective touch intensity, but not affective touch pleasantness. Therefore, the S1 is not directly involved in processing socially affective touch pleasantness, but still plays a role in discriminating touch location and intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27225773 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1130-15.2016 | pmc=4879201 | volume=36 | title=Encoding of Touch Intensity But Not Pleasantness in Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex | journal=J Neurosci | pages=5850–60 | last1 = Case | first1 = LK | last2 = Laubacher | first2 = CM | last3 = Olausson | first3 = H | last4 = Wang | first4 = B | last5 = Spagnolo | first5 = PA | last6 = Bushnell | first6 = MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other senses===
{{main article|Sense}}
Other senses enable perception of body balance, acceleration, gravity, position of body parts, temperature, pain, time, and perception of internal senses such as suffocation, gag reflex, intestinal distension, fullness of rectum and urinary bladder, and sensations felt in the throat and lungs.

'''Personnel selection''' is the methodical process used to hire (or, less commonly, [[promotion (rank)|promote]]) individuals. Although the term can apply to all aspects of the process ([[recruitment]], selection, hiring, acculturation, etc.) the most common meaning focuses on the selection of workers. In this respect, selected prospects are separated from rejected applicants with the intention of choosing the person who will be the most successful and make the most valuable contributions to the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky&gt;Muchinsky, P. (2012). ''Psychology Applied to Work'', (10th ed.). Summerfield, N
klu
C: Hypergraphic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Its effect on the group is discerned when the selected accomplish their desired impact to the group, through achievement or tenure. The procedure of selection takes after strategy to gather data around a person so as to figure out whether that individual ought to be utilized. The strategies used must be in compliance with the various laws in respect to work force selection.

==Overview==
The professional standards of [[industrial psychology|industrial-organizational psychologists]] (I-O psychologists) require that any selection system be based on a [[job analysis]] to ensure that the selection criteria are job-related. The requirements for a selection system are characteristics known as KSAOs – knowledge, skills, ability, and other characteristics. US law also recognizes ''[[bona fide occupational qualifications]]'' (BFOQs), which are requirements for a job which would be considered discriminatory if not necessary – such as only employing men as wardens of maximum-security male prisons, enforcing a mandatory retirement age for airline pilots, or a religious college only employing professors of its religion to teach its theology.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates and involve both the newly hired and those individuals who can be promoted from within the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

In this respect, selection of personnel has "validity" if an unmistakable relationship can be shown between the system itself and the employment for which the people are ultimately being chosen for. In this way, a vital piece of selection is Job Analysis. An analysis is typically conducted before, and regularly apart of, the improvement in determination systems. Then again, a selection method may be deemed valid after it has already been executed by directing follow up job analysis and demonstrating the relationship between the selection process and the respective job.&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

The procedure of personnel selection includes gathering data about the potential candidates with the end goal of deciding suitability and sustainability for the employment in that particular job. This data is gathered utilizing one or more determination devices or strategies classified as such:&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt; 
* Interviews
* Personality Tests
* Biographical Data
* Cognitive Ability Tests
* Physical Ability Tests
* Work Samples
Development and implementation of such screening methods is sometimes done by human resources departments; larger organizations hire consultants or firms that specialize in developing personnel selection systems. I-O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance, evidence that bears on the validity of selection tools. These procedures are usually validated (shown to be job relevant), using one or more of the following types of [[validity (statistics)|validity]]: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]].&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

==History and development==
[[Imperial examination|Chinese civil servant exams]], established in AD 605, may be the first documented "modern" selection tests, and have influenced subsequent examination systems.&lt;ref&gt;

As a scientific and scholarly field, personnel selection owes much to [[psychometric]] theory and the art of integrating selection systems falls to [[human resources|human resource professionals]].

In the [[United States of America]], members of the [http://www.siop.org Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP)] conduct much of the research on selection. Primary research topics include:

* the practicality, reliability, validity, and utility of various forms of selection measures
* methods for demonstrating return on investment for selection systems
* assessing fairness and making selection systems as fair as possible
* legal issues&amp;mdash;such as [[disparate treatment]] and [[disparate impact]]&amp;mdash;and overall compliance with laws
* the generalizability of validity across different work contexts
* alternative methods of demonstrating validity, such as synthetic validity&lt;ref&gt;Steel, P. (2006).

== Validity and reliability ==
=== Validity of interviews ===
The validity of interviews describes how useful interviews are in predicting job performance. In one of the most comprehensive meta-analytic summary to date by Weisner and Cronshaw (1988). The authors investigated interview validity as a function of interview format (individual vs board) and degree of structure( structure vs unstructured). Results of this study showed that structured interviews yielded much higher mean corrected validities than unstructured interviews (0.63 vs 0.20), and  structured board interviews using consensus ratings had the highest corrected validity (0.64).

In&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews|last = McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's|first = |date = 1994|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology Vol.79. No. 4, 599 – 616.|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's  Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews (1994) paper, the authors go a step further and  include an examination of the validity of three different types of interview content(situational, job-related, and psychological).Their goal was to explore the possibility that validity is a function of the type of content collected.

They define the three kinds of content as follows – situational content was described as interview questions that get information on how the interviewee would behave in specific situations presented by the interviewer. For example, a question that asks whether the interviewee would choose to report a coworker for behaving in an unethical way or just let them go. Job related questions, on the other hand, assess the interviewee's past behavior and job-related information. While psychological interviews include questions intended to assess the interviewee's personality traits such as their work ethic, dependability, honesty etc.

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of all previous studies on the validity of interviews across the three types of  content mentioned above. Their results show that for job-performance criteria, situational interviews yield higher mean validity(0.50) than do job-related interviews(0.39) which yield a higher mean validity than do psychology interviews(0.29). This means that when the interview is used to predict job performance, it is best to conduct situational interviews rather than job-related or psychological interviews. On the other hand, when interviews are used to predict an applicant's training performance, the mean validity of job-related interviews(0.36) is somewhat lower than the mean validity of psychological interviews(0.40).

Going beyond the content of the interview, the authors' analysis of interview validity was extended to include an assessment of how the interview was conducted. Here, two questions emerged – Are structured interviews more valid than unstructured interviews ? and are board interviews( with more than one interviewer) more valid than individual interviews.

Their answer  to the first question – Are structured interviews more valid unstructured interviews was that structured interviews, regardless of content, is more valid(0.44) than unstructured interviews(0.33) in predicting job performance criteria. However, when training performance is the criteria, the validity of structured and unstructured interviews are similar (0.34 and 0.36).

As for the validity of board interviews versus individual interviews, the researchers conducted another meta-analyses comparing the validity of board interviews and individual interviews for job performance criteria. The results show that individual interviews are more valid than board interviews( 0.43 vs 0.32). This is true regardless of whether the individual interview is structured or unstructured.

When exploring the variance in interview validity between job performance, training performance, and tenure criteria, the researchers found that the interviews are similar in predictive accuracy for job-performance and training performance( 0.37 vs 0.36). But less predictive for tenure (0.20).

=== Validity of cognitive ability and personality tests ===
Based on meta-analysis results, cognitive ability tests appear to be among the most valid of all psychological tests and are valid for most occupations. However, these tests tend to do better at predicting training criteria than long term job performance. Cognitive ability tests in general provide the benefit of being generalizable. Hence they can be used across organizations and jobs and have been shown to produce large economic gains for companies that use them (Gatewood &amp; Feild, 1998; Heneman et al., 2000).

But despite the high validity of cognitive testing, it is less frequently used as selection tools. One main reason is that cognitive ability testing has been demonstrated to produce adverse impact. In general, groups including Hispanics and African-Americans score lower than the general population while other groups including Asian – Americans score higher (Heneman et al., 2000; Lubenski, 1995). The legal issues with cognitive ability testing were amplified by the supreme court's ruling in the famous 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power case. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that when a selection test produces adverse impact against protected group members the company must be able to defend it by showing that use of the test is a "business necessity" for the operation of the business. The courts have held narrow interpretations of business necessity that require companies to show that no other acceptable selection alternative exists (Sovereign, 1999). As a result, many companies abandoned cognitive ability testing ( Steven L. Thomas &amp;Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

While the utility of cognitive ability testing in selection has been broadly accepted, the utility of personality testing, until relatively recently, has not. Historically, research documenting the low predictive validity and the potential for invasion of privacy based on item content has made its application as selection instruments questionable (Hogan, Hogan, &amp; Roberts, 1996).

But due to the legal challenges associated with cognitive ability, interest in personality instruments has recently been revived (Schmidt, Ones, &amp; Hunter, 1992). Some have suggested that pairing personality testing with cognitive ability testing may be one means to enhance validity while reducing adverse impact (Ryan, Ployhart, &amp; Friedel, 1998). Because it is very likely that some aspects of personality enhance individual ability to apply intellectual capacity while other personality traits limit its application (Kaufman &amp; Lichtenberger, 1999). Hence, adding a personality to an ability test should enhance validity while reducing the adverse impact of a selection system.

Recent research studies prove this assumption to be false, by showing that the addition of a predictor producing smaller group differences (i.e., personality test) to a predictor producing higher group differences (i.e., cognitive ability test) does not reduce the potential for adverse impact to the degree that is often expected (Bobko, Roth, &amp; Potosky, 1999; Schmitt, Rogers, Chan, Sheppard, &amp; Jennings, 1997).

Although the use of personality tests with measures of cognitive ability may not have the desired effects on reducing adverse impact, it appears that the addition of personality measures to measures of cognitive ability as a composite predictor results in significant incremental validity (Bobko et al., 1999; Schmitt et al.,1997). These studies found that the validity of predictor composites was highest when alternative predictors were used in combination with cognitive ability. Though this combination of predictors resulted in the highest predictive validity, the inclusion of cognitive ability with these alternative predictors increased the potential for adverse impact (Steven L. Thomas &amp; Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

In summary, cognitive ability testing by itself has been shown to have high levels of validity, but comes with issues relating to adverse impact. Personality tests, on the other hand, have historically been proven to have low validity due to the lack of a common understanding on what constitutes personality, and the non-standardized measures available. But a growing number of research  studies show that the best way for organizations to achieve close to optimal validity and job performance prediction, is to create a predictor composite that includes a measure of cognitive ability and an additional measure such as a personality test.

==Predictor validity and selection ratio==
Two major factors determine the quality of newly hired employees, [[predictive validity|predictor validity]] and [[selection ratio]].&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; The predictor cutoff is a test score differentiating those passing a selection measure from those who did not. People above this score are hired or are further considered while those below it are not.

The selection ratio (SR), on the other hand is the number of job openings [[statistical sample|''n'']] divided by the number of job applicants ''N''. This value will range between 0 and 1, reflecting the selectivity of the organization's hiring practices. When the SR is equal to 1 or greater, the use of any selection device has little meaning, but this is not often the case as there are usually more applicants than job openings. Finally, the [[base rate]] is defined by the percentage of employees thought to be performing their jobs satisfactorily following measurement.

==Selection decisions==
Tests designed to determine an individual's aptitude for a particular position, company or industry may be referred to as personnel assessment tools. Such tests can aid those charged with hiring personnel in both selecting individuals for hire and in placing new hires in the appropriate positions. They vary in the measurements they use and level of standardization they employ, though all are subject to error.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration. (1999) "Chapter 1: Personnel Assessment." pp. 1-7 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych304-3.1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictors for selection always have less than perfect validity and scatter plots, as well as other forecasting methods such as judgmental bootstrapping, and index models can help us to refine a prediction model as well as identify any mistakes.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J. Scott|last2=others|date=2012|title=Predicting job performance: The moneyball factor|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/254416540_Predicting_Job_Performance_The_Moneyball_Factor/links/0046352826eef7b0cc000000.pdf|journal=Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting|volume=25|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion cutoff is the point separating successful and unsuccessful performers according to a standard set by the hiring organization. [[Type I and type II errors|True positives]] are applied those thought to succeed on the job as a result of having passed the selection test and who have, in fact, performed satisfactorily. True negatives describe those who were correctly rejected based on the measure because they would not be successful employees.

False negatives occur when people are rejected as a result of selection test failure, but would have performed well on the job anyway.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Finally, false positives are applied to individuals who are selected for having passed the selection measure, but do not make successful employees. These selection errors can be minimized by increasing the validity of the predictor test.

Standards for determination of the cutoff score vary widely, but should be set to be consistent with the expectations of the relevant job.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Adjusting the cutoff in either direction will automatically increase the error in the other. Thus, it is important to determine which type of error is more harmful on a case-by-case basis.

Banding is another method for setting cutoff values.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campion, M. A., Outtz, J. L., Zedeck, S., Schmidt, F. L., Kehoe, J. F., Murphy, K. R., &amp; Guion, R. M. (2001). [http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/campionm/Controversy_Score_Banding.pdf The controversy over score banding in personnel selection: Answers to 10 key questions]. ''Personnel Psychology'', '''54(1)''', 149–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Some differences in test scores are ignored as applicants whose scores fall with in the same band (or, range) are selected not on the basis of individual scores, but of another factor spas to reduce adverse impact. The width of the band itself is a function of test reliability, the two being negatively correlated. Banding allows employers to ignore test scores altogether by using random selection, and many have criticized the technique for this reason.

==Predicting job performance==
A meta-analysis of selection methods in personnel psychology found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of [[job performance]] and training performance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F. L. &amp; Hunter, J. E. (1998). [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1998-10661-006&amp;CFID=5257837&amp;CFTOKEN=93267042 The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', '''124(2)''', 262-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding interview procedures, there are data which put into question these tools for selecting employees.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, M. A., Whetzel, D. L., Schmidt, F. L., &amp; Maurer, S. D. (1994).[http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Publications/McDaniel_Whetzel_Schmidt_Maurer%20(1994).pdf The validity of employment interview: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79(4)''', 599-616.&lt;/ref&gt; While the aim of a job interview is ostensibly to choose a candidate who will perform well in the job role, other methods of selection provide greater predictive power and often entail lower costs. Unstructured interviews are commonly used, but structured interviews tend to yield better outcomes and are considered a better practice.&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I. (2010). [http://www.xavier.edu/appliedhrmresearch/2010-Winter/Article_8_Huffcutt_Seven%20Principles.pdf From science to practice: Seven principles for conducting employment interviews]. ''Applied H.R.M. Research'', '''12''', 121-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interview structure is defined as "the reduction in procedural variance across applicants, which can translate into the degree of discretion that an interviewer is allowed in conducting the interview."&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I., &amp; Hunter, W. Jr. (1994). [http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/PSYC%20651/Huffcutt%20&amp;%20Arthur%20(1994)%20Interview.pdf Hunter &amp; Hunter revisited: Interview validity for entry-level jobs]. '' Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79''', 184-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure in an interview can be compared to a typical paper and pencil test: we would not think it was fair if every test taker were given different questions and a different number of questions on an exam, or if their answers were each graded differently. Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; thus, a structured interview attempts to standardize this popular selection tool.

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have also been conducted to look at the relationship between [[organizational citizenship behavior| organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)]] and organizational performance and success.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Podsakoff&gt;Podsakoff, N. P., Whiting, S. W., Podsakoff, P. M., &amp; Mishra, P. (2011). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=apl-96-2-310&amp;site=ehost-live Effects of organizational citizenship behaviors on selection decisions in employment interviews]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''96(2)''', 310-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Job candidates exhibiting higher levels of helping, voice, and loyalty behaviors were generally rated as more confident, received higher salaries, and received higher salary recommendations than job candidates exhibiting these behaviors to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name=Podsakoff/&gt; This was found to be true even candidate responses regarding task performance were taken into account. Finally, content analyses of open-ended question responses indicated selection decisions were highly sensitive to candidates with low expression of voice and helping behaviors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">The '''Rio Declaration on Environment and Development''', often shortened to '''Rio Declaration''', was a short document produced at the 1992 [[United Nations]] "Conference on Environment and Development" (UNCED), informally known as the [[Earth Summit]]. The Rio Declaration consisted of 27 principles intended to guide countries in future [[sustainable development]]. It was signed by over 170 countries.

==History==
The international community met twice to assess the progress made in implementing the principles of the document; first in New York in 1997 during a General Assembly Session of the UN, and then in [[Johannesburg]] in 2002. While the document helped to raise environmental awareness, evidence shows that little has been achieved in the document's environmental goals.&lt;ref name="Robbins2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Palmer |first1=Robert |last2=Nursey-Bray |first2=Melissa |editor1-last=Robbins |editor1-first=Paul |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society |volume=4 |date=2007 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |isbn=9781412927611 |pages=1512–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The Rio Declaration proclaims 27 principles. It includes formulations of the [[precautionary principle]] (principle 15) and of the [[polluter pays principle]] (principle 16).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4573">'''Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction''' ('''SIGCHI''') is the one of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s special interest groups which is focused on [[human–computer interaction]]s (HCI).

It hosts the major annual international HCI conference, [[CHI (conference)|CHI]], with around 2,500 attendees, and publishes ''[[ACM Interactions]]'' and ''[[ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction]]'' (TOCHI).

SIGCHI was formed in 1982 by renaming and refocusing the Special Interest Group on Social and Behavioral Computing (SIGSOC); [[Lorraine Borman]], previously editor of the ''[[SIGSOC Bulletin]]'', was its first chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=SIGCHI: The Early Years|first=Lorraine|last=Borman|authorlink=Lorraine Borman|journal=SIGCHI Bulletin|date=January 1996|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://old.sigchi.org/bulletin/1996.1/borman.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

SIGCHI has two membership publications, the ''[[SIGCHI Bulletin]]'' and ''ACM Interactions''.

==Awards==
Each year SIGCHI inducts around 7 or 8 people into the [[CHI Academy]], honoring them for their significant contribution to the field of human–computer interaction.  It also gives out a CHI Lifetime Achievement Award for research and practice, the CHI Lifetime Service Award, and the CHI Social Impact Award.

'''''Science &amp; Spirit''''' is a discontinued American bimonthly magazine that covered scientific stories with an eye toward their spiritual implications. 

==History and profile==

'''''Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik''''' is a book on the history of [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] by the Austrian [[art history|art historian]] [[Alois Riegl]]. It was published in [[Berlin]] in 1893. The English translation renders the title as ''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'', although this has been criticized by some.{{efn|For example, Benjamin Binstock, "Alois Riegl, Monumental Ruin," in A. Riegl, ''Historical Grammar of the Visual Arts'' (New York, 2004), p.35 n.28: "Evelyn Kain's translation of what she strangely calls ''Problems of Style'' is unsatisfactory; it is not simply a question (or problem) of style." See also Kathryn Brush's review of the translation, ''Art Bulletin'' 74 (1994), p. 355: "Riegl wrote ''Stilfragen'', or ''Questions of style'' (curiously entitled ''Problems of Style'' in the 1992 English translation) during the 1890s...."}} It has been called "the one great book ever written about the history of ornament."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Gombrich, ''The sense of order'' (London, 1984), 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riegl wrote the ''Stilfragen'' while employed as director of the textile department at what was then the Österreichisches Museum für Kunst und Industrie (today the [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|Museum für angewandte Kunst]]) in [[Vienna]]. His primary intention was to argue that it was possible to write a continuous history of ornament. This position is argued in explicit opposition to that of the "technical-materialist" school, according to which "all art forms were always the direct products of materials and techniques"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and that ornamental "motifs originated spontaneously throughout the world at a number of different locations."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Riegl associates this view with the followers of [[Gottfried Semper]], who had advanced a related argument in his ''Der Stil in den technischen Künsten; oder praktischer Ästhetik'' (''Style in the technical arts; or practical [[aesthetics]]'', 1878-79). However, Riegl consistently disassociates Semper's followers from Semper himself, writing that

{{quote|The theory of the technical, materialist origin of the earliest ornaments is usually attributed to Gottfried Semper. This association is, however, no more justified than the one made between contemporary Darwinism and Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the technical-materialist position had attained the status of dogma, Riegl stated that "the most pressing problem that confronts historians of the decorative arts today is to reintegrate the historical thread that has been served into a thousand pieces."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he argued for a continuous development of ornament from ancient Egyptian through Greek and Roman and up to early Islamic and, eventually, Ottoman art.

==Contents==
[[File:Flickr - jemasmith - Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Detail..jpg|thumb|Stone relief with [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] of tendrils, [[palmette]]s and half-palmettes in the [[Umayyad Mosque]], [[Damascus]]]]

The ''Stilfragen'' is divided into an introduction, which sets out the purpose of the work, and four chapters, each on a theme in the history of artistic style.

The first chapter, "The Geometric Style," argues that geometric ornament originated, not from such technical processes as wickerwork and weaving, but rather from an "immanent artistic drive, alert and restless for action, that human beings possessed long before they invented woven protective coverings for their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported this position through an analysis of geometric ornament in [[Stone Age]] European art, in particular objects that had recently been discovered in the [[Dordogne]]. This ornament, he argued, developed from attempts to represent natural forms in two dimensions, which gave rise to the idea of an outline. After this "invention of line," the cave-dwellers proceeded to arrange lines "according to the principles of rhythm and symmetry."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter, "The Heraldic Style," addresses compositions of "paired animals arranged symmetrically to either side of an intervening central element."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of decoration had been associated by previous scholars, most notably [[Ernst Curtius]], with the technical demands of [[silk]]-weaving. Riegl argued instead that heraldic ornament arose before the invention of mechanical weaving-looms, and stemmed from a desire for symmetry.

The third chapter, "The Introduction of Vegetal Ornament and the Development of the Ornamental Tendril," traces an unbroken evolution of vegetal ornament from ancient Egyptian through to late [[Roman art]]. Here Riegl argues that motifs such as the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]], although they may originally have been endowed by the Egyptians with symbolic significance, were adopted by other cultures that "no longer understood their hieratic meaning,"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby became purely decorative. In the most famous section of this chapter, Riegl argued that [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus ornament]] was not derived from the [[Acanthus (genus)|acanthus plant]], as had been believed since the time of [[Vitruvius]], but was rather a sculptural adaptation of the [[palmette]] motif. It was therefore "a product of pure artistic invention,"&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; and not of "a simple compulsion to make direct copies of living organisms."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth chapter, "The [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]]," continues the development of the previous chapter through late antique and early [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and into [[Islamic art]]. The arabesque is  understood here as a geometricized version of earlier systems of tendril ornament, thereby establishing a "genetic relationship between the ornamental Islamic tendril and its direct predecessor, the tendril ornament of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The final two chapters are therefore presented as a continuous history of vegetal ornament from ancient Egypt through to Ottoman Turkey, in which individual motifs develop according to purely artistic criteria, and not through the intervention of technical or mimetic concerns. In the introduction it is suggested that this development could be continued to Riegl's own time, and that "ornament experiences the same continuous, coherent development that prevails in the art of all periods."&lt;ref&gt;''Problems of style'', tr. Kain, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

The ''Stilfragen'' remains a fundamental work in the history of ornament, and has heavily influenced the work of [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Ernst Gombrich]], among others who have addressed the same themes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jessica Rawson|Rawson, Jessica]], ''Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon'', pp. 24-25, 1984, British Museum Publications, {{ISBN|0714114316}}. Rawson's Appendix, pp. 199-222, summarizes the early history of flower ornament around the Mediterranean: "Details of the present description differ from Riegl's analysis; however the general outline proposed follows his fascinating account" (p. 199)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Riegl's work as a whole, the ''Stilfragen'' constitutes his earliest general statement of principles, although his "theoretical thinking had not by any means reached maturity."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Zerner, "Preface," ''Problems of style'', xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; By severing stylistic development from external influences, such as technical procedures or a desire to imitate nature, Riegl raised an extremely complicated set of questions regarding the actual source and significance of stylistic change. As [[Otto Pächt]] has written:

{{quote|In the picture that Riegl draws of the development the changes of style are meaningful in a specific way; continuity is not merely carrying on; every stylistic phase creates its own problems which are solved in the succeeding one, only to create new conflicts for which new answers have to be found. Thus the styles change of necessity, or to put it differently: in a kind of 'retrospective prophecy' the art historian shows that artistic development was compelled to move in the direction in which in fact it did. A view with most serious implications. One of them was that if one viewed art history in this way, absolute aesthetic norms became obsolete and had to be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Pächt, "Art historians and art critics, vi: Alois Riegl," ''The Burlington Magazine'' 105 (1963), 189.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus the concerns of the ''Stilfragen'' led directly into those of Riegl's next major study, the ''Spätrömische Kunstindustrie'' (''Late Roman art industry'', 1901), in which he approached style change in [[late antiquity]] not as a symptom of decline, but as the result of positive artistic concerns.

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.

==Architecture and planning==
A group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the [[Bay Area]], founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of [[architects]], one from [[San Francisco]] and the other from the [[University of California]], Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM ([[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]]) and MARS ([[MARS Group|Modern Architectural Research Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Chermayeff|Chermayeff, Serge]], "Telesis: The Birth of a Group." ''New Pencil Points'' (July 1942), pp.&amp;nbsp;45&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic [[Lewis Mumford]] called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that "People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology."—from ''The Things Telesis Has Found Important''

Noted Telesis members included [[William Wurster]], [[Catherine Bauer Wurster]], [[Vernon DeMars]], [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Grace Morley|Grace McCann Morley]], [[Geraldine Scott|Geraldine Knight Scott]], [[Joseph Allen Stein]], Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and [[working group]]s that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the [http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/cedarchives/ Environmental Design Archives] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Sociology==

The mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.&lt;ref&gt;Outlines of Sociology, Lester F. Ward, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Telesis: Progress consciously planned and produced by intelligently directed effort.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social telesis: The intelligent direction of social activity towards the achievement of a desired and understood end.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines"&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of Sociol., p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Collective telesis: Adaptation of means to ends by society.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Ward, Outlines of SocioL, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Individual telesis: The conscious adaptation of conduct by an individual to the achievement of his own consciously apprehended ends.&lt;ref name="WardOutlines" /&gt;

==Philosophy==

Telesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as "the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.", has also been a term used in the context of [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] to refer to "infocognitive potential", a concept originating from [[Christopher Langan]] and his theory of everything, the CTMU.  In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:&lt;ref&gt;Langan, C.M. 2002. [http://www.megafoundation.org/CTMU/Articles/Langan_CTMU_092902.pdf] ''The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of Reality Theory'' pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Laws do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the objects and attributes on which they act and which they accept as parameters. Similarly, objects and attributes do not stand on their own, but must be defined with respect to the rules of structure, organization and transformation that govern them. It follows that the active medium of cross-definition possesses logical primacy over laws and arguments alike, and is thus pre-informational and pre-nomological in nature…i.e., telic. Telesis, which can be characterized as “infocognitive potential”, is the primordial active medium from which laws and their arguments and parameters emerge by mutual refinement or telic recursion.}}

'''Text, Speech and Dialogue''' ('''TSD''') is an annual conference involving topics on [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]]. The meeting is held every September alternating in [[Brno]] and [[Pilsen, Czech Republic]].

The first Text, Speech and Dialogue conference took place in [[Brno]] in 1998.

== Overview ==
TSD series evolved as a prime forum for interaction between researchers in both spoken and written language processing from all over the world. Proceedings of TSD form a book published by [[Springer-Verlag]] in their Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=Text%2C+Speech+and+Dialogue+Conference&amp;btnG=Hledat+knihy&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;hl=cs#hl=cs&amp;q=%22International+Conference%2C+TSD%22&amp;tbm=bks TSD proceedings at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;
TSD Proceedings are regularly indexed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index.  Moreover, LNAI series are listed in all major citation databases such as [[DBLP]], [[SCOPUS]], [[Ei Compendex|EI]], [[INSPEC]] or [[COMPENDEX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/?SGWID=0-102-24-0-0&amp;submit=Submit+Query&amp;sortOrder=pubdateSortdesc&amp;searchType=EASY_CDA&amp;searchScope=editions&amp;queryText=International+Conference%2C+TSD All TSD proceedings at Springer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference is organized by the Faculty of Informatics, [[Masaryk University]], [[Brno]], and the Faculty of Applied Sciences, [[University of West Bohemia]], [[Plzeň|Pilsen]].  The conference is supported by [[International Speech Communication Association]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca-speech.org ISCA webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomb of Ferdowsi''' ({{lang-fa|آرامگاه فردوسی}}) is a tomb complex composed of a white marble base, and a decorative edifice erected in honor of the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Ferdowsi]] located in [[Tus, Iran]], in [[Razavi Khorasan province]]. It was built in the early 1930s,&lt;ref name=r&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ferdowsi-iii |title=Ferdowsi, Abul-qasem. Mausoleum|last=A. Shahpur|first=Shahbazi|publisher=Columbia University |date=Dec 15, 1999&lt;!-- - 2012 upt.--&gt;|website=Encyclopedia Iranica |accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Reza Shah]], and uses mainly elements of [[Achaemenid architecture]] to demonstrate Iran's rich culture and history. The construction of the mausoleum as well as its aesthetic design is a reflection of the cultural, and geo-political status of [[Iran]] at the time.

==Background==
[[Ferdowsi]], the influential [[Persian language|Persian]] poet and author of the Persian epic, [[Shahnameh]] died in 1020{{nbsp}}AD in the [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], [[Iran]] (Persia), in the same city in which he was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poetics and Politics of Iran's National Epic, the Shahnameh |author=Mahmoud Omidsalar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|date=Nov 2011|pages=52–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQrIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+died+at&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpEzU5aiBYfx0gG694GQDw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20died%20at&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all his literary contribution, Ferdowsi was not recognized during his life. It was only after his death that his poems won him admiration. For hundreds of years, his resting place was nothing more than a minor dome-shrine erected by a [[Ghaznavid]] ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], without any permanent edifice in place in the garden of his house where Ferdowsi's daughter had originally buried him.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; In the beginning years of the 20th{{nbsp}}century [[Iran]] started to realize his critical role in defining the [[National symbols of Iran|identity of Iran]].&lt;ref name=s2&gt;{{cite book|title=A Persian Odyssey: Iran Revisited|author=Rami Yelda|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Kbj21wrwwEC&amp;pg=PT168&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vZUzU6_QHKixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdosi Tomb2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One façade of the poet's mausoleum]]
It was not until 1934 that the Iranian government, then under the control of [[Reza Shah]], first king of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], recognized the cultural and literary value of Ferdowsi and erected a permanent tomb in his honor.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; A [[Ferdowsi Millennial Celebration|millennial celebration]] was also held for the poet, to which were invited scholars from several countries, including [[Soviet Tajikistan]], [[India]], [[Armenia]], and [[Europe]] ([[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[France]], [[U.K.|England]]). Funds were collected, mainly donations from [[Parsi]] scholars, to enable the building of a [[statue]] for the poet at his tomb site.{{clarification needed|date=June 2015}} The Pahlavi family used Ferdowsi to advance Iran's cultural prestige, but in doing so nearly cost Ferdowsi his tomb since, after the [[Islamic revolution]], frustrations with the [[Shah of Iran]] nearly led to destruction of the tomb by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drinking Arak Off a [cleric]'s Beard: A Journey Through the Inside-Out Worlds of Iran and Afghanistan|author=Nicholas Jubber|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2010|pages=61–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DblrRc7mCmsC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=islamic+revolution+ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H6UzU4jTDJOqsQSIy4CwCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20revolution%20ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Panorama of Ferdowsi's tomb, [[Tus, Iran]]]]
The tomb was originally designed by the Iranian [[architect]], [[Haj Hossein Lurzadeh]] who aside from Ferdowsi's tomb also created some 842 [[mosque]]s, as well as the private palace of Ramsar, part of the decoration of the Marmar palace, the Imam Hossein Mosque in [[Tehran]], the Motahari Mosque, and various parts of the Hazrat-i-Seyyed-o-Shouhada [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine]] in [[Karbala]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=s4&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Iran: The History of Iranian Art|author=Habibollah Ayatollahi|publisher=Alhoda UK|year=2003|pages=291–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Al0jpyRDGe8C&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=Haj+Hossein+Lurzadeh+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AqgzU6qeBubUsAS0mYCYBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Haj%20Hossein%20Lurzadeh%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present design of the structure is credited mainly to [[Karim Taherzadeh]], who replaced the old dome-shaped design by Lurzadeh with a modern cubical design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nationalizing Iran: culture, power, and the state, 1870–1940|author=Afshin Marashi|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2011|pages=126–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=488CSG25AzcC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=tomb+of+ferdowsi+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hr40U4e1AvK-sQSbwIKwBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20ferdowsi%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdowsi's tomb, which resembles the [[tomb of Cyrus the Great]], is built in style of [[Achaemenid architecture]]. There is a clear link between this choice of architectural style and the politics of Iran at the time. Four years before Reza Shah came to power in 1922, a group of secular Iranian reformists had created the "[[Society for the National Heritage of Iran|Society for National Heritage]]" (SNH, or in Persian ''anjoman-e asar-e meli'').&lt;ref name=s3&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Cultural Politics Under Reza Shah: The Pahlavi State, New Bourgeoisie and the Creation of a Modern Society in Iran|author=Bianca Devos, Christoph Werner|publisher=Routledge|date=Aug 22, 2013|pages=101–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=architectural+element+of+tomb+of+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqszU72vJqixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=architectural%20element%20of%20tomb%20of%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed mostly of western-educated, pro-reform intellectuals such as [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]], [[Hassan Pirnia]], [[Mostowfi ol-Mamalek]], [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], Firuz Mirza Firus Nosrat al-Dowleh, and [[Keikhosrow Shahrokh]], the SNH was critical in obtaining the funds from the Iranian parliament.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Keikhosrow Shahrokh, Iran's [[Zoroastrian]] representative to the Iranian parliament, was particularly active in reviving Achaemenid and [[Sassanid architecture]] in Iran in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Architectural Conservation|author=Jukka Jokilehto|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|section=9.1.5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UandAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT505&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ar4zU8P-MdHMsQSyx4GoBA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural Details==

The basic structure of the tomb is rectangular with a large garden surrounding the structure and interacting with the structure in the [[Persian gardens|Persian style of gardening]] known as [[Charbagh|Char-bagh]] (or Chaharbagh translating to ''four gardens'' in Persian). In the center of the cross created by the legs of the garden surrounding it, is an edifice made of primarily white [[marble]]. The edifice can be divided into a "wide chamber" that lies at the base and a cubical erection on top, with four pillars surrounding it and scenes from the epic of Shahnameh and text ornating it. The body of the poet is actually interred in the center of the rectangular wide chamber underneath the overlying four [[Column|pillars]] cube.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; There are twelve (12) steps leading from the lowest point of the wide chamber all the way to the level of the cube. The wide base has a total height of 16 m. The edifice has equal dimensions of 30 m on each side.

The following are schematic diagrams of the aerial view of the tomb's wide base and edifice section and their topography:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A unique feature of the design of Ferdowsi's tomb has been its resemblance to that of Cyrus the Great in [[Pasargadae]]. Cyrus's tomb also has a rectangular structure seating atop a rectangular, gradually elevating base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author=James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=tomb+of+cyrus+dimensions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RVo7TZf-HYGBlAeEioXrBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20cyrus%20dimensions&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resemblance is intentional as the designer of this edifice intended to revoke the original Achaemenid style of architecture. In fact every other facet of the edifice has a Zoroastrian symbol known as [[Faravahar]]. This is not coincidental. There are multiple applications of this in the [[Achaemenid architecture]] mainly in [[Persepolis]] in [[Fars province]] today. The "Society for National Heritage of Iran" (SNH) heavily relied on the use of Faravahar as this was the symbolic representation of [[ancient Iran]] since Achaemenid times.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Many construction in the 1930s, including the then [[National Bank of Iran]] use Faravahar which is not unexpected considering that the same architect that created Ferdowsi's tomb also created the National Bank of Iran.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A closer look at the edifice points out that there are four columns each at the corner of the rectangular structure with two half-buried columns that protrude as deep [[friezes]] on each facet of the structure. Each frieze column has a box, followed by a two horn bull sign which is very much similar if not the exact imitation of the Persepolis column design. The columns are ornated with [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]] 3/4 of the way down with the last portion spared. The overall effect is intended to create a grand gesture. The columns are as high as the edifice which is 30 meters high. (the edifice is also 30 m wide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.where-is-iran.com/Historical-Monument-In-Iran/Tombs-Khorassan-Razavi-Iran.aspx |title=Ferdowsi Tomb, Toos-Khorasan-Iran |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website= Where is Iran |publisher= |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marble decorations are used to ornate the siding and the floor of the "wide base" structure as well the wall. Persian flower designs (concentric flower designs composed of a flower with seven (7) ovaloid pellets surrounding a central circle), and hexagonal marble designs are commonly used in the structure.

==Historical Context==
[[File:Rpferdosi.jpg|thumb|right|Reza Shah Pahlavi officially opening the mausoleum of Ferdowsi for public visiting upon conclusion of Ferdowi Millenary conference]]
[[Iran]]'s history has been closely tied to geopolitical changes that has taken place since the establishment of the [[Achaemenid empire]] in [[Persis]] all the way to the modern day Iran. Two major events are of critical importance in Iran's history specially its literary history as it pertained to Ferdowsi: [[Arab conquest of Persia]] and the [[Mongolia]]n invasion of Persia.

Ferdowsi lived his life as a poor man constantly moving from court to court, and eventually died a poor widower, having lost his only son.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], at one point was an opulent city in the [[greater Khorasan]] region but it was repeatedly sacked by [[Oguz Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Uzbeks]] from the steppe.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; This and the growing influence of [[Mashad]] as a political and religious center within Khorasan shaped Ferdowsi's experience and in many way influenced his writing as Tus lost prestige. Additionally, Arabic had found prestige in lands conquered by the Arabs and there was threat of [[Middle Persian]] being lost in favor of [[Arabic]]. Ferdowsi's role is critical in that using the least number of loan-words he transferred the [[Middle Persian]] (Pahlavi) into Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] (Farsi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind|first=Michael |last=Axworthy|authorlink=Michael Axworthy|publisher=Basic Books|pages=66–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGl_Gu6BwxYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+arabic+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rAY0U9_5Iu_JsQT-p4GoBg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20arabic%20language&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time frame preceding the construction of the mausoleum, nationalistic feelings in Iran were high.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite book|title=The Soul of Iran: A Nation's Struggle for Freedom|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2010|pages=40–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za59PAytkFwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=reza+shah+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pBQ0U9LJHNHmsAST3ILoCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=reza%20shah%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a renewed sense of national identity partly due to the pressures felt by foreign powers including the constant Anglo-Persian political struggle specially over the issues of oil, and partly due to inability of the [[Qajar]] dynasty from protecting Iranian lands in central Asia to the Russians and in the east to the British. [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC) was an important source of contention for Iranians. One journalist studying during this time period reflects his and his colleagues personal experience:

{{quote|We supported Reza Shah, and we wanted to support his effort to create a modern nation state, to lift us from our backwardness. At this time we talked about Pan-Iraniasm, or reuniting Afghanistan with Iran. We also talked of nationalism. Ferdowsi became very popular partly because of Reza Shah's support for him, and also partly because of the nationalistic impulses the shahnameh inspired.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;}}

The architecture of Ferdowsi's tomb is also influenced by poet's own personal life, reflecting a constant struggle between the poor poet and the lazy king, and adversity and hope. The Society for National Heritage in 1930s drawing on poet's attempt to revitalize the Persian language, also attempted to revitalize Persian culture and Iranian identity through architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of Iranian Narratives: A Thousand Years of Healing|author=Laleh Shahideh|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|pages=125–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHjArCjZ27sC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+Iranian+identity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-Qw0U8K4CZDjsATc4oGgBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20Iranian%20identity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in many ways taken literary with Persian poems from Shahnameh etched into the white marble facets of the edifice of the poet's mausoleum.

After the Iranian revolution, both tomb of Ferdowsi and even mausoleum of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos. One of the most dangerous threats to the structure was that it would be equated with the late Pahlavi dynasty by the new regime and destroyed. It however was not and was instead embraced by the new local government since Ferdowsi was a devout Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persian Pilgrimages: Journeys Across Iran|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W.

==Interior Design==

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb3.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of Ferdowsi with the accompanying text. To see the translation, see the text on the left.]]
Ferdowsi's Shahnameh inspires tales of heroic act by [[protagonist]]s fighting against their antagonists. In that sense it is a [[national epic]] that encompasses not only fictional and literary figures but also incorporates parts of the history of pre-Islamic Iran. This has led to the interior of the edifice of Ferdowsi to reflect the same heroic scenes.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; The chief architect responsible for the design of the interior of the tomb of Ferdowsi is [[Feraydoon Sadeghi]] who created deep frieze scenes using three dimensional statues each depicting a scene from Shahnameh. [[Rostam]], the hero of the book of Shahnameh is the focus of the majority of the scenes inside of the edifice. As Shahnameh is essentially a text, artistic recreation of its heroic scenes are multiple.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; Centered inside the edifice surrounding by the frieze scenes and other artistic endeavors is the [[tomb stone]] of the poet. Etched in the tomb stone in Farsi (Persian) is the description of Ferdowsi's contribution to the Persian-speakers and at the end it ends by denoting the poet's date of birth, date of death, and the date at which the mausoleum was built.

The [[Persian language|Persian]] content of the tomb is as follows:

&lt;blockquote lang="fa" style="direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed;"&gt;بنام خداوند جان و خرد. این مکان فرخنده آرامگاه استاد گویندگان فارسی‌زبان و سراینده داستان‌های ملی ایران، حکیم ابوالقاسم فردوسی طوسی است که سخنان او زنده‌کننده کشور ایران و در دل مردم این سرزمین جاودان است&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[English language|English]] translation is roughly as follows:

{{quote|In the name of the God who created life. This place is the resting place of he (Hakim Abul-qasem Ferdowsi Tusi) who has advanced the art of language among Persian speakers, and the holder of the national epic of Iran and its national stories. His words have given a new life to Iran, and he has a place in the hearts of its people.}}

An '''ultraluminous X-ray source''' ('''ULX''') is an astronomical source of [[X-rays]] that is less luminous than an [[active galactic nucleus]] but is more consistently luminous than any known stellar process (over 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]/s, or 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s), assuming that it radiates [[isotropy|isotropically]] (the same in all directions). Typically there is about one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host them, but some galaxies contain many. The [[Milky Way]] has not been shown to contain a ULX. The main interest in ULXs stems from their luminosity exceeding the [[Eddington luminosity]] of [[neutron stars]] and even [[stellar black hole]]s. It is not known what powers ULXs; models include beamed emission of stellar mass objects, [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[intermediate-mass black hole]]s, and super-Eddington emission.

==Observational facts==
ULXs were first discovered in the 1980s by the [[Einstein Observatory]]. Later observations were made by [[ROSAT]]. Great progress has been made by the X-ray observatories [[XMM-Newton]] and [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]], which have a much greater [[spectral resolution|spectral]] and [[angular resolution]]. A survey of ULXs by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] observations shows that there is approximately one ULX per galaxy in galaxies which host ULXs (most do not).&lt;ref name="swartz04"&gt;

ULXs are found in all types of galaxies, including [[elliptical galaxies]] but are more ubiquitous in [[Galaxy formation and evolution|star-forming galaxies]] and in gravitationally interacting galaxies. Tens of percents of ULXs are in fact background [[quasars]]; the probability for a ULX to be a background source is larger in [[elliptical galaxies]] than in [[spiral galaxies]].

==Models==
The fact that ULXs have Eddington luminosities larger than that of stellar mass objects implies that they are different from normal [[X-ray binaries]]. There are several models for ULXs, and it is likely that different models apply for different sources.

'''Beamed emission''' — If the emission of the sources is strongly beamed, the Eddington argument is circumvented twice: first because the actual [[luminosity]] of the source is lower than inferred, and second because the accreted gas may come from a different direction than that in which the [[photons]] are emitted. Modelling indicates that stellar mass sources may reach luminosities up to 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; W), enough to explain most of the sources, but too low for the most luminous sources. If the source is stellar mass and has a [[thermal]] [[spectrum]], its [[temperature]] should be high, temperature times the [[Boltzmann constant]] ''kT'' ≈ 1 keV, and [[quasi-periodic oscillations]] are not expected.

'''Intermediate-mass black holes''' — [[Black holes]] are observed in nature with masses of the order of ten times the mass of the [[Sun]], and with masses of millions to billions the solar mass. The former are '[[stellar black hole]]s', the end product of massive stars, while the latter are [[supermassive black hole]]s, and exist in the centers of galaxies. [[Intermediate-mass black hole]]s (IMBHs) are a hypothetical third class of objects, with masses in the range of hundreds to thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref name=DEGN&gt;{{cite book|last=Merritt|first=David|authorlink=David Merritt|title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei|date=2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9781400846122|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16802359W/Dynamics_and_Evolution_of_Galactic_Nuclei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate-mass black holes are light enough not to sink to the center of their host galaxies by [[dynamical friction]], but sufficiently massive to be able to emit at ULX luminosities without exceeding the [[Eddington limit]]. If a ULX is an intermediate-mass black hole, in the high/soft state it should have a thermal component from an accretion disk peaking at a relatively low temperature (''kT''&amp;nbsp;≈ 0.1 keV) and it may exhibit quasi-periodic oscillation at relatively low [[frequencies]].

An argument made in favor of some sources as possible IMBHs is the analogy of the X-ray spectra as scaled-up stellar mass black hole X-ray binaries.  The spectra of X-ray binaries have been observed to go through various transition states.  The most notable of these states are the low/hard state and the high/soft state (see Remillard &amp; McClintock 2006). The low/hard state or power-law dominated state is characterized by an absorbed power-law X-ray spectrum with spectral index from 1.5 to 2.0 (hard X-ray spectrum). Historically, this state was associated with a lower luminosity, though with better observations with satellites such as RXTE, this is not necessarily the case.  The high/soft state is characterized by an absorbed thermal component (blackbody with a disk temperature of (''kT''&amp;nbsp;≈ 1.0 keV) and power-law (spectral index&amp;nbsp;≈ 2.5). At least one ULX source, Holmberg II X-1, has been observed in states with spectra characteristic of both the high and low state.  This suggests that some ULXs may be accreting IMBHs (see Winter, Mushotzky, Reynolds 2006).

'''Background [[quasars]]''' — A significant fraction of observed ULXs are in fact background sources. Such sources may be identified by a very low temperature (e.g. the soft excess in PG quasars).

'''[[Supernova]] remnants''' — Bright supernova (SN) remnants may perhaps reach luminosities as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; W). If a ULX is a SN remnant it is not variable on short time-scales, and fades on a time-scale of the order of a few years.

==Notable ULXs==

*'''Holmberg II X-1''': This famous ULX resides in a dwarf galaxy. Multiple observations with XMM have revealed the source in both a low/hard and high/soft state, suggesting that this source could be a scaled-up X-ray binary or accreting IMBH.
*'''[[Messier 74|M74]]''': Possibly containing an [[intermediate-mass black hole]], as observed by Chandra in 2005.
*'''[[M82 X-1]]''': This is the most luminous known ULX (as of Oct 2004), and has often been marked as the best candidate to host an intermediate-mass black hole.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;

The '''William Phelps Ornithological Collection,''' also known as the Phelps Ornithological Museum, is a museum of [[Natural science|natural sciences]] dedicated to the study, exhibition and preservation of the [[Bird|birds]] of [[Venezuela]] and the rest of Latin America. The collection is located east of Caracas and in the geographic center of [[Metropolitan Region of Caracas|Greater Caracas]], in the heart of the [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande district]]. The William Phelps ornithological collection is the most important in [[Latin America]] and it is also the most important private collection in the world in its research area.&lt;ref name=":282"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H.

The Phelps library in 1990 already had 6,000 books, 800 journals and 5,500 reprints, mostly from natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;
 
== History ==

The ornithological collection was born in 1938, although it did not have its own headquarters on the [[Boulevard of Sabana Grande]] until 1949. At the beginning of 2018, it celebrated its 80th anniversary in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the passing of time, the collection has been growing&lt;ref name=":282" /&gt; and still has great international scientific relevance. In 2005, an investigation was carried out on "plumage differences in four subspecies of golden warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in [[Venezuela]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.neotropicalbirdclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/C23-Restall.pdf|title=On plumage differences in four subspecies of Golden-crowned Warbler Basileuterus culicivorus in Venezuela|last=Restall|first=Robin|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Gustavo|date=2005|journal=Cotinga|number=23|pages=33–36|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=|last3=Lentino|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Importance ===
The Phelps Foundation has been recognized worldwide for its scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fundacionwhphelps.org/web/nosotros/|title=Nosotros – Colección Ornitológica Phelps|website=fundacionwhphelps.org|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1937, this foundation has dedicated to the study of the distribution of birds in Venezuela as well as to the dissemination of ornithology in Venezuela. Since 1949, it has expanded globally in its mission to discover, interpret and disseminate information about ornithology through a program of scientific research, education and dissemination in the natural sciences. The Foundation has had an important global trajectory for which it is recognized and is a regional compulsory study resource on tropical birds for experts who want to know more about this area. This museum has historically been connected to the American Museum of Natural History, thanks to the work of Billy Phelps.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Obituary%20Phelps%20figlio.pdf|title=IN MEMORIAM: WILLIAM H. PHELPS JR.|last=VUILLEUMIER|first=FRANCOIS|date=1990|journal=Department of Ornithology, The American Museum of Natural Histor|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithological collection has also been expanded thanks to the research carried out with Armando Dugand from [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.bdigital.unal.edu.co/33067/1/32820-121526-1-PB.pdf|title=AVES DE LA RIBERA COLOMBIANA DEL RIO NEGRO (FRONTERA DE COLOMBIA Y VENEZUELA)|last=Dugand|first=Armando|last2=Phelps|first2=William|authorlink2=|date=1948|journal=Libro|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds to carry out these investigations were collected by the Phelps Foundation.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

=== Research ===
In March and April 1977, the Phelps Ornithological Collection, with the collaboration of the Venezuelan-Brazilian Border Commission, Demarcador de Limites, carried out a collection of birds at Cerro Urutaní (62 ° 05'W, 3 ° 40'N), which is a low altitude tepui on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border in the Sierra Pacaraima. A total of 511 specimens of birds were collected between 1150 and 1280 meters high s.n.m., representing 78 different species. Gilberto Pérez Chinchilla, Manuel Castro and Dickerman prepared the copies of the collection. A full report on these birds was published in the international press and was published in the Bulletin of the "American Museum of Natural History", [[New York City|New York]]. It was necessary to work in conjunction with the Boundary Directorate of [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/Phelps%20%26%20Dickerman%201980.pdf|title=CUATRO SUBESPECIES NUEVAS DE AVES (FURNARIIDAE, FORMICARIIDAE) DE LA REGION DE PANTEPUI, ESTADO BOLIVAR Y TERRITORIO AMAZONAS, VENEZUELA|last=Phelps|first=William|last2=Robert|first2=Dickerman|date=1980|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias Naturales|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
