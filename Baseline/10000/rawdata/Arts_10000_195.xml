'''"A Lost Wand"''' is a [[fairy tale]] written by [[Jean Ingelow]].  It was first published in 1872 as part of ''The Little Wonder Horn'',&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bibsite/&gt; and later republished as one of the stories in ''Wonder-Box Tales'' in 1902.&lt;ref name=Gutenberg/&gt; The story revolves around Hulda, a lucky young girl in [[Norway]] who receives the opportunity to be granted a wish after finding a ring in her slice of cake.

== Summary ==
After finding a magical ring in her slice of cake, Hulda is given the opportunity to make a wish. A fairy appears from the flower on top of the cake, and tells Hulda she will give her anything she wishes for. Unknowing of what her wish would bring, she asks for the fairy's wand. After handing Hulda her beautiful [[gold]] wand, the fairy is stripped of her powers and will ultimately be held at the will of her enemy if she doesn’t one day retrieve the wand. It could not be returned immediately, it had to be on a midsummers day. Until then, the fairy requested that Hulda keep it safe for her while she was gone. Days passed and the fairy had never returned, this left Hulda believing that the fairy had died. Then a  dishonest guest paid a visit to Hulda and convinced her to trade the wand for a piece of his beautiful jewelry. After trading the wand for a bracelet with a bird clasp, Hulda realizes her visitor was actually a [[gnome]]. The gnome was the enemy the fairy had been worried about; with the wand in his possession he would make the fairy his slave. Hulda was aware she made a mistake, and did not rest until she retrieved the gold wand and returned it to the fairy. Not only did she give the fairy her powers back, but also in turn she saved her own life.&lt;ref name=Gutenberg/&gt;

== History and origin ==
"A Lost Wand" was written in the mid-1800s.  Much of Ingelow’s literature was influenced by the writings of [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[George Macdonald]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Her stories were written specifically for children, not so much to teach a lesson; but for entertainment,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} which was a relatively new concept during this time period.

== Characters ==

=== Hulda ===

Hulda is a young girl from Norway whose world is turned upside down after being granted a wish by a fairy. After receiving her wish, she regrets ever making it. She spends the next few years of her life trying to undo what she asked for. Her genuine, courageous attitude is what ultimately helps her catch the enemy and relieve the fairy of Hulda's unfortunate wish.

=== The Fairy ===

The reason for the fairy's existence is to better the lives of mortals, which she does by granting them one wish. After an unfortunate wish is made by a young girl Hulda, the fairy is stripped of her powers and held at the will of her enemy she goes into hiding. Her hopeful outlook on the situation however is the guidance that the little girl Hulda needed to retrieve what she had once lost for the fairy.

=== The Peddler (Gnome) ===

The [[gnome]] is a creature covered in dirt and earthly material. Although he disguised himself as "The Peddler", he was still the known enemy of the fairy. His devious, evil ways almost stripped the fairy of her powers for good. His bad intentions did not go unpunished; in the end it is always those with kindness in mind who prosper.

[[File:Tel Aviv Ben Gurion - Emil Zola 2011.jpg|thumb|Classical Bauhaus architecture, part of the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City]] UNESCO World Heritage Site]]
The '''architecture of Israel''' has been influenced by the different styles of architecture brought in by those who have occupied the country over time, sometimes modified to suit the local climate and landscape. Fortified [[Crusades|Crusader]] castles, [[Islamic]] madrassas, [[Byzantine]] churches, [[Templers (religious believers)|Templer]] houses,  [[Arab]] arches and minarets, Russian Orthodox onion domes, [[Bauhaus]]-style modernist buildings, sculptural concrete [[Brutalist architecture]], and soaring glass-sided skyscrapers all are part of the architecture of Israel.

==Architectural styles==
The Arabs built small stone houses on the hillsides with flat or dome roofs. The Crusaders built fortresses on strategic hilltops. The Christians built churches to mark sites where Jesus walked. The Templers built homes with tiled roofs like those in the German countryside. The British Mandatory authorities passed a law requiring all construction in Jerusalem to be of [[Jerusalem stone]] and introduced the idea of garden suburbs. In the early years of statehood, Israel built rows of [[Plattenbau|concrete tenements]] to accommodate the masses of new immigrants to replace the huts, tents and packing crates of the [[maabarot]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', edited by Raphael Patai, Herzl Press, McGraw, New York, 1971 "Architecture and Town Planning in Israel," Vol. 1, pp. 71-76&lt;/ref&gt;
First named the "White City" in 1984, the [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]] has been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site. As property values have risen, [[Skyscrapers in Israel|skyscrapers]] are going up around the country. The [[Azrieli Sarona Tower]] in [[Tel Aviv]] is the tallest building in Israel to date.

==Leading architects==
Sensing the political changes taking place in central Europe around the time of the First World War, as well as the stirrings of Zionist ideals about the re-establishment of a homeland for Jews, numerous Jewish architects from around Europe emigrated to Palestine during the first three decades of the 20th century. While much innovative planning occurred during the time of [[Mandatory Palestine|the British Mandatory authorities]], 1920-1948, in particular the town plan for Tel Aviv in 1925 by [[Patrick Geddes]], it would be architecture designed in the modernist "Bauhaus" style that would fill the plots of that plan; among the architects who emigrated to Palestine at that time, and who went on to establish formidable careers were: [[Yehuda Magidovitch]], Shmuel Miestechkin, Lucian Korngold, Jacov Ornstein, Salomon Gepstein, Josef Neufeld and Genia Gideoni.

[[Dov Karmi]], [[Zeev Rechter]] and [[Arieh Sharon]] were among the leading architects of the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="haaretz.co.il"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=1029311&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;title='A%20concrete%20life%20'&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 A Concrete Life, Noam Dvir, [[Haaretz]] Magazine, October 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf (Reuven) Trostler played an important role in designing the country's early industrial buildings.&lt;ref name="haaretz.co.il" /&gt; [[Dora Gad]] designed the interiors of the [[Knesset]], the [[Israel Museum]], the country's first large hotels, the [[Jewish National and University Library]], [[El Al]] planes and [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services|Zim]] passenger ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1037242.html Dora Gad's private sanctuary]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Amnon Niv]] designed [[Moshe Aviv Tower]], Israel's tallest building.

==Historical developments==
=== Traditional rural house ===
[[Image:Ruins of a church in Shivta in the Negev.jpg|thumb|Ancient basilica in the [[Negev]]]]
[[File:Latrun Monastery.jpg|thumb|[[Latrun|Latrun Monastery]]]]
Until the end of the 19th century, the traditional Arab rural house in the villages of what was then [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] consisted of a single room without partitions, divided into levels in accordance with various functions carried out in the house:
* ''Rawiyeh'' – a bottom level at the elevation of the courtyard considered the “dirty” part of the house, used for storage and sheltering livestock.
* ''Mastabeh'' – A higher residential level used for sleeping, eating, hospitality and storage.
* ''Sida'' (gallery) – Another living area above the mastaba,  used primarily for sleeping.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"&gt;[http://www.iaa-conservation.org.il/Projects_Item_eng.asp?subject_id=6&amp;site_id=3&amp;id=114  Heritage Conservation in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 19th century, a residential story characterized by a cross-vault was added above the traditional house, creating a space between the floor with the livestock in the bottom room and the residential story. A separate entrance was installed in each story.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Fortified house ===
[[Fortified house]]s were built outside the village core and had two stories: a raised ground floor with  tiny windows used for raising livestock and storage, and a separate residential floor with large windows and balconies. In the courtyard was a small structure used for storage. Sometimes a tabun baking oven would be located inside it.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Farmhouses ===
The first modern building technology was evident in the farmhouses. Iron beams were used and the roofs were made of concrete and roof tiles. These structures had balconies with a view and wide doorways.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Modern housing (British Mandate) ===
[[Image:Maskit 3.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jerusalem stone]] and metal grillwork]]
Modern housing built during the British Mandate was urban in character, with flat roofs, rectangular doorways and painted floor tiles.&lt;ref name="iaa-conservation"/&gt;

=== Biomorphism, blob architecture ===
[[File:Rothschild Boulevard - WLM 2013 - ovedc - 11.JPG|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|[[Meier on Rothschild]] tower, Tel Aviv's highest residential building]]
The [[Pavie House]] in [[Neve Daniel]] is a rare case of non geometric biomorphic architecture (blobitecture) in Israel. Yonatan Kanti of the Israeli daily ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Ma'ariv]]'' compared Pavie architectural style to the [[futurism]] of [[Eero Saarinen]]'s [[TWA Flight Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanti|first=Yonatan|script-title=he:השראה למכירה: המקרה המוזר של הבית בגוש עציון|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/55/ART2/352/423.html?hp=55&amp;cat=302&amp;loc=7|accessdate=7 April 2012|newspaper=[[Nrg Maariv]]|date=2 April 2012|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Inspiration for sale: The curious case of the house in Gush Etzion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie theaters ===
The architecture of Tel Aviv's movie theaters can be seen as a reflection of Israeli architectural history: The first cinema, the Eden, opened in 1914, was an example of the [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style that was in vogue at the time, combining European and Arab traditions. The Mugrabi cinema, designed in 1930, was built in [[art deco]] style. In the late 1930s, the Esther, Chen and Allenby theaters were prime examples of the [[Bauhaus]] style. In the 1950s and 1960s, [[brutalist]] style architecture was exemplified by the Tamar cinema built inside the historic [[Solel Boneh]] building on [[Allenby Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/before-the-curtain-fell-1.315177 Architectural milestones]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Politics of Architecture ==
The persistent existential threat posed by rival ideologies impacts how architecture is used as a powerful means of determining who gets to control and use land in Israel. [[Eyal Weizman]] advances a detailed argument concerning how the power relations expressed through architecture explain built form. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weizman|first1=Eyal|title=Hollow Land: Israel's architecture of occupation|date=2007|publisher=Verso|location=New York|edition=First|accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== State of Israel ==
From 1948, architecture in Israel was dominated by the need to house masses of new immigrants. The [[Brutalist]] concrete style suited Israel's harsh climate and paucity of natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC&amp;pg=PA1460&amp;lpg=PA1460&amp;dq=design+bank+of+israel+arieh+sharon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_EuPdMVLgf&amp;sig=Sy2nQOzYPNnM2mwCCj1dcNxfjtY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M7M1TKDLPNCnOPiN2NsE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal laws in [[Jerusalem]] require that all buildings be faced with local [[Jerusalem stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PAUL GOLDBERGERPublished: September 10, 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/10/magazine/passion-set-in-stone.html?pagewanted=7 |title=Passion Set in Stone, New York Times, Sept. 10, 1995 |publisher=New York Times |date=1995-09-10 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ordinance dates back to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] and the governorship of [[Sir Ronald Storrs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Architecture/Jeruarchitecture1948.html |title=Jerusalem Architecture Since 1948 |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of a master plan for the city drawn up in 1918 by Sir [[William McLean (disambiguation)|William McLean]], then city engineer of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_12.html The British Mandate] from "Jerusalem: Life Throughout the Ages in a Holy City".

== Museums and archives ==
A small Bauhaus Museum was established in Tel Aviv in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hecht|first=Esther|title=Bauhaus Museum Opens in Tel Aviv’s White City|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/080421bauhaus.asp|work=Architectural Record|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Munio Gitai Weinraub Museum of Architecture opened in [[Haifa]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/amos-gitai-sets-up-israel-s-first-architecture-museum-in-memory-of-his-father.premium-1.465707 Amos Gitai sets up Israel's first architecture museum in memory of his father, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian School of the Arts''' ('''ASTA''') is an arts program founded by the [[Sheldon College]] Institute of the Arts in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astalive.com.au/index.php/about-asta/welcome-message ASTA - Welcome Message] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217234700/http://www.astalive.com.au/index.php/about-asta/welcome-message |date=February 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was designed by Darren Harvey in an attempt to create "unparalleled creative learning experiences in the arts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privateschoolsdirectory.com.au/5806/sheldon-college Australian Private Schools Directory - Sheldon College]&lt;/ref&gt; Industry professionals such as [[Adam Lopez]], Alastair Tomkins, Jessica Hughes and Murray James lead the program in vocal, performance, dance and media courses respectively.

==Program Structure==
The program encompasses four fields of study including Combined Performing Arts, Music, Visual Art and Film and Television. Many of their students have also gone on to study at the [[Queensland Conservatorium of Music]], Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, Victorian College of the Arts and other highly recognised universities and institutions around Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheldoncollege.com.au/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=m2C9NIYU%2FPM%3D&amp;tabid=72&amp;mid=828 Sheldon College] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218022156/http://www.sheldoncollege.com.au/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=m2C9NIYU%2FPM%3D&amp;tabid=72&amp;mid=828 |date=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Major annual events are also held to enable the students to grow as performers and gain experience. These include the Arts Academy Awards (held at the Sheldon Event Centre), Dance Night (held at the Redlands Performing Arts Centre) and the school musical. In addition to these major events, there are several minor annual events, some of which include the ASTA Information Evening, ASTA Showcase and ASTA Day of Excellence.

Links between with the program have been made to major universities such as [[Griffith University]]. This is through the Applied Theatre course and a Digital Production course which are both administrated on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheldoncollege.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=SJGCRTwt%2Fdk%3D&amp;tabid=72&amp;mid=828 Sheldon College] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218143039/http://www.sheldoncollege.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=SJGCRTwt%2Fdk%3D&amp;tabid=72&amp;mid=828 |date=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Media==
In 2012, ASTA announced its annual school musical ([[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]) and its subsequent cast. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] commentator [[Spencer Howson]] is likely to be support of the production following his support for the High School Musical production in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2010/05/sheldon-colleges-high-school-musical.html?site=brisbane&amp;program=612_breakfast Sheldon College's High School Musical - ABC Queensland - Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ASTA received the rights to perform the award-winning musical [[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]. The production received six standing ovations for all six sold out shows at the Redlands Performing Arts Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baysidebulletin.com.au/story/1497750/sheldon-colleges-hairspray-musical-vows-audiences Sheldon College's Hairspray musical vows audiences]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baysidebulletin.com.au/story/1470773/sheldon-sells-out-rpac-with-hairspray/ Sheldon sells out RPAC with Hairspray]&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual musicals held at the [[Redland City|Redland]] Performing Arts Centre in [[Cleveland, Queensland]], have since included [[West Side Story]], [[Dreamgirls]], and [[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3602">In the context of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) collaborations, '''background, foreground, sideground and postground intellectual property''' (IP) are four distinct forms of [[intellectual property]] assets. These are included in the broader and more general categories of knowledge in R&amp;D collaborations or [[open innovation]]. While background and foreground IP and knowledge are fairly established concepts, sideground and postground IP and knowledge have more recently been added to the conceptual vocabulary. This set of four concepts was first introduced by Prof. Ove Granstrand in a European Commission report in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Ove Granstrand|author-link= |authors= |date=2001 |title=IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Aspects of Internet Collaborations |url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/nl/workshop-report-on-ipr-intellectual-property-rights-aspects-of-pbKI3601855/downloads/KI-36-01-855-EN-C/KI3601855ENC_001.pdf;pgid=y8dIS7GUWMdSR0EAlMEUUsWb0000DlRJYbDw;sid=Yr4L-CxbP5AL9H7qxKuVX05-L90ViiuIZG0=?FileName=KI3601855ENC_001.pdf&amp;SKU=KI3601855ENC_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=KI-36-01-855-EN-C |publisher=European Commission |page= |docket= |access-date=16 February 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four knowledge/IP types are defined by Granstrand and Holgersson (2014):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Granstrand |first=Ove |last2=Holgersson |first2=Marcus |date=2014 |title=The challenge of closing open innovation: The intellectual property disassembly problem |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5437/08956308X5705258 |journal=Research-Technology Management |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=19–25 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Background knowledge/IP is knowledge/IP that is relevant to a collaborative venture or open innovation project that is supplied by the partners '''at the start of the project'''.
*Foreground knowledge/IP is all the knowledge/IP produced within the collaborative venture or  open innovation project '''during the project'''’s tenure.
*Sideground knowledge/IP is knowledge/IP that is relevant to a collaborative venture or open innovation project, but produced '''outside the project''' by any of the partners '''during the project'''’s tenure.
*Postground knowledge/IP is knowledge/IP that is relevant to a collaborative venture or open innovation project that is produced by any of the partners '''after the project''' ends.

It was founded in 1999 by [[Rachel Levitsky]] as a reading series at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)|Bluestockings]] in New York, NY. The [[reading series]] quickly expanded to a matrix of readings, publications, and informal salons, featuring avant-garde feminist writing, with an emphasis on hybrid and [[Language poets|language-focused]] writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the press operates as a non-hierarchical collaborative, publishing books and hosting literary events with attention to diversity in its roster of authors and editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicole|first1=Disser|title=Independent Presses Not Immune to Diversity Problems that Plague the Rest of the Publishing Industry|url=http://www.bkmag.com/2014/10/22/independent-presses-not-entirely-immune-to-diversity-problems-that-plague-the-rest-of-the-publishing-industry/|website=www.bkmag.com|publisher=Brooklyn Magazine|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Belladonna* was started as a reading and salon series at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)]] on New York City’s Lower East Side in August 1999. The first publications were postcards by [[kari edwards]] for the May 4, 2000 reading at [[Bluestockings (bookstore)]]. Following the edwards postcards, and in collaboration with Boog Literature, Belladonna* began to publish commemorative "chaplets" (staple-bound pamphlets typically with fewer pages than a chapbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/poetry/resources/chapbook_publishers/|title=Chapbook Publishers - Poetry Society of America|website=www.poetrysociety.org|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced in very small print runs) of its readers' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitsky|first=Rachel|date=2010-08-04|title=Belladonna Books|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/389102|journal=American Book Review|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=5–5|doi=10.1353/abr.0.0122|issn=2153-4578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Belladonna* published chapbooks by [[Erica Hunt]] and [[Akilah Oliver]] and co-published its first full-length book, ''Four from Japan: Contemporary Poetry &amp; Essays by Women'', in collaboration with [https://www.pw.org/small_presses/litmus_press Litmus Press].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.litmuspress.org/books/four-from-japan/|title=Litmus Press|website=www.litmuspress.org|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Belladonna* published its first full-length books independently: ''Open Box'' by [[Carla Harryman]] and ''Mauve Sea-Orchids'', a book of poems in Spanish and English with facing page translations, by [[Lila Zemborain]] (translated by [[Rosa Alcalá]] and [[Mónica de la Torre]]). In celebration of its ten-year anniversary in 2009, Belladonna* published The Elders Series—eight multiply authored [[Perfect bound|perfect-bound]] books highlighting the continuity and transformation of the ideas, poetics, and artistic/political concerns of its poets' circle. Each book was conceived as "an anthology and a conversation between the guest curator and the elder(s) she hosts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.belladonnaseries.org/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Belladonna* has published, on average, two full-length books and 14 chaplets a year.

== Awards ==

Belladonna* has been featured in many publications including American Review of Books, [[Poets &amp; Writers]], and [[Rain Taxi]], among others.

* In a special chapbook issue of American Book Review (Mar/Apr 2005), Corinne Robins reviewed five Belladonna* chaplets in an article called "Belladonna*: The Deadly Night Shades of Experimental Women’s Poetry”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robins|first1=Corinne|title=Belladonna*: The Deadly Night Shades of Experimental Women's Poetry|journal=American Book Review|date=April 2005|volume=26|issue=3|url=http://americanbookreview.org/issueContent.asp?id=15|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In January 2005, Byron Coley and [[Thurston Moore]] had this to say about the Belladonna* chaplet series: "Each zine is a succinct piece by a female poet, all of whom share a common sense of adventure and active consciousness.

It contains one of the most important collections of Chinese temple art in the world,&lt;ref&gt;http://romlx6.rom.on.ca/exhibitions/wculture/bishop.php{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; including three [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271 – 1368 AD) temple wall paintings from [[Shanxi Province]] that adorn the three walls of the Gallery, and several wooden sculptures depicting bodhisattvas from the 12th to the 15th centuries. These are some of the earliest acquisitions and most [[Royal Ontario Museum Iconic Objects|iconic objects in the ROM]].[[File:Bishop White Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|thumb|Temple statues and mural in the Gallery]]

==Name of the Gallery==

The Gallery is named in honour of [[William White (Bishop of Honan)|Bishop William Charles White]] (1873-1960), an [[Anglican]] missionary, educated at Wycliffe College in the [[University of Toronto]], who became Bishop of [[Henan province|Honan Province]], China (1909-1934). Bishop White was chiefly responsible for building and interpreting the ROM's Chinese collection in the early days and, in particular, for the acquisition of the Buddhist wall painting on the north wall of this Gallery and the H.H. Mu &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://guides.library.utoronto.ca/content.php?pid=457463&amp;sid=3847487# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117032139/http://guides.library.utoronto.ca/content.php?pid=457463&amp;sid=3847487# |archive-date=2014-01-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far Eastern Library . [[File:Bishop White on wheelbarrow.jpg|right|thumb|Bishop White in China]] He was also the first curator of the East Asian galleries (1934-1948) and founder of the School of Chinese Studies (later the East Asian Studies Department) at the University of Toronto in 1934. The Bishop White Committee in the Royal Ontario Museum was founded shortly after his death to promote the collections of the East Asian Galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley L, Bishop in Honan. Toronto: University of Toronto Press (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the Bishop White Gallery==

The collections of this Gallery are mostly [[Buddhist]], including the wall painting on the north wall of the Gallery, The Paradise of Maitreya, and the wooden sculptures, which are mostly of a later provenance; but the other two wall paintings, both entitled Homage to the First Principle, are from the [[Daoist]] tradition.

=== The Paradise of Maitreya (1298 AD)===
[[File:Paradise of Maitreya, Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|thumb|Paradise of Maitreya]]
The wall painting depicts Maitreya, the Buddha  of the future and successor to the historical Buddha, enthroned in heaven and awaiting his incarnation on earth where he will save the souls of lost humanity. Maitreya himself is the central figure but he is joined by a goodly retinue of greater and lesser bodhisattvas and monks (arhats, or 'luohan' in Chinese). According to the Indian Buddhist tradition, Maitreya will be born in to the Kingdom of Ketumati, whose King and Queen are depicted here, at the far left and right, 'taking the tonsure' (i.e., having their heads shaved) as a sign of their conversion to Buddhism.

The [[Paradise of Maitreya]], which measures approximately 16 (height) x 36 (width) feet, is known to have come from the Monastery of Joyful Conversion (Xinghua Si) in southern [[Shanxi Province]], which has long since been destroyed after falling into ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, "The Paradise of Maitreya: A Yuan Dynasty Mural from Shanxi Province" in Orientation: The Magazine for Collectors and Connoisseurs of Asian Art. (Spring 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The painting remained in situ and was undisturbed until the 1920s, when social and political unrest in China led to the destruction of many temples in the northern part of the country. To protect the wall paintings from war lords who were looting the northern monasteries, the Buddhist monks resolved to cut the painting in to 63 sections and hid them.&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley L, Bishop in Honan, p. 153. Toronto: University of Toronto Press (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually sold the painting in 1923 to a syndicate of Chinese art dealers from Beijing from whom Bishop White purchased it in 1928 for the Royal Ontario Museum where it was installed in 1933 after being reassembled.&lt;ref name="ROM"&gt;Royal Ontario Museum. The Bishop White Gallery: Wall Paintings and Wood Sculptures from Shanxi Province, China. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired through the generosity of the Sir Joseph Flavelle Foundation, in memory of Sir [[Joseph Flavelle]], a prominent Toronto businessman and Trustee of the ROM.&lt;ref name="ROM"/&gt;

The Paradise of Maitreya is currently dated as having been composed in 1298 and is one of the best surviving examples of its kind from late Yuan period, but there has been much scholarly debate about the exact date of composition. Bishop White himself contributed a monograph on the subject,&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White W., Chinese Temple Frescoes (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; arguing for a slightly earlier date, and suggesting that the painting should be attributed to Zhu Haogu, whose name Bishop White procured from the temple records before it was destroyed.  This attribution has been accepted by subsequent scholars and has been a useful point of reference for research into the development of a Buddhist-Daoist style of temple art in southern Shanxi Province.&lt;ref&gt;Stenhardt, N. "Zhu Haogu Reconsidered: A New Date for the ROM Painting and the Southern Shanxi Buddhist-Daoist Style," in Artibus Asiae (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sculptures (12-15th Centuries)===

These Buddhist sculptures are [[bodhisattvas]], enlightened beings who have remained on earth rather than entering paradise in order to help others attain enlightenment. These sculptures also come from Shanxi Province, though not from the same temple as the Paradise of Maitreya, and were intended as icons by which to evoke the presence of the divine, with the wall paintings serving as a background. The most famous of these are a pair of bodhisattvas, [[Guanyin]] and Dashiji, who are almost identical except for some of their accoutrements, like the diadems they wear. Their creation is attested as being in the year 1195 by an inscription set into the lower back of Guanyin, which makes them unique, as only a very few wooden sculptures of this kind dated to the 12th century are known to have survived. Many of the sculptures in the Bishop White Gallery have openings in their backs where devotees would leave offerings (e.g., printed prayers, small images or precious gems and metals) at the time of dedication to ensure their efficacy as objects of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, Homage to Heaven, Homage to Earth: Chinese Treasures of the Royal Ontario Museum. P.178. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop White surmised that most of the statues in this Gallery were sculpted from a variety of catalpa, either in pieces or from a single block.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt; All of these sculptures were acquired through the efforts of George Crofts, a fur merchant who was also instrumental as an agent in the Chinese art market of the early 20th century, and arrived to the ROM before 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Ontario Museum, Homage to Heaven, Homage to Earth: Chinese Treasures of the Royal Ontario Museum. P.9. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homage to the First Principle (1271 - 1368 AD)===
[[File:Homage to the Highest Principle (1 of 2), Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Homage to the Highest Principle]]
On the east and west walls of the Bishop White Gallery are a pair of two slightly smaller paintings, [[Homage to the Highest Power|Homage to the Highest Principle]], that depict a procession of Daoist deities and their celestial attendants, sometimes referred to as Chaoyuan tu or the 'Heavenly Court'. These deities, whose court is modeled on the bureaucratic structure of the earthly world, are said to maintain the order of nature and to govern the welfare of human beings.  In their original monastic context, these processional paintings would have led up to a great picture at the end of the room, probably depicting the heavenly host.&lt;ref&gt;Currely, C. I Brought the Ages Home. Toronto: Ryerson Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bishop White Gallery, the north wall is occupied by the Paradise of Maitreya, a Buddhist painting but with a similar motif and treatment of the subject matter as what would have been seen in the original Daoist temple. By the time that these paintings were being produced in the 13th or 14th century, Buddhism had been assimilated into the Chinese philosophical system, and this syncretism had long since begun to influence iconography.&lt;ref name="ROM"/&gt;

The provenance of these paintings, which both measure approximately 10 (height) x 34 (width) feet, is not known with certainty. It is thought that they came from a Daoist temple in southern [[Shanxi]], whose name and exact location are unknown, but the stylistic similarity between these and other paintings found in another Shanxi Daoist temple, Yongle Gong, suggests that they might have come from the same workshop and be roughly contemporaneous, dating from the early 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, K., Gesterkamp, L and Ruitenbeek, K. Beyond Clouds and Waves: Daoist paintings in the Royal Ontario Museum. P. 45-63. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the paintings in Yongle Gong bear the inscription of the master Zhu Haogu, the same painter whom Bishop White first identified as being responsible for the Paradise of Maitreya, it has been inferred that all three wall paintings in the Bishop White Gallery, both Buddhist and Daoist, might have been executed by the same man or, at least, in the same workshop.&lt;ref name="ROM"/&gt;
                                               
The Daoist murals were acquired through the well-known art dealership of [[Yamanaka &amp; Co.]] in 1937. [[Charles Trick Currelly|Charles Currelly]], the founding Director of the ROM, relates in his autobiography how the paintings were offered to the Museum by a certain Mr. Tanaka, who, being particularly impressed by the quality of the Buddhist wall painting already in the ROM's possession, thought it desirable that the pair of Daoist paintings should also come to the ROM, so that there would be in North America at least one complete representation of what these early Northern Chinese temples would have been like.&lt;ref&gt;Currelly, C. I Brought the Ages Home, p. 254. Toronto: Ryerson Press (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design of the Bishop White Gallery==

The Bishop White Gallery is located in the original wing of the ROM, constructed in 1914, where it has remained since the wall paintings were installed in the 1930s. The design of the Gallery, however, has changed dramatically over the years, beginning with a fairly prosaic display of the objects around the circumference of the room, later progressing in the 1980s to a recreation of an authentic temple setting and, since the mid-2000s, receiving a more modern treatment with an 'open concept' layout.

In the early 1980s, the Bishop White Gallery was redesigned to give the effect of a Chinese Buddhist temple of the 14th century. This was not an attempt to reproduce a particular site but rather a thoughtful way of utilizing the space to combine a number of roughly contemporary artefacts into a coherent unit. This was done by imitating a few features of what remains from the Yongle Gong temple complex, long roof beams terminating in curved brackets and a coffered ceiling, together with the same general layout of a rectangular space where devotees could participate in rituals such as meditative circumambulation around a raised altar supporting sculpted images of bodhisattvas.
[[File:The Temple Reconstruction, Royal Ontario Museum.jpg|thumb|Temple Statues]]
The choice of a temple environment was appropriate not only thematically, since both the wall paintings and the statues were originally used as temple art, but also in terms of the provenance of these artefacts, which originated in geographic proximity to each other in northern China. It might be objected that the contents of this Gallery are not exactly contemporaneous, dating from 1195 to the late 14th century, but yet it would not have been uncommon for a temple to contain devotional objects that its community had accumulated throughout many generations. Although the wall paintings displayed in this 'temple' setting are both Buddhist and Daoist, it was decided that this too would not be inappropriate, because there had long since been a blending of these two religious belief systems. Indeed, from the 10th century onwards the syncretism of Buddhist, Daoist and Confucian beliefs – 'The Three Teachings' - was reflected even in the similarity of artistic style, which is certainly evidenced in the examples presented in the Bishop White Gallery. The renovated Gallery was reputed to be as close as one could come outside China to a major North Chinese monastery hall.&lt;ref&gt;Nagai-Berthrong, E. "The Bishop White Gallery," p. 12, in Rotunda. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum (Fall 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present Design==

The current incarnation of the Gallery, which opened in 2005, dates from the renovations that were undertaken during the first phase of the 'Renaissance ROM' building project. Several other galleries were also renovated, including the other galleries of the Far Eastern collection, and the construction of the Michael-Lee Chin Crystal, designed by [[Daniel Libeskind]], was completed in 2007. Like the Crystal, the renovation of gallery space in the historic buildings was also intended to be modern in style - quite austere, with a minimum of colour and helpful signage, and an 'open-concept' layout that minimizes visual barriers between adjoining galleries, purportedly so that audience might appreciate the collections as 'works of art,' with little indication of the context for which objects – particularly religious objects – were originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;Ruitenbeek, K. "Light from and for the East: The New East Asian Galleries in the ROM", p.39-44, in Orientations: The Magazine for Collectors and Connoisseurs of Asian Art. (Spring 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; That said, the general organization of the artefacts remains much as it was during the Gallery's previous incarnation as a temple reconstruction, with the murals surrounding the wooden sculptures situated in the middle of the space, but the decorative elements of the temple setting have been stripped away to focus one's attention on the objects themselves.

[[File:Sullivan by Millais.jpg|thumb|right|Arthur Sullivan by [[John Everett Millais]]]]
The critical reputation of the British composer '''[[Arthur Sullivan]]''' has fluctuated markedly in the 150 years since he came to prominence. At first, critics regarded him as a potentially great composer of serious masterpieces, the long-awaited great English composer.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 28 and 42&lt;/ref&gt; When Sullivan made a series of popular successes in [[Gilbert and Sullivan|comic operas]] with the librettist [[W.S. Gilbert]], [[Victorian era|Victorian]] critics generally praised the operettas but reproached Sullivan for not concentrating on composing solemn choral works and grand opera instead. Immediately after Sullivan's death, his reputation was attacked by critics who condemned him for not taking part in what they conceived of as an "English musical renaissance". By the latter part of the 20th century, Sullivan's music was being critically reassessed, beginning with the first book devoted to a study of his music, ''The Music of Arthur Sullivan'' by [[Gervase Hughes]] (1960).

==Early career==
[[File:arthur sullivan by ape.jpg|right|thumb|Sullivan by the cartoonist [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|'Ape']].]]
When the young [[Arthur Sullivan]] returned to England after his studies in Leipzig, critics were struck by his potential as a composer. His incidental music to ''The Tempest'' received an acclaimed premiere at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] on 5 April 1862. The ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' wrote:

{{quote|It was one of those events which mark an epoch in a man's life; and, what is of more universal consequence, it may mark an epoch in English music, or we shall be greatly disappointed. Years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise, so full of fancy, showing so much conscientiousness, so much skill, and so few references to any model elect.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

His ''Irish Symphony'' of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise: "The symphony...is not only by far the most noticeable composition that has proceeded from Mr. Sullivan's pen, but the best musical work, if judged only by the largeness of its form and the number of beautiful thoughts it contains, for a long time produced by any English composer."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', quoted in Jacobs, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; But as [[Arthur Jacobs]] notes, "The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last." A comment that may be taken as typical of those that would follow the composer throughout his career was that "Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan was also occasionally cited for a lack of diligence. For instance, of his early oratorio, ''The Prodigal Son'', his teacher, [[John Goss (composer)|John Goss]], wrote:
{{quote|All you have done is most masterly – Your orchestration superb, &amp; your effects many of them original &amp; first-rate. ... Some day, you will, I hope, try another oratorio, putting out all your strength, but not the strength of a few weeks or months, whatever your immediate friends may say ... only don't do anything so pretentious as an oratorio or even a Symphony without ''all your power'', which seldom comes in one fit.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 22 December 1869, quoted in Allen and Gale, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Transition to opera==
By the mid-1870s, Sullivan had turned his attention mainly to works for the theatre, for which he was generally admired. For instance, after the first performance of ''Trial by Jury'' (1875), the ''Times'' said that "It seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Allen, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But serious music critics began to express disapproval. The music critic [[Peter Gammond]] writes of "misapprehensions and prejudices, delivered to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd.&amp;nbsp;... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art."&lt;ref&gt;Gammond, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; By the time ''The Sorcerer'' appeared in 1877, there were charges that Sullivan was wasting his talents in comic opera:

{{quote|There is nothing whatever in Mr. Sullivan's score which any theatrical conductor engaged at a few pounds a week could not have written equally well.... We trust Mr. Sullivan is more proud of it than we can pretend to be. But we must confess to a sense of disappointment at the downward art course Mr. Sullivan appears to be now drifting into.... [He] has all the ability to make him a great composer, but he wilfully throws his opportunity away. A giant may play at times, but Mr. Sullivan is always playing.... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling.&lt;ref&gt;''Figaro'', quoted in Allen, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Implicit in these comments was the view that comic opera, no matter how carefully crafted, was an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The ''Athenaeum's'' review of ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'' expressed a similar complaint: "It might be wished that in some portions Mr Sullivan had taken a loftier view of his theme, but at any rate he has written some most charming music, and orchestration equal, if not superior, to any that has ever proceeded from the pen of an English musician. And, further, it is an advantage to have the composer of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' occupying himself with a worthier form of art."&lt;ref&gt;25 October 1880, quoted in Jacobs, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The operas with Gilbert themselves, however, garnered Sullivan high praise from the theatre reviewers.  For instance, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account ''Iolanthe'' his best effort in all the Gilbertian series."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Allen, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''Theatre'' would say that "the music of ''Iolanthe'' is Dr Sullivan's ''chef d'oeuvre''. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works.... In every respect ''Iolanthe'' sustains Dr Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced."&lt;ref&gt;Beatty-Kingston, William. ''The Theatre'', 1 January 1883, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan received honorary  doctorates of music from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;"University Intelligence", ''The Times'', 18 May 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and Oxford in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;"University Intelligence", ''The Times'', 11 June 1879, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

|style="text-align: center;" |"A HUMOROUS KNIGHT."
|-
|style="text-align: center;" |["It is reported that after the Leeds Festival Dr. Sullivan will be knighted." Having read this in a column of gossip, a be-nighted Contributor, who has "the Judge's Song" on the brain, suggests the following verse, adapted to probabilities.]
|-
|style="text-align: left;" |
:As a boy I had such a musical bump,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And its size so struck Mr. H&lt;small&gt;ELMORE&lt;/small&gt;,
:That he said, "Though you sing those songs like a trump,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You shall write some yourself that will sell more."
:So I packed off to Leipsic, without ''looking back,''
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And returned in such classical fury,
:That I sat down with H&lt;small&gt;ANDEL&lt;/small&gt; and H&lt;small&gt;AYDN&lt;/small&gt; and B&lt;small&gt;ACH&lt;/small&gt;,—
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And turned out "''Trial by Jury."
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:But W.S.G. he jumped for joy
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As he said, "Though the job dismay you,
:Send Exeter Hall to the deuce, my boy;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's the ''haul'' with me that'll pay you."
:And we hauled so well, mid jeers and taunts,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That we've settled, spite all temptations,
:To stick to our Sisters and our Cousins and our Aunts,—
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And continue our pleasant relations.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
:Yet I know a big Duke, and I've written for Leeds,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And I think (I don't wish to be snarly),
:If honour's poured out on a chap for his deeds,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm as good-—come, as M&lt;small&gt;ONCKTON&lt;/small&gt; or C&lt;small&gt;HARLEY&lt;/small&gt;!
:So the next "first night" and the Opéra C.,
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Let's hope, if you're able to find him,
:You'll cry from the pit, "There's W. S. G.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the stalls,—''with a'' K&lt;small&gt;NIGHT&lt;/small&gt; ''behind him!'"
|}

After Sullivan was knighted in 1883, serious music critics renewed the charge that the composer was squandering his talent. The ''Musical Review'' of that year wrote:

{{quote|[S]ome things that Mr Arthur Sullivan may do, Sir Arthur ought not to do. In other words, it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation, the book by Mr W. S. Gilbert and the music by Sir Arthur Sullivan. A musical knight can hardly write shop ballads either; he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal; oratorio, in which he has so conspicuously shone, and symphony, must now be his line. Here is not only an opportunity, but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended [and] do battle for the honour of English art&amp;nbsp;... against all foreign rivals, and arouse us thoroughly from our present half-torpid condition..&lt;ref name=Baily250&gt;Baily, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Sir George Grove, who was an old friend of Sullivan's, recognised the artistry in the Savoy Operas while urging the composer to bigger and better things: "Surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice, orchestra, and stage effect—master, too, of so much genuine sentiment—may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest."&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Grove, George. "Sullivan, Arthur Seymour" ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', London 1879–89, p. 762, quoted in Sarema, Meinhard. [http://www.sullivan-forschung.de/meinhard/berlinas "In the Purgatory of Tradition: Arthur Sullivan and the English Musical Renaissance"], Deutsche Sullivan Gesellschaft, 2000, accessed 10 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere of ''The Golden Legend'' at the Leeds Festival in 1886 finally brought Sullivan the acclaim for a serious work that he had previously lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, pp. 161–63&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the critic of the ''Daily Telegraph'' wrote that "a greater, more legitimate and more undoubted triumph than that of the new cantata has not been achieved within my experience."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' hailed it as a "triumph of English art".&lt;ref&gt;"Leeds Music Festival", ''The Observer'', 17 October 1886, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Louis Engel in ''The World'' called it: "one of the greatest creations we have had for many years. Original, bold, inspired, grand in conception, in execution, in treatment, it is a composition which will make an "epoch" and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory. The effect it produced at rehearsal was enormous. The effect of the public performance was unprecedented."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Harris, p. IV&lt;/ref&gt; Hopes for a new departure were evident in the ''Daily Telegraph'''s review of ''The Yeomen of the Guard'', Sullivan's most serious opera to that point:
{{quote|The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Allen, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==1890s==
The advance that the ''Daily Telegraph'' was looking for would come with Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1891), which opened to largely favourable reviews,&lt;ref&gt;Dailey, pp. 129–33&lt;/ref&gt; but attracted some significant negative ones. For instance, [[John Alexander Fuller Maitland|J. A. Fuller Maitland]] wrote in ''The Times'' that the opera's "best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;  In her 1891 essay "Arthur Seymour Sullivan", Florence A. Marshall reviewed Sullivan's music up to that time, concluding that Sullivan was torn between his interests in comedy and tragedy. She wrote that he was "no dreamy idealist, but thoroughly practical ... apprehending and assimilating all the tendencies in the life of society around him, and knowing how to turn them all to account ... music is, in his hands, a plastic material, into which he can mold anything. His mastery of form and of instrumentation is absolute, and he wields them without the slightest semblance of effort. His taste is ... unerring; his perceptions of the keenest; his sense of humor infectious and irresistible."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Florence A.  [http://www.haddon-hall.com/Libretti/FamousComposersSullivan.pdf "Arthur Seymour Sullivan"], ''Famous Composers and Their Works'', vol. 1, Millet Co.,1891&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, Sullivan's successes were fewer and farther between than earlier in his career. The ballet ''[[Victoria and Merrie England]]'' (1898) won praise from most critics:&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Arthur Sullivan's New Ballet", ''The Daily News'', 26 May 1897, p. 8; "Alhambra Theatre", ''The Morning Post'', 26 May 1897, p. 7; "Sir Arthur Sullivan's New Ballet 'Victoria'", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 26 May 1897, p. 7; "Music", ''The Illustrated London News'', 29 May 1897, p. 730; and "Victoria And Merrie England", ''The Era'', 29 May 1897, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is music for the people. There is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience. The melodies are all as fresh as last year's wine, and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne. There is not one tune which tires the hearing, and in the matter of orchestration our only humorous has let himself run riot, not being handicapped with libretto, and the gain is enormous.... All through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy, tunes of alarming simplicity, but never a tinge of vulgarity, and a total absence of the cymbal-brassy combination which some ballets never do without.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tillett 1998, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), the ''Daily Telegraph'' said that "The musician is once again absolutely himself", while the ''Musical Times'' opined that "it is music that to hear once is to want to hear again and again."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, Sullivan composed a popular song, "[[The Absent-Minded Beggar]]", to a text by [[Rudyard Kipling]], donating the proceeds of the sale to "the wives and children of soldiers and sailors" on active service in the Boer War. Fuller Maitland disapproved in ''The Times'', but Sullivan himself asked a friend, "Did the idiot expect the words to be set in cantata form, or as a developed composition with symphonic introduction, [[contrapuntal]] treatment, etc.?"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jacobs, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive Sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible, he was, nevertheless, "the nation's ''de facto'' composer laureate".&lt;ref&gt;Maine, Basil. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.001.0001/odnb-9780192683120-e-32988 "Elgar, Sir Edward William"], 1949, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' archive, accessed 20 April 2010 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan was considered the natural candidate to compose a ''Te Deum'' for the end of the Boer War, which he duly completed, despite serious ill-health; it was performed posthumously. Gian Andrea Mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of Sullivan's career in ''The Musical Standard'' of 16 December 1899:
{{quote|As regards music, the English history of the 19th century could not record the name of a man whose "life work" is more worthy of honour, study and admiration than the name of Sir Arthur Sullivan, whose useful activity, it may be expected, will extend considerably into the 20th century; and it is a debatable point whether the universal history of music can point to any musical personality since the days of [[Haydn]], Mozart and Beethoven, whose influence is likely to be more lasting than the influence the great Englishman is slowly, but surely, exerting, and whose results shall be clearly seen, perhaps, only by our posterity. I make no doubt that when, in proper course of time, Sir Arthur Sullivan's life and works have become known on the continent, he will, by unanimous consent, be classed among the epoch-making composers, the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music, that is, to endow their countrymen with the undefinable, yet positive means of evoking in a man's soul, by the magic of sound, those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in the ''Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Journal'', No. 34, Spring 1992, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

After Sullivan's death, [[George Grove|Sir George Grove]] wrote, "Form and symmetry he seems to possess by instinct; rhythm and melody clothe everything he touches; the music shows not only sympathetic genius, but sense, judgement, proportion, and a complete absence of pedantry and pretension; while the orchestration is distinguished by a happy and original beauty hardly surpassed by the greatest masters.".&lt;ref name=musicaltimes&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3368297 "Arthur Sullivan",] ''The Musical Times'' (1 December 1900), pp. 785–87 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary in ''The Times'' called him England's "most conspicuous composer ... the musician who had such power to charm all classes. ... The critic and the student found new beauties at every fresh hearing. What ... set Sullivan in popular esteem far above all the other English composers of his day was the tunefulness of his music, that quality in it by which ... [it] was immediately recognized as a joyous contribution to the gaiety of life. ... Sullivan’s name stood as a synonym for music in England." The obituary also stated: "Many who are able to appreciate classical music regret that Sir Arthur Sullivan did not aim consistently at higher things, that he set himself to rival Offenbach and Lecocq instead of competing on a level of high seriousness with such musicians as Sir Hubert Parry and Professor Stanford. If he had followed this path, he might have enrolled his name among the great composers of all time. ... That Sir Arthur Sullivan could aim high and succeed he proved by ''The Golden Legend'' and by a good deal of ''Ivanhoe''".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan's Obituary in ''The Times'', 23 November 1900, pp. 7 and 9, [http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/html/obit.html reprinted] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 12 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next decade, however, Sullivan's reputation sank considerably among music critics. In 1901, shortly after the composer's death, Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries, citing the composer's failure to live up to the early praise of his ''Tempest'' music:
{{quote|Among the lesser men who are still ranked with the great composers, there are many who may only have reached the highest level now and then, but within whose capacity it lies to attain great heights; some may have produced work on a dead-level of mediocrity, but may have risen on some special occasion to a pitch of beauty or power which would establish their claim to be numbered among the great. Is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius, and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life?. &amp;nbsp;...  Though the illustrious masters of the past never did write music as vulgar, it would have been forgiven them if they had, in virtue of the beauty and value of the great bulk of their productions. It is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater, perhaps, than fell to any English musician since the time of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]] – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them.... If the author of ''The Golden Legend'', the music to ''The Tempest'', ''Henry VIII'' and ''Macbeth'' cannot be classed with these, how can the composer of "Onward Christian Soldiers" and "The Absent-Minded Beggar" claim a place in the hierarchy of music among the men who would face death rather than smirch their singing robes for the sake of a fleeting popularity?&lt;ref&gt;Fuller Maitland, J. A. "Obituary", ''Cornhill Magazine'', March 1901, pp. 300–09&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[File:Sullivan to MacKenzie.png|thumb|left|250px|1897 cartoon relishing the irony of the failure of [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Mackenzie]]'s ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', after Mackenzie and his Academy had claimed that Sullivan was "wasting his talent" on comic opera.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie wrote the comic opera ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' in 1897.

[[Edward Elgar]], to whom Sullivan had been particularly kind,&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; rose to Sullivan's defence, branding Fuller Maitland's obituary "the shady side of musical criticism&amp;nbsp;... that foul unforgettable episode."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Young, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller Maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had falsified the facts, inventing a banal lyric, passing it off as genuine and condemning Sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity.&lt;ref name=burton/&gt; In 1929 Fuller Maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss Sullivan's comic operas as "ephemeral".&lt;ref&gt;"Light Opera", ''The Times'', 22 September 1934, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''History of Music in England'' (1907) [[Ernest Walker (composer)|Ernest Walker]], was even more damning of Sullivan than Fuller Maitland had been in 1901:
{{quote|After all, Sullivan is merely the idle singer of an empty evening; with all his gift for tunefulness, he could never raise it to the height of a real strong melody of the kind that appeals to cultured and relatively uncultured alike as a good folk-song does – often and often on the other hand (but chiefly outside the operas) it sunk to mere vulgar catchiness. He laid the original foundations of his success on work that as a matter of fact he did extremely well; and it would have been incalculably better for the permanence of his reputation if he had realised this and set himself, with sincerity and self-criticism, to the task of becoming – as he might easily have become – a really great composer of musicianly light music. But anything like steadiness of artistic purpose was never one of his endowments, and without that, a composer, whatever his technical ability may be, is easily liable to degenerate into a mere popularity-hunting trifler.&lt;ref name="Hughes, p. 6"&gt;Hughes, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Fuller Maitland incorporated similar views in the second edition of ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', which he edited, while Walker's ''History'' was re-issued in 1923 and 1956 with his earlier verdict intact. As late as 1966, [[Frank Howes]], former music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Outside the Savoy operas, little enough of Sullivan has survived... Yet a post-mortem is a valuable form of inquest, not only to ascertain the cause of death, but to discover why Sullivan's music as a whole had not in it the seeds of the revival that was on the verge of taking place. The lack of sustained effort, that is artistic effort proved by vigorous self-criticism, is responsible for the impression of weakness, the streaks of poor stuff among the better metal, and the consequent general ambiguity that is left by his music. His contemporaries deprecated his addiction to high life, the turf, and an outward lack of seriousness. Without adopting the simplified morality of the women's magazines, it is possible to urge that his contemporaries were really right, in that such addiction implied a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art.&lt;ref&gt;Howes, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

There were other writers who rose to praise Sullivan. For example, [[Thomas Dunhill]] wrote an entire chapter of his 1928 book, ''Sullivan's Comic Operas'', titled "Mainly in Defence", which reads in part:
{{quote|It should not be necessary to defend a writer who is so firmly established in popular esteem that his best works are more widely known and more keenly appreciated over a quarter of a century after his death than they were at any period during his lifetime....  But no critical appreciation of Sullivan can be attempted to-day which does not, from the first, adopt a defensive attitude, for his music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles. These attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius.&lt;ref&gt;Dunhill 1928, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

[[Henry Wood|Sir Henry Wood]] continued to perform Sullivan's serious music.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Henry Wood Jubilee Concert at Albert Hall", ''The Times'', 6 October 1938, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]],&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan's music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely reassessed and revived.

In 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan's music and picked up the trail where Dunhill left off:
{{quote|Dunhill's achievement was that of a pioneer, a preliminary skirmish in a campaign whose advance has yet to be implemented. Today there may be few musicians for whom – as for Ernest Walker – Sullivan is merely 'the idle singer of an empty evening'; there are many who, while acknowledging his great gifts, tend to take them for granted.... The time is surely ripe for a comprehensive study of his music as a whole, which, while recognising that the operettas "form his chief title to fame" will not leave the rest out of account, and while taking note of his weaknesses (which are many) and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste (which were comparatively rare) will attempt to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship.&lt;ref name="Hughes, p. 6"/&gt;|}} 

In recent decades, Sullivan's work outside of the Savoy Operas has begun to be re-assessed. The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan's serious music.&lt;ref name=burton/&gt; Since the late 1960s most of Sullivan's major non-Savoy music has been professionally recorded.&lt;ref name=Sulldiscog&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/sullidx.htm "Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan"], the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 10 July 2010, accessed 5 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Symphony in E'' had its first professional recording in 1968; his solo piano and chamber music in 1974; the cello concerto in 1986; ''Kenilworth'' in 1999; ''The Martyr of Antioch'' in 2000; ''The Golden Legend'' in 2001. In 1992 and 1993, Naxos released four discs featuring performances of Sullivan's ballet music and his incidental music to plays. Of his operas apart from Gilbert, ''Cox and Box'' (1961 and several later recordings), ''The Zoo'' (1978), ''The Rose of Persia'' (1999), and ''The Contrabandista'' (2004) have had professional recordings.&lt;ref name=Sulldiscog/&gt;

In recent decades, several publishers have issued scholarly critical editions of Sullivan's works, including [[Ernst Eulenburg (musical editions)|Ernst Eulenburg]] (''The Gondoliers''), Broude Brothers (''Trial by Jury'', ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''Iolanthe''), [[David Russell Hulme]] for [[Oxford University Press]] (''Ruddigore''), Robin Gordon-Powell at [http://www.amber-ring.co.uk/ The Amber Ring] (''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'', the ''Marmion'' overture, the ''Imperial March'', ''[[The Contrabandista]]'', ''[[The Prodigal Son (Sullivan)|The Prodigal Son]]'', ''[[On Shore and Sea]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'' incidental music, ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' and ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''), and [https://archive.is/20121216110432/http://www.r.clyde.dial.pipex.com/ R. Clyde] (''Cox and Box'', ''Haddon Hall'', ''Overture "In Memoriam"'', ''Overture di Ballo'' and ''The Golden Legend'').&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

In 1957 a review in ''The Times'' explained Sullivan's contributions to "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas": "Gilbert's lyrics ... take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music.&amp;nbsp;... [Sullivan, too, is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody".&lt;ref&gt;"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan: Operas of an Artificial World", ''The Times'', 14 February 1957, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 article in ''The Musical Times'' by Nigel Burton noted the resurgence of Sullivan's reputation beyond the comic operas:
{{quote|We must assert that Sullivan has no need to be "earnest" (though he could be), for he spoke naturally to all people, for all time, of the passions, sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness. He believed, deeply, in the moral expressed at the close of [[Cherubini]]'s ''[[Les deux journées]]'': that the human being's prime duty in life is to serve humanity. It is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest Victorian composer. Time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth, to enjoy all his music, and to rejoice in the rich diversity of its panoply. Now, therefore, one hundred years after his death, let us resolve to set aside the "One-and-a-half-hurrahs" syndrome once and for all, and, in its place, raise THREE LOUD CHEERS.&lt;ref name=burton&gt;Burton, Nigel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12582">The '''Cultural Objects Name Authority''' (CONA) is a project by the [[Getty Research Institute]] to create a [[controlled vocabulary]] containing authority records for cultural works, including architecture and movable works such as paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, manuscripts, photographs, textiles, ceramics, furniture, other visual media such as frescoes and architectural sculpture, performance art, archaeological artifacts, and various functional objects that are from the realm of material culture and of the type collected by museums.&lt;ref name="Discovery and use of art images on the web: an overview"&gt;{{cite book|title=Short proceedings of the Third International Euro-Mediterranean Conference EuroMed|year=2010|publisher=Archaeolingua Publ.|isbn=978-963-9911-16-1|pages=205–211 [207]|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1942/11909|author=Krassimira, I.|authorlink=Discovery and use of art images on the web: an overview|editor=Ioannides, M. |editor2=D. Fellner |editor3=A. Georgopoulos |editor4=D. Hadjimitsis |accessdate=2 April 2013|format=Proceedings Paper|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of CONA is works cataloged in scholarly literature, museum collections, visual resources collections, archives, libraries, and indexing projects with a primary emphasis on art, architecture, or archaeology. The target users are the visual resources, academic, and museum communities.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies: Terminology for Art, Architecture, and Other Cultural Works"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harpring|first=Patricia|title=Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies: Terminology for Art, Architecture, and Other Cultural Works|year=2010|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=160606018X|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/intro_controlled_vocab/index.html|accessdate=2 April 2013|format=Online Edition|chapter=Vocabularies for Cultural Objects}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the CONA database, each work's record (also called a subject in the database, not to be confused with iconographical depicted subjects of art works) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to each work's record are titles/names, current location, dates, other fields, related works, a parent (that is, a position in the hierarchy), sources for the data, and notes. By using terms from all four Getty Vocabularies to control many of these fields, CONA uses [[linked data]] principles to pull together multiple vocabularies in the creation of an authority file for works of art.&lt;ref name="L.A. meta (data): Exploring vocabulary interoperability in libraries, Archives and Museums"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Erik|author2=T. Kanti Srikantaiah|title=L.A. meta (data): Exploring vocabulary interoperability in libraries, Archives and Museums|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|year=2012|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–4 [2]|doi=10.1002/meet.14504901280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coverage of CONA is global, from prehistory through the present.

== History ==

Detailed discussions regarding the Getty Vocabulary Program compiling a vocabulary comprising unique numeric identifiers and brief records for art works began in 2004. It was determined that various Getty projects collected data for movable works and architecture that could form an initial data set, upon which other contributors could build over time. The project was enthusiastically embraced by the user community. In 2005 mapping of the data model used for all three existing vocabularies (the [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT), the [[Thesaurus for Geographic Names]] (TGN), and the [[Union List of Artist Names]] (ULAN)) to potential CONA fields was completed. The effort coincided with the development of CCO (Cataloging Cultural Objects), a more concise offshoot of the CDWA ([[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]]), and CDWA Lite, which is an XML schema intended to serve as an exchange format for art information. Both CCO and CDWA, which reflect consensus in the user community of best practice in cataloging art and architecture, lay out the required fields and rules for cataloging art objects.

Technical development of CONA began in 2010. The editorial system and online search screens for CONA are similar to those used for the existing Getty vocabularies. The data is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of CONA is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules.

Contributions to CONA from the user community commenced in 2012. A pilot release of CONA with a limited number of records is currently available online. The growth and utility of CONA will depend upon contributions from users. As with the AAT, TGN, and ULAN, CONA will grow and change via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]].

The current manager of the Getty vocabularies is Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor. Administratively, the Vocabulary Program resides under the GRI Collection Management and Description Division (David Farneth, Head). Other GRI departments in this division are General Collection Cataloging, Special Collections Cataloging, Digital Services, the Registrar\x92s Office, Institutional Records and Archives, and Conservation and Preservation. The Vocabulary Program works with Digital Art History Access (Murtha Baca, Head) to foster foreign language translations of the vocabularies, maintain national and international partnerships, and oversee licensing and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/cona/about.html About CONA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms ==

The focus of each CONA record is a work of art or architecture. Each work is identified with a unique and persistent numeric ID, which aids in the disambiguation of similar works.&lt;ref name="The Cataloging Cultural Objects experience: Codifying practice for the cultural heritage community"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coburn|first=Erin|title=The Cataloging Cultural Objects experience: Codifying practice for the cultural heritage community|journal=IFLA journal|year=2010|volume=36|issue=1|pages=16–29 [24]|doi=10.1177/0340035209359561|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many fields in CONA, however through titles/names (equivalence relationships), as well as hierarchical and associative relationships, the basic structure of CONA is that of a thesaurus in compliance with ISO and NISO standards. Names or titles may be current, historical, and in various languages.

== Design ==

Although it may be displayed as a list, CONA is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the CONA hierarchy (Subject_ID: 700000000). There may be multiple broader contexts, making CONA polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships (e.g., between a print and the larger volume to which it belongs), CONA has equivalence relationships (between equivalent titles/names) and associative relationships (e.g., between a sketch and the final work).&lt;ref name="The Getty Vocabularies: “Non-Authoritarian” Authority Files for Art, Architecture, and Material Culture"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baca|first=Murtha|title=The Getty Vocabularies: "Non-Authoritarian" Authority Files for Art, Architecture, and Material Culture|url=http://niso.kavi.com/apps/group_public/download.php/5750/NISOauthdatawebinar9feb2011_WEB.pdf|work=NISO Authority Data &amp; Semantic Web Webinar|accessdate=2 April 2013|format=Webinar|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary top divisions of CONA are the facets Built Work and Movable Work.

With the exception of performance art, CONA records unique physical works. However, CONA may include works that were never built or that no longer exist, for example designs for a building that was not constructed or a work that has been destroyed.

'''Built Works''':  Built works within the scope of CONA are architecture, which includes structures or parts of structures that are the result of conscious construction, are of practical use, are relatively stable and permanent, and are of a size and scale appropriate for—but not limited to—habitable buildings. Most built works in CONA are manifestations of the built environment that is typically classified as fine art, meaning it is generally considered to have aesthetic value, was designed by an architect (whether or not his or her name is known), and constructed with skilled labor.

'''Movable Works''': The term movable works is borrowed from legal jargon, referring to tangible objects capable of being moved or conveyed from one place to another, as opposed to real estate or other buildings. It is useful to separate the two types of works—built works and movable works—into different facets in CONA because movable works typically are located in a repository, have a repository identification number, have a provenance of former locations, and other characteristics that typically differ from architecture.

Movable works within the scope of CONA include the visual arts that are of the type collected by art museums, although the objects themselves may actually be held by an ethnographic, anthropological, or other museum, or owned by a private collector. Performance art is included in CONA under this facet as well.

The minimum fields and editorial rules of CONA are in compliance with CDWA and CCO.&lt;ref name="Museum Data Exchange: Learning How to Share"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waibel|first=Günter|author2=Ralph LeVan |author3=Bruce Washburn |title=Museum Data Exchange: Learning How to Share|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=March–April 2010|volume=16|issue=3/4|doi=10.1045/march2010-waibel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The minimum fields are the following: Catalog Level, Object/Work Type, Title or Name, Creator, Creation Date, Measurements, Materials and Techniques, Depicted Subject, and Current Location.

'''Dhundiraj Govind Phalke''', popularly known as '''Dadasaheb Phalke''' ({{audio|Ma-Dadasaheb Phalke.ogg|pronunciation}}) (30 April 1870&amp;nbsp;– 16 February 1944), was an Indian producer-director-screenwriter, known as ''the Father of [[Indian cinema]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vilanilam|first=J.

He made 95 feature-length films and 27 short films in his career, spanning 19 years, until 1937, including his most noted works: ''Mohini Bhasmasur'' (1913), ''Satyavan Savitri'' (1914), ''Lanka Dahan'' (1917), ''Shri Krishna Janma'' (1918) and ''Kaliya Mardan'' (1919).
The [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]], for lifetime contribution to cinema, was instituted in his honour by the [[Government of India]] in 1969. The award is one of the most prestigious awards in [[Indian cinema]] and is the highest official recognition for film personalities in our country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/pran-chosen-for-dada-saheb-phalke-award/article4610293.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Pran chosen for Dada Saheb Phalke award | date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A postage stamp bearing his likeness was released by [[India Post]] to honour him in 1971.

==Biography==
===1870–1892: Early life and education===
Dhundiraj Phalke was born on 30 April 1870 at [[Trimbak]], [[Maharashtra]] (then [[Bombay Presidency]]) into a [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking [[Chitpavan]] [[Brahmin]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/google-doodle-marks-dadasaheb-phalke-birth-anniversary-amitabh-bachchan-pays-homage/story-ZNhVILAzrnJD5PmuBjKbbJ.html|title=Google doodle marks Dadasaheb Phalke birth anniversary, Amitabh Bachchan pays homage|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=30 April 2018|accessdate=11 July 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502083645/https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/google-doodle-marks-dadasaheb-phalke-birth-anniversary-amitabh-bachchan-pays-homage/story-ZNhVILAzrnJD5PmuBjKbbJ.html|archivedate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Kajri|title=Gods in the Bazaar: The Economies of Indian Calendar Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bl8No2_PJ8AC&amp;pg=PA151|date=16 March 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8973-8|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Govind Sadashiv alias Dajishastri, was a Sanskrit scholar and worked as a priest conducting religious ceremonies and his mother, Dwarkabai, was a housewife. The couple had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Shivrampant, the eldest, was twelve years elder than Phalke and worked in [[Baroda]]. He briefly worked as the ''[[Dewan#In India|Dewan]]'' (Chief Administrator) of the [[princely state]] of [[Jawhar State|Jawhar]] and died in 1921, at the age of 63. Phalke's second brother, Raghunathrao, also worked as priest and died at a young age of 21. Dajishastri taught Phalke to conduct religious rituals like [[yajna]] and dispensing of medicines. When he was appointed as a professor of Sanskrit in the [[Wilson College, Mumbai]], the family shifted its base to Mumbai (then Bombay). Phalke completed his primary education in Trimbakeshwar and [[Matriculation#India|matriculation]] was done in Mumbai.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=13}}

Phalke joined the [[Sir J. J. School of Art]], Mumbai in 1885 and completed a one-year course in drawing.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=14}} At the beginning of 1886, he accompanied his elder brother, Shivrampant, to Baroda where he got married to a girl from [[Marathe]] family. Later, he joined Faculty of Fine Arts at the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]] and completed a course in [[Oil painting]] and [[Watercolor painting]] in 1890. He also achieved proficiency in architecture and [[Physical model|modelling]]. In the same year, Phalke bought a film camera and started experimenting with photography, [[Photographic processing|processing]], and [[Photographic printing|printing]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=15}}&lt;ref name="TribuneGM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000430/spectrum/main2.htm|title=Great Minds: Dadasaheb Phalke (1870–1944)|newspaper=Tribune (India)|date=30 April 2000|accessdate=17 November 2012|first=Kuldip|last=Dhiman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816191830/tribuneindia.com/2000/20000430/spectrum/main2.htm|archivedate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a gold medal for creating a model of an ideal theatre at the 1892 Industrial Exhibition of Ahmedabad. While his work was much appreciated, one of his fans presented him a "costly" camera, used for [[still photography]]. In 1891, Phalke did a six-months course to learn the techniques of preparing [[Halftone|half-tone blocks]], [[Photolithography|photo-lithio]], and three-colour ceramic photography.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=16}} Principal Gajjar of Kala Bhavan sent Phalke to [[Ratlam]] to learn three-colour blockmaking, photolitho transfers, colotype and [[darkroom]] printing techniques under the guidance of Babulal Varuvalkar.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=109}}

===1893–1910: Early career===
In 1893, Gajjar allowed Phalke to use the photo studio and laboratory of Kala Bhavan where he started his work under the name of "Shri Phalke's Engraving and Photo Printing". Despite his proficiency in various skills, he did not have a stable family life and had difficulties in making a living. Thus, in 1895, he decided to become a professional [[photographer]] and relocated to [[Godhra]] for doing business. His business did not do well in Godhra and he lost his wife and a child in the 1900 plague epidemic in the city.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=16}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sachin|last=Sharma|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-28/vadodara/32456429_1_godhra-dadasaheb-phalke-father-of-indian-cinema|title=Godhra forgets its days spent with Dadasaheb Phalke|newspaper=the Times of India|date=28 June 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|location=Vadodara|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714184940/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/Godhra-forgets-its-days-spent-with-Dadasaheb-Phalke/articleshow/14444404.cms?referral=PM|archivedate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phalke returned to Baroda and started photography business. It did not run well because of the myth spread across the city that the camera sucks up the energy from a person's body which leads to their death.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=17}} He faced similar resistance from the Prince of Baroda who refused to take photographs with the assumptions that it would shorten his life. Though, the Prince was later convinced by Phalke who went on to advocate the benefits of photography in his court, it did not help Phalke's business.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=110}} He started the business of painting the stage curtains for the drama companies. This got him some basic training in drama production and fetched him a few minor roles in the plays.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=17}}

Phalke learned magic tricks from a German magician who was on a tour in Baroda that time. This helped him use trick photography in his filmmaking. At the end of 1901, Phalke began to hold the public performances of magic using professional name of Professor Kelpha with letters of his last name in reverse order.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=109}}{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=18}} In 1902, Phalke remarried to Saraswati Karandikar, niece of proprietor of [[Annasaheb Kirloskar#Marathi theater companies|Kirloskar Natak Mandali]]. In 1903, he got a job as a photographer and draftsman at the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. However, not satisfied with the job, Phalke resigned in 1906 and set up a printing press at [[Lonavla]] under the name of "Phalke Engraving and Printing Works" with [[R. G. Bhandarkar]] as a partner.{{sfn|Pinney|2013|p=110}}{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=19}}

The press majorly worked for making photo-litho transfers for [[Raja Ravi Varma#Raja Ravi Varma Press|Ravi Verma Press]], owned by painter Raja Ravi Varma. Later, it also started the work of halftone blockmaking and printing and tri-colour printing. With the growing business, the press was shifted to Dadar, Mumbai.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=20}} Later in 1908,{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=23}} Purushottam Mavji replaced Bhandarkar as a partner and the press was renamed as "Laxmi Art Printing Works". Phalke went to Germany in 1909 to buy the necessary colour printing machinery.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=20}}{{efn|name=purification|According to the prevalent society mores,&lt;ref name="Mukherjee2009"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sumita|last=Mukherjee|title=Nationalism, Education and Migrant Identities: The England-returned|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmePAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44|date=16 December 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-27112-1|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phalke had to undergo a purification ceremony, having returned from a foreign country.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=20}}{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=33}}}} Though the printing business grew exponentially, the partners had increasing differences about the running of the press. Soon, Phalke decided to abandon the partnership, without availing any monetary benefits.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=21}}

===1911–1917: Filmmaking struggle, debut, and success===

====Initial struggle and London visit====

After quitting "Laxmi Art Printing Works", Phalke received multiple offers from various financiers to start another printing press but he did not accept any offers.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=21}} On 14 April 1911, Phalke with his elder son Bhalchandra went to see a film, ''Amazing Animals'', at the America India Picture Palace,{{sfn|Kosambi|2017|p=320}} [[Girgaon]], Mumbai.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=24–26}} Surprised at seeing animals on the screen, Bhalchandra informed his mother, Saraswatibai, about his experience earlier that day. None of the family members believed them, so Phalke took his family to see the film the next day. As it was [[Easter]], the theatre screened a film about Jesus, ''The Life of Christ'' (1906) by the French director [[Alice Guy-Blaché]] instead.&lt;ref name="Dharap"&gt;{{cite book|first=B. V.|last=Dharap|title=Indian films|year=1985|publisher=National Film Archive of India|pp=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=24–26}} While watching Jesus on the screen, Phalke envisioned Hindu deities [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] instead and decided to start in the business of "moving pictures".{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=24–26}}

For the next one year, Phalke started collecting various film related material like catalogues, books, and movie making equipment from Europe. He bought a small film camera and reels and started showing movies at night, by focusing candle light on a lens and projecting the pictures on the wall. He watched movies every evening for four to five hours and was deprived of sleep. This put strain on his eyes and he developed [[cataract]] in both eyes. He continued working against the advice of taking rest and lost his sight completely. [[Ophthalmology|Ophthalmologist]] Dr. Prabhakar treated Phalke with the aid of three or four pairs of spectacles which helped him restore the eye sight.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=29}} Phalke wished to go to London to get technical knowledge of filmmaking but had difficulties getting finances for his trip. With the help of Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Abasaheb Chitnis, he secured a sum of ten thousands by mortgaging his insurance policies worth twelve thousands. On 1 February 1912, he boarded a ship for London.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=30–31}}{{efn|name=purification}}

At London, Phalke saw a nameboard of "Bioscope Cine-Weekly" near [[Piccadilly Circus]]. He was a subscriber of the weekly in India. He met its editor, Mr. Kepburn, and explained the purpose of his visit. Kepburn advised Phalke against the idea of filmmaking in India based on the unsuccessful attempts in England and suggested that the Indian climate might not be suitable as well. However, he was impressed with Phalke's dedication and introduced him to the film director, producer, and screenwriter [[Cecil Hepworth]] of [[Walton Studios]]. Hepworth allowed Phalke to visit all the departments of the studio and their workings along with the demonstration of filming. At the advice of Kepburn and Hepworth, he bought Williamson camera for fifty pounds and placed an order for [[Kodak]] raw film and a perforator. Phalke stayed in London for two weeks and returned to India on 1 April 1912. He founded "Phalke Films" on the same day.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=32–33}}&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|first1=K. Moti|last1=Gokulsing|first2=Wimal|last2=Dissanayake|title=Routledge Handbook of Indian Cinemas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djUFmlFbzFkC|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-77284-9|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Film debut with ''Raja Harishchandra''====

After coming back from London, Phalke started looking for a spacious place for shooting the films. Soon, the family shifted from Ismail Building, [[Charni Road]] to Mathura Bhavan Bungalow, [[Dadar]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=34}} He constructed a small glass room at the compound of the bungalow and prepared a dark room and arrangements for processing the film. Imported filmmaking equipment reached Mumbai in May 1912 and Phalke set it up within four days with the help of sketch provided. He also taught his family to perforate and develop the film. To test the working of camera and projector, Phalke filmed the boys and girls in the surroundings to the satisfactory results.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=35}}&lt;ref name="dhanurdhari1946"&gt;{{cite news|title=मुलाखत: सरस्वतीबाई धुंडिराज फाळके|trans-title=Interview: Saraswatibai Dhundiraj Phalke|language=Marathi|newspaper=Dhanurdhari|date=16 February 1946|location=Nashik}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the filmmaking techniques and get financier for the feature film, Phalke decided to make a short film. He planted some peas in a pot and placed a camera in front of it. He shot one frame a day for over a month producing a film just over one minute, of the seed growing, sprouting, and changing into a climber. The short film titled ''Ankurachi Wadh'' (''Growth of a Pea Plant'') and was showed selective individuals. Some of them, including Yashwantrao Nadkarni and Narayanrao Devhare, offered Phalke a loan.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kesari1913"&gt;{{cite news|title=मुलाखत: धुंडिराज गोविंद फाळके|trans-title=Interview: Dhundiraj Govind Phalke|language=Marathi|newspaper=Kesari|date=19 August 1913|location=Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phalke decided to make a film based on the legends of [[Harishchandra]] and wrote the script for it.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=36}} He published advertisements in various newspapers like ''[[Induprakash]]'' calling for the cast and crew required for the film.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=37}} As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/dec/15jha.htm|title=10 pre-release big ones|author=Jha, Subhash K.|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=8 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620044728/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/dec/15jha.htm|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. D. Dabke|Dattatraya Damodar Dabke]] played the lead role of King [[Harishchandra]] and [[Anna Salunke]] as Queen Taramati. Phalke's elder son Bhalchandra was assigned the role, Rohitashva, son of Harishchandra and Taramati.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=38–39}} He was in-charge of the [[scriptment]], [[Film director|direction]], [[Production designer|production design]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Film editing|editing]], and [[Photographic processing|film processing]] and [[Trymbak B. Telang]] handled the camera.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=41}} The filming was completed in six months and 27 days producing a film of 3,700 feet, about four [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reels]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=43}}

The film [[premiere]]d at the Olympia Theatre, Mumbai on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on Saturday, 3 May 1913 at the [[Coronation Cinema]], [[Girgaon]], Mumbai. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the [[Cinema of India|film industry in the country]].{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=46}}{{sfn|Gulzar|Nihalani|Chatterjee|2003|p=29}} The film is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film with its status debated with historians considering [[Dadasaheb Torne]]'s silent film ''[[Shree Pundalik]]'', released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Melissa U.

;Hindustan films
Phalke formed a film company, Hindustan Films in partnership with five businessmen from [[Mumbai]], in the hope that by having the financial aspect of his profession handled by experts in the field, he would be free to pursue the creative aspect. He set up a model studio and trained technicians and actors but, very soon, he ran into insurmountable problems with his partners. In 1920, Phalke resigned from Hindustan Films, made his first announcement of retirement from cinema, and he wrote ''Rangbhoomi'', an acclaimed play. Without him in charge, Hindustan Films ran into deep financial losses, and he was finally persuaded to return. However, Phalke felt constrained by the business and, after directing a few films for the company, he withdrew from it.

;Sound film
The times changed and Phalke fell victim to the emerging technology of sound film. Unable to cope with the talkies, the man who had fathered the Indian film industry became obsolete. His last silent film ''Setubandhan'' was released in 1932 and later released with dubbing. During 1936–1938, he produced his last film ''Gangavataran'' (1937) which was the only talking movie directed by Phalke, before retiring to [[Nashik]], where he died on 16 February 1944.

'''''Dante's Dream''''' (full title '''''Dante's Dream at the Time of the Death of Beatrice''''') is a [[painting]] from [[1871]] by the English [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. It hangs in the [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England.

Rossetti had a lifelong interest in the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]].  The painting was inspired by Dante's poem ''[[La Vita Nuova]]''. In this poem Dante dreams that he is led to the death-bed of [[Beatrice Portinari]], who was the object of his unfulfilled love.  Dante, in black, stands looking towards the dying Beatrice who is lying on a bed.  Two female figures in green hold a canopy over her.  An angel in red holds Dante's hand and leans forward to kiss Beatrice.

In the painting, Rossetti creates a visionary world with complex symbols.  The symbols include the green clothes of Beatrice's attendants, signifying hope; spring flowers in the foreground symbolising purity; and red doves for love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | year = 1994| title = The Walker Art Gallery| edition = | publication-place = London | publisher = Scala| page = 68| isbn = 1-85759-037-6 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Rossetti's largest painting.&lt;ref name=wag/&gt;  The model for Beatrice was Jane Morris, the wife of William Morris. Annie Miller, who is thought to have been one of Rossetti's mistresses,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} posed as a grieving hand maiden. The Walker Art Gallery bought the painting directly from the artist in 1881 for £1575 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1575|1881|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}).&lt;ref name=wag&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/conservation/dantesdream/| title = Dante's Dream: Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1871) | accessdate = 23 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Inflation-fn|UK}}  The acquisition was negotiated by Victorian novelist [[Hall Caine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The sale of ‘Dante’s Dream at the time of the Death of Beatrice’ to the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool: The Correspondence between D.

Again in 1904 the painting was noted to be in "a bad condition" and it was considered that its condition had been worsened by its journey to and from Berlin.  The painting was sent in 1908 to the [[National Gallery]] in London to be [[lining of paintings|relined]], that is, for a new canvas to be glued to the original.  It was then returned to Liverpool. During the Second World War, it was removed from its stretcher, rolled and stored in the basement of the gallery.  In 1941 the painting was moved, together with other large paintings from the gallery, to [[Ellesmere College]] in [[Shropshire]].  It was noted at this time that it had sustained some damage.  Conservation work was carried out on the painting in 1960 and in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/conservation/dantesdream/history.aspx| title = Conservation history of "Dante's Dream"| accessdate = 23 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dante's Dream'' is a painting in [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]], measuring {{convert|216|cm|in|0}} by {{convert|312.4|cm|in|0}}.&lt;ref name=wag/&gt;  It was examined in 2003 and found to be in good condition, with no evidence of any recurrence of the former problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/conservation/dantesdream/today.aspx| title = Dante's Dream today | accessdate = 23 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fertility in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying [[fertility]], which usually refers to successful breeding among humans, although it may also mean successful [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]].  It includes engravings, drawings, [[paintings]], [[sculptures]], [[figurines]], [[portraits]] and even [[literary works]]. In [[Paleolithic art]], fertility is usually associated with figurines with exaggerated parts of human anatomy. 

Many civilisations in history believed in fertility [[deities]]. In [[Classical mythology]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (to the [[Greeks]]) or [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]] (to the [[Romans]]), the personification of [[Earth]], is associated with [[female fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goddess-guide.com/greek-goddess-of-the-earth.html Greek Goddess of the Earth&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often depicted with a ripe [[bosom]], a child-bearing [[hip]] and a [[nude]] body in some cases.&lt;ref name=Fertility&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/mar/30/art.familyandrelationships Laura Cumming on fertility in art&lt;/ref&gt; Animals that [[reproduce]] prolifically are also seen in art depicting fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=9xkhBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT577&amp;lpg=PT577&amp;dq=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=La01CAx3OF&amp;sig=bIowIpN3ZECwWjj3zvnf2akWJL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxrIDa1c7TAhXFPBoKHYhTBboQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Animals+that+%5B%5Breproduce%5D%5D+prolifically+are+also+seen+in+art+depicting+fertility.&amp;f=false|title=Animals into Art|first=Howard|last=Morphy|date=30 October 2014|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional cultures==
[[File:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]], considered to be an example of fertility in art.]]
Fertility was present in art traditionally in many different forms. These include ceramic figures from some [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with fertility. Palielothic statuettes had round [[abdomen|bellies]], short [[heads]] and short, pointed [[legs]]. They also exaggerate the [[hips]], breasts, [[thighs]], or [[vulva]] of the subject.

Two of the earliest known possible depictions of fertility in art are the ''[[Venus of Willendorf]]'' (c. 25,000 [[BCE]]), an [[Oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]] figurine of a woman whose breasts and hips have been exaggerated to emphasise her fertility found in [[Austria]] and the ''Fertility Goddess'' of Cernavoda (c. 5,000 BCE) found in [[Romania]], a small figurine that is meant to possibly show fertility. Historians consider these figurines to be goddesses. It is believed that worshippers would push the pointed legs into the earth to erect a temporary [[shrine]] for the goddess. The rotundity and [[obesity]] of these figurines were seen as attractive in early times when [[food]] was scarce.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 747&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western art==
===Early forms===
[[File:TITIAN - Venus Anadyomene (National Galleries of Scotland, c. 1520. Oil on canvas, 75.8 x 57.6 cm).jpg|thumb|220px|[[Titian]], copy of the ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' ]]
[[Fertility]] is often shown in artworks related to [[Classical mythology]]. Paintings of the [[Greek goddess]] of love [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the [[Romans]]) often portray her as [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] and fertile. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' states that Aphrodire (Venus) was born from the sperm/foam of the castrated genitals of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]'' is a painting by [[Apelles]] that shows Aphrodite rising from the sea. The original painting is now lost, but a colossal copy of the painting exists, painted by the artist [[Titian]] and known as [[Venus Anadyomene (Titian)|''Venus Anadyomene'' by Titian]]. It depicts Venus (Aphrodite) rising from the sea and wringing her wet hair after her birth, a pose inspired by an account of the original painting by Apelles.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 140 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/8687/venus-rising-sea-venus-anadyomene-about-1520 Venus Rising from the Sea ('Venus Anadyomene') (About 1520)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demeter]], the Greek goddess of [[agriculture]], [[grain crops]], [[fertility]] and motherly relationships is often shown carrying a basket of [[apples]] in [[sculptures]], which are meant to show fertility.&lt;ref name=Fertility/&gt;
[[File:Ostara by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|170px|left|[[Johannes Gehrts]]: Eostre, the [[Germanic mythology|Germanic goddess]] flies through the heavens surrounded by Roman-inspired [[putti]], beams of light, rabbits and birds. Germanic people look up at the goddess from the realm below.]]

[[Hares]] are often portrayed in art as a symbol of [[reincarnation|rebirth]] and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1964)p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] goddess [[Eostre]], whose [[theme (arts)|themes]] are fertility and rebirth, is often surrounded by hares in art. 
In Christianity, white rabbits are considered to be symbols of rebirth and fertility and are seen on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]], where they are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth_(biblical_figure)|Elizabeth]].
In [[Jan Van Eyck]]'s ''[[Arnolfini portrait]]'', a carving of [[Margaret the Virgin|St. Margaret of Antioch]] (patron saint of childbirth) appears in the center background of the painting. The presence of this symbol in the painting either promises fertility in the marriage or announces the pregnancy of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 749 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===
[[Paula Modersohn-Becker]]'s series of self-portraits showing her pregnant even before she had actually been so represent her fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 64 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Jewish Bride]]'' is a painting of a couple joined in love. Despite the title, none of the subjects in the painting are [[Jewish]]. The Painting portrays the [[fertility]] of the young couple, particularly that of the woman.

The shoe tied to the happy couple's car can be seen to represent the fertile vagina, as with [[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe]], a nursery rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman, ''The Rationale of the Dirty Joke'' (1973) Vol II p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Botticelli]]'s ''Primavera'', on one hand the [[Charites|Three Graces]] represented by nubile young women embody the sexual powers of springtime while opposite them [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]], the goddess of Spring is a symbol of motherhood and, by her distribution of the roses gathered in her skirt, believed to represent the good things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Swinglehurts, ''Botticelli'' (1994) p. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Picasso]]' paintings of [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], everywhere there is green, the colour of fertility and nature's renewal.&lt;ref&gt;John Golding, in D. H Kahnweiler et al eds., ''Picasso 1881/1973'' (1973) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; In his series of sleeping nudes, Picasso may have been influenced by the much reproduced [[Hal Saflieni Hypogeum|Hal Saflieni]] ''Reclining Woman'' and the Venuses of [[Venus of Lespugue|Lespugue]] and Willendorf, which with their heavy, ripe, bulging forms can be viewed as ancestresses of Picasso's images of female fecundity.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, p. 115-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In ''[[The Bacchae]]'', an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] playwright [[Euripides]], Dionysus is mentioned as a male fertility god that represented a special kind of vitality that is sometimes referred to as the [[Energy (esotericism)|Life Force]]. It is described a force which, in itself, is neither good nor bad, but one that simply exists.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Curry trans., ''Euripides'' (Cambridge 1981) p. 164 and p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

When at the close of [[Possession (Byatt novel)|''Possession: A Romance'']], a novel by [[A. S. Byatt]], the two lovers Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte finally unite in the midst of a great storm. They wake the next day to find that the whole world had a strange new smell. It is described as 'a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples.' It was the described as the smell of death and destruction, however, it was said to smell fresh, lively and hopeful.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (1991) p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1903UncleTomFilm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Still from [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which was one of the first "full length" movies. The still shows Eliza telling Uncle Tom that she has been sold and that she is running away to save her child.]]

A number of film adaptations of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' have been made over the years. Most of these movies were created during the [[silent film]] era (with ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' being the most-filmed story of that time period).&lt;ref name="UTCFilm"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1930s, [[Hollywood]] studios have considered the story too controversial for another adaptation (although one foreign film and a made-for-TV movie have been created). Characters, themes and plot elements from ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' have also influenced a large number of other movies, including ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), while also inspiring numerous [[animated cartoon]]s.

==Silent film versions==

[[File:Uncle Tom's Cabin featuring Irving Cummings LCCN2005679771.jpg|thumb|Poster for the [[World Film Company]] production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' (1914), part of the [[National Film Registry]]]]
''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was the most-filmed story of the [[silent film]] era&lt;ref name="UTCFilm"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with at least nine known adaptations between 1903 – 1927. This popularity was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and "[[Tom shows]]", meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.&lt;ref name="UTCFilm"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/fihp.html Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

*A 1903 version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' was one of the earliest "full-length" movies (although "full-length" at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv03hp.html The First Uncle Tom's Cabin Film: Edison-Porter's Slavery Days (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This film, directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]], used white actors in [[blackface]] in the major roles and black performers only as [[Extra (actor)|extras]]. This version was evidently similar to many of the "Tom Shows" of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;
*Another film version from 1903 was directed by [[Siegmund Lubin]] and starred Lubin as [[Simon Legree]]. While no copies of Lubin's film still exist, according to accounts the movie was similar to Porter's version and reused the sets and costumes from a "Tom Show."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/lubinhp.html "Duping" Porter: Sigmund Lubin's Production (1903)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1910, a 3-Reel Vitagraph Company of America production was directed by [[J. Stuart Blackton]] and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to ''The Dramatic Mirror,'' this film was "a decided innovation" in motion pictures and "the first time an American company" released a dramatic film in 3 reels. Until then, "full-length" movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred [[Florence Turner]], [[Mary Fuller]], Edwin R. Phillips, [[Flora Finch]], [[Genevieve Tobin]], and Carlyle Blackwell Sr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv10hp1.html The 3-Reel Vitagraph Production (1910)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1910 Thanhouser film)|Another 1910 version by the Thanhouser Company]] was directed by Barry O'Neil, starred Frank Hall Crane as Uncle Tom, Anna Rosemond as Eliza, [[Marie Eline]] as Little Eva, and Grace Eline as Topsy.
*A 1913 release was directed by Otis Turner and adapted by [[Allan Dwan]]. It starred [[Edward Alexander (actor)|Edward Alexander]], [[Margarita Fischer]], [[Harry A. Pollard]], [[Iva Shepard]] and Gertrude Short.
*Another 1913 release was directed by [[Sidney Olcott]] and starred [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].
*A 1914 version was directed by William Robert Daly. It was adapted Edward McWade from the play adaptation by George L. Aiken. It starred [[Sam Lucas]], Teresa Michelena, Marie Eline (again), Royce D. Applegate and Boots Wall. This was the first "white" film to have an African-American star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gevinson|first=Alan|title=American Film Institute catalog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsoUXGZSxZcC&amp;pg=PA1079|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-20964-8|page=1079}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was added to the [[National Film Registry]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;King, Susan. [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-national-film-registry-20121217,0,1057524.story "National Film Registry selects 25 films for preservation "] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (December 19, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) deliberately used a cabin similar to Uncle Tom's home in the film's dramatic climax, where several white Southerners unite with their former enemy (Yankee soldiers) to defend what the film's caption says is their "[[Aryan race|Aryan]] birthright." According to scholars, this reuse of such a familiar cabin would have resonated with, and been understood by, audiences of the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Playing the Race Card: Melodramas of Black and White from Uncle Tom to O. J. Simpson'' by Linda Williams, Princeton Univ. Press, 2001, page 115. Also [http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/griffithhp.html H. B. Stowe's Cabin in D. W. Griffith's Movie], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1918 film)|1918 version]] was directed  and adapted by J. Searle Dawley. It starred [[Marguerite Clark]] (as both Little Eva '''''and''''' Topsy), [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]], Florence Carpenter, Frank Losee and Walter P. Lewis.
*A [[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1927 film)|1927 version]] was directed by [[Harry A. Pollard]] (who'd played Uncle Tom in the 1913 release of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''). This two-hour movie spent more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era (at a cost of $1.8 million). Black actor [[Charles Sidney Gilpin|Charles Gilpin]] was originally cast in the title role, but was fired after the studio decided his "portrayal was too aggressive." James B. Lowe then took over the character of Tom. One difference in this film from the novel is that after Tom dies, he returns as a [[vengeful spirit]] and confronts Simon Legree before leading the slave owner to his death. Black media outlets of the time praised the film, but the studio&amp;mdash;fearful of a backlash from Southern and white film audiences&amp;mdash;ended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film's opening at a slave auction (where a mother is torn away from her baby). The story was adapted by Pollard, Harvey F. Thew and A.P. Younger, with titles by Walter Anthony. It starred James B. Lowe, [[Virginia Grey]], [[George Siegmann]], Margarita Fischer, [[Mona Ray]] and [[Madame Sul-Te-Wan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv27hp.html Universal Super Jewel Production (1927)], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Babbuncletomscabin.jpg|right|thumb|A movie poster from [[Kroger Babb]]'s 1965 production of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''.]] --&gt;
A number of movies have utilized characters, plots, and themes from ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', including ''An Uncle Tom's Cabin Troupe'' (1913); the Duncan Sisters' ''Topsy and Eva'' (1927); "Uncle Tom's Uncle," a 1926 [[Our Gang]] episode which has the kids creating their own "Tom Show"&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1938's ''[[Everybody Sing (film)|Everybody Sing]]'' (which features [[Judy Garland]] in [[blackface]]).&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; But for several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation. In 1946, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] considered filming the story, but ceased production after protests led by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/cameos/hollywood.html Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hollywood: 1929-1956], Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in film==
Edwin S. Porter’s 1903 film production, ''Uncle Tom’s Cabin; or, Slavery Days'', was based largely off of the theatrical productions of the same story common during that time. The movie lived up to racial stereotypes in wide circulation, and scenes were included to showcase slave dances. While African-American extras made appearances, white actors in blackface played the main slave characters. The film storyline strays widely from the plot of the novel, as exemplified by a scene completely independent of the novel depicting a steamboat race. The film assumes the audience is generally familiar with the plot due to the story’s long running popularity.&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt;
 
Universal Studio’s 1927 release of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1927 film)|Uncle Tom’s Cabin]]'' was an epic film and a step forward for Stowe's work. While certain stigmatic similarities remained, such as scenes depicting outlandish slave dances and Topsy’s flamboyant unruliness, this version was less outmoded in its characterization of slaves. More than earlier adaptations, this film took care to accurately follow the book, and some lines in the movie are direct quotes from the text. Integral characters omitted from previous films were brought to the forefront, such as George Harris. While the overall story remained intact, the writers did take some liberties. For instance, after escaping to freedom, Eliza and Harry are captured by the lawyer Marks and runaway slave tracker Tom Loker and sold down the river as opposed to receiving aid from kindly Quakers. Harry is separated from his mother when purchased by a nameless slave-owner before eventually being reunited with his father. Eliza is sold off to Simon Legree at the same auction as Uncle Tom. This alteration omits the entire subplot involving the Harris family’s escape to Canada, weaving the story into one coherent plot. Another twist in the storyline occurs when Union soldiers on the march through the south liberate hundreds of slaves along the way, including the residents of Legree’s plantation. The director moved the story forward historically to capitalize on the public’s patriotic sympathies.
 
Socially, this film was more progressive than previous versions. Fewer characters were portrayed in blackface (Topsy is an outstanding exception) and less of an emphasis was put on exotic slave customs. Still, the majority of the screen time is dedicated to the white actors. African American actor James B. Lowe played the character Uncle Tom, but was on screen for less than 9 minutes and speaks less than a dozen lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/utc/onstage/films/mv27hp.html Universal Super Jewel Production (1927)], ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film title design''' is a term describing the craft and design of [[motion picture]] [[title sequence]]s. Since the beginning of the film form, it has been an essential part of any motion picture. Originally a motionless piece of artwork called ''title art'', it slowly evolved into an artform of its own.

In the beginning, main title design consisted of the movie studio's name and/or logo and the presentation of the main characters along with the actor’s names, generally using that same artwork presented on [[title card]]s. Most independent or major studio had their own title art logo used as the background for their screen credits and they used it almost exclusively on every movie that they produced.

Then, early in the 1930s, the more progressive motion picture studios started to change their approach in presenting their screen credits. The major studios took on the challenge of improving the way they introduced their movies. They made the decision to present a more complete list of credits to go with a higher quality of artwork to be used in their screen credits.

A '''main title designer''' is the designer of the movie title. The manner in which title of a movie is displayed on screen is widely considered an art form. It's often been classified as motion graphics, title [[Graphic design|design]], [[title sequence]]s and animated [[Motion picture credits|credits]]. The title sequence is often presented through [[Animation|animated]] visuals and [[Kinetic art|kinetic]] type while the credits are introduced on screen.

From the mid-1930s through the late-1940s the major film studios led the way in Film Title Art by employing artists like [[Al Hirschfeld]], [[George Petty]], Ted Ireland (Vencentini), William Galraith Crawford, Symeon Shimin, [[Alvan "Hap" Hadley]], and Jacques Kapralik.

Quality artists met this challenge by designing their artwork to "set a mood" and "capture the audience" before the movie started. An overall 10% jump in box-office receipts was proof that this was a profitable improvement to the introduction of their motion pictures.

One famous example of the form is the work of [[Saul Bass]] in the 1950s and 1960s. His modish title sequences for the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] were key in setting the style and mood of the movie even before the action began, and contributed to Hitchcock's "house style" that was a key element in his approach to marketing.  Another well known designer is [[Maurice Binder]], who designed the often erotic titles for many of the [[James Bond films]] from the 1960s to the 1980s.  After his death, [[Daniel Kleinman]] has done several of the titles.

However, the leader in the industry in the 1990s - 2000 was [[Cinema Research Corporation]], with over 400 movie titles to its credit in that time period alone, and almost 700 titles in total from the 1950s to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinema Research Titles (1990s) |url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0058110/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern technology has enabled a much more fantastical way of presenting them through use of programs such as [[Adobe After Effects]] and Maxon [[Cinema4D]]. Although a form of editing, it's considered a different role and art form rather than of a traditional [[film editor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6483">[[File:Fontaine de l'Observatoire, July 4, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Fontaine de l'Observatoire (1867-1874)]]

The '''Fontaine de l'Observatoire''' is a monumental fountain located in the Jardin Marco Polo, south of the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]] in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] of Paris, with sculpture by [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]].   It was dedicated in 1874. It is also known as the ''Fontaine des Quatre-Parties-du-Monde'', for the [[Four continents|four parts of the world]] embodied by its female figures, or simply the  ''Fontaine Carpeaux''.

== History ==

The fountain was first proposed in 1866 as part of the creation of the new grand avenue du Luxembourg,  one of the major projects of the plan of [[Baron Haussmann]] for the reconstruction of Paris.  The project was under the direction of [[Gabriel Davioud]], the director of the Service of Parks and Plantations of the Prefecture of Paris. Davioud was a trained classical sculptor, and he was responsible for the design of the Paris fountains, squares, gates, lamp-posts, benches, pavilions and other architectural details during the [[Second French Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Béatrice Lamoitier, "Le règne de Davioud",  in ''Paris et ses fontaines'' (pg. 180).&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:FontaineQuatrePartiesDuMonde06.jpg|thumb|left|Ensemble setting]]
The avenue du Luxembourg project called for the creation of two new squares, with ornamental lamps and columns, statues, and a fountain.  The fountain was located on the tree-lined axis between the ''[[Observatoire de Paris]]'' and the [[Palais du Luxembourg]].  The sculpture of the fountain was supposed to be related to the observatory, and instructions of Davioud to the sculptor were simply not to block the view of the domed observatory or the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Béatrice Lamoitier, "Entre Innovation et Tradition", in ''Paris et ses fontaines'', pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sculptor chosen,  [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]] (1827–1875),  had been a pupil of [[François Rude]], the sculptor who had made the most famous group of sculptures on the [[Arc de Triomphe]].  Carpeaux won the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1854.  In 1869 he made the sculptures of ''[[La Danse (Carpeaux)|La Danse]]'' on the facade of the [[Paris Opera]] which had caused a scandal because of the free expression of the sculpture and the unrestrained emotions on the faces of the statues, much different from the calm expressions of neo-classical statues.   
[[File:Fontaine quatre parties monde observatoire place camille jullian.jpg|thumb|[[Emmanuel Frémiet]]'s horses]]
The first studies Carpeaux made were of four standing female figures representing the four points of the compass holding a celestial sphere over their heads, but Carpeaux was dissatisfied with the immobility of the figures.  In his next models he transformed the women into representatives of the [[Four Continents|four parts of the world]], Europe, Asia, Africa and America, twisting their bodies to turn the sphere, giving the sculpture motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue des peintures et sculptures de Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux à Valenciennes'', Valenciennes, 1978 (pg. 80-82.).  Cited by Beatrice LaMoitier, this book illustrates two of the studies Carpeaux he did for the fountain.&lt;/ref&gt;   
The sculptor Eugène Legrain (1837–1915), a student of Carpeaux, was commissioned to make the sphere, and the sculptor [[Emmanuel Frémiet]], the nephew and pupil of the sculptor [[François Rude]], made the horses in the basin around the statue.   Louis Villeminot created the garlands of seashells and aquatic plants which decorated the basin, and Legrain designed the zodiac band around the sphere. The project received one correction from the Director of the Observatory, who noted in 1872 that the signs of the zodiac on the band around the equator of the sphere should actually be on an [[ecliptic]]  circle.&lt;ref&gt;LaMoitier, pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work on the project was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and the uprising of the Paris Commune. It was resumed in 1872, when plaster models were shown at the [[Paris Salon]], the first since the fall of the Commune, and finished in 1874. Casting was by Matifat.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ''The Grove dictionary of art: From Monet to Cézanne : late 19th-century'' p 62f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carpeaux was in poor health, and watched from a distance as the statues were installed in the fountain. He died the following year.

== Critical Reaction ==

The first critical reaction to the sculpture, based on the plaster models presented in the Salon, was hostile. The critic Jules Clarétie wrote: "This thin, unhealthy women, with their wasted flanks, their elongated, furrowed  thighs, are twisting around in a bizarre circle without any grace....One has to ask by what aberration of spirit, eye and hand one could compose such a group of wild, vulgar and wrinkled dancers." &lt;ref&gt;Jules Clarétie, ''Peintres et sculpteurs contemporains'', 1874. Pg. 192-196 contain a discussion of the work of Carpeaux written in 1872.  Citied by Beatrice LaMoitier. Excerpt translated by D.R. Siefkin.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ten years later, however, after Carpeaux was dead. Clarétie reversed his judgement and praised the fountain as one of the masterpieces of Carpeaux.&lt;ref&gt;Jules Clarétie, ''Peintres et sculpteurs contemporains, 1re série, Aristes decedes de 1870 a 1880''. Paris, Bibliotheque des Bibliophiles, 1882, pg. 183-185. Cited by LaMoitier.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giulio Paolini''' (born 5 November 1940) is an [[Italy|Italian]] artist associated with both [[Arte Povera]] and [[Conceptual Art]].&lt;ref name=Nota1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/biografia.php |title= Biography |publisher= Artist's official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Paolini was born in [[Genoa]]. After a childhood spent in [[Bergamo]], he moved with his family to [[Turin]] where he still lives today. He attended the Giambattista Bodoni State Industrial Technical School of Graphics and Photography, graduating in the Graphics department in 1959. He had been interested in [[visual arts|art]] from an early age, visiting museums and galleries and reading art periodicals. Towards the end of the 1950s he approached [[painting]], trying some pictures of an abstract nature, close to [[monochrome]]. The discovery of [[Graphic design|modern graphics]] during his studies and the fact that there were architecture magazines around the house – his elder brother Cesare (1937–1983) was an architect – contributed to orienting him towards a line of research aimed at zeroing the image.

He did his first work in 1960, ''Disegno geometrico'' (''Geometrical Drawing''), which consists of the squaring in ink of a canvas painted with white tempera. This preliminary gesture of any representation whatever would remain the point of “eternal recurrence” in the universe of Paolini’s thought: topical moment and original instant that revealed the artist to himself, representing the conceptual foundation of all his future work.

In the early 1960s, Paolini developed his research by focusing on the very components of the picture: on the painter’s tools and on the space of representation. For his first solo show – in 1964 at Gian Tommaso Liverani’s La Salita gallery in [[Rome]] – he presented some rough wooden panels leant against or hanging on the wall, suggesting an exhibition in the process of being set up. The show was seen by Carla Lonzi and Marisa Volpi who would shortly afterwards write the first critical texts on the young artist. In 1965 Paolini began to use photography, which allowed him to extend his inquiry to the relationship between artist and work (''Delfo'', 1965; ''1421965'', 1965). In the same year, through Carla Lonzi, he met [[Luciano Pistoi]], owner of the Galleria Notizie in Turin, who introduced him to a new circle of friends and collectors and became his main dealer until the beginning of the 1970s.

Between 1967 and 1972, the critic [[Germano Celant]] invited him to take part in [[Arte Povera]] exhibitions which resulted in his name being associated with that movement. In fact Paolini’s position was clearly distinct from the vitalistic climate and “existential phenomenology” that distinguished the propositions of Celant’s artists. He repeatedly declared an intimate belonging to the history of art, identifying programmatically with the lineage of all the artists who had preceded him. Some of his best known works can be traced back to this purpose, extraneous to the militant scene of the late 1960s: ''Giovane che guarda Lorenzo Lotto'' (''Young Man Looking at Lorenzo Lotto'', 1967), the “self-portraits” from Poussin and Rousseau (1968) and the pictures in which he reproduces details of old masters’ paintings (''L’ultimo quadro di Diego Velázquez'', 1968; ''Lo studio'', 1968). Among Paolini’s main references in those years were [[Jorge Luis Borges]], to whom he paid homage on several occasions, and [[Giorgio de Chirico]] from whom he borrowed the constituent phrase of the work ''Et.quid.amabo.nisi.quod.ænigma est'' (1969).

His first official acknowledgements came with the 1970s: from shows abroad, which placed him on the international avant-garde gallery circuit, to his first museum exhibitions. In 1970 he took part in the [[Venice Biennale]] with ''Elegia'' (''Elegy'', 1969), the first work in which he used the [[plaster cast]] of a [[classical antiquity|classic]] subject: the eye of Michelangelo’s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' with a fragment of mirror applied to the pupil. One of the outstanding themes in this decade was a backward glance at his own work: from literal citation of celebrated paintings he arrived at self-citation, proposing a historicizing in perspective of his oeuvre. Works such as ''La visione è simmetrica?'' (''Is Vision Symmetrical?'', 1972) or ''Teoria delle apparenze'' (''Theory of Appearances'', 1972) allude to the idea of the picture as potential container of all past and future works. Another theme investigated with particular interest in this period was that of the double and the copy, which found expression above all in the group of works entitled ''Mimesi'' (''Mimesis'', 1975–76) consisting of two plaster casts of the same classical statue set face to face, calling into question the concept of [[mimesis|reproduction]] and representation itself.

The period most dense in exhibitions and retrospectives, with the publication of important monographs, was the 1980s. In the first half of the decade an explicitly theatrical dimension began to establish itself with works marked by fragmentation and dispersion (''La caduta di Icaro'', 1982; ''Melanconia ermetica'', 1983) or distinguished by theatrical figures such as eighteenth century valets de chambre (''Trionfo della rappresentazione'', 1984). Paolini’s poetics was considerably enriched by literary attributions and [[Mythology|mythological]] references, as well as by the introduction of cosmic images. In the late 1980s the artist's reflections turned mainly on the very act of exhibiting. Starting with his solo show at the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes|Musée des Beaux-Arts]] in Nantes (1987) the concept of the exhibition – its premises and its promises – became progressively configured as the actual subject of the works themselves.

In the course of the 1990s, further inquiry into the idea of exhibiting spread into other, new modalities. The increasingly complex set-ups often followed a typology that was additive (seriality, juxtaposition) or centrifugal (dispersion or dissemination from a central nucleus) or centripetal (concentration and implosive superimposition). The place of the exhibition became the stage par excellence of the “theatre of the opus”, meaning of the work in its doing and undoing: the place that defined the very eventuality of its happening (''Esposizione universale'', 1992; ''Teatro dell’opera'', 1993; ''Essere o non essere'', 1995). Completion of the work was moreover constantly deferred, leaving the spectator in perennial expectation: just what the artist always feels from the start at his worktable, waiting for the work to manifest itself.

In the 2000s, another theme especially dear to Paolini took on special importance, as much in his artwork as in his writings: the identity of the author, his condition as spectator, his lack of contact with a work that always precedes and supersedes him.

Paolini’s poetics and artistic practice as a whole may be characterised as a self-reflective meditation on the dimension of art, on its timeless “classicality” and its perspective without vanishing point. By means of [[photography]], [[collage]], [[plaster cast]]s and [[drawing]] his intention is always to inquire, with great conceptual rigour, into the tautological and at the same time metaphysical nature of artistic practice.&lt;ref name=Nota1/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
[[File:Paolini - 'L'Altra Figura' (1984).jpg|thumb|''L'Altra Figura'' (1984) in the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]]]
Since his first solo show ([[Rome]], 1964) Paolini has exhibited in art galleries and museums worldwide. Collaboration with avant-garde Italian galleries of the 1960s and 1970s (La Salita, [[Rome]]; Galleria Notizie, [[Turin]]; Galleria dell'Ariete, [[Milan]]; Galleria del Leone, [[Venice]]; La Tartaruga, [[Rome]]; L'Attico, Rome; Studio Marconi, [[Milan]]; Modern Art Agency, [[Naples]]) was swiftly integrated with regular presence in important foreign galleries (from 1971 Paul Maenz, [[Cologne]]; from 1972 [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend]], [[New York City]]; from 1973 Annemarie Verna, [[Zurich]]; from 1976 [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]]; from 1977 [[Lisson Gallery]], [[London]]). Since the 1980s Paolini has mainly been represented by the galleries Christian Stein, [[Milan]]; Massimo Minini, [[Brescia]]; Alfonso Artiaco, [[Naples]]; [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Yvon Lambert]], [[Paris]] and Marian Goodman, [[New York City]].

The great anthological exhibitions took off towards the late 1970s (Istituto di Storia dell'Arte dell'Università di Parma, [[Parma]], 1976; Städtisches Museum, [[Mönchengladbach]], 1977; Mannheimer Kunstverein, [[Mannheim]], 1977; Museo Diego Aragona Pignatelli Cortes, [[Naples]], 1978; [[Stedelijk Museum]], [[Amsterdam]], touring to The Museum of Modern Art, [[Oxford]], 1980) and culminated in the second half of the 1980s (Le Nouveau Musée, [[Villeurbanne]], 1984, touring to [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Charleroi]]; [[Neue Staatsgalerie|Staatsgalerie]], Stuttgart, 1986; [[Castle of Rivoli|Castello di Rivoli]], [[Rivoli (TO)|Rivoli]], 1986; [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]], [[Rome]], 1988; Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna, Villa delle Rose, [[Bologna]], 1990). Outstanding recent solo shows were held in [[Graz]] (Neue Galerie im Landesmuseum Joanneum, 1998), [[Turin]] (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, 1999), [[Verona]] (Galleria d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea Palazzo Forti, 2001), [[Milan]] (Fondazione Prada, 2003), [[Winterthur]] ([[Kunstmuseum Winterthur]], 2005) and [[Münster]] (Westfälisches Landesmuseum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte, 2005). For the season 2002/2003 in the [[Vienna State Opera]] Giulio Paolini designed a large scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series "Safety Curtain", conceived by [[museum in progress]].&lt;ref name="Safety Curtain by Giulio Paolini"&gt;[http://www.mip.at/creations/eiserner-vorhang-2002-2003 "Safety Curtain 2002/2003"], [[museum in progress]], Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;

Group exhibitions, innumerable since his participation in the 1961 ''Premio Lissone'', include the shows connected with [[Arte Povera]] (1967–1971, 1984–85, 1997, 2001–02), the main international exhibitions of Italian art and many of the most significant shows dedicated to artistic development in the second half of the 20th century (for example: ''Vitalità del negativo'', [[Rome]] 1970; ''Contemporanea'', Rome 1973; ''Projekt '74'', [[Cologne]] 1974; ''Europe in the Seventies'', [[Chicago]] and touring through the [[United States]] 1977–78; ''Westkunst'', [[Cologne]] 1981; ''‘60–'80': Attitudes/concepts/images'', [[Amsterdam]] 1982; ''An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1984; ''The European Iceberg'', [[Toronto]] 1985; ''Transformations in Sculpture'', [[New York City]] 1985; ''Bilderstreit'', [[Cologne]] 1989; ''1965–1975: Reconsidering the Object of Art'', [[Los Angeles]] 1995; ''The Last Picture Show: Artists Using Photography, 1960–82'', [[Minneapolis]] and touring 2003–05). Paolini has appeared several times at [[documenta]] Kassel (1972, 1977, 1982, 1992) and the [[Venice Biennale]] (1970, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, 1993, 1995, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/esposizioni_personali.php |title= Exhibitions |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Whitechapel Gallery in London staged Giulio Paolini: To Be or Not To Be, an exhibition of Paolini's sculptures, exhibitions and installations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/giulio-paolini-to-be-or-not-to-be/&lt;/ref&gt; "Giorgio De Chirico-Giulio Paolini Giuilo Paolini Giorgio De Chirico" Center for Italian Modern Art, Oct. 13, 2016-June 24, 2017, New York, NY, italianmodernart.org

==Set design==

In the course of his career Paolini has also worked in the [[scenic design|theatre]], from the sets and costumes for [[Vittorio Alfieri]]’s ''Bruto II'', directed by Gualtiero Rizzi (1969), to his collaboration with Carlo Quartucci and the Zattera di Babele in the 1980s. Outstanding recent projects include the sets for [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]’s [[Die Walküre]] (2005) and [[Parsifal]] (2007) at the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples, directed by Federico Tiezzi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/scenografie.php |title= Set Design |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==

Right from the start Paolini’s productions have been accompanied by written reflections and comments, seen as elements complementary to and parallel with the image. His first collection of texts, ''Idem'', was published by [[Giulio Einaudi|Einaudi]] in 1975 with an essay by [[Italo Calvino]]. Recent collections include ''Quattro passi. Nel museo senza muse'' (Einaudi, Turin 2006) and ''Dall'Atlante al Vuoto (in ordine alfabetico)'' published by Mondadori Electa, Milan 2010. In 1995 Maddalena Disch edited a complete edition of his writings and interviews (''Giulio Paolini: la voce del pittore. Scritti e interviste 1965–1995'', ADV Publishing House, [[Lugano]]).

The first monograph on the artist, by [[Germano Celant]], was published in 1972 in [[New York City]] by [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend Press]]. The most significant books on Giulio Paolini, including critical anthologies and a wealth of documentation, are the catalogues brought out on the occasion of his solo shows in [[Parma]] (1976), [[Ravenna]] (1985, ''Giulio Paolini. Tutto qui'', Edizioni Essegi, Ravenna), [[Stuttgart]] (1986), [[Rome]] (1988), [[Graz]] (1998) and [[Milan]] (2003). In 1990 Francesco Poli edited a monograph for Edizioni Lindau of Turin. In 1992 Marco Noire published ''Impressions graphiques. L’opera grafica 1967–1992 di Giulio Paolini'', a general catalogue of his prints and multiples. In 2008 the publisher Skira of Milan brought out a two volume Catalogue Raisonné of Paolini's works from 1960 to 1999, edited by Maddalena Disch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionepaolini.it/bibliografia.php |title= Bibliography |publisher= Artist’s official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Grupo Cine Liberación''''' ("'''The Liberation Film Group'''") was an [[Argentine film movement]] that took place during the end of the 1960s. It was founded by [[Fernando Solanas]], [[Octavio Getino]] and [[Gerardo Vallejo (film-maker)|Gerardo Vallejo]], and became closely linked to the [[Peronist]] Left. In the subsequent years other films directors (''[[grupo Realizadores de Mayo]]'', [[Enrique Juárez|Enrique]] and [[Nemesio Juárez]], [[Pablo Szir]], etc.) revolved around the active core of the ''Cine Liberación'' group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.kinoki.net/muere-gerardo-vallejo-fundador-de-grupo-cine-liberacion/ Muere Gerardo Vallejo, fundador de Grupo Cine Liberación] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140519235324/http://noticias.kinoki.net/muere-gerardo-vallejo-fundador-de-grupo-cine-liberacion/ |date=19 May 2014 }}, ''[[Noticias de Cine Social]]'', 8 February 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vallejo&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/5-5319-2007-02-07.html Gerardo Vallejo, emblema del cine militante de los ‘60 y ‘70], ''[[Pagina 12]]'', 7 February 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Along with [[Raymundo Gleyzer]]'s ''[[Cine de la Base]]'' in Argentina, the Brazilian ''[[Cinema Novo]]'', the [[Cuban revolutionary cinema]] and the Bolivian film director [[Jorge Sanjinés]], the ''Grupo Cine Liberación'' was part of the ''[[Tercer Cine]]'' movement.&lt;ref name=Tercer&gt;Oscar Ranzani, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/cultura/7-42538-2004-10-20.html La revolución es un sueño eterno], ''[[Pagina 12]]'', 20 October 2004 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of ''Tercer Cine'' (or Third Film, in an obvious allusion to the [[Third World]]) was explicitly opposed to "First World" cinema, that is, Hollywood, and was also contrasted with [[Auteur theory|auteur film]], deciding to engage itself more explicitly in the social and political movements.&lt;ref name=Tercer/&gt;

From his exile in [[Francoist Spain]], [[Juan Peron]] sent in 1971 two letters to Octavio Getino, one congratulating him for this work of Liberation Film Group, and another concerning two [[film documentaries|documentaries]] that were to be done with him (''La Revolución Justicialista'' and ''Actualización política y doctrinaria'').&lt;ref name=Tercer/&gt; 

The [[graphism|graphist]] [[Raimundo Ongaro]], also founder of the ''[[CGT de los Argentinos]]'' (CGTA) trade-union, was also close to this movement.

== Theory and practice ==
One of the principles of the ''Grupo Cine Liberación'' was to produce [[Anonymity|anonymous]] films, in an endeavour to favorite [[collective creation]] processes, to create a collective discourse, and also to protect themselves from political repression. According to Lucio Mufud, the collective [[authorship]] movement of the 1960s and 1970s was "among other things, about erasing any authorial mark. It concerned itself, on the one hand, with protecting the militant creators from state repression. But it was also about having their voice coincide with the 'voice of the people.'&lt;ref name=Mufud&gt;Lucio Mufud, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/subnotas/7408-2455-2007-08-25.html Un llamado a transformar la realidad], ''[[Pagina 12]], 25 August 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Another similar group included the ''[[Grupo Cine de la Base]]'' (The Base Film Group), which included the film director [[Raymundo Gleyzer]], who produced ''Los Traidores'' (The Traitors, 1973), and was later "[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]" during the [[Dirty War|dictatorship]].&lt;ref name=Enfoque/&gt;

Both ''Grupo Cine Liberación'' and ''Grupo Cine de la Base'' were especially concerned with [[Latin American integration]], [[neo-colonialism]] and advocated the use of [[insurrection|violence]] as one of the alternative possible means against hegemonic power.&lt;ref name=Enfoque/&gt;

== ''La Hora de los hornos'' (1968) ==
In 1968, the Cuban film director [[Santiago Álvarez (filmmaker)|Santiago Álvarez]] collaborated with [[Octavio Getino]] and [[Fernando Solanas]] on the four-hour [[film documentary|documentary]] ''La Hora de los hornos'' ("The Hour of the furnaces"), about [[United States and Latin American relations|foreign imperialism in South America]]. The title of the film itself comes from a writing by 19th Century Cuban poet and independence leader [[José Martí]], who proclaimed, in an eponymous manifest, the need to start the independence war against Spain again.

Among the other subjects explored in this film were the [[Music in Latin America|musical]] and cultural scene in Latin America and the dictatorships which gripped the region – at the same time, several Latin American authors, including the Mexican [[Carlos Fuentes]] and the Argentine [[Julio Cortázar]], initiated the [[Dictator Novel]] genre. The movie was diffused only in alternative circuits, both by choice and by censorship obligations.&lt;ref name=Enfoque&gt;[http://www.segundoenfoque.com.ar/estetica_carencia.htm Entrevista con Alfredo Marino], by Jairo Straccia, ''[[Segundo Enfoque]]'', May 2003 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Ya es tiempo de violencia'' (1969) ==
In 1969, the film director [[Enrique Juárez]] thus anonymously produced ''Ya es tiempo de violencia'' (Now is the Time for Violence), mainly concerned with the events of the May 1969 ''[[Cordobazo]]'' riots and the assassination of the trade-unionist [[Augusto Vandor]] on 30 June 1969.&lt;ref name=P12&gt;Ana Bianco, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/5-7408-2007-08-25.html La militancia en imágenes], ''[[Pagina 12]]'', 25 August 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other images included those of the massive funerals of [[Emilio Jáuregui]], another trade-unionist shelled three days before Vandor's death during a demonstration in protest of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s (owner of [[Miramax]] there) arrival to Argentina.&lt;ref name=P12/&gt;

The film, entirely made clandestinely, criticized [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]'s dictatorship and the [[mass media|media's]] official discourse.&lt;ref name=P12/&gt; ''Ya es tiempo de violencia'' was thought to have been destroyed in the turmoil of the [[1976 Argentine coup|1976 coup d'état]] and the "[[Dirty War]]," but a copy of it was in fact stored by the Cuban film institute [[Icaic]].&lt;ref name=P12/&gt; In 2007, the film was brought back to [[Buenos Aires]] by [[Fernando Krichmar]], a member of the ''[[Grupo Cine Insurgente]]'' (Insurgent Cine Group), and [[Aprocinain]] (''Asociación para el Apoyo Patrimonial Audiovisual y la Cinemateca Nacional'') made another copy of it to insure its preservation.&lt;ref name=P12/&gt; 

In this film documentary, Enrique Juárez used a multiplicity of [[voice-over]]s (among which an anonymous narrator and an anonymous [[Peronist]] activist, among others) against censorship exerted by the [[Cultural hegemony|hegemonic discourse]]&lt;ref name=Mufud/&gt; — the voices are in fact those of Juárez himself, the actor [[Héctor Alterio]], etc.

The film itself was almost exclusively composed from media images, with the [[film editing|editing]] used to contradict the official discourse by using contradictory voices and images (i.e. a civil servant of [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]'s dictatorship states that everything is well, contradicted by images showing the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' riots). Furthermore, the voice-over often address itself directly to the spectator, urging him to take action.&lt;ref name=Mufud/&gt;

== ''El Camino hacia la muerte del viejo Reales'' (1968) ==
''El Camino hacia la muerte del viejo Reales'' was mainly produced by [[Gerardo Vallejo (filmmaker)|Gerardo Vallejo]], and depicted the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of [[sugarcane]] workers. Persecuted by Ongania's dictatorship, Vallejo fled to Rome and finished the film there.&lt;ref name=Vallejo/&gt; Although the movie won several awards abroad, it was censored in Argentina in 1972, and diffused in clandestine networks. It only re-appeared legally due to a [[decree]] passed by [[Juan Peron]]'s after his return in 1973 to Argentina.&lt;ref name=Vallejo/&gt; Vallejo returned from exile after Peron's return, but he was again forced into exile after a bomb planted by the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] exploded in his home in December 1974.&lt;ref name=Vallejo/&gt;

'''Heywood Hardy''' (25 November 1842 – 20 January 1933) was a British artist, in particular an [[animal painter]] and painter of horse riding scenes. He also painted landscapes and portraits, especially [[Equestrian Portrait|equestrian portraits]].

== Early life ==
[[File:Corn Stooks by Bray Church.jpg|thumb|''Corn Stooks by Bray Church'' (1872)]]
Heywood Hardy was born on 25 November 1842 at [[Chichester]] in Sussex, the youngest of ten children of the artist James Hardy senior (1801 – 1879) and his wife Elizabeth.  Before he became an artist his father was Principal Trumpet in the Private Band of Music of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]].  Other artists in the family included Heywood's elder brothers, James junior and David, his sister Ada and his cousins, [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]] and [[George Hardy (artist)|George Hardy]].  Heywood's ancestors were from [[Horsforth]] in Yorkshire; [[Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook|Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy]], First Earl of Cranbrook,  was his second cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hardy Family of Artists: Frederick Daniel, George, Heywood, James and their descendants|last=Hardy|first=Kimber G.|publisher=ACC Art Books|year=2016|isbn=978 185149 826 0|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk UK|pages=198–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 17 years old Heywood Hardy left the family home in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] after an argument with his quick-tempered father and removed to [[Keynsham]] near Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chichester Artists|last=Stewart|first=Brian|last2=Cutten|first2=Mervyn|publisher=Bladon Press|year=1987|isbn=0 9512814-0-2|location=Canterbury, UK|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first two paintings, landscapes, were accepted for exhibition at [[Royal Academy of Arts|The Royal Academy]] in 1864&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Royal Academy of Arts: a complete dictionary of contributors and their work from its foundation in 1769 to 1904.|last=Graves|first=Algernon|publisher=Henry Graves &amp; Co Ltd|year=1905|location=London|pages=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year he was appointed an Ensign in the 7th Somersetshire Rifle [[British Volunteer Corps|Volunteer Corps]], a part-time position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Commissions signed by the Lord Lieutenant of the County of Somerset|last=|first=|date=26 February 1864|work=The London Gazette|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year he left Keynsham to study at the [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris|École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris where his principal teacher was [[Isidore Pils]].  Hardy spent much of his spare time copying paintings in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2016), p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

After his years of [[bohemianism]] in Paris, Heywood returned to England via Antwerp and by 1869 was living at [[Goring-on-Thames|Goring]] in Oxfordshire, near the bridge over the Thames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Letters of Frederick Walker A.R.A.|last=Marks|first=John George|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1896|isbn=|location=London|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal painting ==
[[File:A Lion's Head.jpg|thumb|''A Lion's Head'' (1878)]]
In 1870 Hardy removed to [[St John's Wood]] in London and established himself as an animal painter.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2016), p.75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 ''[[The Times]]'' commented on his picture of fighting lions exhibited at The Royal Academy, "...we do not remember such a daring and determined piece of savage animal painting from an English hand – few from any hand since [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]].  The picture at once gives a great rise in artistic rank to the artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Royal Academy Exhibition|last=|first=|date=3 May 1873|work=The Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy visited Egypt in 1873 to paint wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2016), p.86&lt;/ref&gt; In London he studied the comparative anatomy of animals and birds with Professor [[Alfred Henry Garrod]], Head of the Scientific Department at the [[London Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2016), p.205&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made illustrations for Garrod's research on the [[horse gait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Professor's Garrod's Lecture on Animal Locomotion|last=|first=|date=6 March 1875|work=The Illustrated London News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To assist his studies of lions, Hardy acquired a lioness that had died at the London Zoo and had it mounted by [[Rowland Ward]], one of the foremost taxidermists of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2016) p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

== Horses and Equestrian portraits ==
Horses and horse riding were the subjects of much of Hardy’s later work. His pictures of horse riding by the seashore and riders in 18th century settings are among his most popular paintings.  Hardy painted three winners of the [[Grand National]] for their owners.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2016), p.137&lt;/ref&gt;  He was much in demand to paint equestrian portraits and pictures of the most famous Hunts and foxhounds of his day. Notable portraits include that of Lady Ida [[The Sitwells|Sitwell]]; her husband [[George Sitwell|Sir George Sitwell]] commissioned it as a wedding present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Left Hand, Right Hand!  An autobiography|last=Sitwell|first=Osbert|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1945|isbn=|location=London|pages=249, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 Heywood Hardy returned to live in Sussex, at [[East Preston, West Sussex|East Preston]], a few minutes walk from the beach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33923">This is a list of [[fiction]]al stories in which [[illegitimacy]] features as an important [[plot (narrative)|plot]] element.  Passing mentions are omitted from this article. Many of these stories explore the social pain and exclusion felt by illegitimate "natural children".

Illegitimacy was a common theme in [[Victorian literature]]. "Illegitimacy was a popular subject for Victorian writers, not only because of its value as a plot device, but also because of the changing laws affecting illegitimate children and their parents which kept the topic in the public eye."&lt;ref&gt;"Representations of illegitimacy in Wilkie Collins's early novels", ''[[Philological Quarterly]]'', 22 March 2004.

Later, Arthur unwittingly begets a bastard son, [[Mordred]], on his own half-sister [[Morgause]].  At Arthur's court, Mordred and his half-brother Agravain incite growing discontent about the Queen’s adulterous relations with Sir [[Lancelot]], and a civil war ensues.  While Arthur is preoccupied fighting Lancelot, Mordred spreads word that Arthur has been killed, seizes the crown for himself, and attempts to seduce the queen.  She resists, and Arthur quickly returns, attacking and defeating his son’s armies.  Mordred dies in combat, and Arthur is fatally wounded and dies shortly thereafter with his kingdom in ruins.
* [[William Shakespeare]]:

'''Insular illumination''' refers to the production of [[illuminated manuscripts]] in the monasteries of Ireland and Great Britain between the 6th and 9th centuries, as well as in monasteries under their influence on continental Europe. It is characterised by decoration strongly influenced by metalwork, the constant use of [[Interlace (art)|interlacing]], and the importance assigned to calligraphy. The most celebrated books of this sort are largely [[gospel book]]s. Around sixty manuscripts are known from this period.

==History==
The [[Insular art|insular artistic style]] began after the conversion of Ireland by [[St Patrick]] in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. The new religious institutions of [[Celtic Christianity]], mostly organised around monasteries, ordered the creation of numerous works of art, liturgical objects and [[vestment]]s, and also manuscripts. Two types of manuscripts dominated: small format gospels to be used by preachers and missionaries or in private worship (e.g. the [[Book of Dimma]] and the [[Book of Mulling]]), and large works, reserved for the liturgical services of the monasteries (such as the [[Book of Kells]]).&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Bernard Meehan, ''Le Livre de Kells'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995, {{ISBN|2878110900}}, p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish monks took part in the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|conversion of Scotland and the north of Great Britain]]], establishing numerous monasteries, such as [[Iona Abbey]], founded by [[Columba]] in Scotland in 563 and [[Lindisfarne]], founded by [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] in [[Northumbria]] in 635. The Irish missionaries brought their art to Britain along with their religion. Over the course of the 6th and 7th centuries, especially after the [[Gregorian mission]], the south of Britain came under the direct influence of continental Christianity, mainly Italian. Some Italian and Byzantine manuscripts came to the island as a result, influencing the development of insular illumination as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.96–107&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the major centres of production were concentrated first in Northumbria, then in southern England and Kent over the 7th and 8th centuries. The monasteries in these places benefited from more conditions which were more prosperous than those in Ireland as well as from the protection and patronage of the Anglo-Saxon kings. The ''[[Scriptorium|scriptoria]]'' of Lindisfarne and Iona were the most prolific at the end of the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 7th century, several Irish missionaries led by [[Columbanus]] travelled to the continent and contributed to the creation of several monasteries in France, Switzerland and Northern Italy. Columbanus' disciple, [[Saint Gall]], took part in the foundation of an [[Abbey of Saint Gall|abbey in Switzerland]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|St Kilian of Würzburg|fr|3=Kilian de Wurtzbourg}} was active in southern Germany. All these establishments helped to spread the insular calligraphy and decorative techniques to manuscripts produced on the continent in this period.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt; Often referred to as "{{Interlanguage link multi|Franco-Saxon|fr|3=École franco-saxonne}}", the manuscripts made in northern France in the [[Carolingian]] period also show a direct insular influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookline-03.valenciennes.fr/bib/decouverte/expositions/expovirtuelle/ecolefrsax.asp|title=L'école franco-insulaire|website=Le scriptorium de l'abbaye de Saint-Amand - Bibliothèque de Valencienne|access-date=23 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035942/http://bookline-03.valenciennes.fr/bib/decouverte/expositions/expovirtuelle/ecolefrsax.asp|archivedate=21 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Despite the great diversity of origins of manuscripts of the insular style, several common characteristics can be identified.

===Treatment of the parchment===
The treatment of the parchment creates a [[suede]]-like appearance, which makes it very receptive to ink and colour. This treatment was applied to both veal-skin and sheep. It enables both calligraphy and ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of ornamental motifs===
The [[Interlace (art)|interlace]] is the best-known motif of insular art. This decoration,  however, is not limited to Celtic art of Insular illumination. It is also seen in some Egyptian papyrus, Byzantine and Italian works and some Anglo-Saxon works of art, like those found in the tomb at [[Sutton Hoo]]. But the use of this pattern in insular manuscripts is almost systematic from the middle of the 7th century onwards. It can fill out the space around other types of illumination, as well as [[initial]]s, frames, margins, and [[carpet page]]s. Different types of interlace can be identified: simple, double, or triple.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Rectilinear motifs include diamonds, chequerboard patterns, clefs and [[Meander (art)|Greek frets]]. Round motifs include circles, spirals, and winding helixes.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoomorphic]] motifs generally extend into the interlace: their heads are located at an end and occasionally the rear of the animal reappears at the other end of the interlace. In the earlier manuscripts, their character remains very schematic and it is difficult to identify specific species of animal. From the Lindisfarne Gospels onwards, some kinds of animal begin to appear with more realism, especially dogs and predators, which recall the art of the hunt appreciated by the Anglo-Saxon elite.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:LidisfarneKat.jpg|Decoration in the form of a cat, from the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], f.139r
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Initials ===
The [[Cathach of St. Columba]] (beginning of 7th century) is the oldest extant manuscript with [[initial]]s decorated in the characteristic style of insular illumination: the first letter is incorporated into the text and is followed by other letters whose size decreases until they reach the size of the main text.The initials themselves are decorated with curves, spirals, points and even animal heads. This type of decoration is found in [[Celtic art]] from the [[la Tène]] period onwards and marks the true beginning of the distinction between insular and late antique manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

File:BookDurrowInitMark86r.jpg|Beginning of the [[Gospel of Mark]] in the [[Book of Durrow]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Miniatures===
The earliest insular designs are generally images of the cross, sometimes included in a carpet page. The first representations of individuals in insular manuscripts probably only occur as a result of the influence of works acquired from the continent. Specialists have been able to distinguish several details of these earliest miniatures which are shared with ancient manuscripts of the ''[[Diatessaron]]'' from Persia, which might have come to the British Isles as a result of [[pilgrimage]] to the Near East. Representations of humans are very schematic, with individuals on foot, usually the Evangelists are represented without wings or [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]]. Sometimes their representation is limited to their symbols (lion, cow, eagle, man) depicted in a heraldic manner.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation is funded by contributions from trustees and patrons and by various fund-raising events. The Foundation does not accept financial support from any Government, Semi-Government organisations or lobbying groups. The IFF is governed by a body of trustees supported by a Film and Moving Image Committee.

== History ==

The organizers of the Foundation have contributed to the Iranian film industry during the past ten years prior to the formal founding of group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Berlin "Taiwan Night" shadow people gathered in a smooth and successful - News News|url = http://www.like-news.us/?i116494-Berlin-Taiwan-Night-shadow-people-gathered-in-a-smooth-and-successful|website = www.like-news.us|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Standstill in development of  Iran’s national film: secretary of   Iran’s short-length film festival|url = http://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/1382537.html|website = Trend|access-date = 2016-01-25|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the formal registration of the organization, the organizers of the foundation worked to build and contribute to publication of several art documentaries in both the English language and [[Persian language|Persian]].

The Foundation has also offered some of its catalogue to large organizations based in Europe for the dissemination of historical archive footage in 2014, notably the recent Iran history series at universities in the United Kingdom.

In 2015, members of the moving image committee contributed to the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]] with supporting the distribution of Iranian cinematography through access deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Berlin Film Festival: The Match Factory Represents Three Competition, Three Panorama Films (EXCLUSIVE)|url = https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/berlin-film-festival-the-match-factory-competition-1201686132/|website = Variety|access-date = 2016-01-25|language = en-US|first = Leo|last = Barraclough}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Iranian drama competes in Berlin International Film Festival 2016  - Film - Arts &amp; Culture - Ahram Online|url = http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/180751/Arts--Culture/Film/Iranian-drama-competes-in-Berlin-International-Fil.aspx|website = english.ahram.org.eg|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Keşlik Stele''' is a [[Neo-Hittite]] monument from northern [[Tyana]], near [[Niğde]] discovered in 1962 in southern [[Turkey]], which dates from the 8th century BC.

== Discovery ==
The stele was discovered by Vural Sezer in the ''Bayındır Yaylası'' summer pasture of the village of Keşlik, a plateau north of [[Altunhisar]] in [[Niğde Province]] and was installed in the Niğde Museum. The location of discovery was part of the [[Iron Age]] [[Luwian]] kingdom of [[Tuwana]]. According to the testimony of local landowner Abdullah Tanik about the find, it was discovered by Turkish archaeologist Aykut Çınaroğlu in a 1962 survey. The stele had probably fallen from a hill which rises 25 m above the surrounding fields, since a depression has been found there which could have contained the pedestal of a stele. The monument is now in the [[Niğde Archaeological Museum]] and has the inventory number 51.

== Description ==
The brown [[Basalt]] stele is 1.45 m high, 69&amp;nbsp;cm wide and about 27&amp;nbsp;cm thick. The upper surface is severely weathered and pock marked. The image depicts the weather god [[Tarhunzas]] facing right. He is dressed in a short kilt, a short-sleeved over-tunic with a wide belt, and thigh-high boots. His head is bearded and he has shoulder-length hair, covered by a horned helmet. His right hand is bent at his side and holds a cluster of grapes, while his left hand holds a bundle of corn ears. Thegrape cluster and the corn ears both grow up from the ground on either side of him.

In the space to the right, between the figure and the corn ears, [[John David Hawkins]] detected nine lines of an inscription, which probably continued on the side of the stele. Because of the poor state of preservation of the stele, it was not legible.

The image is very similar to the depiction of the weather god on the [[İvriz relief]]. As a result, the Keşlik stele is dated to the same time as it - the reig of King [[Warpalawas]] of Tuwana (740-705).

'''LibriVox''' is a group of worldwide volunteers who read and record [[public domain]] texts creating free public domain [[audiobook]]s for download from their website and other [[digital library]] hosting sites on the internet. It was founded in 2005 by Hugh McGuire to provide "Acoustical liberation of books in the public domain"&lt;ref name="Authorlibrivox"&gt;"[https://librivox.org/search?primary_key=0&amp;search_category=author&amp;search_page=1&amp;search_form=get_results/ LibriVox Author]", LibriVox website. Retrieved 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the LibriVox objective is "To make all books in the public domain available, for free, in audio format on the internet".&lt;ref name="aboutlibrivox"&gt;"[http://librivox.org/pages/about-librivox/ Objective LibriVox]", LibriVox website. Retrieved 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2016, the project completed project number 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://librivox.org/2016/08/06/another-librivox-milestone-10000-projects/ Another LibriVox Milestone: 10,000 projects!]", librivox.org, 6 August 2016.

There are multiple affiliated projects that are providing additional content. LibriVox is closely affiliated with [[Project Gutenberg]] from where the project gets some of its texts, and the [[Internet Archive]] that hosts their offerings.

==History==
[[File:Hugh McGuire.jpg|thumb|Hugh McGuire, founder of LibriVox]]
{{Cquote|Can the net harness a bunch of volunteers to help bring books in the public domain to life through [[podcasting]]?|author=Hugh McGuire}}

LibriVox was started in August 2005 by [[Montreal]]-based writer Hugh McGuire, who set up a [[blog]], and posed the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh|last= McGuire|date=9 August 2005|url=http://librivox.org/2005/08/09/welcome-to-librivox/|title=Welcome to LibriVox|publisher=LibriVox.org|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Hugh|last=McGuire|url=http://hughmcguire.net/2007/02/12/from-textosolvo-clarity-why-it-worked-1/|title=Clarity (blog entry)|date=February 12, 2007|publisher=HughMcGuire.net|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded book&lt;ref&gt;"[https://librivox.org/the-secret-agent-by-joseph-conrad/ The Secret Agent]", librivox.org. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; was ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]].

The main features of the way LibriVox works have changed little since its inception, although the technology that supports it has been improved by the efforts of its volunteers with web-development skills.

== Etymology of LibriVox ==
''LibriVox'' is an invented word inspired by [[Latin]] words {{lang|la|liber}} (book) in its [[genitive]] form {{lang|la|libri}} and {{lang|la|vox}} (voice), giving the meaning ''BookVoice'' (or ''voice of the book''). The word was also coined because of other connotations: {{lang|la|liber}} also means ''child'' and ''free, independent, unrestricted''. As the LibriVox forum says: "We like to think LibriVox might be interpreted as 'child of the voice', and 'free voice'. Finally, the other link we like is 'library' so you could imagine it to mean Library of Voice."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://forum.librivox.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=876 What does LibriVox mean?]", LibriVox forum, retrieved 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been no decision or consensus by LibriVox founders or the community of volunteers for a single pronunciation of LibriVox. It is accepted that any audible pronunciation is accurate.&lt;ref name="librivoxpronunciation"&gt;"[http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/English_Pronunciation_Guides#Pronunciation_of_.22LibriVox.22 Pronunciation of "LibriVox"]", LibriVox wiki. Retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and funding ==
LibriVox is a volunteer-run, free content, Public Domain project. It has no budget or [[legal person]]ality. The development of projects is managed through an [[Internet forum]], supported by an [[Forum administrator|admin]] team, who also maintain a searchable catalogue database of completed works.

In early 2010, LibriVox ran a fundraising drive to raise $20,000 to cover hosting costs for the website of about $5,000/year and improve front- and backend usability.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://librivox.org/2010/02/24/librivox-needs-your-help/ LibriVox Needs Your Help]", LibriVox blog, 24 February 2010. Retrieved 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The target was reached in 13 days, and so the fundraising ended and LibriVox suggested that supporters consider making donations to its affiliates and partners, [[Project Gutenberg]] &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Partners,_Affiliates_and_Resources Gutenberg Affiliates]", Gutenberg.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/librivoxaudio&amp;tab=about Archive.org partners]", Archive.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production process==
Volunteers can choose new projects to start, either recording on their own or inviting others to join them, or they can contribute to projects that have been started by others. Once a volunteer has recorded his or her contribution, it is uploaded to the site, and proof-listened by members of the LibriVox community.

Finished audiobooks are available from the LibriVox website, and [[MP3]] and [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]] files are hosted separately by the [[Internet Archive]]. Recordings are also available through other means, such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], and, being free of copyright, they are frequently distributed independently of LibriVox on the Internet and otherwise.

==Content==
[[File:LibriVox works per month including May 2011.png|thumb|LibriVox works per month 2005–2011]]
LibriVox only records material that is in the [[public domain]] in the United States, and all LibriVox books are released with a public domain dedication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Domain |url=https://librivox.org/pages/public-domain/ |website=LibriVox |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of copyright restrictions, LibriVox produces recordings of only a limited number of contemporary books. These have included, for example, the [[9/11 Commission Report]] which is a work of the US Federal Government therefore in the Public Domain. 

The LibriVox catalogue is varied. It contains much popular classic fiction, but also includes less predictable texts, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and a recording of the first 500 digits of [[pi]]. The collection also features poetry, plays, religious texts (for example, English versions of the [[Koran]] and books from various translations of the [[Bible]]) and non-fiction of various kinds. In January 2009, the catalogue contained approximately 55 percent fiction and drama, 25 percent non-fiction and 20 percent poetry (calculated by numbers of recordings). As of November 7, 2018, the most viewed item (6.5M) was ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' in a 2006 solo recording by John Greenman.&lt;ref name="librivoxatia"&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/librivoxaudio The LibriVox Free Audiobook Collection]", The [[Internet Archive]]. Retrieved 7 November, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 90 percent of the catalogue is recorded in English, but recordings exist in 31 languages altogether ({{as of|2010|2|lc=y}}). Chinese, French and German are the most popular languages other than English amongst volunteers, but recordings have also been made in languages including [[Urdu]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

==Reputation==
LibriVox has garnered significant interest, in particular from those interested in the promotion of volunteer-led content and alternative approaches to [[copyright]] ownership on the Internet.

It has received support from the [[Internet Archive]] and [[Project Gutenberg]]. Intellectual freedom and commons proponent [[Mike Linksvayer]] described it in 2008 as "perhaps the most interesting collaborative culture project this side of [[Wikipedia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has also been featured in press around the world and has been recommended by the BBC's [[Click (TV series)|Click]], MSNBC's [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]], [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],&lt;ref name="LibriVoxReason"&gt;"[http://reason.com/archives/2007/04/24/the-wealth-of-librivox/ The Wealth of LibriVox]", Reason.com, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]],&lt;ref name="LibriVoxWired"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512012632/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69780 The Web Will Read You a Story]", archive.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the US [[PC Magazine]] and the UK [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] and [[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]&lt;ref name="NYTLibriVox"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/books/25audi.html?_r=2&amp; Public Domain Books, Ready for Your iPod]", nytimes.com, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; newspapers.

==Quality==
A frequent concern of listeners is the site's policy of allowing any recording to be published as long as it is understandable and faithful to the source text.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://forum.librivox.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=36873 Quality of Delivery?]", Librivox forums. Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that some recordings are of lower audio fidelity; some feature background noises, non-native accents or other perceived imperfections in comparison to professionally recorded audiobooks.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.reviewsandmore.net/2007/01/07/the-return-of-the-native-audiobook-librivox/ The Return of the Native Audiobook (Librivox)]", Review.

Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While some listeners may object to those books with chapters read by multiple readers,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=122685 Librivox - free audio books]", Review.

The [[Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction]] (previously called '''Women's Prize for Fiction''' (2013), '''Orange Prize for Fiction''' (1996–2006 &amp; 2009–12) and '''Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction''' (2007–2008) and to be presented as the '''Women's Prize for Fiction''' once again from 2018) is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious literary prizes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7137156.stm|title = Life after Orange Prize success|accessdate=7 June 2009|date=28 December 2007|last=Pryor|first=Fiona|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smallisland&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1499760/Small-Island-voted-best-Orange-prize-winner-of-past-decade.html |title = Small Island voted best Orange prize winner of past decade|accessdate=7 June 2009|date=12 April 2008|last=Reynolds|first=Nigel|work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/11/orangeprizeforfiction2005.orangeprizeforfiction|title = Stranger than fiction|accessdate=7 June 2009 |date=11 June 2005|last=Forna|first=Aminatta|work=The Guardian  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; annually awarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English, and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-entry-rules-obpf |title=Entry rules and regulations |accessdate=7 June 2009 |publisher=Orange |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427160248/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-entry-rules-obpf |archivedate=27 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize was originally due to be launched in 1994 with the support of [[Mitsubishi]] but public controversy over the merits of the award caused the sponsorship to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name=womenstudies/&gt;  Funding from [[Orange (UK)|Orange]], a UK [[mobile network operator]] and [[Internet service provider]], allowed the prize to be launched in 1996 by a committee of male and female "journalists, reviewers, agents, publishers, librarians, booksellers", including current Honorary Director [[Kate Mosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-history |publisher=Orange |accessdate=17 June 2009 |title=Prize history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425143335/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-history |archivedate=25 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article4263530.ece | title = The Times Summer Books: Stories by Kate Mosse| accessdate =7 June 2009 |work=The Times |date=3 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2012, it was announced that Orange would be ending its sponsorship of the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/orange-cease-sponsorship-fiction-prize.html |title=Orange to cease sponsorship of Fiction Prize |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |author=Benedicte Page |work=The Bookseller}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the award was formally known as the "Women's Prize for Fiction", and was sponsored by "private benefactors" led by [[Cherie Blair]] and writers [[Joanna Trollope]] and [[Elizabeth Buchan]].&lt;ref name=mccrum&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/13/orange-prize-wfp-books?newsfeed=true |title=How prize that used to be Orange was saved – and rebranded |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Robert McCrum |date=13 October 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the new sponsor became [[Baileys]].&lt;ref name=masters/&gt; In January 2017 the company announced that it was the last year that they would sponsor the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Prize for Fiction: Baileys end sponsorship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38768553|website=BBC News|accessdate=30 January 2017|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, the prize announced it would change its name to simply "Women's Prize for Fiction" starting in 2018, and will be supported by a family of sponsors.&lt;ref name=newname2017/&gt;

The prize was established to recognise the contribution of female writers, whom Mosse believed were often overlooked in other major literary awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-why-only-open-to-women |title=Why are the Orange Prize for Fiction and Award for New Writers only open to women? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=10 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106132247/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-why-only-open-to-women |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/28/fiction.stephaniemerritt|work=The Guardian |title = The model of a modern writer|first=Stephanie|last=Merritt|accessdate=10 June 2009|date=28 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in reaction to the all-male shortlist for the 1991 [[Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/20/news|title = Orange Prize longlist announced|work=The Guardian |accessdate=11 June 2009|date=20 March 2000 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winner of the prize receives [[Pound sterling|£]]30,000, along with a [[bronze sculpture]] called the ''Bessie'' created by artist [[Grizel Niven]], the sister of actor and writer [[David Niven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-what-do-winners-win |title=What do winners win? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=7 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321050619/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-what-do-winners-win |archivedate=21 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June;  within days the winner is announced.  The winner is selected by a board of "five leading women" each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-who-judges |title=Who judges the Prize for Fiction and Award for New Writers? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=7 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321050402/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-who-judges |archivedate=21 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, judges named [[Andrea Levy]]'s ''[[Small Island (novel)|Small Island]]'' as the "Orange of Oranges", the best novel of the preceding decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/oct/03/orangeprizeforfiction2005.books | title= Orange judges to name best novelist of decade |work=The Guardian  | accessdate=8 June 2009 | date=3 October 2005|first=John | last=Ezard | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] suggests that the prize forms part of the "trinity" of UK literary prizes, along with the Booker Prize and the [[Costa Book Awards]];  the sales of works by the nominees of these awards are significantly boosted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7046677.stm| title = 10 ways to get you to read a book |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 June 2009|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levy's 2004 winning book sold almost one million copies (in comparison to less than 600,000 for the Booker Prize winner of the same year),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4985892.stm| title = Science prize seeks new sponsor |accessdate=11 June 2009| date=16 May 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; while sales of [[Helen Dunmore]]'s ''[[A Spell of Winter]]'' quadrupled after being awarded the inaugural prize.&lt;ref name=womenstudies&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women as Readers, Writers, and Judges The Controversy about the Orange Prize for Fiction| first=Britta|last=Zangen|pages=281–299|issn=0049-7878 |journal=Women's Studies |date=April–May 2003 |volume=32 |issue=3|doi = 10.1080/00497870310066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Valerie Martin]]'s 2003 award saw her novel sales increase tenfold after the award,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work=Bookseller|page=17|date=7 May 2004|title = Orange authors eye bright futures}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British libraries, who often support the prize with various promotions, reported success in introducing people to new authors: "48% said that they had tried new writers as a result of the promotion, and 42% said that they would try other books by the new authors they had read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Library triumph for Orange| page=31|date=1 February 2002|work=Bookseller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that the prize singles out female writers is not without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aR6wT5dJd5i4&amp;refer=muse |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=7 June 2009 |date=21 April 2009 |title=Robinson, Feldman Make Final Round in Orange Prize for Fiction |first=James |last=Pressley |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019212913/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088 |archivedate=19 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the prize was founded, [[Auberon Waugh]] nicknamed it the "[[Lemon (automobile)|Lemon]] Prize" while [[Germaine Greer]] claimed there would soon be a prize for "writers with red hair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/06/orangeprizeforfiction2004.orangeprizeforfiction|work=The Guardian |accessdate=7 June 2009|date=6 March 2005|first=Geradline|last=Bedell|title = Textual politics | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, [[A.

No woman has won the award more than once but [[Margaret Atwood]] has been nominated three times without a win.  Since the inaugural award to [[Helen Dunmore]], British writers have won five times, while North American authors have secured the prize nine times.

[[File:Karlův most.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Bridge]], 2006]]

There are '''30 statues''' mounted to the balustrade of '''[[Charles Bridge]]''' in [[Prague]]. They form two rows, one on each side. For the purpose of this article, they are listed in the order they are passed when crossing the bridge from the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, and are divided into two categories: those on the north side of the bridge and those on the south side. The [[Statue of Bruncvík, Charles Bridge|statue of Bruncvík]] is also included, although it is not considered one of the principal statues.

Damage caused to the statues over many years has resulted in many of the originals being replaced by copies.

==Statues on the south side of the bridge==
=== Statue of [[Ivo of Kermartin|St. Ivo]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Ivo of Kermartin, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Iva'' or ''Ivona'') The original was made by [[Matthias Braun]] in 1711, paid for by the Law faculty of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]]. The statue portrays St. Ivo as the patron saint of lawyers, accompanied by an allegorical depiction of Justice.

=== Statues of saints [[Saint Barbara|Barbara]], [[Saint Margarita|Margaret]] and [[Elisabeth of Hungary|Elizabeth]] ===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Barbara, Margaret and Elizabeth, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Barbory, Markéty a Alžběty'') The statues were sculpted by [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1707. Although there is an inscription saying IOANN BROKOFF FECIT (''made by [[Jan Brokoff]]''), their style is evidence that his son Ferdinand is their true author.

=== Statue of the Lamentation of [[Christ]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Pietà, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Piety'') Designed by [[Emanuel Max]] in 1858, upon commission from the Old Town's public authorities, the statue depicts [[Mary Magdalene]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] mourning the dead Christ. At this position on the bridge, there was originally a wooden crucifix, which was destroyed by a flood in 1496. In 1695, a statue depicting the lamentation of Christ by [[Jan Brokoff]] was installed here; this was removed to the Monastery of Gracious Nurses under Petřín hill in Prague in 1859 and replaced by the current statue.

=== Statue of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Joseph, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Josefa'') This statue was designed by [[Josef Max]] and sponsored by Josef Bergmann, a tradesman in Prague. It depicts St. Joseph leading a small Christ, and is situated on a pseudo-Gothic base. It replaced a statue with the same motif by Jan Brokoff, designed in 1706. This was damaged by cannon fire during the 1848 revolution and was replaced by the current statue in 1854.

=== Statue of [[Francis Xavier|St. Francis Xavier]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis Xavier, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Františka Xaverského'') This statue is a 1913 replica by [[Čeněk Vosmík]] of Ferdinand Brokoff's original 1711 sculpture. The original sculpture was commissioned of the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]], but fell into the river during the floods of 1890. The statue depicts an Indian and a Japanese prince being baptized by the saint, along with a Moor in chains and a Tatar.

=== Statue of [[Saint Christopher|St. Christopher]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Christopher, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Kryštofa'') This statue was designed by Emanuel Max in 1857 and sponsored by Václav Wanek, the portreeve of Prague. It depicts the saint holding Christ as a boy on his shoulder. The statue was originally conceived by Count [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Antonín Sporck]], who wanted to build a marble statue as tribute to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1720. A plan of this was created by Matthias Braun, which was not executed.

=== Statue of [[Francis Borgia|St. Francis Borgia]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis Borgia, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Františka Borgiáše'') This statue was commissioned from Ferdinand Brokoff by the imperial Burgrave František z Colletů in 1710. The sculpture portrays St. Borgia, a [[Jesuit]] priest, with two angels.

=== Statue of [[Saint Ludmila|St. Ludmila]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Ludmila, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Ludmily'') The exact date and sculptor responsible for this statue are not known, although it is believed that it was created by Matthias Braun around 1730. The sculpture was erected on the bridge in 1784 to replace the statue of St. Wenceslas damaged in the floods in that year. The statue depicts St. Ludmila teaching her grandson, St. Wenceslas and the base contains a relief sculpture showing the murder of St. Wenceslas.

=== Statue of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Františka Serafinského'') Sculpted by Emanuel Max in 1855, the statue was donated by count František Antonín Kolowrat Liebsteinský. It portrays St. Francis standing with two [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]] angels, on a pseudo-baroque base. The sculpture replaced a similar statue designed in 1708 by František Preis.

=== Statue of Saints [[Vincent Ferrer]] and [[Procopius of Sázava|Procopius]] + Bruncvík column ===
{{Main|Statue of Bruncvík, Charles Bridge|Statues of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Procopius, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Vincence Ferrarského a sv. Prokopa'') One of the most artistically important pieces on the bridge, this statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1712, paid for by Romedius Josef František, the count Thun and lord of Choltice. St. Vincent is on the left, with a coffin and a kneeling penitent sinner by his legs. Saint Procopius of Sázava stands on a devil to the right.

Beside the statue of Sts. Vincent and Procopius stands a column with a sculpture of Bruncvik, (a mythical Bohemian knight inspired by the Saxonian and Bavarian knight [[Henry the Lion]] from [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]), portrayed helping a lion fight a seven-headed dragon. This was sculpted by Ludvík Šimek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncvík, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a [[Roland (statue)|statue of Roland]], erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town's privileges, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when the city was attacked by [[Sweden|Swedish forces]] in 1648.

=== Statue of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|St. Nicholas of Tolentino]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Nicholas of Tolentino, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Mikuláše Tolentinského'') Sculpted by Jan Bedřich Kohl in 1708, this statue was paid for by the [[Augustinian order]] convent of St. Thomas in Prague. The saint is portrayed standing on a simple base, together with an angel holding a basket of bread.

=== Statue of [[Luthgard|St. Luthgard]] (Dream of St. Luthgard) ===
{{Main| Statue of Lutgardis, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Luitgardy'') Possibly the most valuable piece of art on the bridge, the statue of St. Luthgard was sculpted by Matthias Braun in 1710 as a commission from Evžen Tyttl, the abbot of the [[Cistercian]] monastery in Plasy.

=== Statue of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Adalbert of Prague, Charles Bridge}}
(''socha sv. Vojtěcha'') Designed by [[Michael Brokoff|Michael]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor.

=== Statues of Saints [[John of Matha]], [[Felix of Valois]], and [[Saint Ivan|Ivan]] ===
{{Main|Statues of John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Saint Ivan, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana'') The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by František Josef Thun, the lord of Klášterec nad Ohří. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation.

=== Statue of [[Saint Wenceslas|St. Wenceslas]] ===
{{Main|Statue of Wenceslaus I, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Václava'') This statue was designed by Karel Böhm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil Führing. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Klárov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge.

==Statues on the north side of the bridge==
===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] attending to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]===
{{Main|Statues of Madonna and Saint Bernard, Charles Bridge}}

(Czech: ''sousoší Madony se sv. Bernardem'') This statue was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckl in 1709 and donated by the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig.

===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], [[Saint Dominic|Ss. Dominic]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]===
{{Main|Statues of Madonna, Saint Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší Madony se sv. Dominikem a Tomášem Akvinským'') This group was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1708, and sponsored by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] [[Convent]] of St. Giles in the Old Town of Prague. The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right.

===The Crucifix and Calvary===
{{Main|Calvary, Charles Bridge}}

[[Image:St Calvary at Charles Bridge.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Statuary of the Holy Crucifix and Calvary]]
(''sousoší Kříže s Kalvárií'') This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the [[Hussites]] in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] towards the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|lapidarium]] of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in [[Dresden]], this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]]. 

The golden [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European [[anti-Semitism]]. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, one Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out "Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts," the [[Kedusha]] from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The "Vav" from the Charles Bridge).  A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.  The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text.  Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.

===Statue of [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Anny'') Designed by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl.

===Statue of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Charles Bridge}}

(''sousoší sv. Cyrila a Metoděje'') This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvořák between 1928 and 1939 and was erected by the Ministry of education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius ([[missionary|missionaries]] who introduced Christianity to the [[Slavic Peoples|Slavs]]). The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|Prague lapidarium]].

===Statue of St. [[John the Baptist]]===
{{Main|Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Jana Křtitele'') Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848.

===Statue of Saints [[Norbert of Xanten]], [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] and [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]]===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Norbert, Wenceslaus and Sigismund}}

[[Image:Prague-charles bridge-hradcany.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund on Charles Bridge in Prague]]
(''sousoší sv. Norberta, Václava a Zikmunda'') This statue was designed by Josef Max in 1853, under the patronage of the abbot of Strahov Monastery, Dr. Jeroným Zeidler.

===Statue of [[John of Nepomuk|St. John of Nepomuk]]===
{{Main|Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge}}

[[Image:Prague 07-2016 Charles Bridge John of Nepomuk statue img2.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The [[Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge|statue of John of Nepomuk]]]]

(''socha sv. Jana Nepomuckého'') This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchmüller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeroným Heroldt in [[Nuremberg]]. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint's death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned. In modern times it has become traditional to touch the bridge here; this is held to bring good fortune and to ensure that the visitor will return to the city of Prague.

===Statue of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]]===
{{Main|Statue of Anthony of Padua, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Antonína Paduánského'') Designed by Jan Oldřich Mayer in 1707 and sponsored by Krištof Mořice Withauer, councilor of the [[Prague Castle]] [[Graf|burgraviate]], this statue represents St. Anthony standing between two vases, holding Jesus.

===Statue of [[Saint Jude|St. Jude Thaddeus]]===
{{Main|Statue of Jude the Apostle, Charles Bridge}}

===Statue of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]===
{{Main|Statue of Augustine of Hippo, Charles Bridge}}
(''socha sv. Augustina'') Designed by Jan Bedřich Kohl in 1708 and paid for by the Augustinian convent of St. Thomas in Prague, this portrays the philosopher holding a hook and a burning heart. He is followed by an angel attempting to pour the sea out of a sea-shell.

===Statue of [[Saint Cajetan|St. Cajetan]]===
{{Main|Statue of Saint Cajetan, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Kajetána'') This statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1709, and sponsored by the convent of Theatins in Prague. The Saint, founder of the religious order of Theatins, is portrayed holding a book and standing before an obelisk representing the Trinity.

===Statue of [[Philip Benitius|St. Philip Benitius]]===
{{Main|Statue of Philip Benizi de Damiani, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Filipa Benicia'') Designed by Michal Bernard Mandel in 1714, this statue was made from [[Salzburg]] marble and donated by the [[Servite]]s convent in Prague. The statue portrays St. Philip Benitius, fifth general of the Servites, holding a cross, a book and a spray. By his legs there is the crown of the Pope. A clay model of this statue can be found in the [[Salzburg]] museum.

===Statuary of [[Vitus|St. Vitus]]===
{{Main|Statue of Vitus, Charles Bridge}}

(''socha sv. Víta'') Sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1714, this statue was donated by Matěj Vojtěch Macht of Löwenmacht, the dean of the [[Vysehrad|Vyšehrad]] canonry. St. Vitus is portrayed standing on a base in the shape of cave, from which lions crawl up. The Saint is depicted as a [[Rome|Roman]] aristocrat, martyred for his faith. Duke [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] acquired a number of his relics to honor the founding of [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] at Prague Castle. These relics, together with others acquired by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1355, are embedded in the cathedral building.

===Statue of the Holy Savior with [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]]===
{{Main|Statues of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Charles Bridge}}

==Early life==
Quant was born on 11 February 1934 in [[Blackheath, London]], the daughter of Welsh teachers.&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office of England and Wales, Births, March quarter 1930, Woolwich, {{cite book|author=Kent, Jacqueline C.|title=Business Builders in Fashion|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5EgJ9BwO5Q0C&amp;pg=PA96|pages=96–99|publisher=The Oliver Press, Inc.|location=Minneapolis, MN|year=2003|isbn=1-881508-80-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Jack and Mildred Quant (John H Quant married Mildred G Jones, 1925),&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office of England and Wales, Marriages, December quarter 1925, Woolwich, Vol 1d, page 2092&lt;/ref&gt; were both from mining families; however, they had been awarded scholarships to grammar school and had both attained first-class degrees at [[Cardiff University]] before they moved to London to work as school teachers.&lt;ref name="Designers"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Polan, Brenda|author2=Tredre, Roger|title=The Great Fashion Designer|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H5oadQtleT4C&amp;pg=PA103|pages=103–04|publisher=Berg|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84788-228-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She went to [[Blackheath High School]], then studied [[illustration]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]]. After gaining a Diploma in Art Education from Goldsmiths, Quant began an apprenticeship at Erik, a high-end [[Mayfair]] [[Hatmaking|milliner]] on [[Brook Street]] next door to [[Claridge's]] hotel.&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Quant|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/mary_quant/index.html|accessdate=24 February 2011|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|year=2011|work=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914124204/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/mary_quant/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lisa&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Lisa|title=Mary Quant: 'You have to work at staying slim - but it's worth it'|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG9087300/Mary-Quant-You-have-to-work-at-staying-slim-but-its-worth-it.html|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her younger brother John Antony 'Tony' Quant became a high ranking [[dental surgeon|Dental Officer]] in the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette Supplement'', various editions including 27 August 1957 pg 5045 &amp; 14 January 1985 pg 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

She met her future husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene in 1953.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt; They were married from 1957 until his death in 1990, and had a son, Orlando (b. 1970).

==Fashion career==
[[File:Mary Quant 'Rex Harrison' cardigan dress chosen as Dress of the Year, 1963.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Mary Quant dress chosen as the [[Dress of the Year]], 1963]]

===Early career===
In November 1955, Quant and Plunket Greene teamed up with a photographer and former [[solicitor]], Archie McNair, to open Quant's first shop on the corner of [[Markham Square]] and [[King's Road]] in Chelsea, London called ''Bazaar'', above "Alexander's", a basement restaurant run by Plunket Green.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=berg&gt;{{cite book|first=Amy|last=DelaHaye|editor1-last=Steele|editor1-first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=1847885632|pages=586–588|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0_3qzO6NTqcC&amp;pg=PA586}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, they opened the second branch of ''Bazaar'', which was designed by [[Terence Conran]].&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

Successful designs from this early period included small white plastic collars to brighten up sweaters and dresses, bright stockings in colours matched to her knitwear, men's cardigans made long enough to be worn as dresses, and a pair of "mad" lounging [[pyjamas]] made by Quant herself which were featured in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and purchased by an American manufacturer to copy.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; Following this, Quant decided to design and make more of the clothes she stocked, instead of buying-in stock.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; Initially working solo, she was soon employing a handful of [[machinist]]s, and by 1966 she was working with eighteen manufacturers concurrently.

For a while in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Quant was one of only two London-based high-end designers consistently offering youthful clothes for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denza|first1=Vanessa|title=Interview with Vanessa Denza MBE|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/vanessa-denza-mbe/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddell|first1=Gavin|title=How fashion works: couture, ready-to-wear, and mass production|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9781118814994|page=130|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GX-uAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was [[Kiki Byrne]], who opened her boutique on the King's Road in direct competition with Quant.&lt;ref name=obyrne&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Byrne|first1=Robert|title=Style city: how London became a fashion capital|date=2009|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|isbn=9780711228955|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quant and the miniskirt===
[[File:1960s Mary Quant minidress, green, purple and white jersey.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jersey minidress by Mary Quant, late 1960s]]
The miniskirt, described as one of the defining [[1960s in fashion|fashions of the 1960s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ros |last1=Horton |first2=Sally |last2=Simmons |date=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LYLOj2APSsC&amp;pg=PA170 |title=Women Who Changed the World |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the garments most widely associated with Quant. While she is often cited as the inventor of the style, this claim has been challenged by others. [[Marit Allen]], a contemporary fashion journalist and editor of the influential "Young Ideas" pages for UK [[Vogue (British magazine)|''Vogue'']], firmly stated that another British fashion designer, [[John Bates (designer)|John Bates]], rather than Quant or [[André Courrèges]], was the original creator of the miniskirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garments worn by Marit Allen|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/g/garments-worn-by-marit-allen/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others credit Courrèges with the invention of the style.&lt;ref name=jess&gt;{{cite news|last=Cartner-Morley|first=Jess|title=Chelsea girl who instigated a new era|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skirts had been getting shorter since the 1950s—a development Quant considered practical and liberating, allowing women the ability to run for a bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Miles |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era |page=194 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009}}&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Quant later said, "It was the girls on the [[King's Road]] [during the "[[Swinging London]]" scene] who invented the mini. I was making easy, youthful, simple clothes, in which you could move, in which you could run and jump and we would make them the length the customer wanted. I wore them very short and the customers would say, 'Shorter, shorter.'"&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt; She gave the miniskirt its name, after her favourite make of car, the [[Mini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era |page=203 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009}}&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and said of its wearers, "they are curiously feminine, but their femininity lies in their attitude rather than in their appearance ... She enjoys being noticed, but wittily. She is lively—positive—opinionated."&lt;ref name="seebohm19710719"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=English Girls in New York: They Don't Go Home Again|work=New York|date=19 July 1971|accessdate=6 January 2015|author=Seebohm, Caroline|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned [[tights]] that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] who offered [[harlequin]]-patterned tights in 1962&lt;ref name=jess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Ernestine|title=The changing world of fashion: 1900 to the present|year=1977|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297773498|pages=213|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PNn-T8q3GMXV0QXltIC7Bw&amp;id=AkdEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Balenciaga+stockings+patterned&amp;q=Balenciaga+harlequin#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to John Bates.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;Lester, Richard, ''John Bates: Fashion Designer'', London, 2008.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In the late 1960s, Quant popularised [[hot pants]] and became a British fashion icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Quant profile|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1966/fashion3.shtml|quote=Quant was responsible for hot pants, the Lolita look, the slip dress, PVC raincoats, smoky eyes and sleek bob haircuts, but it was make-up that eventually made her company the most money.|accessdate=9 January 2011|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=November 2008|work=[[BBC]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hillary Alexander|title=Fashion designer Mary Quant to have design included on Royal Mail stamps|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1966/fashion3.shtml|quote=Apart from the mini, Quant is credited with popularising white "go-go" boots, patterned tights, {{Sic|hide=y|brightly|-}}coloured "Paintbox" make-up, the micro-mini skirt, plastic raincoats, the "wet look", and hot-pants, which she designed in 1966, the year she received an OBE from the Queen for her services to the fashion industry.|accessdate=9 January 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, UK|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make-up, rather than just her clothing lines, including the [[duvet]] which she claims to have invented.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt;

In 1988, Quant designed the interior of the [[Mini]] (1000) Designer (originally dubbed the Mini Quant, the name was changed when popularity charts were set against having Quant's name on the car). It featured black and white striped seats with red trimming. The seatbelts were red, and the driving and passenger seats had Quant's signature on the upper left quadrant. The steering wheel had Quant's signature daisy and the bonnet badge had "Mary Quant" written over the signature name. The headlight housings, wheel arches, door handles and bumpers were all nimbus grey, rather than the more common chrome or black finishes. Two thousand were released in the U.K. on 15 June 1988, and a number were also released on to foreign markets; however, the numbers for these are hard to come by. The special edition Mini came in two body colours, jet black and diamond white. She is a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]] of the [[Chartered Society of Designers]], and winner of the ''Minerva Medal'', the Society's highest award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These were the days that shook the world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/20/review.features7|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, she resigned as director of ''Mary Quant Ltd.'', her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out.&lt;ref name=gillan&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillan|first=Audrey|title=Mary Quant quits fashion empire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan.&lt;ref name="gillan" /&gt;

===Recognition===
In 1963 Quant was the first winner of the [[Dress of the Year]] award. In 1966 she was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for her outstanding contribution to the fashion industry. She arrived at [[Buckingham Palace]] to accept the award in a cream wool jersey minidress with blue facings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.B.E.

In 1990 she won the Hall of Fame Award of the [[British Fashion Council]]. Quant received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2006/people_awards.html |title=Annual Review 2006 : People, Honours and Awards |website=www1.hw.ac.uk |access-date=2016-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413051238/http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2006/people_awards.html |archivedate=2016-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Quant was among the [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icons]] selected by artist Sir [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

'''Mester de juglaría''' ("Ministry of [[jongleur]]y") is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[Spanish literature|literature]] [[genre]] from the 12th and 13th centuries, transmitted [[oral tradition|orally]]
by "juglares" who made their living by telling and singing these stories in public places and palaces while performing short theatrical scenes, acrobatics or other amusements.

These anonymous stories were mostly [[cantar de gesta]]. Although versified to make
it easier to memorize, juglares probably often changed the story a little bit as they passed it to others.

There are more theories regarding the origin of these texts. The ''individualist theory'' states that these texts
were the creation of one poet and they didn't change much. On the other hand, the ''traditionalist theory''
says that it is a collective work of the public and it was totally changed on its route.

Compared to the [[Mester de Clerecía]] the authors weren't educated, it treats popular topics, the language is simple and the metrics of the verses is irregular.

The most known examples of the works that can be classified as Mester de Juglaría is El [[Cantar de Mio Cid]] and [[Representación de los Reyes Magos]].

'''''Murdering Airplane''''' (1920) is a [[collage]] by the [[Germany|German]] [[Dada|dadaist]] [[Max Ernst]]. It depicts a monstrous aircraft with human arms flying over an open field. In the lower right-hand corner two soldiers are carrying a third wounded soldier.

The Dada movement was created partly as a critical response to [[World War I]]. This had a special significance to Ernst who served in the war. This work was a statement on the advent of aerial warfare that occurred in that war.

The '''music of Iraq''' or '''Iraqi music''', ({{lang-ar|موسيقى عراقية}}), also known as the '''Music of Mesopotamia''' encompasses the music of a number of ethnic groups and musical genres. Ethnically, it includes [[Arabic music]], [[Assyrian/Syriac folk music|Assyrian]],  [[Kurdish music|Kurdish]] and the music of [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], among others. Apart from the traditional music of these peoples, Iraqi music includes contemporary music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[urban contemporary]].

Iraq is recognized mainly for three instruments, the [[Oud]], [[Iraqi Santur]] and [[Rebab|Joza]]. The most renowned Oudists are [[Ahmed Mukhtar]], [[Naseer Shamma]], [[Rahim AlHaj]], [[Sahar Taha]] and [[Munir Bashir]].

==Classical Iraqi Music==
[[Image:ComedianpartyBaghdad.jpg|thumb|Musical theater group in [[Baghdad]], 1920s.]] 
Iraqi classical music necessitates some discussion of the social environment, as well as references to the poetry. Poetry is always rendered clearly. Poetry is the art of the Iraqis, and sung poetry is the finest of all. In [[Baghdad]] from 760-1260, writers spurned musical notation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/caml/en/review/31-2/conference.htm Classical Music in Iraq] Virginia Danielson, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; The music is melodically modal, and moves in a stepwise motion with repeated notes. Use of the lower end of a melodic range is characteristic, as is the use of silence; one listens through the silence. Following a cadence, the singer moves up to the next range of pitches. An arch shape is discernible, and the work ends in the original mode.

Singers of the Baghdad Court were praised for their excellence in composition, their knowledge of history and songs, and their ornaments and innovations. There was support for female singers and orators, such as Arib, a skilled poet, calligrapher, lutenist, composer, and backgammon player who wrote more than one thousand songs. The common instrument (comparable in popularity to the piano or violin in the west) is the oud. Classical Iraqi music is identifiable by the genre/canon, and by how it is performed.

Historically, music would have been played for gatherings of men. With the advent of the sound recording industry, things have changed somewhat. Today one invites musicians to perform at weddings; by the first quarter of the century, concerts were being staged at concert venues.

===Maqam===
[[Image:Iraqi-fluteplayer.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional flute player from Iraqi folk troupe]]
Across the Arab world, ''[[Arabic maqam|maqam]]'' refers to specific [[mode (music)|melodic modes]]. When a musician performs maqam performances, the performer improvises, based on rules. There are a number of different maqams, each with its own mood and characteristics.  There are between fifty and seventy maqams, many of which have sub-styles.  Other characteristics of Iraqi music include a slow tempo, rhythmically free ornamentation or melodic lines, and predominantly minor modes.  Instruments include [[qanun (instrument)|qanun]], [[riq]], santur, [[goblet drum|darbuka]], [[naqareh]], [[ney]], djose and [[oud]].  Baghdad's ''Chalgi'' ensembles typically include the djoze and ney, and may also utilize an oud.
[[file:Ahmed_al-Musili,_Muwashah_02.ogg|right|thumb|"Lil 'Ashiqi fi-l Hawa Dala'il" by Ahmed Abdul Qadir al-Musili (1877-1941).]]
[[Maqama]] texts are often derived from classical [[Arabic poetry]], such as by [[Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri]], [[al-Mutanabbi]] and [[Abu Nuwas]], or Persian poets like [[Hafez]] and [[Omar Khayyám]].  Some performers used traditional sources translated into the dialect of Baghdad, and still others use Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, Hebrew, Turkmen, Aramaic or Persian language lyrics.

====History====
The roots of modern Iraqi maqam can be traced as far back as the Abbassid Caliphate, when that large empire was controlled from Baghdad.

The [[pesteh]], a kind of light song which concludes a maqam performance, has been popularized in the later 20th century, growing more prominent along with the rise of recorded music and broadcast radio.  Among the most popular pesteh performers are the husband and wife [[Salima Pasha]] and [[Nazem Al-Ghazali]].

The most popular modern singers of maqam are [[Rachid Al-Qundarchi]] (1887–1945), [[Youssouf Omar]] (1918–1987), [[Nazem Al-Ghazali]] (1920–1963), [[Salim Shibbeth]] (born 1908), [[Hassan Chewke]] (1912–1962), [[Najim Al-Sheikhli]] (1893–1938), [[Mohammed Al-Qubanchi]] (1900–1989), [[Hamid Al Saadi]] (1959-)  and [[Farida Mohammad Ali]] (1963- ).

==Modern era==
[[File:MBashir.jpg|thumb|[[Munir Bashir]], an acclaimed oud singer.]]
[[File:Omar bashir.jpeg|thumb|[[Omar Bashir]], a modern day oud singer.]]

For much of the 20th century, Egypt was the center for Arab popular music, with only a few stars from other countries finding international success. Singers were [[Muslim]]s, [[Jews]] and [[Christian]]s.

[[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] instrumentalists attended the famous 1932 Arabic music congress in Cairo, which the Muslim vocalist Muhammed al-Qubanchi also attended. In 1936, Iraq Radio was established by two of Iraq's most prominent performers and composers, Saleh and Daoud al-Kuwaity with an ensemble, with the exception of the percussion player.  The nightclubs of Baghdad also featured almost entirely Jewish musicians.  At these nightclubs, ensembles consisted of oud, qanun and two percussionists while the same format with ney and cello were used on the radio.&lt;ref name=Kojaman&gt;{{cite web|last=Kojaman|first=Yeheskel|title=Jewish Role in Iraqi Music|url=http://www.dangoor.com/72page42.html|accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons for the predominance of Jewish instrumentalists in early 20th century Iraqi music was a prominent school for [[blindness|blind]] Jewish children, which was founded in the late 1920s by the great ''qanunji'' ("qanun player") Joseph Hawthorne (''Yusef Za'arur'') ({{lang-he|דנדהי ללוואלד-יוסף זערור}} {{lang-ar|يوسف زعرور}}). Many of the students became musicians, eventually forming the Arabic music ensemble "Israel Radio" ({{lang-he|קול ישראלי}} ''Qol Yisraeli'' ).

The most famous singer of the 1930s&amp;ndash;1940s was perhaps [[Salima Pasha]].&lt;ref name="Kojaman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasseh"&gt;{{Citation | last=Manasseh | first=Sara | publication-date=February 2004 | title=An Iraqi samai of Salim Al-Nur | periodical=Newsletter | publication-place=London | publisher=Arts and Humanities Research Board Research Centre for Cross-Cultural Music and Dance Performance | issue=3 | page=7 | url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/ahrbmusicanddance/newsletter/musicanddance3.pdf | accessdate=2007-09-09 | format= &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AManasseh+intitle%3AAn+Iraqi+samai+of+Salim+Al-Nur&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051202084829/http://www.soas.ac.uk/ahrbmusicanddance/newsletter/musicanddance3.pdf |archivedate = December 2, 2005}} .&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, two brothers began to gain prominence in the field of music in Iraq; the Kuwaiti brothers - Salih, a violin player, and Dawud, an oud player. Almost at the same time, the name of a woman singer, Salima Pasha began to achieve fame. The brothers, Salih and Dawud el-Kuwaiti began to perform and to compose new songs for Pasha. Salih became the most prominent musician in Iraq, and Pasha became the most famous singer.

Following the opening of the Iraqi Broadcast Station in 1936. Salih was asked to form the official music ensemble for the radio station. It was due to him, that two instruments, the cello and nay (flute), were introduced for the first time into the instrumental music ensemble. The respect and adoration for Pasha were unusual at the time, since public performance by women was considered shameful and most female singers were recruited from brothels.&lt;ref name="Kojaman"/&gt;

Numerous instrumentalists and singers of the middle and late twentieth century were trained at the [[Baghdad Conservatory]].

In recent years the Iraqi school of oud players has become very prominent, with players such as [[Salman Shukur]] and Munir Bashir developing a very refined and delicate style of playing combining older Arabic elements with more recent [[Anatolia]]n influences.

==Pop music==
Pop music in Iraq more often than not means musical motifs and lyrics dating back centuries but performed with a mix of traditional and modern instruments. [[Kadim Al Sahir]], for example, may be nicknamed "the Elvis of the Middle East," but he sings in classical Arabic. Popular musician [[Ilham al-Madfai]] features the electric guitar and saxophone, but uses the instruments to reinterpret age-old folk songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906050302/http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]], the most popular [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] was the '''Voice of Youth''', which used to play the popular music of Iraq to continue the culture of the country. The station also played a mix of rock, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and pop music from artists as far-ranging as [[Eminem]] to [[R.E.M.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906050302/http://www.iraq4u.com/forum/m_1631/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm |archivedate=2012-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which had to be imported via [[Jordan]] due to international [[economic sanctions]], and both disc jockeys and callers spoke exclusively in [[English language|English]]. [[Irish people|Irish]] bands  [[The Corrs]] and [[Westlife]] were especially popular. Iraq also produced a major pan-Arab pop star in exile in [[Kadim Al Sahir]], whose songs include ''Ladghat-e Hayya'', which was banned by Hussein for its racy lyrical content.

Other modern Iraqi singers include [[:ar:علي العيساوي (مغني)|Ali Al Essawi]], whose song ''Makhtuba'' became huge hit in the Arab world and made him famous throughout the region. Major artists include [[Shatha Hassoun]], Rahma Mezher, [[Majid al-Muhandis]], [[Hussam Al-Rassam]], [[Rida Al Abdullah]] and Iraq's very own boy band [[Unknown to No One]], as well as [[Acrassicauda]], Iraq's first [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. There are also ethnic  [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] singers such as [[Klodia Hanna]], [[Ashur Bet Sargis]] and [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]  as well as a number of [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Yazidi]], [[Dom people|Dom]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] musicians such as [[Seta Hagopian]].

==Effect of 2003 Iraq War==
Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq and fall of Saddam Hussein, some militant extremists have been attacking musicians, especially those in the port city of [[Basra]], where the Wahabis are believed to be responsible.Basra's [[sea shanties]] are well known throughout Iraq.  Music shops in the [[Summar]] district have been the target of grenade bombings.  Extremist religious leaders have closed some of the concert halls and clubs in the city.

'''''October''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] specializing in [[contemporary art]], [[art criticism|criticism]], and [[critical theory|theory]], published by [[MIT Press]].

==History==
''October'' was established in 1976 in New York by [[Rosalind E. Krauss]] and [[Annette Michelson]], who left ''[[Artforum]]'' to do so.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/arts/design/25benglis.html?_r=0 | title=Art or Ad or What?

The journal was a participant in introducing French [[Post-structuralism|post-structural theory]] on the English-speaking academic scene.&lt;ref name = ArtStory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cusste2009"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = U of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4732-3| last = Cusset| first = François| title = French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, &amp; Co. Transformed the Intellectual Life of the United States| date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Art Story'', Krauss used the journal "as a way to publish essays on her emergent ideas on post-structuralist art theory, Deconstructionist theory, psychoanalysis, postmodernism and feminism".&lt;ref name = ArtStory/&gt; [[Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe]], one of the co-founders of the journal, withdrew after only a few issues, and by the spring of 1977, [[Douglas Crimp]] joined the editorial team. In 1990, after Crimp left the journal, Krauss and Michelson were joined by [[Yve-Alain Bois]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], Denis Hollier, and [[John Rajchman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://trikster.net/2/crimp/1.html |title=Mathias Danbolt, Front Room – Back Room: An Interview with Douglas Crimp |work=Trikster – Nordic Queer Journal #2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-26|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
As well as in-depth articles and reviews of 20th century and contemporary art, the journal features critical interpretations of cinema and popular culture from a progressive viewpoint.

==Impact==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the journal was an "influential vehicle for the debate surrounding the emergence of postmodernism and New Historicism in 20th-century art-historical studies", and the journal "contributed greatly to Anglo-American academics’ adoption of French theoretical innovations, especially those pertaining to the analysis of cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Rosalind-E-Krauss#ref1041327 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |work=Rosalind E. Krauss |accessdate=2016-01-09|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art Story'' describes the journal as "significant for revisiting and stressing the historical importance of early modes of 20th-century avant-garde art, such as Cubism, Surrealism and Expressionism".&lt;ref name = ArtStory/&gt;

'''P3 art and environment''' is an art organization, curatorial office and gallery in [[Shinjuku]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan, which opened in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P3 art and environment|url=http://islandsinstitute.pbworks.com/w/page/20166843/P3%20art%20and%20environment|publisher=Islands Institute Library - Archives|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; P3 art and environment was founded by urbanist and regional planner [[Takashi Serizawa]]. He was commissioned to build a new temple for Tochoji Zen Temple in [[Yotsuya]], Tokyo, commemorating its 400-year anniversary. Serizawa designed an auditorium in the basement of the temple, and devised a plan to expand the temple’s activities and explore cultural projects, mainly in the area of contemporary art. Subsequently “P3 Alternative Museum Tokyo”, was established. The first exhibition was held in April 1989.

In February 1991  the name was changed to P3 art and environment to better fit with the actual task and activities
Since then, P3 art and environment has spawned 40 contemporary art exhibitions and 70 lectures and workshops. In December 1995, P3 art and environment became an independent entity from Tochoji Zen Temple. The same year P3 art and environment established P3 Management co. as its commercially operating wing.

Since 2014 P3 is now located again in the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo, across from the Tochoji Zen Tempel where it was founded. The offices now incorporate a gallery space for art exhibitions and events.

==Exhibitions==

Notable exhibitions include [[Ingo Gunther]]’s [http://Worldprocessor.org Worldprocessor], (1990);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worldprocessor|url=http://p3.org/ENG/data/t/6/1/3/1/index.html|publisher=P3|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cai Guo-Qiang]]’s Primeval Fireball: Project for Projects (1991), [[Seiko Mikami]]'s Pulse Beats (1990), and [[Fama International#Sarajavo Survival Guide, 1993|Sarajevo Survival Guide]] by [[Fama International|Fama]] (1994).

==Curatorial Activities==

Public large scale exhibitions initiated, managed and curated by Mr Serizawa under the P3 brand are the [[Obihiro, Hokkaido|Obihiro]] Demeter Biennial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whittle|first=Keith|title=Interview with Takashi Serizawa, Director, P3 art and environment|url=http://keithwhittle.org/blog/sixth-post/|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Asahi Breweries|Asahi]] Art Festival, the [[Beppu]] Project among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=芹沢高志（P3 art and environment 統括ディレクター）|url=http://www.tarl.jp/cat_coordinator/1586.html|publisher=Tokyo Art Research Lab|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

P3 art and environment’s leitmotiv can be described in two words: "mind and landscape." This indicates a dynamic interactive formative process between people and the environment, as well as the individual and society. The spirit of time, renewed by continuous interaction between people and the surrounding environment, is revealed by excellent artists. P3 believes in the possibilities to be found in art and presents what is created through collaboration with artists.

P3 is actively initiating and curating exhibitions, authoring and publishing books&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p3.org/ENG/data/t/2/3/11/2/index.html|title=p3 art and environment|website=www.p3.org|language=ja|access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and catalogs as well as digital media. Research, education, and regional planning and advising is equally part of P3’s portfolio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb| The paradox of fiction asks why we experience strong emotions when, for example,  we are watching [[Hamlet]] on stage while at the same time knowing that it is not really Hamlet but merely an [[actor]].]]

The '''paradox of fiction''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] problem about how people can experience strong [[Aesthetic emotions|emotions]] from purely [[fiction]]al things, such as art, literature, and imagination. The [[paradox]] draws attention to an everyday issue of how people are moved by things which, in some ways, do not exist. Although the [[ontology]] of fictional things in general has been discussed in philosophy since [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=paskow2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Paskow|first=Alan|title=The Paradoxes of Art : A phenomenological investigation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the paradox was first suggested by [[Colin Radford]] and Michael Weston in 1975.&lt;ref name=radwest1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=Colin|author2=Weston, Michael|title=How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina?|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes|date=January 1975|volume=49|pages=67–93|jstor=4106870}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Radford and Weston's original paper, they and others have continued the discussion by giving the problem slightly differing formulations and solutions.&lt;ref name="iep2012"&gt;{{cite web|last = Schneider|first = Steven|title = The Paradox of Fiction|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/|publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The paradox ==
The basic paradox is as follows:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;

# Most people have emotional responses to characters, objects, events etc. which they know to be fictitious.
# On the other hand, in order for us to be emotionally moved, we must believe that these characters, objects, or events, truly exist.
# But no person who takes characters or events to be fictional at the same time believes that they are real.

The paradox is that all three premises seem to be true, but can not logically be true at the same time. If any two points (e.g. 1 and 3) are taken to be true, then the third (e.g. 2) must either be false or else produce a contradiction.

==Proposed solutions==
The various proposed solutions to the paradox can be divided into three basic groups:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iep2012" /&gt;

* The ''pretend'' or the ''simulation theories'', proposed for example by [[Kendall Walton]].
:The pretend theories deny premise 1 and argue that with fiction we do not experience real emotions but rather something less intense. For example, when watching a horror movie where the monster makes an attack towards the viewer (towards the camera), the viewer can be startled but does not truly fear for his or her life.
* The ''thought theories'', for example from [[Peter Lamarque]], [[Noël Carroll]], and Robert J. Yanal.
:The thought theories deny premise 2 and claim that we can have genuine emotions from things even if we do not believe them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/philosophy-articles-friday-phil-colin-radford-paradox-of-fiction/|title = Why Stories Make Us Feel: Colin Radford’s So-called "Paradox of Fiction" and How Art Prompts Human Emotion|date = November 13, 2015|access-date = February 22, 2016|website = The Gemsbok|publisher = |last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Friday Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''illusion'' or ''realist theories'', for example from Alan Paskow.
:The illusion theories deny premise 3 and claim that, in a way, the fictional characters are real. They suggest that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was right saying that fiction involves a ''[[Suspension of disbelief|"willing suspension of disbelief"]]'', i.e. believing in the fiction while engaging with it.

'''Parkett''' is an international magazine specializing in art. The magazine will cease publication in Summer 2017 with its 100th issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brian Boucher|title=Parkett Ceases Print Magazine After 33 Years|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/parkett-ceases-print-magazine-33-years-870326|accessdate=3 April 2017|work=Artnet|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Published three times per year in English and German by its publishing house in Zurich, Switzerland, with an additional editorial office in New York, Parkett has a circulation of 12,000 and is read by some 30,000 readers in 40 countries, one third of them in North America.&lt;ref name="parkettart.com"&gt;[http://www.parkettart.com/set_aboutus.htm About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118034107/http://www.parkettart.com/set_aboutus.htm |date=2009-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in the early 1980s with the idea of fostering an open dialogue between the artistic communities of Europe and America, ''Parkett'' is based in Zurich, with an office also in New York.  The magazine's goal has been to actively and directly collaborate with important international artists whose oeuvre is explored in several essays by leading writers and critics in both German and English. Each artist featured also creates a special signed and numbered work exclusive to Parkett. By 2010, ''Parkett'' had published more than 80 volumes with some 180 monographs and over 1500 in-depth texts making it one of the most comprehensive libraries on contemporary art worldwide. Critics, curators, art historians, and other commentators join in the conversation contained within its pages. Many write on the collaborating artists; some write opinions under a variety of topic headings that recur issue to issue; others write on additional artists and ideas. The result is more of a curated event-between-covers than a typical art magazine with reviews and news items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2001/parkett/|title=Interactives - Exhibitions - 2001 - Collaborations with Parkett|work=MoMA|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the fortieth issue of ''Parkett'', in June 1994 the editors presented a special thematic issue asking what beauty will look like after it reemerges from Postmodernism? And how, when contemporary life demands so many different things from contemporary art, do we strike a balance between history and presence, politics and humor? Taking the children's game of Snakes and Ladders as a guiding metaphor, the gala issue offers six mini-collaborations: Holland Cotter on [[Francesco Clemente]]; [[Boris Groys]] on [[Peter Fischli and David Weiss]]; David Rimanelli and Max Weechsler on [[Gunther Förg]]; [[Gordon Burn]] on [[Damien Hirst]]; Joan Simon on [[Jenny Holzer]]; and [[Gilbert Lascault]] on [[Rebecca Horn]]. Also in this issue, [[Dave Hickey]] wrote on magic, [[Vik Muniz]] on apparitions, Jeff Perrone on boards and borders, and [[G. Roger Denson]] on nomadic critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbook.com/3907509900.html|title=Parkett No. 40/41 Snakes &amp; Ladders|work=Artbook|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, on the occasion of ''Parkett'''s retrospective, the Museum of Modern Art in New York staged the exhibition, "Parkett - 20 Years of Artists' Collaborations", replete with a catalog raisonné of all artists' editions.  A book from the Kunsthaus Zurich exhibition in 2004 features unpublished artists sketches, documents, interviews, photographs and statements on the history and the making of Parkett since 1984. Exhibitions of Parkett's artists' editions have also been held in Cologne (Ludwig Museum), Frankfurt (Portikus), Copenhagen (Louisiana Museum), Tokyo (Hillside Forum), Geneva (Centre d'Art Contemporain), London (Whitechapel Art Gallery), and Zurich (Kunsthaus).&lt;ref name="parkettart.com"/&gt;

==Featured artists==
[[Laurie Anderson]], [[Richard Artschwager]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Matthew Barney]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Peter Fischli and David Weiss]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Rebecca Horn]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], [[Ann Hamilton (artist)|Ann Hamilton]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Sherrie Levine]], [[Jannis Kounellis]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Ross Minoru Laing]], [[Hanne Darboven]], [[Mariko Mori]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Brice Marden]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Edward Ruscha]], [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], [[Nancy Spero]],
and many more. 

In addition to the collaboration with these artists, ''Parkett'' features various articles on contemporary art within a series of playful rubrics such as Cumulus, Insert, or Les Infos du Paradis.

==History==

SaferVPN was released in 2013 by cybersecurity software developers, including founders Amit Bareket and Sagi Gidali. SaferVPN’s parent company began raising capital after creating and patenting a system created to aid law enforcement in identifying and catching car thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/294754|title=How to Choose a VPN Provider for Your Business|last=Onibalusi| first=Segun| date=2017-07-21 | work=Entrepreneur| access-date=2017-10-04| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tech.eu/brief/safervpn-funding/|title=Israeli VPN startup SaferVPN raises $1 million for business services|work=Tech.eu|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Imagine Cup|Microsoft Imagine Cup]] competition the first application cofounders Amit Bareket and Sagi Gidali assembled together made second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techcompanynews.com/safervpn-raises-1m-venture-funding-provide-businesses-scalable-cloud-based-vpn-applications-customizable-cloud-management-portal/|title=SaferVPN Raises $1M Venture Funding To Provide Businesses With Scalable, Cloud-Based VPN Applications And A Customizable Cloud Management Portal - Tech Company News|date=2017-09-22|work=Tech Company News|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #UnblockTheWeb ===
In March 2014 when [[Turkey]] attempted to block [[Twitter]], SaferVPN launched the #UnblockTheWeb initiative to give individuals blocked by government censorship free access to a VPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/08/tech-industry-democracy-free-speech-rights-google-politics|title=Why Google and other tech giants are creating tools for political dissidents|last=Liacas|first=Tom|date=2015-05-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, 2016, Unblock the Web provided a free VPN account to a coalition of Bangladeshi bloggers allowing them to communicate.&lt;ref name = huffingtonpost3&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-mesoznik/blogging-for-a-change-a-b_b_10161490.html | title = Blogging for a Change: A Blogger’s Journey to Advocate for His People and His Culture Through Blogging Activism| publisher = Huffington Post | accessdate = 24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Apple approved SaferVPN to implement automatic Wi-Fi Security. Its patented technology alerts users when they connect to an unsecured Wi-Fi network even if their device is locked, preventing harmful data leaks.&lt;ref name = geektime/&gt;

==Technology==
SaferVPN uses [[Protocols (computing)|protocols]] to secure data that is transmitted over its network. Each protocol varies in how the data is secured.&lt;ref name = geektime&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geektime.com/2016/09/09/israeli-safervpn-launches-automatic-wi-fi-solution-to-keep-users-secure-on-the-go/|title=SaferVPN's launches Automatic Wi-Fi solution for mobile|date=2016-09-09|work=Geektime|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
SaferVPN’s supported protocols include:
* [[OpenVPN]], the commonly used protocol due to its performance and security level.
* Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol ([[PPTP]]), a commonly used VPN protocol that uses basic encryption giving users fast connection speeds.
* Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol ([[L2TP]]/IPSec), secure but slower than other protocols. L2TP is a good option if OpenVPN or IKEv2 aren’t available. Unlike PPTP, L2TP/IPSec requires a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|shared key]] or the use of certificates.
* [[Internet Key Exchange|IKEv2]], the newest protocol available. Fastest of all protocols, it is secure and stable but not supported on all platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://itspmagazine.com/from-the-newsroom/seriously-can-you-not-do-that-chapter-iv-insecure-use-of-public-wi-fi|title=Seriously?!

== Mission Statement ==
[[World Wide Web|The World Wide Web]] started to function as a "[[Global village|Global Village]]" without any meaning to geographical boundaries. It was accessible, open and equal to all users. Over the years, more and more regulations have been enforced on the users and the Internet has turned into a completely different ecosystem.  Many countries have begun censoring a variety of sites and services (a prominent example is Iran and China, which blocked [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Gmail]], [[YouTube]] and many other well-known services). 

In addition, a high percentage of content services are currently accessible only from parent countries. For example, [[Netflix]], the popular content service, blocks access to most content for those outside the US. [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]], [[Spotify]], and many other sites are also blocked. 

In fact, the Internet has become a place with many "local villages" and defined boundaries.

SaferVPN focuses on developing a secure VPN service, which allows users to bypass censorship restrictions in more than 65 countries and bypass geographical limitations of various network services. In addition, the service enables users to enjoy network privacy and to avoid being monitored by governments and large companies and enjoy security over public wireless networks.

===''Big Bird's Egg Catch''===
'''''Big Bird's Egg Catch''''' (originally ''Grover's Egg Catch''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.digitpress.com/archives/arc00084.htm|title = DP Royal Archives - Coke Wins: The True Story|website = www.digitpress.com|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1983 video game for the [[Atari 2600]] developed by [[Atari]] and [[Children's Computer Workshop]].&lt;ref name="Big Bird"&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Bird's Egg Catch|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/atari2600/584585-big-birds-egg-catch/data|website=GameFAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Big Bird's Egg Catch'', the player controls [[Big Bird]] as he saves eggs produced by chickens at the top of the screen. These eggs travel down variously contorted chutes to land safely in the basket perched on Big Bird's head. Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible. "[[Turkey in the Straw]]", the song that plays during the egg-catching, also increases in tempo.

Periodically, Big Bird will exit the screen to count his eggs. During this stage, Big Bird is seen with his basket and numbers flash on the screen progressively faster as he counts. When the total is reached, a song is played and Big Bird dances. The game ends when too many eggs are dropped or a set number of counting sessions is performed.

[[File:Rembrandt, bue squartato, 1655, 01.JPG|thumb|''Slaughtered Ox'', 1655. Oil on panel. 95.5 x 68.8 cm. Louvre, Paris]]

'''''Slaughtered Ox''''', also known as '''''Flayed Ox''''', '''''Side of Beef''''', or '''''Carcass of Beef''''', is a 1655 oil on [[beech]] panel [[still life]] painting by [[Rembrandt]]. It has been in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in Paris since 1857.  A similar painting is in [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], Glasgow, possibly by Rembrandt himself but probably by one of his pupils, perhaps [[Fabritius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-carcase-of-an-ox-85827 The Carcase of an Ox], ArtUK&lt;/ref&gt;  Other similar paintings by Rembrandt or more likely his circle are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.  

The work follows in a tradition of artworks showing butchery, for example [[Pieter Aertsen]]'s ''[[A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms]]'' (1551) and [[Annibale Carracci]]'s ''[[Butcher's Shop]]'' (c. 1583), and perhaps more specifically [[Joachim Beuckelaer]]'s ''[[:File:Joachim Beuckelaer - Slaughtered Pig - WGA2122.jpg|Slaughtered Pig]]'' (1563).  Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c. 1635.  Another pre-1655 painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work by Rembrandt himself.  In northern Europe, November was traditionally the time for slaughtering livestock, before winter made feed difficult to find.  

The painting measures {{convert|95.5|x|68.8|cm}}, and is signed and dated "Rembrandt f. 1655".  It shows the butchered carcass of a bull or an ox, hanging in a wooden building, possibly a stable or lean-to shed.  The carcass is suspended by its two rear legs, which are tied by ropes to a wooden crossbeam.  The animal has been decapitated and flayed of skin and hair, the chest cavity has been stretched open and the internal organs removed, revealing a mass of flesh, fat, connective tissue, joints, bones, and ribs.  The carcass is carefully coloured, and given texture by [[impasto]].  In the background, a woman appears behind a half-open door, lifting the painting from [[still life]] into a [[genre painting]], a scene of everyday life.  It is sometimes considered a [[vanitas]] or [[memento mori]]; some commentators make references to the killing of the fatted calf in the biblical story of the [[Prodigal Son]], others directly to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].

The painting was possibly owned by Christoffel Hirschvogel in 1661. It was viewed by [[Joshua Reynolds]] in the collection of [[Pieter Locquet]] in Amsterdam in 1781, and later owned by [[Louis Viardot]], who sold it to the [[Louvre]] in 1857 for 5,000 francs.

The work's muscular depiction inspired [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], a series of works by  [[Chaim Soutine]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].  Most particularly, Bacon's ''[[Figure with Meat]]'' depicts [[Pope Innocent X]], as painted by [[Velazquez]], accompanied by ghostly echoes of the carcass from Rembrandt's painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2686">The '''Symphony No. 1''' is a [[symphony]] for [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Elliott Carter]].  The work was originally completed in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] on December 18, 1942, though Carter later revised the work in 1954.  It was first performed on April 27, 1944 by the Eastman-Rochester Symphony under the direction of [[Howard Hanson]] at the fourteenth annual Festival of American Music.  The piece is dedicated to Carter's wife.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Carter |year=1942 |title=Symphony No. 1 |publisher=[[G. Schirmer Inc.]] |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/26723 |accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The Symphony has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in three [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Moderately, wistfully
#Slowly, gravely
#Vivaciously

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (second doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s (first doubling [[E-flat clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s, two [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]], [[timpani]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
The Symphony No. 1 has been praised by music critics.  Reviewing a 2003 recording of the work (among other Carter pieces), [[Arnold Whittall]] of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' wrote:{{quote|The wartime muscularity of the Symphony No 1 (completed in 1942 but heard here in its 1954 revision) is clearest in passages which echo, or anticipate, Copland's more extrovert orchestral scores of the same period. But that triumphalist spirit is most productively on show in Carter's splendidly brash ''[[Holiday Overture]]'' (1944). The Symphony as a whole is less straightforward, more varied in style and character, and the slow movement in particular moves from hymnic meditation into more ambiguous regions of expression in a manner that might not be completely convincing. It is certainly distinctive, however, and fits well with the balance between restraint and exuberance that typifies the work as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whittall |first=Arnold |authorlink=Arnold Whittall |title=Carter Symphony No 1; Piano Concerto: Elliott Carter makes his Naxos début with an ear-catching programme |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=March 2004 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/carter-symphony-no-1-piano-concerto |accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

El autor y su obra |first=Miguel Ángel |last=Pérez Priego |access-date=18 September 2018 |work=[[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]] |publisher=Fundación Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is considered as the best piece in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] genre known as [[mester de clerecía]].

''The Book'' begins with prayers and a guide as to how to read the work, followed by stories each containing a moral and often comical tale.

==Theme and structure==

''The Book of Good Love'' is a varied and extensive composition of 1728 [[stanza]]s, centering on the fictitious autobiography of Juan Ruiz, Archpriest of Hita. Today three manuscripts of the work survive: the Toledo (T) and Gayoso (G) manuscripts originating from the fourteenth century, and the Salamanca (S) manuscript copied at the start of the fifteenth century by Alonso de Paradinas. All three manuscripts have various pages missing, which prevents a complete reading of the book, and each manuscript varies extensively from each other due to the diversions of the authors. The work most commonly read today was suggested by [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] in 1898 based on sections from all three manuscripts.

The book is famous for its variety of:
#Content (examples, love stories, traditional bucolic poems, fables, lyrical compositions, etc.)
#Meter (the cuaderna vía, sixteen syllabic verses, zéjel stanzas, etc.)
#Tone (serious, festive, religious, profane, etc.)

The work is composed of the following:
*The introduction, where the author explains how the book should be interpreted.
*A fictitious autobiography of the author in which he tells us of his relationships with women of different origin and social status: a [[nun]], a [[Moors|Moor]], a housewife he spied praying, a baker, a noble woman and several mountain women (''serranas''), often helped by another woman named Urraca, better known as ''Trotaconventos'' (Trots-between-monasteries)
*Several examples ([[parable]]s, [[fable]]s and tales) which serve as moral education at the end of each episode.
*The dispute between the author and Love (''Don Amor''), in which he accuses Love of being the cause of the seven [[mortal sin]]s
*The tale of the love of Mr. Melon (''don Melón'') and Mrs. Endrina, an adaptation of the medieval [[elegiac comedy]] ''[[Pamphilus de amore]]''.
*The tale of a battle between [[Carnival]] ("Don Carnal") and [[Lent]] ("Doña Cuaresma")
*A commentary of "Ars Amandi" (Art of Love) by [[Ovid]]
*A number of songs dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]
*A number of profane songs, such as that upon the death of "Trotaconventos"

==Interpretation==
The title ''The Book of Good Love'' is inferred from the text, and who or what Good Love may be is not revealed by the author.

''The Book of Good Love'' explains how men must be careful about Love that can be Good (el buen amor) or Foolish (el loco amor). The Good Love is God's one and is preferred to the Foolish love which only gives men sins. Juan Ruiz gives the reader a lot of examples to explain his theory and avoid Foolish love in name of Good one.

The '''woman's film''' is a [[film genre]] which includes women-centered narratives, female protagonists and is designed to appeal to a female audience. Woman's films usually portray "women's concerns" such as problems revolving around domestic life, the family, motherhood, self-sacrifice, and [[Romance (love)|romance]].{{sfn|Doane|1987|pp=152&amp;ndash;53}} These films were produced from the [[Silent film|silent era]] through the 1950s and early 1960s, but were most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, reaching their zenith during [[World War II]]. Although [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] continued to make films characterized by some of the elements of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself disappeared in the 1960s. The work of directors [[George Cukor]], [[Douglas Sirk]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Josef von Sternberg]] has been associated with the woman's film genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heung | first = Marina | authorlink = | editor1-first = Angela | editor1-last = Howard | editor2-first = Frances M. | editor2-last = Kevenik | title = Handbook of American Women's History | url = | publisher =  Garland | location = New York | year = 1990 | chapter = | chapterurl = | isbn = 978-0-8240-8744-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] were some of the genre's most prolific [[movie star|stars]].{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=163}}

The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to [[D. W. Griffith]]'s silent films. [[Film historian]]s and critics defined the genre and canon in retrospect. Before the woman's film became an established genre in the 1980s, many of the classic woman's films were referred to as [[Melodrama#Film|melodrama]]s.

Woman's films are films that were made ''for'' women by predominantly male screenwriters and directors whereas [[women's cinema]] encompasses films that have been made ''by'' women.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=153}}

==Definition==

When the woman's film was still at a nascent stage, it was not regarded as a fully independent genre.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=29}} [[Mary Ann Doane]], for example, argued that the woman's film is not a "pure genre" because it is crossed and informed by a number of other genres such as melodrama, [[film noir]], the gothic, and [[horror film]].&lt;ref&gt;Doane cited in Altman 1998, pp. 28&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, film scholar Scott Simmon argues that the woman's film has remained "elusive" to the point of having its very existence questioned. This elusiveness, he argues, is partially due to the fact that the woman's film is an oppositional genre which can only be defined in opposition to male-centered genres like the [[Western (genre)|Western]] and [[Mob film|gangster film]].{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=68}} It has also been noted that it is a critically rather than industrially constructed genre, having been defined in retrospect rather than at the time of the films' production.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=28}} The woman's film was seen as closely related to and even synonymous with melodrama.&lt;ref name="modleski"&gt;Modleski, Tania (1984). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1225094 "Time and Desire in the Woman's Film"]. ''[[Cinema Journal]]'' '''23''' (3): 19&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms commonly used to describe the woman's film were "drama", "romance", "love story", "comedy drama", and "soap opera".&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Stephen (1993). "Melo Talk: On the Meaning and Use of the Term 'Melodrama' in the American Trade Press". ''[[Velvet Light Trap|The Velvet Light Trap]]'' '''32''' (3): 66&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, the woman's film has been an established film genre.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=32}} Film scholar Justine Ashby, however, has observed a trend in [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] that she calls "generic eclipse" whereby films that adhere to all the fundamental tenets of the woman's film are subsumed under other genres. ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943) and ''[[Two Thousand Women]]'' (1944), for example, have been described and promoted as war films rather than woman's films.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=155}}

The woman's film differs from other film genres in that it is primarily addressed to women.{{sfn|Doane|1987|p=3}} Cinema historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] argues that the first of three purposes of the woman's film is "to place a woman at the center of the story universe".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} In most other and particularly men-oriented film genres the opposite is the case as women and their concerns have been assigned minor roles. [[Molly Haskell]] explains that "if a woman hogs this universe unrelentingly, it is perhaps her compensation for all the male-dominated universes from which she has been excluded: the gangster film, the western, the war film, the policier, the rodeo film, the [[adventure film]]".{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=155}} The second purpose of the woman's film, according to Basinger, is "to reaffirm in the end the concept that a woman's true job is that of being a woman". A romantic ideal of [[love]] is presented as the only "career" that will guarantee happiness and that women should aspire to.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} The third purpose of the genre, as suggested by Basinger, is "to provide a temporary visual liberation of some sort, however small – an escape into a purely romantic love, into sexual awareness, into luxury, or into the rejection of the female role".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} Basinger argues that the major – if not only – action of the woman's film and its biggest source of drama and tragedy is the necessity to make a choice.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=19}} The heroine will have to decide between two or more paths that are equally appealing but mutually exclusive as, for example, romantic love and a fulfilling job. One path will be right and consistent with the film's overall morality and the other path will be wrong but it will provide liberation. As the films' heroines were punished for following the wrong path and ultimately reconciled to their roles as women, wives, and mothers, Basinger argues that woman's films "cleverly contradict themselves" and "easily reaffirm the status quo for the woman's life while providing little releases, small victories or even big releases, big victories".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=10}}

Unlike male-centered movies which are frequently shot outdoors, most woman's films are set in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]],{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=24}} which defines the lives and roles of the female protagonist.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=181}} Whereas the events in woman's films &amp;ndash; weddings, proms, births &amp;ndash; are [[socialization|socially]] defined by nature and society, the action in male films &amp;ndash; chasing criminals, participating in a fight &amp;ndash; is story-driven.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=9}}

The themes in woman's and male-oriented films are often diametrically opposed: fear of separation from loved ones, emphasis on emotions, and human attachment in women's films, as opposed to fear of intimacy, repressed emotionality, and individuality in male-oriented movies.{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=24}} The plot conventions of woman's films revolve around several basic themes: love triangles, unwed motherhood, illicit affairs, the rise to power, and mother-daughter relationships.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|pp=163, 166}} The narrative pattern depends on the activity engaged in by the heroine and commonly includes sacrifice, affliction, choice, and competition.{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=157}} The maternal melodrama, the career woman comedy, and the paranoid woman's film, a subgenre based on suspicion and distrust, are the most frequent subgenres.{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=125}} Female madness, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[hysteria]], and [[amnesia]] were frequent plot elements in Hollywood's woman's films of the 1940s. This trend took place when Hollywood tried to incorporate aspects of [[psychoanalysis]]. In the medical discourse in films like ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948), mental health is visually represented by beauty and mental illness by an unkept appearance; health was restored if the female protagonist improved her appearance.{{sfn|Doane|1986|pp=153, 155}} [[Friendship]] among women was fairly common,{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=45}} although the treatment was superficial and focused more on women's dedication to men and female-male relationships than on their friendships with each other.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|pp=36&amp;ndash;40}}

[[File:Annex - Stanwyck, Barbara (Stella Dallas) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|In [[King Vidor]]'s ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937), Barbara Stanwyck plays a [[Working class|working-class]] mother who sacrifices her connection to her daughter in order to help her become part of an [[Upper class|upper-class]] world.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=46}}]]
The woman's films that were produced in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] have a strong thematic focus on [[Social class|class]] issues and questions of economic survival whereas the 1940s woman's film places its protagonists in a middle- or upper-middle-class world and is more concerned with the characters' emotional, sexual, and psychological experiences.{{sfn|McKee|2014|pp=24&amp;ndash;25}}

The female protagonist is portrayed as either good or bad.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=164}} Haskell distinguishes three types of women that are particularly common to woman's films: the extraordinary, ordinary and the "ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary". The extraordinary women are characters like [[Scarlett O'Hara]] and [[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]] who are played by equally extraordinary actresses like [[Vivien Leigh]] and Bette Davis. They are independent and emancipated "aristocrats of their sex" who transcend the limitations of their sexual identities. The ordinary women, in contrast, are bound by the rules of their respective societies because their range of options is too limited to break free of their limitations. The ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary is a character who "begins as a victim of discriminatory circumstances and rises, through pain, obsession, or defiance, to become mistress of her fate."{{sfn|Haskell|1987|pp=160&amp;ndash;61}} Depending on the type of heroine a film champions, a film can be either socially conservative or progressive.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|p=28}} Certain archetypal characters appear in many woman's films: unreliable husbands, the other man, a female competitor, the reliable friend, usually an older woman, and the sexless male, frequently depicted as an older man who offers the protagonist security and luxury but makes no sexual demands on her.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|pp=165&amp;ndash;66}}

A common motif in Hollywood's woman's films is that of the [[doppelgänger]] sisters (often played by the same actress), one good and one bad who vie for one man as [[Bette Davis]] in her double role in ''[[A Stolen Life (1946 film)|A Stolen Life]]'' (1946) and [[Olivia de Havilland]] in ''[[The Dark Mirror (film)|The Dark Mirror]]'' (1946).{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=78}} The good woman is portrayed as passive, sweet, emotional, and asexual whereas the bad woman is assertive, intelligent, and erotic. The conflict between them is resolved with the defeat of the bad woman.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Lucy (1983). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1225070 "Two-Faced Women: The 'Double' in Women's Melodrama of the 1940s"]. ''Cinema Journal'' '''23''' (1): 24&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; A central element of the 1980s British woman's film is the motif of escape. Woman's films allow their respective female protagonists to escape their everyday lives and their socially and sexually prescribed roles. The escape can take the form of a journey to another place such as the [[USSR]] in ''[[Letter to Brezhnev]]'' (1985) and [[Greece]] in ''[[Shirley Valentine (film)|Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989) or education as in ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983) and sexual initiation as in ''[[Wish You Were Here (1987 film)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1987).{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=155}}

==History==
The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to [[D. W. Griffith]], whose one- and two-reelers ''[[A Flash of Light]]'' (1910) and ''[[Her Awakening]]'' (1911) feature the trademark narratives of repression and resistance that would later define a majority of women's films.{{sfn|Simmon|1993|pp=68&amp;ndash;69, 71}} Other predecessors of the genre include women-centered [[serial film]]s such as ''[[The Exploits of Elaine]]'' (1914) and ''[[Ruth of the Rockies]]'' (1920).{{sfn|Hollinger|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TA8iYChqyb0C&amp;pg=PA36 36]}}

The woman's film genre was particularly popular in 1930s and 1940s, reaching its zenith during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="russel"&gt;Russel, Catherine (1994). [http://www.filmstudies.ca/journal/pdf/cj-film-studies32_Russell_mourning.pdf "Mourning the Woman's Film: The Dislocated Spectator in ''The Company of Stranger''"]. ''Canadian Journal of Film Studies'' '''3''' (2): 25&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The film industry of that time had an economic interest in producing such films as women were believed to comprise a majority of movie-goers. In line with this perception, many woman's films were prestigious productions which attracted some of the best stars and directors.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=45}} Some film scholars suggest that the genre as a whole was well-regarded within the film industry,{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=193}} while others argue that the genre and term "woman's film" had derogatory connotations and was used by critics to dismiss certain films.{{sfn|Haskell|1987|pp=154&amp;ndash;55}} 

Production of women's films dropped off in the 1950s as melodrama became more male-centered and as [[soap opera]]s began to appear on television.&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt; Although [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] continued to make films marked by some of the features and concerns of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself disappeared in the 1960s.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=184}}

The genre was revived in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heung | first = Marina | authorlink = | editor-first = Lucy | editor-last = Fischer | title = Imitation of Life: Douglas Sirk, Director | url = | publisher =  [[Rutgers University Press]] | location = [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] | year = 1991 | chapter = 'What's the matter with Sarah Jane?': Daughters and Mothers in Douglas Sirk's ''Imitation of Life'' | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=NxHbph9wFJsC&amp;pg=PA302 | isbn = 978-0-8135-1644-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to create modern versions of the classic woman's film, updated to take account of new social norms, include [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' (1978) by [[Paul Mazursky]], [[Garry Marshall]]'s ''[[Beaches (film)|Beaches]]'' (1988), and ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes]]'' (1991) by [[Jon Avnet]]. Similarly, the 2002 films ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'' and ''[[Far from Heaven]]'' took their cues from the classic woman's film.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=49}} Elements of the woman's film have reemerged in the modern [[horror film]] genre. Films such as [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976) and [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) subvert traditional representations of femininity and refuse to follow the traditional marriage plot. The female protagonists in these movies are driven by something other than romantic love.{{sfn|Greven|2011|pp=91&amp;ndash;140}}

Within [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]], [[David Leland]] returned to the formula of the 1980s woman's film in ''[[The Land Girls (film)|The Land Girls]]'' (1998). The film tells the story of three young women during World War II and offers its heroines the opportunity to escape their old lives. ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' (2002) emphasizes the key generic theme of female friendship and casts the heroine in a conflict between the restrictions of her traditional [[Sikh]] upbringing and her aspirations to become a [[Association football|football player]]. [[Lynne Ramsay]]'s ''[[Morvern Callar (film)|Morvern Callar]]'' is based on the woman's film tradition; a young woman escapes to Spain and pretends to be the author of her boyfriend's novel. While Morvern's journeys and transformations allow for liberation, she ends up where she started.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|pp=162, 163&amp;ndash;65, 166&amp;ndash;68}}

==Response==
Jeanine Basinger notes that woman's films were often criticized for reinforcing conventional values, above all, the notion that women could only find happiness in love, marriage and motherhood. However, she argues that they were "subtly subversive". They implied that a woman could not combine a career and a happy family life, but they also offered women a glimpse of a world outside the home, where they did not sacrifice their independence for marriage, housekeeping, and childrearing. The pictures depicted women with successful careers as journalists, pilots, car company presidents, and restaurateurs.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=163}} Similarly, Simmon notes that the genre offered a mixture of repression and liberation, in which repressive narratives are regularly challenged, partly via [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]] and acting but also by conflicts within the narratives themselves. He further states that such resistances were present in some of the earliest woman's films and became the rule with [[Douglas Sirk]]'s postwar American woman's films.{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=71}} Others have argued, however, that the narratives of these films offer only the repressive perspective and that viewers must read the texts "against the grain" to be able to find a liberating message.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|p=35}} Critics such as Haskell have criticized the term "woman's film" itself. She writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;What more damning comment on the relations between men and women in America than the very notion of something called the 'woman's film'? ... A film that focuses on male relationships is not pejoratively dubbed a 'man's film' ..., but a 'psychological drama.'"{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some woman's film have been met with critical acclaim. Woman's films that were selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" include ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1934), ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' (1941), ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942),&lt;ref&gt;LaPlace, Maria.
