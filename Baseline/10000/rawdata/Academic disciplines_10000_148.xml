'''Absolute space and time''' is a concept in physics and philosophy about the properties of the universe. In physics, absolute space and time may be a [[preferred frame]].

==Before Newton==
A version of the concept of absolute space (in the sense of a preferred frame{{clarify|date=August 2018|Reason=What is a preferred frame?}}) can be seen in [[Aristotelian physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/#2 Absolute and Relational Theories of Space and Motion]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. Westman]] writes that a "whiff" of absolute space can be observed in [[Copernicus]]' classic work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', where Copernicus uses the concept of an immobile sphere of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Westman, ''The Copernican Achievement'', University of California Press, 1975, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2018|reason=How is absolute spacetime illustrated by an immobile sphere of stars, and what does that mean anyway? (I know but I doubt the average reader does.) What "whiff" of absolute spacetime in De Revolutionibus? General reader (even one who knows generally about ''De revolutionibus'', and immobile spheres of stars) needs a less allusive explanation, or rather less comparing, and more clear, specific language.}}

==Newton==
Originally introduced by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', the concepts of absolute time and space provided a theoretical foundation that facilitated [[Newtonian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newton, absolute time and space respectively are independent aspects of objective reality:&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;In ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica'' See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Newton, absolute time exists independently of any perceiver and progresses at a consistent pace throughout the universe. Unlike relative time, Newton believed absolute time was imperceptible and could only be understood mathematically. According to Newton, humans are only capable of perceiving relative time, which is a measurement of perceivable objects in motion (like the Moon or Sun). From these movements, we infer the passage of time.

{{quote|Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies: and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space ...

Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place into another: and relative motion, the translation from one relative place into another ...|Isaac Newton}}

These notions imply that absolute space and time do not depend upon physical events, but are a backdrop or stage setting within which physical phenomena occur. Thus, every object has an absolute state of motion relative to absolute space, so that an object must be either in a state of absolute [[Rest (physics)|rest]], or moving at some absolute [[speed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-iframes/ Space and Time: Inertial Frames (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; To support his views, Newton provided some empirical examples: according to Newton, a solitary rotating sphere can be inferred to rotate about its axis relative to absolute space by observing the bulging of its equator, and a solitary pair of spheres tied by a rope can be inferred to be in [[absolute rotation]] about their center of gravity ([[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]]) by observing the tension in the rope.

Absolute time and space continue to be used in [[classical mechanics]], but modern formulations by authors such as [[Walter Noll]] and [[Clifford Truesdell]] go beyond the [[linear algebra]] of [[elastic moduli]] to use [[topology]] and [[functional analysis]] for non-linear [[Field theory (physics)|field theories]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Truesdell (1977) ''A First Course in Rational Continuum Mechanics'', [[Academic Press]] {{ISBN|0-12-701301-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differing views==
[[Image:Rotating spheres.svg|thumb|200px|Two spheres orbiting around an axis. The spheres are distant enough for their effects on each other to be ignored, and they are held together by a rope. The rope is under tension if the bodies are rotating relative to absolute space according to [[Rotating spheres|Newton]], or because they rotate relative to the universe itself according to [[Mach's principle|Mach]], or because they rotate relative to local [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]] according to [[general relativity]].]]
Historically, there have been differing views on the concept of absolute space and time. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] was of the opinion that space made no sense except as the relative location of bodies, and time made no sense except as the relative movement of bodies.&lt;ref name="Ferraro"&gt;{{citation|title=Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|first1=Rafael|last1=Ferraro|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2007|isbn=9780387699462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]] suggested that, lacking any point of reference, a sphere in an otherwise empty universe could not be conceived to rotate, and a pair of spheres could be conceived to rotate relative to one another, but not to rotate about their center of gravity,&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book |title=The Matter Myth: Dramatic Discoveries that Challenge Our Understanding of Physical Reality |author= Paul Davies |author2= John Gribbin |page= 70 |isbn=0-7432-9091-7 |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlmEIGiZ0g4C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=universe+Milky++rotation#PPA70,M1   }}&lt;/ref&gt; an example later raised by [[Albert Einstein]] in his development of general relativity.

A more recent form of these objections was made by [[Ernst Mach]]. [[Mach's principle]] proposes that mechanics is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular, [[mass]] is an expression of such relative motion. So, for example, a single particle in a universe with no other bodies would have zero mass. According to Mach, Newton's examples simply illustrate relative rotation of spheres and the bulk of the universe.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;Ernst Mach; as quoted by {{cite book |title=Gravitation and Inertia |author=Ignazio Ciufolini |author2=John Archibald Wheeler |pages=386–387 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYIs1ndbi38C&amp;pg=RA1-PA386&amp;dq=centrifugal+Einstein+rotating+globes#PRA1-PA387,M1 |isbn=0-691-03323-4 |date=1995 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When, accordingly, we say that a body preserves unchanged its direction and velocity ''in space'', our assertion is nothing more or less than an abbreviated reference to ''the entire universe''.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;mdash;Ernst Mach; as quoted by [[Ignazio Ciufolini|Ciufolini]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler]]: ''Gravitation and Inertia'', p. 387&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These views opposing  absolute space and time may be seen from a modern stance as an attempt to introduce [[operational definition]]s for space and time, a perspective made explicit in the special theory of relativity.

Even within the context of Newtonian mechanics, the modern view is that absolute space is unnecessary. Instead, the notion of [[inertial frame of reference]] has taken precedence, that is, [[preferred frame|a preferred ''set'' of frames of reference]] that move uniformly with respect to one another. The laws of physics transform from one inertial frame to another according to [[Galilean invariance|Galilean relativity]], leading to the following objections to absolute space, as outlined by Milutin Blagojević:&lt;ref name="Blagojević2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gravitation and Gauge Symmetries |author=Milutin Blagojević |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8JDSi_eNbwC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=inertial+frame+%22absolute+space%22#PPA5,M1 |isbn=0-7503-0767-6 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* The existence of absolute space contradicts the internal logic of classical mechanics since, according to Galilean principle of relativity, none of the inertial frames can be singled out.
* Absolute space does not explain inertial forces since they are related to acceleration with respect to any one of the inertial frames.
* Absolute space acts on physical objects by inducing their resistance to acceleration but it cannot be acted upon.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newton himself recognized the role of inertial frames.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;Isaac Newton: ''Principia'', Corollary V, p. 88 in Andrew Motte translation. See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a practical matter, inertial frames often are taken as frames moving uniformly with respect to the [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref name=Moeller&gt;{{cite book |author=C Møller |title=The Theory of Relativity |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford UK |isbn=0-19-560539-X |date=1976 |page=1 |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/220221617&amp;referer=brief_results |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Inertial frame of reference]] for more discussion on this.

==Special relativity==
The concepts of space and time were separate in physical theory prior to the advent of [[special relativity]] theory, which connected the two and showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame's motion. In Einstein's theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were superseded by the notion of [[spacetime]] in [[special relativity]], and curved spacetime in [[general relativity]].

Absolute simultaneity refers to the concurrence of events in time at different locations in space in a manner agreed upon in all frames of reference. The theory of relativity does not have a concept of absolute time because there is a [[relativity of simultaneity]]. An event that is simultaneous with another event in one frame of reference may be in the past or future of that event in a different frame of reference,&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|59}} which negates absolute simultaneity.

==Einstein==
{{Main article|Einstein's views on the aether}}
Quoted below from his later papers, Einstein identified the term [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] with "properties of space", a terminology that is not widely used. Einstein stated that in [[general relativity]] the "aether" is not absolute anymore, as the [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and therefore the structure of spacetime depends on the presence of matter.&lt;ref name=kostb&gt;{{Citation|author=Kostro, L.|title=Albert Einstein's New Ether and his General Relativity|journal=Proceedings of the Conference of Applied Differential Geometry|pages=78–86|date=2001|url=http://www.mathem.pub.ro/proc/bsgp-10/0KOSTRO.PDF|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802120105/http://www.mathem.pub.ro/proc/bsgp-10/0KOSTRO.PDF|archivedate=2010-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|To deny the ether is ultimately to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever. The fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view. For the mechanical behaviour of a corporeal system hovering freely in [[vacuum|empty space]] depends not only on relative positions (distances) and relative velocities, but also on its state of rotation, which physically may be taken as a characteristic not appertaining to the system in itself. In order to be able to look upon the rotation of the system, at least formally, as something real, Newton objectivises space. Since he classes his absolute space together with real things, for him rotation relative to an absolute space is also something real. Newton might no less well have called his absolute space “Ether”; what is essential is merely that besides observable objects, another thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real, to enable [[acceleration]] or [[rotation]] to be looked upon as something real.|Albert Einstein, Ether and the Theory of Relativity (1920)&lt;ref name=einstb&gt;Einstein, Albert: "[[s:Ether and the Theory of Relativity|Ether and the Theory of Relativity]]" (1920), ''Sidelights on Relativity'' (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation|Because it was no longer possible to speak, in any absolute sense, of simultaneous states at different locations in the aether, the aether became, as it were, four-dimensional, since there was no objective way of ordering its states by time alone. According to special relativity too, the aether was absolute, since its influence on inertia and the propagation of light was thought of as being itself independent of physical influence....The theory of relativity resolved this problem by establishing the behaviour of the electrically neutral point-mass by the law of the geodetic line, according to which inertial and gravitational effects are no longer considered as separate. In doing so, it attached characteristics to the aether which vary from point to point, determining the metric and the dynamic behaviour of material points, and determined, in their turn, by physical factors, namely the distribution of mass/energy. Thus the aether of general relativity differs from those of classical mechanics and special relativity in that it is not ‘absolute’ but determined, in its locally variable characteristics, by ponderable matter.|Albert Einstein, Über den Äther (1924)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=A. Einstein | date=1924 | title=[[wikilivres:Über den Äther|Über den Äther]] | journal=Verhandlungen der Schweizerischen naturforschenden Gesellschaft | volume=105|issue=2|pages=85–93}}.

==General relativity==
Special relativity eliminates absolute time (although Gödel and others suspect absolute time may be valid for some forms of general relativity)&lt;ref name="Savitt"&gt;{{citation|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven F.|title=There's No Time Like the Present (in Minkowski Spacetime)|doi=10.1086/392846|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=67|issue=S1|date=September 2000|citeseerx=10.1.1.14.6140}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general relativity further reduces the physical scope of absolute space and time through the concept of [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]].&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;{{Rp|207–223}} There appears to be absolute space in relation to the [[celestial sphere|distant stars]] because the local geodesics eventually channel information from these stars, but it is not necessary to invoke absolute space with respect to any system's physics, as its local geodesics are sufficient to describe its spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mach's Principle II|first1=James G.|last1=Gilson|date=September 1, 2004|arxiv=physics/0409010|bibcode = 2004physics...9010G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''belief–desire–intention''' ('''BDI''') model of human practical reasoning was developed by [[Michael Bratman]] as a way of explaining future-directed intention.

BDI is fundamentally reliant on [[folk psychology]] (the 'theory theory'), which is the notion that our mental models of the world are theories. It was used as a basis for developing the [[belief–desire–intention software model]].

==Applications==

BDI was part of the inspiration behind the [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI software architecture]], which Bratman was also involved in developing. Here, the notion of intention was seen as a way of limiting time spent on deliberating about what to do, by eliminating choices inconsistent with current intentions.

BDI has also aroused some interest in psychology. BDI formed the basis for a computational model of childlike reasoning [https://web.archive.org/web/20070629002644/http://cognition.iig.uni-freiburg.de/csq/pdf-files/Wahl_Spada.pdf CRIBB]. It has been proposed that autistic children do not recognise other people as folk-psychological agents (i.e., agents with their own beliefs, etc.). BDI has been used to develop a [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/7906/21803/01011803.pdf rehabilitation strategy] to teach autistic children to reason about other people.

{{Bible related}}
In Christian communities, '''Bible study''' is the study of the [[Bible]] by ordinary people as a personal [[spiritual practice|religious or spiritual practice]].  Some denominations may call this '''devotion''' or '''devotional acts'''; however in other denominations ''devotion'' has other meanings.  ''Bible study'' in this sense is distinct from ''[[biblical studies]]'', which is a formal [[academic]] discipline.

==Personal Bible study==
In [[Evangelical]] [[Protestantism]], the time set aside to engage in personal Bible study and prayer is sometimes informally called a [[Quiet Time]]. In other traditions personal Bible study is referred to as "devotions". [[Catholic devotions]] and [[Anglican devotions]] both employ the ''[[Lectio Divina]]'' method of Bible reading.

Christians of all denominations may use [[study Bible]]s and Bible reading notes to assist them in their personal Bible studies. However, the use of such aids is discouraged in many churches,{{which|date=March 2018}} which advocate the simple reading of Bible passages. In some cases, the practice of reading through the entire Bible in a year is followed, this usually requires readings each day from both the Old and New Testament. This practice, however, has been widely criticized{{by whom|date=March 2018}} on the basis that the understanding gained of each specific passage is too vague.

The association of Bible study and [[Christian prayer|prayer]] is an important one. Christians do not merely study the Bible as an academic discipline, but with the desire to know God better. Therefore, they frequently pray that God will give them understanding of the passage being studied. They also consider it necessary to consider what they read with an attitude of respect, rather than the critical attitude which is frequently followed in formal study. To them, the Bible is not just a sacred book, but is the very Word of God, that is, a message from God which has direct relevance to their daily lives.

=== Inductive Bible study ===
Inductive Bible study is a means of studying and [[Exegesis|exegeting]] a biblical passage. [[Richard Krejcir]] describes it terms of "interviewing a passage" without preconceptions or agendas.&lt;ref name=Krejcir /&gt; Inductive Bible study involves examining the ideas and words of the text, which leads to the meanings and then the interpretations, which in turn lead the reader to conclusions and applications.&lt;ref name=Krejcir&gt;
{{cite web | last  =Krejcir | first = Richard J | title = Why Inductive Bible Study? 
| url = http://70030.netministry.com/articles_view.asp?articleid=31555&amp;columnid=3801 
| authorlink = Richard Krejcir |accessdate = 7 March 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In inductive study, the reader will read a passage and then ask questions of how they personally interpret the verse(s). These questions can range from what the verse(s) literally means to how it applies to the believer's present personal circumstances. The purpose of these questions is to go deep enough into the text to extract the meaning and then to apply that gained knowledge to their personal life in order to create change for their own or other people's benefit.&lt;ref name="Into thy word"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krejcir|first=Richard Joseph|title=How to Study the Bible?|url=http://www.intothyword.org/pages.asp?pageid=53488|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exegetical Bible study ===
In this type of study, the believer also goes beyond the surface value of the text. However, the purpose is not so much for personal application as gaining information. Exegetical study is used most often by pastors, theologians, writers, professors, and church leaders in order to prepare for sharing lessons with others. It is often categorized as advanced Bible study and is meant to extract the ideas found in the text for the primary purpose of teaching.&lt;ref name="Into thy word"/&gt;

==Small groups==

Bible study groups within congregations are sometimes known as [[cell groups]], though many different names exist. The Bible is often studied in informal small groups, and groups within [[parachurch organization]]s. During these study times, groups will set their main topic to be biblical studies. Though there may exist some form of worship and prayer, the purpose of Bible study is to collectively grasp an understanding of God through His Word. These groups become small communities often sharing this personal journey to discovering the meaning of the passage.

Some Churches encourage the formation of small groups while others form casually or due to shared interest or common circumstances (such as a singles small group or a newly wed couple group). These groups range from young children, normally middle school and up led by an adult, to elderly people. These groups can even interact with other small groups.

In recent years many successful church growth attribute the effectiveness of [[cell groups]], groups can be formed based on age group e.g. youth, young adults etc., or by profile –singles, married couples, by gender male or female homogeneous grouping.

== Catholic Bible study ==

{{see also|Catholic theology of Scripture}}

''[[Providentissimus Deus]]'', "On the Study of Holy Scripture", is an encyclical letter issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on 18 November 1893. In it, he reviewed the history of Bible study from the time of the [[Church Fathers]] to the present, spoke against the errors of the [[Rationalists]] and "[[Higher criticism|higher critics]]", and outlined principles of scripture study and guidelines for how scripture was to be taught in [[seminaries]]. He also addressed the issues of apparent contradictions between the Bible and physical science, or between one part of scripture and another, and how such apparent contradictions can be resolved.

''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', ("Inspired by the [[Holy Spirit]]"), is a [[papal encyclical]] letter issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] on 30 September 1943 calling for new translations of the Bible from the original languages, instead of the [[Latin Vulgate]] of [[Jerome]], which was revised multiple times and had formed the textual basis for all [[Catholic]] vernacular translations until then. It inaugurated the modern period of Roman Catholic [[biblical studies]] by encouraging the study of [[textual criticism]] (or ''lower criticism''), pertaining to text of the Scriptures themselves and transmission thereof (for example, to determine correct readings) and permitted the use of the [[historical-critical method]] (or ''higher criticism''), to be informed by [[Catholic theology|theology]], [[Sacred Tradition]], and [[ecclesiastical history]] on the historical circumstances of the text.

The general theme of the "[[Logos_(Christianity)|Word of God]]" was covered by the [[Second Vatican Council]] in November 1965 in its Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation: [[Dei Verbum]].

The 1992 [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] describes principles of Bible Study in paragraphs 101-141 and other sections.  For Catholics, the Word of God is not a "dead letter" but is incarnate and living.  Christ must through the [[Holy Spirit]] open minds to understand the Scriptures&lt;ref&gt;Cathechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 108 with allusion to {{bibleref|Luke|24:45}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

''[[Verbum Domini]]'' ({{lang-en|The Word of the Lord}}) is a post-synodal [[apostolic exhortation]] issued by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] which deals with how the [[Catholic church]] should approach the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=8243 Catholic Culture : Latest Headlines : Pope Benedict issues major document on Sacred Scripture (link to full text)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He issued it following the XII Ordinary [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]], which had met in October 2008 to discuss "The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/synod/index.htm Synod of Bishops - Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verbum Domini'' is dated September 30, 2010, for the [[calendar of saints|Feast]] of [[St. Jerome]], the [[patron saint]] of [[Biblical studies]].

'''Calcium pumps''' are a family of [[ion transporter]]s found in the [[cell membrane]] of all animal cells. They are responsible for the [[active transport]] of [[calcium]] out of the cell for the maintenance of the steep Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; [[electrochemical gradient]] across the cell membrane. Calcium pumps play a crucial role in proper [[cell signalling]] by keeping the intracellular calcium concentration roughly 10,000 times lower than the extracellular concentration.&lt;ref name="Carafoli"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carafoli E |title=Calcium pump of the plasma membrane |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=129–53 |date=January 1991 |pmid=1986387 |doi= |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1986387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failure to do so is one cause of muscle [[cramp]]s.

The [[plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase|plasma membrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase]] and the [[sodium-calcium exchanger]] are together the main regulators of [[intracellular space|intracellular]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref name="Strehler "&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strehler EE, Zacharias DA |title=Role of alternative splicing in generating isoform diversity among plasma membrane calcium pumps |journal=Physiol.

== Biological role ==
{{main article|Calcium in biology}}
Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has many important roles as an intracellular messenger. The release of a large amount of free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can trigger a fertilized egg to develop, skeletal muscle cells to contract, secretion by secretory cells and interactions with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -responsive proteins like calmodulin. To maintain low concentrations of free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the cytosol, cells use membrane pumps like calcium ATPase found in the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. These pumps are needed to provide the steep electrochemical gradient that allows Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to rush into the cytosol when a stimulus signal opens the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in the membrane. The pumps are also necessary to actively pump the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; back out of the cytoplasm and return the cell to its pre-signal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Bray|first2=Dennis|last3=Hopkin|first3=Karen|last4=Johnson|first4=Alexander D|last5=Lewis|first5=Julian|last6=Raff|first6=Martin|last7=Roberts|first7=Keith|last8=Walter|first8=Peter|title=Essential Cell Biology|date=2009|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=978-0815341291|pages=552–553|edition=3rd}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crystallography of calcium pumps==
The structure of calcium pumps found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle was elucidated in 2000 by Toyoshima, et al. using microscopy of tubular crystals and 3D microcrystals. The pump has a molecular mass of 110,000 [[atomic mass unit|amu]], shows three well separated cytoplasmic domains, with a transmembrane domain consisting of ten alpha helices and two transmembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toyoshima|first1=Chikashi|last2=Nakasako|first2=Masayoshi|last3=Nomura|first3=Hiromi|last4=Ogawa|first4=Haruo|title=Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 Å resolution|journal=Nature|date=8 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6787|pages=647–655|doi=10.1038/35015017|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6787/full/405647a0.html|accessdate=28 March 2016|pmid=10864315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prokaryotes and fungi==
[[File:Penicillium notatum.jpg|thumb|The fungus [[Penicillium chrysogenum]]. It produces [[penicillin]], a compound which kills bacteria.|alt=|left]]
Bacteria of the genera ''[[Chromobacterium]]'', ''[[Janthinobacterium]]'', and ''[[Pseudoalteromonas]]'' produce a toxic secondary metabolite, [[violacein]], to deter protozoan predation. Violacein is released when bacteria are consumed, killing the protozoan. Another bacteria, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', aggregates into [[quorum sensing]] biofilms which may aid the coordinated release of toxins to protect against predation by protozoans. Flagellates were allowed to grow and were present in a biofilm of ''P. aeruginosa'' grown for three days, but no flagellates were detected after seven days. This suggests that concentrated and coordinated release of extracellular toxins by biofilms has a greater effect than unicellular excretions.&lt;ref&gt;Matz, C., &amp; Kjelleberg, S. (2005). Off the hook—how bacteria survive protozoan grazing. Trends in microbiology, 13(7), 302–307. {{doi|10.1016/j.tim.2005.05.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial growth is inhibited not only by bacterial toxins, but also by secondary metabolites produced by fungi as well.&lt;ref name=Keller2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=gloer/&gt; The most well-known of these, first discovered and published by Alexander Fleming in 1929, described the antibacterial properties of a "mould juice" isolated from ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum|Penicillium notatum]]''. He named the substance penicillin, and it became the world's first broad-spectrum antibiotic.&lt;ref name=Keller2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, A. (1929). On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of B. influenzae. British journal of experimental pathology, 10(3), 226. {{pmc|2048009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many fungi are either pathogenic [[Saprotroph|saprophytic]], or live within plants without harming them as [[endophyte]]s, and many of these have been documented to produce chemicals with antagonistic effects against a variety of organisms, including fungi, bacteria, and protozoa.&lt;ref name=Keller2005/&gt; Studies of [[coprophilous fungi]] have found antifungal agents which reduce the fitness of competing fungi.&lt;ref name=gloer/&gt; In addition, [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]] of ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' contained a number of previously unknown [[Aflavinine|aflavinines]] which were much more effective at reducing predation by the fungivorous beetle, ''[[Carpophilus hemipterus]]'', than [[Aflatoxin|aflatoxins]] which ''A. flavus'' also produced and it has been hypothesized that ergot alkaloids, [[Mycotoxin|mycotoxins]] produced by ''[[Claviceps purpurea]]'', may have evolved to discourage herbivory of the host plant.&lt;ref name=gloer/&gt;

== Plants ==
{{Main|Plant_defense_against_herbivory#Chemical_defenses}}

A wealth of literature exists on the defensive chemistry of secondary metabolites produced by terrestrial plants and their antagonistic effects on pests and pathogens, likely owing to the fact that human society depends upon large-scale agricultural production to sustain global commerce. Since the 1950s, over 200,000 secondary metabolites have been documented in plants.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, T. (2007). From waste products to ecochemicals: fifty years research of plant secondary metabolism. Phytochemistry, 68(22), 2831–2846. {{doi|10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.09.017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds serve a variety of physiological and allelochemical purposes, and provide a sufficient stock for the evolution of defensive chemicals. Examples of common secondary metabolites used as chemical defenses by plants include [[alkaloids]], [[phenols]], and [[terpenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Levin, D. A. (1976). The chemical defenses of plants to pathogens and herbivores. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 7(1), 121–159. {{doi|10.1146/annurev.es.07.110176.001005}}. {{JSTOR|2096863}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Defensive chemicals used to avoid consumption may be broadly characterized as either toxins or substances reducing the digestive capacity of herbivores. Although toxins are defined in a broad sense as any substance produced by an organism that reduces the fitness of another, in a more specific sense toxins are substances which directly affect and diminish the functioning of certain metabolic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Wittstock, U., &amp; Gershenzon, J. (2002). Constitutive plant toxins and their role in defense against herbivores and pathogens. Current opinion in plant biology, 5(4), 300–307. {{doi|10.1016/S1369-5266(02)00264-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patterns&gt;Cates, R. G., &amp; Rhoades, D. F. (1977). Patterns in the production of antiherbivore chemical defenses in plant communities. Biochemical Systematics and Ecology, 5(3), 185–193. {{doi|10.1016/0305-1978(77)90003-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Toxins are minor constituents (&lt;2% dry weight), active in small concentrations, and more present in flowers and young leaves. On the other hand, indigestible compounds make up to 60% dry weight of tissue and are predominately found in mature, woody species.&lt;ref name=Patterns/&gt; Many alkaloids, pyrethrins, and phenols are toxins. Tannins are major inhibitors of digestion and are polyphenolic compounds with large molecular weights. Lignin and cellulose are important structural elements in plants and are also usually highly indigestible. Tannins are also toxic against pathogenic fungi at natural concentrations in a variety of woody tissues.&lt;ref name=Berenbaum1995 /&gt; Not only useful as deterrents to pathogens or consumers, some of the chemicals produced by plants are effective in inhibiting competitors as well. Two separate shrub communities in the California chapparal were found to produce phenolic compounds and volatile terpenes which accumulated in soil and prevented various herbs from growing near the shrubs.

Many insects are distasteful to predators and excrete irritants or secrete poisonous compounds that cause illness or death when ingested. Secondary metabolites obtained from plant food may also be sequestered by insects and used in the production of their own toxins.&lt;ref name=Fhagg2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=BEETLE&gt;Dettner, K. (1987).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13843">[[File:Peru map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Peru map of Köppen climate classification.]]
The '''climate of Peru''' is very diverse,  with a large variety of [[climate]]s and [[microclimate]]s, including 28 of the 32 world climates.  Such a diversity is chiefly conditioned by the presence of the [[Andes mountains]] and the cold [[Humboldt Current]]
      
The  climate on the coast is [[arid]] and semi-arid with high temperatures and very little [[rain]]fall. The Andes mountains observe a cool-to-cold climate with rainy [[summer]]s and very dry [[winter]]. The eastern lowlands present an [[Equatorial climate]] with hot weather and rain distributed all year long.

==Pacific coast==
The climate of the coast ranges from warm-[[Semi-arid|semiarid]] (north of 10°S, and thus very close to the equator) to a climate which is a bit like the Mediterranean (Köppen Csb) climate with an important difference &amp;mdash; the winter, although cloudy and cool, does not have sufficient rainfall to be considered a Köppen C climate.

The high coastal climate is mostly determined by the influence of the cold Humboldt Current, which runs parallel to the Peruvian coast, blocking the possibility of precipitation coming from the Ocean. Should this current be warm instead, the presence of the Andes would suffice for high amounts of [[orographic precipitation]], such as registered in the top north and south part of the [[South America]]n coastal Andes.
[[Image:Peru Provinces Costa Sierra Selva.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of the Peruvian provinces climate-wise: coastal (light yellow) – mountain (clay) – jungle (deep green)]]

===Northern coast===
The temperature extremes of the northern coast (3°S–6°S) range from {{convert|30|to|38|°C|°F|1}}. Summers are characterized by hot and sunny conditions, with occasional afternoon and nocturnal light rainshowers. The farther north, the less arid, due to the Humboldt Current getting less cold as it nears the Equator. Thus, the [[Tumbes Region]], bordering [[Ecuador]], is the only coastal one with regular seasonal precipitation.

Summer rainfall totals rarely exceed {{convert|210|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, save for severe [[El Niño]] events, which can provoke major floodings, with precipitations which can be as high as {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, especially in the readings observed over the entire Peruvian coast; the aforementioned Tumbes region and [[Piura Region|Piura]] are the hottest. Winter is characterized by warm yet comfortable conditions and absence of rain.

===Central and southern coast===

In the central and southern coasts (south of 6°S) temperature ranges from {{convert|8|to|30|°C|°F|1}} and rainfall is scarce with annual totals are 150&amp;nbsp;mm. Summer is characterized by warm, moist and sunny conditions with lows between {{convert|20|and|22|°C|°F|1}} and highs are between {{convert|24|and|29|°C|°F|1}}. Temperatures over {{convert|29|°C}} are commonly observed less than 12 days per year except at the Ica deserts where summer highs can sometimes reach {{convert|35|°C}}. Little or no rainfall occurs during the summer. Very rare rainfall events are produced by the leftovers of Andean convection and occur during the night. Summer rainfall totals are generally less than {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.

Winter is characterized by overcast, cool and damp conditions, which keep daytime temperatures cool. Strictly by the coast and a few kilometers inland, winter is determined by an almost permanent layer of fog, which creates ''garua'', a particular [[Fog#Sea and coastal fog|mist own to coastal Peru and Chile]]. In those areas located right by the ocean, the so-called 'rainy season' develops by late May and comes to an end by mid October. Precipitation occurs in the form of nocturnal-morning [[drizzle]] and seasonal totals range between {{convert|10|and|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Winter precipitation favors the development of vegetation over particular coastal mountain ranges known as "Lomas". The desert green-up peaks between July and early November.

Temperatures range from {{convert|14|–|18|°C|°F|1}} at night and {{convert|19|–|21|°C|°F|1}} during the day. Winter highs oscillate between {{convert|15|and|21|°C|°F|1}} and the lows between {{convert|8|and|15|°C|°F|1}}. Several weeks of persistent overcast skies and highs below {{convert|19|°C|1}} are not uncommon between July and September.

Some representative [[weather station]] averages:
* [[Piura]] (north); {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|24.4|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|72|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} Climate type BWh (hot [[desert]]).
* [[Lima]], (central); {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|19.2|°C}}; annual {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type BWh ("subtropical" desert, but cold [[Humboldt Current]] generates fog).
* [[Lomas de Lachay]], [[Huaral Province]] in [[Lima]], a unique mist-fed ecosystem.

==Andean highlands==

The Peruvian Andes (''clima de Sierra'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) exhibits the largest diversity among the country. Temperature is proportional to altitude, varying from temperate (annual average of {{convert|18|°C|disp=or}}) in the low-lying valleys to frigid (annual average below {{convert|0|°C|disp=or}}) in the [[alpine climate|highest elevations]]. The maximum temperature is often steady throughout the year, the low varying due to the presence of clouds in the rainy season, which help keeping to some extent the daytime heat during the night. In the absence of clouds, nights are much colder.

Precipitation varies in different scales and has a marked seasonality. The [[Wet season|rainy season]] starts in September but peaks between January and March, whereas the May–August part of the year is characterized by strong [[insolation]], very dry conditions and cold [[night]]s and [[morning]]s, which is almost the exact reverse, in terms of insolation, to the coast climate. There is a marked southwest-northeast rainfall gradient with the driest conditions ({{convert|200|-|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) along the southwestern Andes, and the wettest conditions along the eastern slopes (&gt;{{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year). Upon the interaction between the topography and the mean flow, some regions immediately east of the Andes can receive as much as {{convert|10000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. Rainfall is also larger over mountain ranges than over valley floors, since most of the rainfall occurs in the form of afternoon convective storms. Lakes also modulate the distribution and rainfall amounts. [[Lake Titicaca]], for example, induces nocturnal convective storms that produce twice as much rainfall over the lake than over the surrounding terrain. Occasionally [[thunderstorm]]s can be accompanied by frequent cloud to ground [[lightning]], strong [[wind]]s and damaging [[hail]], especially during the onset of the rainy season and over higher elevations. [[Snow]]fall is frequent above {{convert|5000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} during the rainy season, and occasional above {{convert|3800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} between May and August.

Some representative averages
* [[Chachapoyas, Peru]]; {{convert|2435|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|15.3|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|796|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Oceanic climate|Cwb]]. 
* [[Cusco|Cuzco]], Peru; {{convert|3249|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|12.5|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|736|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Oceanic climate|Cwb]].&lt;ref name="klimadiagramme"&gt;http://www.klimadiagramme.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern lowlands==
The eastern lowlands are characterized by the [[Equatorial climate]] which feeds the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. The climate of this region is hot and rainy most of the year. Temperatures oscillate between {{convert|18|–|36|°C|°F|1}} most of the year and rainfall varies between {{convert|1000|and|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. South of 8°S, a short dry season occurs between June and August. Occasional cold surges that originate over [[Argentina]] may lower the temperature to {{convert|10|–|15|°C|°F}}. These events occur 1–5 times per year between May and September.

Some representative averages:

* [[Iquitos]], Peru; {{convert|126|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, annual mean temperature {{convert|26.2|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|2853|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Equatorial climate|Af]]. 
* [[Yurimaguas]], Peru; {{convert|184|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; annual mean temperature {{convert|26.9|°C}}; annual mean precipitation {{convert|2047|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, Climate type [[Equatorial climate|Af]].&lt;ref name="klimadiagramme"/&gt;

===2009 winter===
From April to July 2009, unusually cold weather resulted in the deaths of more than 100 children under the age of five.&lt;ref name="Almost 250 children"/&gt;  In June, there were 50,000 suffering from acute respiratory infections, and 4,851 with pneumonia.  Between mid April and mid June, 61 children perished.&lt;ref name="soe"/&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] reported over 13,500 cases of [[pneumonia]], and more than 60,000 cases of [[respiratory infection]]s.  The [[Adventist Development and Relief Agency]] (ADRA) is distributing blankets and warm clothing.  Whereas pneumonia cases resulting in death of infants (who are often underclothed, if not barefoot) are the norm during winter, the 2009 winter season was unusual in that it began 12 weeks earlier than usual.  More than 80 of the deaths occurred in [[Puno]], Peru, one of the larger cities of the [[Altiplano]] lying in the central [[Andes]].  The children suffering from malnourishment are the population at greatest risk in an impoverished southern area of Peru lacking health care facilities.&lt;ref name="Almost 250 children"&gt;{{cite web

Yehude Simon, presidential Cabinet Chief, reported that 27 million [[Peruvian nuevo sol|S/]] or [[United States dollar|US$]]9 million was allotted for [[Puno]] and 23,230 vaccine{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} doses were shipped out.  Oscar Ugarte, the Health Minister reported that only 234 of these vaccines were administered.  Carmen Vildoso, Minister of Women's Affairs is working at developing a program to create solar panel heated walls in residential homes to provide heating.

In June, Percy Zaga Bustinza, Director of Puno's Social Development reported that a new [[Pinaya]] health centre would be opening up and also a small hospital in [[Santa Lucia]].  [[UNICEF]] would like action taken so that the deaths from the predictable cold weather can be prevented. As well preventative measures should be put in place so that the cold weather does not arise in an emergency situation anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  School hours were modified for the children's school days so they are not out in the coldest part of the day.  By the middle of June, livestock and crops had been adversely affected by the cold weather across {{convert|92000|ha|acre|0}} of land. In July 2009, a [[state of emergency]] was declared by [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of Peru]] [[Alan García Pérez]] in 11 regions of Peru: [[Apurímac Region|Apurímac]], [[Arequipa Region|Arequipa]], [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]], [[Cusco Region|Cusco]], [[Huancavelica Region|Huancavelica]], [[Junín Region|Junín]], [[Lima Region|Lima]], [[Moquegua Region|Moquegua]], [[Pasco Region|Pasco]], [[Puno Region|Puno]] and [[Tacna Region|Tacna]].&lt;ref name="soe"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The cold winter weather is expected to end in September.&lt;ref name="soe"/&gt;

=== 2010 state of emergency ===
In July 2010, the Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in 16 of Peru's 24 regions due to cold weather. The majority of the areas affected are in the south, where temperatures have dropped to as low as -24C. Lima recorded its lowest temperatures in 38 years at 9C, and emergency measures have been applied to several of its outlying districts. In the Amazon region temperatures dropped to as low as 9C, the fifth recorded cold spell this year. In the south, hundreds of people - nearly half of them very young children - are reported as having died of cold-related diseases such as pneumonia, and poor rural populations living at more than 3,000m above sea level being the most affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Conservation psychology''' is the scientific study of the reciprocal relationships between [[human]]s and the rest of [[nature]], with a particular focus on how to encourage [[conservation movement|conservation]] of the [[natural environment|natural world]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;Saunders, C.D. 2003. The Emerging Field of Conservation Psychology. Human Ecology Review, Vol. 10, No, 2. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a specialty area within [[psychology]] itself, it is a growing field for scientists, researchers, and practitioners of all disciplines to come together and better understand the earth and what can be done to preserve it. This network seeks to understand why humans hurt or help the environment and what can be done to change such behavior. The term "conservation psychology" refers to any fields of psychology that have understandable knowledge about the environment and the effects humans have on the natural world. Conservation psychologists use their abilities in "greening" psychology and make society [[ecologically sustainable]].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ Myers, Gene. ''Conservation Psychology''. WWU. January 20, 2002.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219133545/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of conservation psychology is oriented toward environmental sustainability, which includes concerns like the conservation of [[natural resources|resources]], conservation of [[ecosystem]]s, and quality of life issues for humans and other [[species]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

One common issue is a lack of understanding of the distinction between conservation psychology and the more-established field of [[environmental psychology]], which is the study of transactions between individuals and all their physical settings, including how people change both the built and the natural environments and how those environments change them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, R. 2007. Environmental Psychology: Principles and Practice (4th ed.). Colville, WA: Optimal Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental psychology began in the late 1960s (the first formal program with that name was established at the City University of New York in 1968), and is the term most commonly used around the world. Its definition as including human transactions with both the natural and built environments goes back to its beginnings, as exemplified in these quotes from three 1974 textbooks: "Environmental psychology is the study of the interrelationship between behavior and the built and natural environment"&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.A., Fisher, J. D., &amp; Loomis, R.J.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Philadelphia PA: Saunders (p. 6).&lt;/ref&gt; and "...the natural environment is studied as both a problem area, with respect to [[environmental degradation]], and as a setting for certain recreational and psychological needs",&lt;ref&gt;Ittelson, W.H., Proshansky, H.M., Rivlin, L.G., Winkel, G.H. 1974. Environmental Psychology: An Introduction. New York: Hold, Rinehart, and Winston (p. 6),&lt;/ref&gt; and a third that included a chapter entitled The Natural Environment and Behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Heimstra, N.W. &amp; McFarling, L.H.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation psychology, proposed more recently in 2003 and mainly identified with a group of US academics with ties to zoos and environmental studies departments, began with a primary focus on the relations between humans and animals. Introduced in ecology, policy, and biology journals, some have suggested that it should be expanded to try to understand why humans feel the need to help or hurt the environment, along with how to promote conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clayton|first=S|author2=Brook, A|title=Can Psychology Save the World?  A Model for Conservation Psychology|journal=[[Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy]] |date=Dec 2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=87–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneers in this field==
Psychologists from all fields including philosophy, biology, sociology, industrial and organizational, health, and consumer psychology, along with many other subfields like environmental education and [[conservation biology]] come together to put their knowledge to practice in educating others to work together and encourage a congruous relationship between humans and the environment around them. These psychologists work together with places such as zoos and aquariums. Zoos and aquariums may seem to only be places of recreation and fun but are actually trying hard to put positive messages out and to educate the public on the homes and needs of the animals that live there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitgood|first=Stephen C.|title=Environmental psychology in museums, zoos, and other exhibition centers|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|location=NJ|isbn=0-471-40594-9|pages=461–480}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are trying to find ways to interact and teach the public the consequences of their day to day actions to the animals and the environment rather than simply viewing the animals. Psychologists and sociologists have been visiting workshops and think tanks at the zoos to evaluate if the animals are being viewed and shown to the best of their ability while still giving informative knowledge to the public.

==Research to consider==
What characterizes conservation psychology research is that in addition to descriptive and theoretical analyses, studies will explore how to cause the kinds of changes that lessen the impact of human behavior on the natural environment, and that lead to more sustainable and harmonious relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Zelezny, L.C. &amp; Schultz, P.W. (eds.). 2000. Promoting environmentalism. Journal of Social Issues 56, 3, 365–578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, C.M. 1999. Psychological perspectives on sustainability. In E. Becker and T. Jahn (eds.), Sustainability and the Social Sciences: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Integrating Environmental Considerations into Theoretical Reorientation, 223–42. London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research being done with respect to conservation is estimating exactly how much land and water resources are being used by each human at this point along with projected future growth.  Also important to consider is the partitioning of land for this future growth.  Additionally, conservation efforts look at the positive and negative consequences for the biodiversity of plant and animal life after humans have used the land to their advantage.  In addition to creating better conceptual models, more applied research is needed to: 1) identify the most promising strategies for fostering ways of caring about nature, 2) find ways to reframe debates and strategically communicate to the existing values that people have, 3) identify the most promising strategies for shifting the societal discourse about human–nature relationships, and 4) measure the success of these applications with respect to the conservation psychology mission.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; The ultimate success of conservation psychology will be based on whether its research resulted in programs and applications that made a difference with respect to environmental sustainability. We need to be able to measure the effectiveness of the programs in terms of their impact on behavior formation or behavior change, using tools developed by conservation psychologists.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

== Present research and future planning ==
Conservation psychology research has broken down the four most important tenets of promoting positive conservation attitudes into "the four 'I's".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Vugt|first=Mark|title=Averting the Tragedy of the Commons: Using Social Psychological Science to Protect the Environment|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=1 June 2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=169–173|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01630.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include: Information, Identity, Institutions, and Incentives.  Research has been done in all four categories.

=== Information ===
Studies have shown that the way in which crises are presented is a key predictor for how people will react to them.  When people hear that they personally can help to alleviate a crisis through their conservation efforts, just by simple actions with their personal energy use, they are more likely to conserve.  However, if people are told that the other people around them are overusing energy, it increases selfish behavior and causes people to actually consume more.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"&gt;{{cite journal|last=SAUNDERS|first=CAROL D. |author2=BROOK, AMARA T. |author3=EUGENE MYERS, OLIN|title=Using Psychology to Save Biodiversity and Human Well-Being|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 June 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=702–705|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching people about the benefits of conservation, including easy ways to help conserve, is an effective way to inform about and promote more environmentally friendly behavior.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Patrick R.|author2=Greco, Steven E. |author3=Thorne, James H. |title=Boundaries Make a Difference: The Effects of Spatial and Temporal Parameters on Conservation Planning*|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=24 June 2010|volume=62|issue=3|pages=409–425|doi=10.1080/00330121003788309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, research has shown that making sure people understand more about the boundaries of land they can help preserve actually improves positive attitudes towards conservation.  When people know more about local regions they can help protect, they will care more.  Knowing more about the regions includes knowing the extent of the [[biodiversity]] in that region, and being sure that the ecosystem will remain healthy and protected.  Cost analysis is another important factor.  People do not want to take risks on valuable lands, which in places like California, could be worth billions.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"/&gt;

=== Identity ===
In general, people like to fit in and identify with their peer social groups.  Studies have shown people identify more intimately with close friends and family, which is why conservation campaigns try to directly address the most people.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"/&gt;  The "think of the children" argument for conservation follows this logic by offering a group everyone can relate to and feel close to.  Studies have also shown that this need to fit in among peer social groups can be reinforced positively or negatively: giving positive feedback on energy bills for conserving in their homes encourages people to continue lower energy use.  Examples of negative [[reinforcement]] include the use of negative press against companies infamous for heavy pollution.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

Another interesting line of research looks at how people identify positively or negatively with certain issues.  One relevant idea is the notion of "consistency attitudes".  Studies have shown that people tend to take a good association they have, and then use this to make positive or negative links with other, related things.  For example, if someone thinks it is a good idea to protect old Pacific forests, this will positively form a link to also want to protect smaller forests and even grasslands.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bright|first=Alan D.|author2=Barro, Susan C. |author3=Burtz, Randall T. |title=Attitudes Toward the Protection and Restoration of Natural Areas Across Three Geographic Levels: An Examination of Interattitude Consistency1|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=1 November 2001|volume=31|issue=11|pages=2301–2321|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This same line of thinking can cause someone who supports the protection of old Pacific forests to start thinking negatively about the creation of more logging roads.  Other studies on consistency attitudes have shown that, with one particular issue, people like to align their preferences with each other.  This has been shown repeatedly while looking at political ideologies and racial attitudes, and studies have shown that this can also include environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  Finally, other studies have shown that how people identify an ecosystem geographically can affect their concern for it.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  For instance, when people think of saving the rainforests, they often think of this as a global problem and support it more readily.  However, lesser known but still significant local ecosystems remain ignored and unprotected.

=== Institutions ===
Another approach that has been considered is the use of organized institutions and government as the leaders for promoting conservation.  However, these leaders can only be effective if they are trusted.  Studies from previous crises where conserving resources was extremely necessary showed that people were more likely to obey energy restrictions and follow certain leaders when they felt they could trust the people directing them.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  People need to understand that they are being encouraged to act a certain way out of necessity, and that they are not being misled.

=== Incentives ===
Incentivizing conservation through rewards and fines is another approach.  Studies have shown that people who identify more with their community need less incentives to conserve than those who do not identify strongly with their surrounding community.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  For corporations, monetary incentives have been shown to work for companies showing some effort to make their buildings and practices more "green".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  Studies have also shown that doing something as simple as putting a water meter in homes has helped incentivize conservation by letting people track their energy consumption levels.  Finally, studies have shown that when giving fines, it is better to start with very small and then raise it for repeated violations.  If the fines are too high, the issue becomes too economic, and people start to mistrust the authorities enforcing the fines.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

==Main concepts==
Conservation psychology assesses as a whole four different concepts. At the country's first Conservation Psychology conference these four things were discussed. The first is the main original topic of the field, and the other three are topics with a previous history in [[environmental psychology]].

The first topic being discussed is the connection of humans and animals. The Multi-Institutional Research Project (MIRP) works diligently on finding ways to develop a compassionate stance towards animals in the public eye. Many different questions were assessed to find answers to questions concerning ways to help develop loving attitudes for animals and the earth. With these questions and answers, effective educational and interpretive programs were made that would help review the progress.

The second concept that was discussed at the conference concerned connections of humans and places. A new language of conservation will be supported if there are abundant opportunities for meaningful interactions with the natural world in both urban and rural settings. Unfortunately, as biodiversity is lost, every generation has fewer chances to experience nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, P.K., Jr. 1999. The human relationship with nature. Development and culture. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. 2006. Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution: in press.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many questions asked concerning how humans in their everyday lives could be persuaded or educated well enough to make them want to join in programs or activities that help maintain biodiversity in their proximity. Local public and private organizations were asked to come together to help find ways to protect and manage local land, plants, and animals. Other discussions came to whether people on an individual or community level would voluntarily choose to become involved in maintaining and protecting their local biodiversity. These plus many other important questions were contemplated. Techniques in marketing are a key tool in helping people connect to their environment. If an identity could be connected from the environment to towns becoming more urbanized, maybe those living there would be more prone to keep it intact.

The third discussion covered the aspects of producing people who act [[environmentally friendly]]. Collectively, any activities that support sustainability, either by reducing harmful behaviors or by adopting helpful ones, can be called conservation behaviors. Achieving more sustainable relationships with nature will basically require that large numbers of people change their reproductive and consumptive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Any action, small or large, that helps the environment in any way is a good beginning to a future of generations who only practice environmentally friendly behavior. This may seem to be a far-fetched idea but with any help at all in educating those who do not know the repercussions of their actions could help achieve this. Approaches to encouraging a change in behavior were thought about carefully. Many do not want to change their way of life. A more simplistic lifestyle rather than their materialistic, current lives hurt their environment around them rather than help, but could people willingly change? To take public transportation rather than drive a car, recycling, turning off lights when they are not needed, all these things are very simple yet a nuisance to actually follow through with. Would restructuring tax-code help people to want to change their attitudes? Any concept to reach the goal of helping people act ecologically aware was discussed and approached. Some empirical evidence shows that simply "being the change you want to see in the world" can influence others to behave in more environmentally friendly ways as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, R., &amp; Gifford, R. (2013). Be the Change You Want to See: Modeling Food Composting in Public Places. Environment &amp; Behavior, 45, 323-343, DOI: 10.1177/0013916511431274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and final point at the first Conservation Psychology convention was the discussion of the values people have to their environment. Understanding our relationship to the natural world well enough so that we have a language to celebrate and defend that relationship is another research area for conservation psychology. According to the [[biophilia hypothesis]], the [[human]] species evolved in the company of other life forms, and we continue to rely physically, emotionally, and intellectually on the quality and richness of our affiliations with natural diversity.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; A healthy and diverse natural environment is considered an essential condition for human lives of satisfaction and fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Kellert, S.R. &amp; Wilson E.O. (eds.). 1993. The Biophilia Hypothesis. Washington, DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Where did they get these values and are they ingrained to the point they cannot be changed? How can environmentally educated people convey value-based communication to a community, a nation, or even on a global level? National policy for this model is something that is desired but under such a strong political scrutiny this could be very challenging. Advocates for biodiversity and different programs came together to try to find methods of changing Americans' values concerning their environment and different methods to express and measure them.

==Connection of conservation in biology and psychology==
[[Conservation biology]] was originally conceptualized as a crisis-oriented discipline, with the goal of providing principles and tools for preserving biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Soule, M.E. (1987). History of the Society for Conservation Biology: How and why we got here. Conservation Biology, 1, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a branch of biology that is concerned with preserving genetic variation in plants and animals. This scientific field evolved to study the complex problems surrounding habitat destruction and species protection. The objectives of conservation biologists are to understand how humans affect biodiversity and to provide potential solutions that benefit both humans and non-human species. It is understood in this field that there are underlying fields of biology that could readily help to have a better understanding and contribute to conservation of biodiversity. Biological knowledge alone is not sufficient to solve conservation problems, and the role of the social sciences in solving these problems has become increasingly important.&lt;ref&gt;Mascia, M.B.; Brosius, J.P.; Dobson, T.A.; Forbes, B.C.; Horowitz, L.; McKean, M.A. &amp; N.J. Turner. 2003. Conservation and the social sciences. Conservation Biology 17: 649–50.&lt;/ref&gt; With the knowledge of conservation biology combined with other fields, much was thought to be gained. Psychology is defined as the scientific study of human thought, feeling, and behavior.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Psychology was one of the fields that could take its concepts and apply them to conservation. It was also always understood that in the field of psychology there could be much aid to be given, the field only had to be developed. Psychology can help in providing insight into moral reasoning and moral functioning, which lie in the heart of human–nature relationships.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Everyone that is now involved from the field of psychology had knowledge of ways to conceptualize the relationship of humans to their environment. Biology has always been involved in advances of conservation considering biodiversity, and the organisms in it are part of the main field of biology. Psychology has been absent from conservation for some time, but educators and scientists are realizing that with the help of both we can come to a better understanding of humans and their social interactions with their environment and everything in it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4263">In [[cognitive science]], association by '''contiguity''' is the principle that ideas, memories, and experiences are linked when one is frequently experienced with the other. For example, if you constantly see a knife and a fork together they become linked (associated). The more these two items (stimuli) are perceived together the stronger the link between them. When one of the memories becomes activated later on, the linked (contiguously associated) memory becomes temporarily more activated and thus easier to be called into working memory. This process is called ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]],'' and the initial memory that primed the other is called the ''retrieval cue.''

Association by contiguity is the root of association by similarity. Association by similarity is the idea that one memory primes another through their common property or properties. Thus, an apple may prime a memory of a rose through the common property of red. These two become associated even though you may have never experienced an apple and a rose together (consistent with association by contiguity).

In the study of human memory, the contiguity effect has been found in studies of free recall.  Analyses of free recall data indicates that there tends to be the greatest number of +/- 1 transitions between words, suggesting that a person is more likely to recall words together that are closer together in a list.&lt;ref name="Syracuse University"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sederberg, Howard &amp; Kahana|title=A context-based theory of recency and contiguity in free recall|url=http://memory.syr.edu/papers/SedeEtal08.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is shown in a graph of conditional response probability as a function of lag as originated by Dr. Michael Kahana.  The probability of recall (y-axis) is plotted against the lag, or separation between subsequently recalled words.&lt;ref name=Kahana&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahana|first=Michael|last2=Howard |last3=Zaromb |last4=Wingfield|title=Age dissociates recency and lag-recency effects in free recall|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2001}} See also figure http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/File:Crp2a_square.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if two items A and B are learned together, when cued with B, A is retrieved and vice versa due to their temporal contiguity, although there will be a stronger forward association (when cued with A, B is recalled).&lt;ref name=Kahana/&gt;

The contiguity effect appears relatively constant, and has been predicted to have long-term effects according to the temporal context model proposed by Howard and Kahana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|author2=Kahana|title=A distributed representation of temporal context|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|year=2002|volume=46|pages=269–299|doi=10.1006/jmps.2001.1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model explains the contiguity effect in the following manner:  when an item is presented, it activates the temporal context that was active when the item was originally studied.  Since contexts of neighboring items overlap, and that overlap increases with decreasing lag between items, a contiguity effect results.&lt;ref name="Syracuse University"/&gt; The contiguity effect has even been found between items in different lists, although it has been speculated that these items could simply be intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|last2=Youker |last3=Venkatadass|title=The persistence of memory: Contiguity effects across hundreds of seconds|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|year=2008|volume=1|issue=15|pages=58–63|doi=10.3758/pbr.15.1.58 |pmc=2493616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When one associated memory, a group of associated memories, or a whole line of associated memories becomes primed, this is known as [[spreading activation]].

In [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]], contiguity refers to how associated a [[reinforcement|reinforcer]] is with behaviour. The higher the contiguity between events the greater the strength of the behavioural relationship.

[[Edwin Ray Guthrie]]'s contiguity theory deals with patterned movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/contiguity-theory.html Instructional Design Theories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''culture of capitalism''' or '''capitalist culture''' is the set of social practices, social norms, values and patterns of behavior that are attributed to the capitalist economic system in a capitalist society. Capitalist culture promotes the [[accumulation of capital]] and the sale of commodities, where individuals are primarily defined by their relationship to business and the market. The culture is composed of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act in order to survive in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= The culture of capitalism is devoted to encouraging the production and sale of commodities. For capitalists, the culture encourages the accumulation of profit; for laborers, it encourages the accumulation of wages; for consumers, it encourages the accumulation of goods. In other words, capitalism defines sets of people who, behaving according to a set of learned rules, act as they must act }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of capitalist culture include the mindset of [[business]] and corporate culture, [[consumerism]] and working class culture.

==Capitalist culture and ideology==
While certain political ideologies, such as [[neoliberalism]], assume and promote the view that the behavior that capitalism fosters in individuals is natural to humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/20/human-nature-politics-left-right |title=Who's correct about human nature, the left or the right? |author=Ed Rooksby |date=2010 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=20 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/261927/two-cheers-capitalism-bruce-thornton |title=Two sheers for capitalism |author=Bruce Thornton |date=2016 |publisher=Frontpage Magazine |accessdate=24 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologists like [[Richard Robbins (anthropologist)|Richard Robbins]] point out that there is nothing natural about this behavior - people are not naturally dispossessed to accumulate wealth and driven by wage-labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robbins|first= Richard |title= Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism |publisher= Pearson|date=2005|isbn= 978-0205917655|page = 13 |quote= There is nothing natural about this behavior. People are not naturally driven to accumulate wealth. There are societies in which such accumulation is discouraged...People are not driven to work; in fact, contrary to popular notions, members of capitalist culture work far more than, say, people who live by gathering and hunting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political ideologies such as neoliberalism abstract the economic sphere from other aspects of society (politics, culture, family etc., with any political activity constituting an [[Economic interventionism|intervention]] into the natural process of the market, for example) and assume that people make rational exchanges in the sphere of market transactions. However, applying the concept of embeddedness to market societies, the sociologist Granovetter demonstrates that rational economic exchanges are actually heavily influenced by pre-existing social ties and other factors.&lt;ref name="granovetter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Granovetter, M.|title=Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=91|pages=487|year=1985|id=|doi=10.1086/228311|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a capitalist system, society and culture revolve around business activity (the accumulation of capital). As such, business activity and the market exchange are often viewed as being absolute or "natural" in that all other human social relations revolve around these processes (or should exist to facilitate one's ability to perform these processes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/market_mystification.php |title=Market Mystification in Capitalist and Market Socialist Societies |author=[[Bertell Ollman]] |date= |publisher=[[New York University]] |accessdate=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Richard|title=Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Human growth and development}}

'''Human development''' is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the [[ovary]] of a female is penetrated by [[sperm]]. The egg then lodges in the [[uterus]], where an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develop until [[birth]]. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], and through [[adulthood]] to [[senility]], and are referred to as the process of [[ageing]].

==Before birth==
{{Main|Prenatal development}}
Development before birth, or '''prenatal development''' ({{ety|la|natalis|relating to birth}}) is the process in which an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develops during [[gestation]]. Prenatal development starts with fertilization, the first stage in [[embryogenesis]] which continues in fetal development until [[birth]].

===Fertilization===
{{Main|Fertilization}}
[[Image:Sperm-egg.jpg|tbhhjgb|right|thumb|Sperm fertilizing an egg]] 
Fertilization occurs when the sperm successfully enters the ovum's membrane. The chromosomes of the sperm combine with those of the egg to form a single cell, called a zygote, and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=Prenatal Development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization, through the development of the early embryo, up until implantation. The germinal stage is over at about 10 days of gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[zygote]] contains a full complement of [[genetic material]] and develops into the embryo. Briefly, embryonic developments have four stages: the morula stage, the blastula stage, the gastrula stage, and the neurula stage. Prior to implantation, the [[embryo]] remains in a protein shell, the [[zona pellucida]], and undergoes a series of cell divisions, called mitosis. A week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size, but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother's [[uterus]]. This induces a [[decidual reaction]], wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue. The embryo, meanwhile, proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue, the latter forming the [[fetal membranes]] and the [[placenta]].  In humans, the embryo is referred to as a [[fetus]] in the later stages of prenatal development.  The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs. A nearly identical process occurs in other species.

===Embryonic development===
{{main|Human embryogenesis}}
[[Human embryogenesis]] refers to the development and formation of the human [[embryo]]. It is characterised by the process of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the [[embryo]] that occurs during the early stages of [[Human development (biology)|development]]. In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[sperm]] cell successfully enters and fuses with an [[egg cell]] ([[ovum]]). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of [[prenatal development]] commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Embryogenesis covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].
 
The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.

In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.

===Fetal development===
{{main|Fetus}}
A '''fetus''' is a stage in the human development considered to begin nine weeks after [[fertilization]].&lt;ref name="nursing"&gt;Klossner, N. Jayne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B47OVg25g-QC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=fetal+stage+begins&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dqQjWN-2jU&amp;sig=-KVkuIJggNo1T_gV6AHkcc58xyI&amp;hl=en Introductory Maternity Nursing] (2005): "The fetal stage is from the beginning of the 9th week after fertilization and continues until birth"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/fetaldevelopment1.htm|title=First Trimester - American Pregnancy Association|author=|date=1 May 2012|website=americanpregnancy.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423022520/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/duringpregnancy/fetaldevelopment1.htm|archivedate=23 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with many defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final location.

===Maternal influences===
{{See also|Placenta}}
The fetus and embryo develop within the [[uterus]], an organ that sits within the pelvis of the [[mother]]. The process the mother experiences whilst carrying the fetus or embryo is referred to as [[pregnancy]]. The [[placenta]] connects the developing [[fetus]] to the [[Uterus|uterine]] wall to allow nutrient uptake, thermo-regulation, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply; to fight against internal infection; and to produce hormones which support pregnancy. The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing fetuses and removes waste products from the fetus's blood. The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus, and the fetus's [[umbilical cord]] develops from the placenta. These organs connect the mother and the fetus.  Placentas are a defining characteristic of [[placental mammal]]s, but are also found in [[marsupials]] and some non-mammals with varying levels of development.&lt;ref name="Pou92"&gt;Pough ''et al.'' 1992. Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Homology (biology)|homology]] of such structures in various [[Viviparity|viviparous organisms]] is debatable, and in invertebrates such as [[Arthropod]]a, is [[Analogy (biology)|analogous]] at best.

==After birth==
===Infancy and childhood===
{{main|Infant|Child development|Child development stages}}
'''Childhood''' is the age span ranging from birth to [[adolescence]].&lt;ref name="Students Macmillan 1981 page 173"&gt;''Macmillan Dictionary for Students'' Macmillan, Pan Ltd. (1981), page 173. Retrieved 2010-7-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[developmental psychology]], childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of [[toddle]]rhood (learning to walk), [[early childhood]] (play age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty). Various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation.'''&lt;ref name="Students Macmillan 1981 page 173"/&gt;

[[File:Child development stages.svg|thumb|center|800px|Approximate outline of development periods in [[child development]].]]

The [[Tanner stages]] can be used to approximately judge a child's age based on physical development.

===Puberty===
{{main|Puberty}}
'''Puberty''' is the process of physical changes through which a [[child]]'s [[Human body|body]] matures into an [[adult]] body capable of [[sexual reproduction]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s: the [[ovary|ovaries]] in a girl, the [[testis|testes]] in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], [[breast]]s, and [[sex organ]]s. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed.

Notable among the [[morphology (biology)|morphologic]] changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, the "filling in" of the child's body; from girl to woman, from boy to man.

===Adulthood===
[[Biology|Biologically]], an '''adult''' is a [[human]] or other [[organism]] that has reached [[sexual maturity]]. In human context, the term ''adult'' additionally has meanings associated with [[social]] and [[Law|legal]] concepts. In contrast to a "[[Minor (law)|minor]]", a '''legal adult''' is a [[person]] who has attained the [[age of majority]] and is therefore regarded as independent, [[self-sufficient]], and [[:wikt:responsible|responsible]]. The typical age of attaining adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.

Human adulthood encompasses [[Adult development|psychological adult development]]. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]] and responsibility that may define an adult.

==Organ systems==

Development of human [[organ (biology)|organs]] and [[organ systems]] begins in the embryo and continues throughout the human lifespan.

[[File:Electron density wave - plasmon excitations.png|thumb|350px |Schematic representation of a surface wave propagating along a metal-dielectric interface. The fields away from the surface die off exponentially (right hand graph) and those fields are thus described as ''evanescent'' in the '''z''' direction]]
In electromagnetics, an '''evanescent field''', or  '''evanescent wave''', is an oscillating electric and/or magnetic field that  does not propagate as an [[electromagnetic wave]] but whose energy is spatially concentrated in the vicinity of the source (oscillating charges and currents). Even when there in fact is an electromagnetic wave produced (e.g., by a transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]) one can still identify as an evanescent field the component of the electric or magnetic field that cannot be attributed to the propagating wave observed at a distance of many wavelengths (such as the [[far field]] of a transmitting antenna).

A hallmark of an evanescent field is that there is no net energy flow in that region. Since the net flow of electromagnetic energy is given by the average [[Poynting vector]], that means that the Poynting vector in these regions, as averaged over a complete oscillation cycle, is zero.&lt;ref group=note&gt;or expressing the fields '''E''' and '''H''' as phasors, the complex Poynting vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H^*}&lt;/math&gt; has a zero real part&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage of the term ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
In many cases one cannot simply say that a field is or is not evanescent. For instance,  in the above illustration energy is indeed transmitted in the horizontal direction. The field strength drops off exponentially away from the surface, leaving it concentrated in a region very close to the interface, for which reason this is referred to as a [[surface wave]]. However, there is ''no'' propagation of energy ''away'' from (or toward) the surface (in the '''z''' direction), so that one could properly describe the field as being "evanescent in the z direction." This is one illustration of the inexactness of the term. In most cases where they exist, evanescent fields are simply thought of and referred to as electric or magnetic fields, without the evanescent property (zero average Poynting vector in one or all directions) ever being pointed out. The term is especially applied to differentiate a field or solution from cases where one normally expects a propagating wave.

Everyday electronic devices and electrical appliances are surrounded by large fields which have this property. Their operation involves alternating voltages (producing an electric field between them) and alternating currents (producing a magnetic field around them). The term "evanescent" is never heard in this ordinary context. Rather, there may be concern with inadvertent production of a propagating electromagnetic wave and thus discussion of reducing [[Alternating current#Techniques for reducing radiation loss|radiation losses]] (since the propagating wave steals power from the circuitry) or interference. On the other hand, "evanescent field" is used in various contexts where there ''is'' a propagating (even if confined) electromagnetic wave involved, to describe accompanying electromagnetic components which do not have that property. Or in some cases where there would ''normally'' be an electromagnetic wave (such as light [[refracted]] at the interface between glass and air) the term is invoked to describe the field when that wave is suppressed (such as with light in glass incident on an air interface beyond the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]]).

Although all electromagnetic fields are classically governed according to [[Maxwell's equations]], different technologies or problems have certain types of expected solutions, and when the primary solutions involve wave propagation the term "evanescent" is frequently applied to field components or solutions which do not share that property. For instance, the [[propagation constant]] of a hollow metal [[waveguide]] is a strong function of frequency (a so-called [[dispersion relation]]). Below a certain frequency (the [[Cutoff frequency|cut-off frequency]]) the propagation constant becomes an imaginary number. A solution to the [[wave equation]] having an imaginary wavenumber does ''not'' propagate as a wave but falls off exponentially, so the field excited at that lower frequency is considered evanescent. It can also be simply said that propagation is "disallowed" for that frequency. The formal solution to the wave equation can describe modes having an identical form, but the change of the propagation constant from real to imaginary as the frequency drops below the cut-off frequency totally changes the physical nature of the result. One can describe the solution then as a "cut-off mode" or an "evanescent mode";&lt;ref name=IEEEDict_1992&gt;{{cite book|title=IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms|date=1992|publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-55937-240-4|page=458|edition=IEEE STD 100-1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while a different author will just state that no such mode exists. Since the evanescent field corresponding to the mode was computed as a solution to the wave equation, it is often discussed as being an "evanescent wave" even though its properties (such as not carrying energy) are inconsistent with the definition of [[wave]].

Although this article concentrates on electromagnetics, the term ''evanescent'' is used similarly in fields such as [[acoustics]] and [[quantum mechanics]] where the [[wave equation]] arises from the physics involved. In these cases, solutions to the wave equation resulting in imaginary propagation constants are likewise termed "evanescent" and have the essential property that no net energy is transmitted even though there is a non-zero field.

== Evanescent wave applications ==
In [[optics]] and [[acoustics]], evanescent waves are formed when waves traveling in a medium undergo [[total internal reflection]] at its boundary because they strike it at an angle greater than the so-called ''[[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]]''.&lt;ref name=Tineke&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Bright Future for Subwavelength Light Sources|author=Tineke Thio|volume=94|issue=1|pages=40–47|year=2006|doi=10.1511/2006.1.40|journal=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marstin-acoustic&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marston | first =Philip L. | authorlink = |author2=Matula, T.J. | title =Scattering of acoustic evanescent waves | journal = [[Journal of the Acoustical Society of America]] | volume =111 | issue =5 | page =2378 | date =May 2002 | bibcode =2002ASAJ..111.2378M | doi=10.1121/1.4778056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The physical explanation for the existence of the evanescent wave is that the electric and magnetic fields (or [[pressure gradients]], in the case of acoustical waves) cannot be discontinuous at a boundary, as would be the case if there was no evanescent wave field. In [[quantum mechanics]], the physical explanation is exactly analogous—the [[wave function|Schrödinger wave-function]] representing particle motion normal to the boundary cannot be discontinuous at the boundary.

Electromagnetic evanescent waves have been used to exert optical [[radiation pressure]] on small particles to trap them for experimentation, or to [[refrigeration|cool]] them to very low temperatures, and to illuminate very small objects such as [[biological cell]]s or [[Single-molecule experiment|single protein and DNA molecules]] for [[microscopy]] (as in the [[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope]]). The evanescent wave from an [[optical fiber]] can be used in a gas sensor, and evanescent waves figure in the [[infrared spectroscopy]] technique known as [[attenuated total reflectance]].

In [[electrical engineering]], evanescent waves are found in the [[Electromagnetic radiation#Near and far fields|near-field region]] within one third of a wavelength of any radio antenna. During normal operation, an antenna emits electromagnetic fields into the surrounding nearfield region, and a portion of the field energy is reabsorbed, while the remainder is radiated as EM waves.

Recently, a graphene-based Bragg grating (one-dimensional [[photonic crystal]]) has been fabricated and demonstrated its competence for excitation of surface electromagnetic waves in the periodic structure using a [[Prism coupler|prism coupling technique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Excitation of surface electromagnetic waves in a graphene-based Bragg grating |journal=Scientific Reports |year=2012|doi=10.1038/srep00737 |volume=2|pages=737 |last1=Sreekanth|first1=Kandammathe Valiyaveedu|last2=Zeng|first2=Shuwen|last3=Shang|first3=Jingzhi|last4=Yong|first4=Ken-Tye|last5=Yu|first5=Ting |bibcode = 2012NatSR...2E.737S |pmid=23071901 |pmc=3471096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], the evanescent-wave solutions of the [[Schrödinger equation]] give rise to the phenomenon of [[quantum tunnelling|wave-mechanical tunneling]].

In [[microscopy]], systems that capture the information contained in evanescent waves can be used to create [[super-resolution microscopy|super-resolution images]]. Matter radiates both propagating and evanescent electromagnetic waves. Conventional optical systems capture only the information in the propagating waves and hence are subject to the [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction limit]]. Systems that capture the information contained in evanescent waves, such as the [[superlens]] and [[near field scanning optical microscopy]], can overcome the diffraction limit; however these systems are then limited by the system's ability to accurately capture the evanescent waves.&lt;ref&gt;Neice, A., "Methods and Limitations of Subwavelength Imaging", Advances in Imaging and Electron Physics, Vol. 163, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The limitation on their resolution is given by
: &lt;math&gt; k \propto \frac{1}{d} \ln{\frac{1}{\delta}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum [[wave vector]] that can be resolved, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the object and the sensor, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the [[Q factor|quality]] of the sensor.

More generally, practical applications of evanescent waves can be classified as (1) those in which the energy associated with the wave is used to excite some other phenomenon within the region of space where the original traveling wave becomes evanescent (for example, as in the [[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope]]) or (2) those in which the evanescent wave couples two media in which traveling waves are allowed, and hence permits the transfer of energy or a particle between the media (depending on the wave equation in use), even though no traveling-wave solutions are allowed in the region of space between the two media. An example of this is so-called ''[[quantum tunnelling|wave-mechanical tunnelling]]'', and is known generally as ''[[evanescent wave coupling]]''.

== Total internal reflection of light ==
[[File:Total internal reflection.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Total internal reflection]]]]
[[File:Evanescent wave.jpg|thumb|200px |Top to bottom: representation of a [[refraction|refracted incident wave]] and an evanescent wave at an interface.]]

For example, consider [[total internal reflection]] in two dimensions, with the interface between the media lying on the x axis, the [[surface normal|normal]] along y, and the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] along z. One might naively expect that for angles leading to total internal reflection, the solution would consist of an incident wave and a reflected wave, with no transmitted wave at all, but there is no such solution that obeys [[Maxwell's equations]]. Maxwell's equations in a dielectric medium impose a boundary condition of continuity for the components of the fields ''E&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''. For the polarization considered in this example, the conditions on ''E&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' are satisfied if the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident one, because these components of the incident and reflected waves superimpose destructively. Their ''H&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' components, however, superimpose constructively, so there can be no solution without a non-vanishing transmitted wave. The transmitted wave cannot, however, be a sinusoidal wave, since it would then transport energy away from the boundary, but since the incident and reflected waves have equal energy, this would violate [[conservation of energy]]. We therefore conclude that the transmitted wave must be a non-vanishing solution to Maxwell's equations that is not a traveling wave, and the only such solutions in a dielectric are those that decay exponentially: evanescent waves.

Mathematically, evanescent waves can be characterized by a [[wave vector]] where one or more of the vector's components has an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] value. Because the vector has imaginary components, it may have a magnitude that is less than its real components. If the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, then the wave vector of the transmitted wave has the form
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{k} \ = \ k_y \hat{\mathbf{y}} + k_x \hat{\mathbf{x}}
\ = \ i \alpha \hat{\mathbf{y}} + \beta \hat{\mathbf{x}}, &lt;/math&gt;
which represents an evanescent wave because the ''y'' component is imaginary. (Here α and β are real and ''i'' represents the [[imaginary unit]].)

For example, if the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, then the electric field of any of the waves (incident, reflected, or transmitted) can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathrm{Re} \left \{ E(\mathbf{r}) e^{ i \omega t } \right \} \mathbf{\hat{z}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] in the ''z'' direction.

Substituting the evanescent form of the wave vector '''k''' (as given above), we find for the transmitted wave:

:&lt;math&gt; E(\mathbf{r})  =  E_o e^{-i ( i \alpha y + \beta x ) }  =  E_o e^{\alpha y - i \beta x } &lt;/math&gt;

where α is the [[Propagation constant#Attenuation constant|attenuation constant]] and β is the [[phase constant]].

== Evanescent-wave coupling ==
[[File:FITR penetration depth.svg|thumb|Plot of 1/e-penetration depth of the evanescent wave against angle of incidence in units of wavelength for different refraction indices.]]
Especially in [[optics]], ''evanescent-wave coupling'' refers to the coupling between two waves due to physical overlap of what would otherwise be described as the evanescent fields corresponding to the propagating waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Size dependence of Au NP-enhanced surface plasmon resonance based on differential phase measurement |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.073|volume=176|pages=1128|last1=Zeng|first1=Shuwen|last2=Yu|first2=Xia|last3=Law|first3=Wing-Cheung|last4=Zhang|first4=Yating|last5=Hu|first5=Rui|last6=Dinh|first6=Xuan-Quyen|last7=Ho|first7=Ho-Pui|last8=Yong|first8=Ken-Tye |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268225952_Fig._S1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One classical example is [[frustrated total internal reflection]] in which the evanescent field very close (see graph) to the surface of a dense medium at which a wave normally undergoes [[total internal reflection]] overlaps another dense medium in the vicinity. This disrupts the totality of the reflection, diverting some power into the second medium.

Coupling between two [[optical waveguide]]s may be effected by placing the fiber cores close together so that the evanescent field generated by one element excites a wave in the other fiber. This is used to produce [[fiber optic splitter]]s and in [[fiber tapping]]. At radio (and even optical) frequencies, such a device is called a [[Power dividers and directional couplers#Directional couplers|directional coupler.]] The device is usually called a power divider in the case of microwave transmission and modulation.
Evanescent-wave coupling is synonymous with [[near and far field|near field]] interaction in electromagnetic field theory.  Depending on the nature of the source element, the evanescent field involved is either predominantly electric (capacitive) or magnetic (inductive), unlike (propagating) waves in the far field where these components are connected (identical phase, in the ratio of the [[impedance of free space]]).  The evanescent wave coupling takes place in the non-radiative field near each medium and as such is always associated with matter; i.e., with the induced currents and charges within a partially reflecting surface. Other commonplace examples are the coupling between the primary and secondary coils of a transformer, or between the two plates of a capacitor. In quantum mechanics the wave function interaction may be discussed in terms of particles and described as [[quantum tunneling]].

=== Applications ===
Evanescent wave coupling is commonly used in photonic and nanophotonic devices as waveguide sensors or couplers (see e.g., [[prism coupler]]).

Evanescent wave coupling is used to excite, for example, [[dielectric microsphere resonators]].

A typical application is [[resonant inductive coupling|resonant energy transfer]], useful, for instance, for charging electronic gadgets without wires. A particular implementation of this is [[WiTricity]]; the same idea is also used in some [[Tesla coil]]s.

Evanescent coupling, as near field interaction, is one of the concerns in [[electromagnetic compatibility]].

Coupling of optical fibers without loss for [[fiber tapping]].

Evanescent wave coupling plays a major role in the theoretical explanation of [[extraordinary optical transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.optcom.2008.07.077|title=Critical process of extraordinary optical transmission through periodic subwavelength hole array: Hole-assisted evanescent-field coupling|year=2008|last1=Fan|first1=Zhiyuan|last2=Zhan|first2=Li|last3=Hu|first3=Xiao|last4=Xia|first4=Yuxing|journal=Optics Communications|volume=281|issue=21|pages=5467|bibcode = 2008OptCo.281.5467F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evanescent wave coupling is used in powering devices wirelessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Karalis | first = Aristeidis |author2=J.D.

A [[total internal reflection fluorescence microscope]] uses the evanescent wave produced by [[total internal reflection]] to excite fluorophores close to a surface. This is useful when surface properties of biological samples need to be studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Axelrod|first=D.|title=Cell-substrate contacts illuminated by total internal reflection fluorescence|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=1 April 1981|volume=89|issue=1|pages=141–145|doi=10.1083/jcb.89.1.141|pmid=7014571|pmc=2111781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fine-Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector''' ('''FREND''') is a [[Neutron detection|neutron detector]] that is part of the instrument payload on board the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO), launched to [[Mars]] in March 2016.  This instrument is currently mapping [[hydrogen]] levels to a maximum depth of {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} beneath the Martian surface, thus revealing shallow water ice distribution.This instrument has an improved resolution of 7.5 times over the one Russia contributed to NASA's ''[[Mars Odyssey]]'' orbiter.

==Overview==

FREND can provide information while orbiting Mars on the presence of hydrogen, in the form of [[Water on Mars|water]] or [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]] in the top {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} of the Martian surface.&lt;ref name="ria2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20140804/191710468/Russia-to-Construct-Landing-Pad-for-Russian-European.html |title=Russia to Construct Landing Pad for Russian-European "ExoMars-2018" Space Mission |work=RIA Novosti |location=Russia |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='FREND home'&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/48523-trace-gas-orbiter-instruments/?fbodylongid=2217 ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Instruments: FREND - Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector].

Mapping ground ice could also be useful for future resource utilization ([[ISRU]]) and crewed missions.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

FREND also features a [[dosimeter]] to monitor the radiation environment along its orbit around Mars.&lt;ref name=Sanin/&gt;&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

==Objectives==

The main science objective of the instrument is to carry out high spatial resolution mapping of [[Neutron temperature|epithermal and fast]] neutron fluxes from the Martian surface.&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt; FREND will work in synergy and complement orbital and ground data as measured the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) instrument on the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]], the [[ADRON-RM]] instrument on the [[ExoMars (rover)|ExoMars rover]] and the ADRON-EM on the [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]].&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt;

The second goal of FREND is to use its [[dosimeter]] to measure the radiation dose at the TGO orbit from [[Particle physics|energetic particle]]s of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar flare]]s. The data will be used to estimate exposure levels of spacecraft and maintain radiation safety of  crewed interplanetary flights.&lt;ref name=Sanin/&gt;&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

[[Cosmic ray]]s are sufficiently energetic to break apart atoms in the top one or two metres of Mars' surface, releasing high-energy neutrons, which can be measured by FREND instrument.&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt; The distribution of neutron velocities measured reveals the hydrogen content, which are a good indicator of hydrogen abundance —water or [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]]— in the shallow subsurface of Mars.&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt;

FREND uses inherited technology developed by the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] and flown on the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) on ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''; the Mercury Gamma and Neutron Spectrometer (MGNS) on ''[[BepiColombo]]''; the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) on the ''[[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'', and [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) on [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]].&lt;ref name=Sanin/&gt;&lt;ref name='FREND home'/&gt;

This instrument's key components are four detectors containing [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He) for neutrons with energies from 0.4 keV to 500 keV, and a stilbene-based [[scintillator]] for high-energy neutrons up to 10 MeV.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt; Each of the four &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He detectors counts neutrons independently for increased reliability.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt; All five detectors are encased within a [[collimator]] that improves the resolution 7.5 times over the one Russia contributed to NASA's ''Mars Odyssey'' orbiter.&lt;ref name='IKI FREND'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6082">'''Genetic ecology''' is the study of the stability and expression of varying genetic material within abiotic mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Kellenberger, E. (15 May 1994) "Genetic ecology: a new interdisciplinary science, fundamental for evolution, biodiversity and biosafety evaluations" ''Experientia'' vol50:5 pp. 429–437&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, genetic data is not thought of outside of any organism save for criminal for criminal forensics. However, genetic material has the ability to be taken up by various organisms that exist within an abiotic medium through natural transformations that may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Lederberg, J. (1994) ''The Transformation of Genetics'' The Rockefeller University, New York, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this field of study focuses on interaction, exchange, and expression of genetic material that may not be shared by species had they not been in the same environment.

==History==

E.B. Ford was the first geneticist to begin work in this field of study. E.B. Ford worked mostly during the 1950s and is most noted for his work with ''Maniola jurtina'' and published a book entitled ''Ecological Genetics'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/1405100338/Lowe_Ecological%20Genetics_sample%20chapter.pdf?q=ecological ''Ecological Genetics''] (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter S.W. ''et. al'' (2017) "EB Ford revisited: assessing the long-term stability of wing-spot patterns and population genetic structure of the meadow brown butterfly on the Isles of Scilly" ''Heredity''&lt;/ref&gt; This type of evolutionary biological study was only possible after gel electrophoresis had been designed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Tiselius, A. (25 January 1937) "A New Apparatus for Electrophoretic Analysis of Colloidal Mixtures" ''Transactions of the Faraday Society''&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, a high throughput method for DNA analysis did not exist. This field of study began to become more popular following the 1980s with the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR 1985) and poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis  (p. 1967).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, A.L. ''et. al'' (7 September 1967) "Molecular weight estimation of polypeptide chains by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels" ''Biochem Biophys Res Commun''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9577.html "The History of PCR"] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; With this technology, segments of DNA could be sequenced, amplified, and proteins produced using bacterial transformations. The genetic material along with the proteins could be analyzed and more correct phylogenetic trees could be created. 

Since E.B. Ford's research, multiple other genetic ecologists have continued study within the field of genetic ecology such as PT Hanford&lt;ref&gt;Handford PT. (1973) "Patterns of variation in a number of genetic systems in Maniola jurtina" Isles of Scilly. ''Proc R Soc B Biol Sci'' 183: 285–300. |&lt;/ref&gt; Alina von Thaden,&lt;ref&gt;Thaden, A. ''et. al'' (11 August 2017) "Assessing SNP genotyping of noninvasively collected wildlife samples using microfluidic arrays" ''Scientific Reports''&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Frachon, L ''et. al'' (27 July 2017) "Intermediate degrees of synergistic pleiotropy drive adaptive evolution in ecological time" ''Nature, Ecology, and Evolution''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torda, G. ''et. al'' (26 July 2017) ''Rapid adaptive responses to climate change in corals'' Nature Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benvenuto, C. Cosica, I. Chopelet, J. Sala-Bozano, M. Mariani, S. (25 July 2017) ''Ecological and evolutionary consequences of alternative sex-change pathways in fish'' Scientific Reports&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cure, K. Thomas, L. Hobbs, JPA. Fairclough, D.V. Kennington, W.J. (25 July 2017) "Genomic signatures of local adaptation reveal source-sink dynamics in a high gene flow fish species" ''Scientific Reports''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Komurai, R. Fujisawa, T. Okuzaki, Y. Sota, T. (11 July 2017) "Genomic regions and genes related to inter-population differences in body size in the ground beetle Carabus japonicus" ''Scientific Reports''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene transfer==

Genetic information may transfer throughout an ecosystem in multiple ways. The first of which, on the smallest scale, being bacterial gene transfer (see [[bacterial transformations]]). Bacteria have the ability to exchange DNA. This DNA exchange, or [[horizontal gene transfer]], may provide various species of bacteria with the genetic information they need to survive in an environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amrls.cvm.msu.edu/microbiology/molecular-basis-for-antimicrobial-resistance/acquired-resistance/acquisition-of-antimicrobial-resistance-via-horizontal-gene-transfer "Horizontal Gene Transfer"]. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; This can help many bacterial species survive within an environment.

A similar event has the ability to happen between plants and bacteria. For example, Agrobacterium tumefaciens has the ability to introduce genes into plants to cause the development of Gall disease. This occurs through genetic transfer between the ''A. tumefaciens'' and between the plant in question.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/biosecurity/education/dualuse-agriculture/2.-agricultural-biotechnology/methods-of-gene-transfer-in-plants.html "Methods of Gene Transfer in Plants"] (2011) ''Agricultural Biosecurity''&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, a similar event occurs each time viral infections occur within living organisms. The [[viruses]], whether positive or negative sense viruses, require a living organism to replicate their genes and produce more viruses. Once a virus is inside a living organism, it utilizes polymerases, ribosomes, and other biomolecules to replicate its own genetic material and to produce more virus genetic material similar to the original virus.&lt;ref&gt;7. Weaver, R. (2012). ''Molecular biology'' (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, gene transfer may occur through many varying means. Thus, the study of this gene transfer throughout each ecosystem, whether it be through a bacterial ecosystem or through the ecosystem of an organism, genetic ecology is the study of this gene transfer and its causes.

==Features==

===Hypergraphia===
[[Hypergraphia]] is the tendency for extensive and compulsive writing or drawing, and has been observed in persons with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] who have experienced multiple seizures.&lt;ref name=Hypergraphia_repeated_seizures&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Tremont |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Smith |first2 = Megan M |last3 = Bauer |first3 = Lyndsey |last4 = Alosco |first4 = Michael L |last5 = Davis |first5 = Jennifer D |last6 = Blum |first6 = Andrew S |last7 = LaFrance |first7 = W Curt |title = Comparison of personality characteristics on the Bear-Fedio Inventory between patients with epilepsy and those with non-epileptic seizures. |journal = The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11020039 |pages=47–52 |issue = 1 |volume = 24 |year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with hypergraphia display extreme attention to detail in their writing. Some such patients keep diaries recording meticulous details about their everyday lives. In certain cases, these writings demonstrate extreme interest in religious topics. Also, these individuals tend to have poor penmanship. The novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] showed symptoms of Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia.&lt;ref name=DostoevskyEpilepsy&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Hughes |first = John R |title = The idiosyncratic aspects of the epilepsy of Fyodor Dostoevsky. |journal = [[Epilepsy &amp; Behavior]]|pages=531–8 |issue = 3 |volume = 7 |year = 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2005.07.021 |pmid=16194626}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=JK|last2=Robertson|first2=MM|last3=Trimble|first3=MR|title=The lateralising significance of hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy|journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]]|date=February 1982|volume=45|issue=2|pages=131–8|doi=10.1136/jnnp.45.2.131|pmid=7069424|pmc=1083040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes morphing writing with drawing &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurology and General Medicine|last=Michael|first=Michael Jeffrey Aminoff|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "typical personality" of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events.

===Circumstantiality===
Individuals that demonstrate circumstantiality (or ''viscosity'') tend to continue conversations for a long time and talk receptively.&lt;ref name=Circumstiantiality_TLE&gt;{{Cite book |last = Devinsky |first = Orrin |author2=Vorkas, Charles |author3=Barr, William |title = Psychiatric Issues in Epilepsy: A Practical Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment |publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |date = 2006 |isbn = 078178591X |chapter = Personality disorders in epilepsy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensified Mental Life===
Individuals may demonstrate an intensified mental life, including deepened cognitive and emotional responses. This tendency may pair with hypographia, leading to prolific creative output and a tendency toward intense, solitary pursuits.

'''Glasgow Science Centre''' is a visitor attraction located in the [[Clyde Waterfront Regeneration]] area on the south bank of the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] opened Glasgow Science Centre on 5 June 2001. It is one of Scotland's most popular paid-for visitor attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35690252 |title=Visitor numbers up at Scots attractions |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a purpose-built [[science centre]] composed of three principal buildings: Science Mall, [[Glasgow Tower]] and an [[IMAX]] [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The Scottish tourist board, [[VisitScotland]], awarded Glasgow Science Centre a five star rating in the visitor attraction category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Science Centre on Visitscotland.com | url=http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5,en,SCH1/objectId,SIG48295Svs,curr,GBP,season,at1,selectedEntry,home/home.html | accessdate=24 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004233/http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5%2Cen%2CSCH1/objectId%2CSIG48295Svs%2Ccurr%2CGBP%2Cseason%2Cat1%2CselectedEntry%2Chome/home.html | archivedate=27 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as its main location, Glasgow Science Centre also manages the visitor centre at [[Whitelee Wind Farm]], which opened to the public in 2009.

==Science Mall==
[[File:Glasgow Science Centre from the west.jpg|thumb|330px|Glasgow Science Centre from the west]]
The largest of the three main, titanium-clad buildings takes a crescent shape structure and houses a Science Mall. In architectural terms it represents the canted hull of a ship, a reference to the adjacent 'canting basin', where vessels were brought to have the marine growth removed from their hulls. Internally, there are three floors of over 250 science-learning exhibits. As is usual for science centres, the exhibits aim to encourage interaction, and can be used or played with as part of the informal learning experience the centre aims to deliver. The building was designed by BDP.

On Floor 1, amongst the many interactive exhibits that demonstrate scientific principles, visitors can access a Science Show Theatre and the Glasgow Science Centre Planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=MERO Construction website on the Glasgow Science Centre| url=http://www.merouk.co.uk/structures/2001gsc.htm| accessdate=26 April 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410114702/http://www.merouk.co.uk/structures/2001gsc.htm| archivedate=10 April 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Science Centre webpage on the Science Mall | url=http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/sciencemall_4.aspx | accessdate=26 April 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093046/http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/sciencemall_4.aspx | archivedate=9 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[planetarium]] contains a [[zeiss projector|Zeiss]] [[Planetarium#Traditional electromechanical.2Foptical projectors|optical-mechanical projector]] that projects images of the night sky onto a 15m diameter dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeiss Press release| url=http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/ee1fd0d05bbcc39bc1256b6f003c7d01 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210003926/http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/ee1fd0d05bbcc39bc1256b6f003c7d01 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=10 February 2013 |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeiss installation list| url=http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/cd498b133073712741256a76004e9e4b |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an area specifically aimed at young children, called The Big Explorer.

On Floor 2, visitors can explore opportunities in STEM careers in the My World of Work Live interactive exhibition space. There is also The Lab, primarily used as an educational workshop space.

Floor 3 was refurbished in 2012 and reopened to the public on 28 March 2013. It now houses an interactive exhibition about human health and wellbeing in the 21st century, called BodyWorks. Visitors are invited to consider their bodies, health and lifestyle from a new perspective through 115 interactive exhibits, research capsules and live laboratory experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=What is BodyWorks?| url=http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/bodyworks-newsroom/what-is-bodyworks.html| accessdate=8 April 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022532/http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/bodyworks-newsroom/what-is-bodyworks.html| archivedate=24 September 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ground Floor of the Science Mall contains the ticket desk, cafes, gift shop, and a cloakroom. There are a number of flexible room spaces on the Ground Floor that are used for a variety of educational and corporate purposes: an education space called The Egg; a lecture-theatre space called The Auditorium; and the Clyde Suite, a multi-purpose function space. Access to Glasgow Tower for the public is also via the Ground Floor.

==Glasgow Tower==

{{main|Glasgow Tower}}
The Glasgow Tower was designed to be the tallest freely-rotating tower in the world. It missed its opening date in 2001 and was plagued by problems since then. It has been closed for over 80% of its life,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and was closed from August 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22509056|title=BBC News - Faulty tower: Glasgow's £10m white elephant|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; until July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-28366052|title=BBC News - Glasgow Science Centre tower reopens|date=19 July 2014|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMAX Cinema==

The IMAX cinema was the first IMAX cinema to be built in Scotland. The single auditorium seats 370 in front of a rectangular screen measuring {{convert|80|ft|m}} by {{convert|60|ft|m}} and has the capability to show [[3-D film|3D films]] as well as standard 2D films in IMAX format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Big Movie Zone | url=http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=695 | accessdate=17 September 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604041706/http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=695 | archivedate=4 June 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened to the public in October 2000, and premiered the first film, entitled "Dolphins", several months prior to the opening of the two other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Millennium Commission News October 2000 | url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1184&amp;d=11&amp;h=24&amp;f=46&amp;dateformat=%25o-%25B-%25Y | accessdate=24 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010424/http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1184&amp;d=11&amp;h=24&amp;f=46&amp;dateformat=%25o-%25B-%25Y | archivedate=28 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 2013, [[Cineworld]] agreed a 10-year lease to operate the IMAX cinema and opened a [[Starbucks]] on site.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Glasgow garden festival overhead.jpg|thumb|270px|right|View of the [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] site]]
Opened to the public in June 2001, Glasgow Science Centre is part of the ongoing redevelopment of [[Pacific Quay]], an area which was once a cargo port known as Prince's Dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science on the Clyde |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1394637.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=19 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Architecture website on Pacific Quay | url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/pacific_quay.htm |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redevelopment started with the [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] in 1988. As with the other [[National Garden Festival]]s, the {{convert|100|acre|km2}} Glasgow site was intended to be sold off for housing development, but due to a housing slump in 1987, the developers were unable to develop the land as they intended, and the majority of the site remained derelict for years. Parts were finally redeveloped for the Science Centre and also [[Pacific Quay]], including new headquarters for [[BBC Scotland]] and [[Scottish Television]], opened in 2007. The Clydesdale Bank Tower was dismantled and re-erected in [[Rhyl]] in North [[Wales]], however its spiritual successor came in the form of the [[Glasgow Tower]] as part of Science Centre complex, which stands on approximately the same spot.

The architects of the Glasgow Science Centre were [[Building Design Partnership]], however the Glasgow Tower was originally designed by the architect Richard Horden with engineering design by [[Buro Happold]].&lt;ref name="hcla.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web | title=Horden Cherry Lee Architects | url=http://www.hcla.co.uk/projects/?prorub1=ap&amp;prorub2=5&amp;pid=67

==Funding issues==
In June 2004, it was announced that about a fifth of the workforce were to be made redundant following the creation of a funding deal with the [[Scottish Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Redundancies at science centre |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3851349.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2008 |date=29 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the leader of the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]], [[Nicol Stephen]], stated that Glasgow Science Centre was facing a 40% cut in government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science centre '40% funding cut' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7437912.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2008 |date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] commented on this issue during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] saying, "It's unfortunate in Glasgow that as a result of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], funding has been cut, and they will live to regret that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Evening Times News Report | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2376867.0.0.php|accessdate= 3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although funding for the Scottish Science Centres as a whole has actually increased, it is now being split between four centres using a formula based on visitor numbers, and Glasgow is the only centre to face a reduction in budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SNP News Release | url=http://www.snp.org/node/14009 | accessdate=3 July 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012181805/http://www.snp.org/node/14009 | archivedate=12 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the announcement in July 2008 that 28 full-time jobs were to be cut as a direct consequence of the cuts "in order to secure Glasgow Science Centre's future", according to the Chief Executive, Kirk Ramsay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Troubled science centre cuts jobs |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7487335.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 July 2008 |date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
Glasgow Science Centre is located in the [[Pacific Quay]] area, and as such, is surrounded by the media centres that form the Digital Media Quarter, a [[Scottish Enterprise]] development initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Digital Media Quarter webpage | url=http://www.pacificquaydmq.com/|accessdate= 10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the opening of the new [[STV (TV network)|STV]] headquarters in June 2006 and the beginning of broadcast programming from [[BBC Pacific Quay]] in the summer of 2004, it can be expected that more programming will be filmed in the area.

In the [[CBeebies]] television programme ''[[Nina and the Neurons]]'', the title character Nina is a [[neuroscientist]] who works at Glasgow Science Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CBeebies Nina and the Neurons webpage | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons.shtml | accessdate=28 April 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514133942/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons.shtml | archivedate=14 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Nina is played by the actress [[Katrina Bryan]] who is not a staff member at Glasgow Science Centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">In [[geotechnical engineering]], an '''interceptor ditch''' is a small ditch or channel constructed to intercept and [[Dewatering|drain water]] to an area where it can be safely discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itd.idaho.gov/enviro/Stormwater/BMP/PDF%20Files%20for%20BMP/Chapter%205/PC-16%20%20Interceptor%20Ditches.pdf |title=Best Management Practices Manual|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are used for excavation purposes of limited depth made in a coarse-grained soils. These are constructed around an area to be dewatered. [[Sump pit]]s are also placed at suitable intervals for installation of [[centrifugal pump]]s to remove the water collected in an efficient manner.&lt;ref&gt;soil mechanics and foundation engineering by Dr. K.R.ARORA on page no. 391. Retrieved on 13 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In fine [[sand]]s and [[silt]]s, there may be [[sloughing (soil)|sloughing]], [[erosion]] or [[quick condition]]s. For such type of [[soil]]s the method is confined to a depth of 1 to 2 m. Interceptor ditches are most economical for carrying away water which emerge on the slopes and near the bottom of the foundation pit.&lt;ref&gt;Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering by Dr. K.R.ARORA on page no. 392. Retrieved on 13 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Its size depends on the original ground slope, runoff area, type  of soil and vegetation, and other factors related to runoff volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://engineeringtraining.tpub.com/14070/css/14070_75.htm | title=Inteceptor ditches | accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction Guidelines==
* The interceptor ditch commonly consists of a ditch and may have an associated dike. 
* Secondly the sediment control measures may be required to filter or trap sediments before the runoff leaves the construction area.
* The construction of the interceptor ditch at the crown of a slope shall be accomplished prior to the [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] of the cut section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itd.idaho.gov/enviro/Stormwater/BMP/PDF%20Files%20for%20BMP/Chapter%205/PC-16%20%20Interceptor%20Ditches.pdf |title=Best Management Practices Manual|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance==
Inspection and maintenance is necessary after completion of construction of any structure. Here some steps followed in the maintenance of interceptor ditches are summarized below:
* Periodic inspection and maintenance will be required based on post-construction site conditions. 
* Make any repairs necessary to ensure that it is operating properly. 
* Locate any damaged areas and repair as necessary.
* Remove any channel obstructions (particularly waste materials) which would otherwise obstruct dewatering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itd.idaho.gov/enviro/Stormwater/BMP/PDF%20Files%20for%20BMP/Chapter%205/PC-16%20%20Interceptor%20Ditches.pdf |title=Best Management Practices Manual|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Large woody debris''' ('''LWD''') are the logs, sticks, branches, and other [[wood]] that falls into [[stream]]s and [[river]]s.  This debris can influence the [[streamflow|flow]] and the shape of the stream channel.  Large woody debris, grains, and the shape of the bed of the stream are the three main providers of flow resistance, and are thus, a major influence on the shape of the stream channel.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, Janet H. "Flow Resistance of Large Woody Debris in Headwater Streams of the Washington Cascades" Abstracts with Programs - Geological Society of America, vol.29, no.6, pp.315, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Some stream channels have less LWD than they would naturally because of removal by watershed managers for flood control and aesthetic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence, J.E., V.H. Resh, and M.R. Cover |title=Large-wood Loading from Natural and Engineered Processes at the Watershed Scale. River Research and Applications |journal=River Research and Applications |year=2014 |volume=29 | doi=10.1002/rra.2589 | pages=1030–1041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The study of woody debris is important for its [[Forest management|forestry management]] implications. Plantation thinning can reduce the potential for recruitment of LWD into proximal streams. The presence of large woody debris is important in the formation of pools which serve as [[salmon]] habitat in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223021002/http://www.elwhainfo.org/elwha-river-watershed/river-restoration/engineered-log-jams|url=http://www.elwhainfo.org/elwha-river-watershed/river-restoration/engineered-log-jams|title=Engineered Log Jams - Elwha Watershed Information Resource|archivedate=23 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrainment of the large woody debris in a stream can also cause [[erosion]] and scouring around and under the LWD.  The amount of scouring and erosion is determined by the ratio of the diameter of the piece, to the depth of the stream, and the embedding and orientation of the piece.

''Annual Review of Anthropology'', ''37'', 53-73&lt;/ref&gt; designed to study the diversity of life history strategies used by different organisms throughout the world, as well as the causes and results of the variation in their life cycles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Flatt, T., &amp; Heyland, A. (Eds.). (2011). Mechanisms of Life History Evolution : The Genetics and Physiology of Life History Traits and Trade-Offs. Oxford, GB: OUP Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theory of biological [[evolution]] that seeks to explain aspects of organisms' anatomy and behavior by reference to the way that their life histories—including their reproductive development and behaviors, life span and post-reproductive behavior—have been shaped by [[natural selection]]. A life history strategy is the "age- and stage-specific patterns"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and timing of events that make up an organism's life, such as birth, weaning, maturation, death, etc.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ahlström, T. (2011). Life‐history theory, past human populations and climatic perturbations. ''International Journal of Osteoarchaeology'', ''21''(4), 407-419.&lt;/ref&gt; These events, notably [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] development, age of [[sexual maturity]], first reproduction, number of offspring and level of [[parental investment]], [[senescence]] and death, depend on the physical and ecological environment of the organism.

The theory was developed in the 1950s&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Stearns, S. (1992). ''The Evolution of Life Histories''. Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to answer questions about topics such as organism size, age of maturation, number of offspring, life span, and many others.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Hochberg, Z. (2011). Evo-Devo of Child Growth : Treatise on Child Growth and Human Evolution (1). Hoboken, US: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to study these topics, life history strategies must be identified, and then models are constructed to study their effects. Finally, predictions about the importance and role of the strategies are made,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Stearns, S. (1976). Life-History Tactics: A Review of the Ideas. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology,'' ''51''(1), 3-47. {{jstor|2825234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientists use these predictions to understand how evolution affects the ordering and length of life history events in an organism's life, particularly the lifespan and period of reproduction.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hill, K., &amp; Kaplan, H. (1999). Life history traits in humans: Theory and empirical studies.

(Ed.). (2012). Wiley Blackwell Companions to Anthropology Ser. : A Companion to Gender Prehistory (1). Somerset, US: Wiley-Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt; It also uses measures of [[evolutionary fitness]] to determine if organisms are able to maximize or optimize this fitness,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Preston, S. D., Kringelbach, M. L., &amp; Knutson, B. (2014). The Interdisciplinary Science of Consumption. Cambridge, US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by allocating resources to a range of different demands throughout the organism's life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It serves as a method to investigate further the "many layers of complexity of organisms and their worlds".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Morbeck, M., Galloway, A., &amp; Zihlman, A. ''The Evolving Female : A Life-history Perspective''. (1997). Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms have evolved a great variety of life histories, from [[Pacific salmon]], which produce thousands of eggs at one time and then die, to human beings, who produce a few offspring over the course of decades.  The theory depends on principles of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[ecology]] and is widely used in other areas of science.

== Brief history of field ==
Life history theory is seen as a branch of [[evolutionary ecology]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and is used in a variety of different fields. Beginning in the 1950s, [[mathematical analysis]] became an important aspect of research regarding LHT.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Roff, D. (2002). ''Life History Evolution''. Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main focuses that have developed over time: genetic and [[phenotypic]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but there has been a recent movement towards combining these two approaches.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Life cycle ==
All organisms follow a specific sequence in their development,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; beginning with [[gestation]] and ending with death, which is known as the life cycle. Events in between usually include [[birth]], [[childhood]], [[developmental biology|maturation]], [[reproduction]], and [[senescence]], and together these comprise the life history strategy of that organism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The major events in this [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] are usually shaped by the demographic qualities of the organism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Some are more obvious shifts than others, and may be marked by physical changes—for example, [[tooth eruption|teeth erupting]] in young children.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Some events may have little variation between individuals in a species, such as length of gestation, but other events may show a lot of variation between individuals,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; such as age at first reproduction.

Life cycles can be divided into two major stages: growth and reproduction. These two cannot take place at the same time, so once reproduction has begun, growth usually ends.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This shift is important because it can also affect other aspects of an organism's life, such as the organization of its group or its [[social interaction]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Each species has its own pattern and timing for these events, often known as its [[ontogeny]], and the variety produced by this is what LHT studies.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Hawkes K., ed''. The Evolution of Human Life History''. (2006). Santa Fe : Oxford: School of American Research ; James Currey. Gen ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution then works upon these stages to ensure that an organism adapts to its environment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, a human, between being born and reaching [[adulthood]], will pass through an assortment of life stages, which include: birth, infancy, [[weaning]], childhood and growth, [[adolescence]], [[sexual maturation]], and reproduction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; All of these are defined in a specific biological way, which is not necessarily the same as the way that they are commonly used.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Darwinian fitness ==
In the context of evolution, fitness is determined by the number of descendents an organism produces over the course of its life. The main elements are survivorship and reproductive rate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This means that the organism's traits and gene are carried on into future generations, and contribute to  evolutionary "success". The process of adaptation contributes to this "success" by impacting rates of survival and reproduction,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which in turn establishes an organism's level of Darwinian fitness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In life history theory, evolution works on the life stages of organisms and creates adaptation—this process establishes fitness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Life history traits ==
There are seven traits that are traditionally recognized as important in life history theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The trait that is seen as the most important for any given organism is the one where a change in that trait creates the most significant difference in that organism's level of fitness. In this sense, an organism's fitness is determined by its changing life history traits.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The way in which evolutionary forces act on these life history traits serves to limit the genetic variability and heritability of the life history strategies,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; although there are still large varieties that exist in the world.

=== List of traits ===
# size at birth
# growth pattern
# age and size at maturity
# number, size, and sex ratio of offspring
# age- and size-specific reproductive investments
# age- and size-specific mortality schedules
# length of life

== Life history strategies ==
Combinations of these life history traits and life events create the life history strategies. As an example, Winemiller and Rose, as cited by Lartillot &amp; Delsuc, propose three types of life history strategies in the fish they study: opportunistic, periodic, and equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Lartillot, N., &amp; Delsuc, F. (2012). JOINT RECONSTRUCTION OF DIVERGENCE TIMES AND LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION IN PLACENTAL MAMMALS USING A PHYLOGENETIC COVARIANCE MODEL. ''Evolution,'' ''66''(6), 1773-1787.{{jstor|41503481}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of strategies are defined by the body size of the fish, age at maturation, high or low survivorship, and the type of environment they are found in. So, a fish with a small body size, a late age of maturation, and low survivorship, found in a seasonal environment, would be classified as having a periodic life strategy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The type of behaviors taking place during life events can also define life history strategies. For example, an exploitative life history strategy would be one where an organism benefits by using more resources than others, or by taking these resources from other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, J., &amp; McCrea, S. (2016). Life history theory and exploitative strategies. ''Evolutionary Psychology'', ''14''(3),&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life history characteristics ==
Life history characteristics are traits that affect the [[life table]] of an organism, and can be imagined as various investments in growth, reproduction, and survivorship.

The goal of life history theory is to understand the variation in such life history strategies. This knowledge can be used to construct models to predict what kinds of traits will be favoured in different environments. Without constraints, the highest fitness would belong to a [[Darwinian Demon]], a hypothetical organism for whom such trade-offs do not exist. The key to life history theory is that there are limited resources available, and focusing on only a few life history characteristics is necessary.

Examples of some major life history characteristics include:
* Age at first reproductive event
* Reproductive lifespan and ageing
* Number and size of offspring

Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another.

For example, birds with larger broods are unable to afford more prominent [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafsson, L., Qvarnström, A., and Sheldon, B.C.  1995.  Trade-offs between life-history traits and a secondary sexual character in male collared flycatchers. Nature 375, 311—313&lt;/ref&gt; Life history characteristics will, in some cases, change according to the population density, since genotypes with the highest fitness at high population densities will not have the highest fitness at low population densities.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, L.D., Guo, P., and Ayala, F.J. 1991. Density dependent natural selection and trade-offs in life history traits. Science, 253: 433-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditions, such as the stability of the environment, will lead to selection for certain life history traits. Experiments by [[Michael R. Rose]] and [[Brian Charlesworth]] showed that unstable environments select for flies with both shorter lifespans and higher fecundity—in unreliable conditions, it is better for an organism to breed early and abundantly than waste resources promoting its own survival.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, M. and Charlesworth, B. A Test of Evolutionary Theories of Senescence. 1980. Nature 287, 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological [[tradeoffs]] also appear to characterize the life histories of [[viruses]], including [[bacteriophages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4161/bact.28365| pmid = 24616839| title = Tradeoffs in bacteriophage life histories| journal = Bacteriophage| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = e28365| year = 2014| last1 = Keen | first1 = E. C. | pmc = 3942329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproductive value and costs of reproduction ===

[[Reproductive value (population genetics)|Reproductive value]] models the tradeoffs between reproduction, growth, and survivorship. An organism's reproductive value (RV) is defined as its expected contribution to the population through both current and future reproduction:&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R. A. 1930. The genetical theory of natural selection. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

:RV = Current Reproduction + Residual Reproductive Value (RRV)

The residual reproductive value represents an organism's future reproduction through its investment in growth and survivorship. The cost-of-reproduction hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasienska|first=Grazyna|date=2009-07-01|title=Reproduction and lifespan: Trade-offs, overall energy budgets, intergenerational costs, and costs neglected by research|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=524–532|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20931|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicts that higher investment in current reproduction hinders growth and survivorship and reduces future reproduction, while investments in growth will pay off with higher fecundity (number of offspring produced) and reproductive episodes in the future. This cost-of-reproduction tradeoff influences major life history characteristics. For example, a 2009 study by J. Creighton, N. Heflin, and M. Belk on burying beetles provided "unconfounded support" for the costs of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtis Creighton, Nicholas D. Heflin, and Mark C. Belk. 2009. Cost of Reproduction, Resource Quality, and Terminal Investment in a Burying Beetle. The American Naturalist, 174:673–684.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that beetles that had allocated too many resources to current reproduction also had the shortest lifespans. In their lifetimes, they also had the fewest reproductive events and offspring, reflecting how over-investment in current reproduction lowers residual reproductive value.

The related terminal investment hypothesis describes a shift to current reproduction with higher age. At early ages, RRV is typically high, and organisms should invest in growth to increase reproduction at a later age. As organisms age, this investment in growth gradually increases current reproduction. However, when an organism grows old and begins losing physiological function, mortality increases while fecundity decreases. This [[senescence]] shifts the reproduction tradeoff towards current reproduction: the effects of aging and higher risk of death make current reproduction more favorable. The burying beetle study also supported the terminal investment hypothesis: the authors found beetles that bred later in life also had increased brood sizes, reflecting greater investment in those reproductive events.&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtis Creighton, Nicholas D. Heflin, and Mark C. Belk.  2009.  Cost of Reproduction, Resource Quality, and Terminal Investment in a Burying Beetle. The American Naturalist, 174:673–684.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''r''/''K'' selection theory ===
{{Further|r/K selection theory}}

The selection pressures that determine the reproductive strategy, and therefore much of the life history, of an organism can be understood in terms of [[r/K selection theory]].  The central trade-off to life history theory is the number of offspring vs. the timing of reproduction.  Organisms that are r-selected have a high growth rate (''r'') and tend to produce a high number of offspring with minimal parental care; their lifespans also tend to be shorter.  ''r''-selected organisms are suited to life in an unstable environment, because they reproduce early and abundantly and allow for a low survival rate of offspring.  ''K''-selected organisms subsist near the carrying capacity of their environment (''K''), produce a relatively low number of offspring over a longer span of time, and have high [[parental investment]].  They are more suited to life in a stable environment in which they can rely on a long lifespan and a low mortality rate that will allow them to reproduce multiple times with a high offspring survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen C. Stearns|Stearns, S.C.]]  1977.  The Evolution of Life History Traits: A Critique of the Theory and a Review of the Data.  Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 8: 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisms that are very ''r''-selected are [[semelparous]], only reproducing once before they die.  Semelparous organisms may be short-lived, like annual crops.  However, some semelparous organisms are relatively long-lived, such as the African flowering plant ''[[Lobelia telekii]]'' which spends up to several decades growing an [[inflorescence]] that blooms only once before the plant dies,&lt;ref&gt;Young, Truman P.  1984.  The Comparative Demography of Semelparous Lobelia Telekii and Iteroparous Lobelia Keniensis
on Mount Kenya.  Journal of Ecology, 72: 637–650&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[periodical cicada]] which spends 17 years as a larva before emerging as an adult.  Organisms with longer lifespans are usually [[iteroparous]], reproducing more than once in a lifetime.  However, iteroparous organisms can be more ''r''-selected than ''K''-selected, such as a [[sparrow]], which gives birth to several chicks per year but lives only a few years, as compared to a [[wandering albatross]], which first reproduces at ten years old and breeds every other year during its 40-year lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, Robert E.  1977.  On the Evolution of Reproductive Strategies in Birds: Reproductive Effort.  The American Naturalist, 111: 453–478.&lt;/ref&gt;

''r''-selected organisms usually:

* mature rapidly and have an early age of first reproduction
* have a relatively short lifespan
* have a large number of offspring at a time, and few reproductive events, or are semelparous
* have a high mortality rate and a low offspring survival rate
* have minimal parental care/investment

''K''-selected organisms usually:

* mature more slowly and have a later age of first reproduction
* have a longer lifespan
* have few offspring at a time and more reproductive events spread out over a longer span of time
* have a low mortality rate and a high offspring survival rate
* have high parental investment

=== Variation ===
Variation is a major part of what LHT studies, because every organism has its own life history strategy. Differences between strategies can be minimal or great.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, one organism may have a single offspring while another may have hundreds. Some species may live for only a few hours, and some may live for decades. Some may reproduce dozens of times throughout their lifespan, and others may only reproduce one or twice.

=== Trade-offs ===
An essential component of studying life history strategies is identifying the trade-offs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/trade-offs_and_constraints/story.htm|title=105_2013_12_05_Trade-offs_1|author=|date=|website=idea.ucr.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; that take place for any given organism. Energy use in life history strategies is regulated by thermodynamics and the conservation of energy,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the "inherent scarcity of resources",&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; so not all traits or tasks can be invested in at the same time. Thus, organisms must choose between tasks, such as growth, reproduction, and survival,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; prioritizing some and not others. For example, there is a trade-off between maximizing body size and maximizing lifespan, and between maximizing offspring size and maximizing offspring number.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is also sometimes seen as a choice between quantity and quality of offspring.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These choices are the trade-offs that life history theory studies.

One significant trade off is between [[somatic effort]] (towards growth and maintenance of the body) and reproductive effort (towards producing offspring).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since an organism can't put energy towards doing these simultaneously, many organisms have a period where energy is put just toward growth, followed by a period where energy is focused on reproduction, creating a separation of the two in the life cycle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, the end of the period of growth marks the beginning of the period of reproduction. Another fundamental trade-off associated with reproduction is between [[mating effort]] and [[parental effort|parenting effort]]. If an organism is focused on raising its offspring, it cannot devote that energy to pursuing a mate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

An important trade-off in the dedication of resources to breeding has to do with predation risk: organisms that have to deal with an increased risk of predation often invest less in breeding. This is because it is not worth as much to invest a lot in breeding when the benefit of such investment is uncertain.&lt;ref name="DillonConway2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dillon|first1=Kristen G|last2=Conway|first2=Courtney J|last3=Skelhorn|first3=John|title=Nest predation risk explains variation in avian clutch size|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=29|issue=2|year=2018|pages=301–311|issn=1045-2249|doi=10.1093/beheco/arx130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These trade-offs, once identified, can then be put into models that estimate their effects on different life history strategies and answer questions about the selection pressures that exist on different life events.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Over time, there has been a shift in how these models are constructed. Instead of focusing on one trait and looking at how it changed, scientists are looking at these trade-offs as part of a larger system, with complex inputs and outcomes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Constraints ===
The idea of constraints is closely linked to the idea of trade-offs discussed above. Because organisms have a finite amount of energy, the process of trade-offs acts as a natural limit on the organism's adaptations and potential for fitness. This occurs in populations as well.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These limits can be physical, developmental, or historical, and they are imposed by the existing traits of the organism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Optimizing fitness ===
Optimizing fitness is the idea that an organism can adapt in order to achieve an "optimal" life history strategy that allows it the highest level of fitness possible. There are several methods from which to approach the study of optimality, including energetic and demographic.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Achieving optimal fitness also encompasses multiple generations, because the optimal use of energy includes both the parents and the offspring.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For example, "optimal investment in offspring is where the decrease in total number of offspring is equaled by the increase of the number who survive".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Optimality is important for the study of life history theory because it serves as the basis for many of the models used, which work from the assumption that [[natural selection]], as it works on a life history traits, is moving towards the most optimal group of traits and use of energy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This base assumption, that over the course of its life span an organism is aiming for optimal energy use,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; then allows scientists to test other predictions. However, actually gaining this optimal life history strategy cannot be guaranteed for any organism.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Allocation of resources ===
An organism's allocation of resources ties into several other important concepts, such as trade-offs and optimality. The best possible allocation of resources is what allows an organism to achieve an optimal life history strategy and obtain the maximum level of fitness,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and making the best possible choices about how to allocate energy to various trade-offs contributes to this. Models of resource allocation have been developed and used to study problems such as parental involvement, the length of the learning period for children, and other developmental issues.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The allocation of resources also plays a role in variation, because the different resource allocations by different species create the variety of life history strategies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Capital and income breeding===
{{Further|Capital and income breeding}}
The division of capital and income breeding focuses on how organisms use resources to finance breeding,&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houston|first1=Alasdair I.|last2=Stephens|first2=Philip A.|last3=Boyd|first3=Ian L.|last4=Harding|first4=Karin C.|last5=McNamara|first5=John M.|title=Capital or income breeding? A theoretical model of female reproductive strategies|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=18|issue=1|year=2007|pages=241–250|issn=1465-7279|doi=10.1093/beheco/arl080}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how they time it.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drent|first1=R. H.|last2=Daan|first2=S.|title=The prudent parent: energetic adjustments in avian breeding|journal=Ardea|volume=38-90|year=1980|pages=225–252|issn=0373-2266|doi=10.5253/arde.v68.p225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In capital breeders, resources collected before breeding are used to pay for it,&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"/&gt; and they breed once they reach a body-condition threshold, which decreases as the season progresses.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"/&gt; Income breeders, on the other hand, breed using resources that are generated concurrently with breeding,&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"/&gt; and time that using the rate of change in body-condition relative to multiple fixed thresholds.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"/&gt; This distinction, though, is not necessarily a dichotomy; instead, it is a spectrum, with pure capital breeding lying on one end, and pure income breeding on the other.&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"/&gt;

Capital breeding is more often seen in organisms that deal with strong seasonality. This is because when offspring value is low, yet food is abundant, building stores to breed from allows these organisms to achieve higher rates of reproduction than they otherwise would have.&lt;ref name="EjsmondVarpe2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ejsmond|first1=Maciej Jan|last2=Varpe|first2=Øystein|last3=Czarnoleski|first3=Marcin|last4=Kozłowski|first4=Jan|title=Seasonality in offspring value and trade-offs with growth explain capital breeding|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=186|issue=5|year=2015|pages=E111–E125|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/683119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less seasonal environments, income breeding is likely to be favoured because waiting to breed would not have fitness benefits.&lt;ref name="SainmontAndersen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sainmont|first1=Julie|last2=Andersen|first2=Ken H.|last3=Varpe|first3=Øystein|last4=Visser|first4=André W.|title=Capital versus income breeding in a seasonal environment|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=184|issue=4|year=2014|pages=466–476|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/677926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phenotypic plasticity ===
Phenotypic plasticity focuses on the concept that the same genotype can produce different phenotypes in response to different environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It affects the levels of genetic variability because by serving as a source of variation and integration of fitness traits.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Determinants of life history==
Many factors can determine the evolution of an organism's life history, especially the unpredictability of the environment.  A very unpredictable environment—one in which resources, hazards, and competitors may fluctuate rapidly—selects for organisms that produce more offspring earlier in their lives, because it is never certain whether they will survive to reproduce again.  Mortality rate may be the best indicator of a species' life history:  organisms with high mortality rates—the usual result of an unpredictable environment—typically mature earlier than those species with low mortality rates, and give birth to more offspring at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Promislow, D.E.L. and P.H. Harvey. 1990.  Living fast and dying young: A comparative analysis of life-history variation among mammals.  Journal of Zoology, 220:417-437.&lt;/ref&gt;  A highly unpredictable environment can also lead to plasticity, in which individual organisms can shift along the spectrum of r-selected vs. K-selected life histories to suit the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, D. G., L. R. Linton and Ronald W. Davies.  1986.  Life-History Evolution and Post-Reproductive Mortality Risk.  ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 55: 295-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human life history ==
In studying humans, life history theory is used in many ways, including in [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and other fields.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mittal, C., Griskevicius, V., Simpson, J., &amp; Kawakami, K. (2014). Sense of control under uncertainty depends on people's childhood environment: A life history theory approach. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''107''(4), 621-637.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, D., &amp; Rhode, P. (2013). The human polygyny index and its ecological correlates: Testing sexual selection and life history theory at the cross‐national level. ''Social Science Quarterly'', ''94''(4), 1159-1184.&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, life history strategies include all the usual factors—trade-offs, constraints, reproductive effort, etc—but also includes a culture factor that allows them to solve problems through cultural means in addition to through adaptation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Humans also have unique traits that make them stand out from other organisms, such as a large brain, later maturity and age of first reproduction,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; a long lifespan,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Kaplan, H., Hill, K., Lancaster, J. and Hurtado, A. M. (2000), A theory of human life history evolution: Diet, intelligence, and longevity. Evol. Anthropol., 9: 156–185. {{doi|10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4&lt;156::AID-EVAN5&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a high level of reproduction, often supported by fathers and older (post-menopausal) relatives.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barton, R., Capellini, I., &amp; Stevens, C. (2011). Maternal investment life histories, and the costs of brain growth in mammals. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,'' ''108''(15), 6169-6174. {{jstor|41126625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Isler, K., &amp; van Schaik, C. (2012). Allomaternal care, life history and brain size evolution in mammals. ''Journal of Human Evolution'', ''63''(1), 52-63.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of possible explanations for these unique traits. For example, a long juvenile period may have been adapted to support a period of learning the skills needed for successful hunting and foraging.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This period of learning may also explain the longer lifespan, as a longer amount of time over which to use those skills makes the period needed to acquire them worth it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Cooperative breeding]] and the grandmothering hypothesis have been proposed as the reasons that humans continue to live for many years after they are no longer capable of reproducing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The large brain allows for a greater learning capacity, and the ability to engage in new behaviors and create new things.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The change in brain size may have been the result of a dietary shift—towards higher quality and difficult to obtain food sources&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;—or may have been driven by the social requirements of group living, which promoted sharing and provisioning.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Recent authors, such as Kaplan, argue that both aspects are probably important.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Perspectives==
Life history theory has provided new perspectives in understanding many aspects of human reproductive behavior, such as the relationship between [[Income and fertility|poverty and fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinding|first=Steven|title=Population, Poverty, and Economic Development|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1532/3023.full|work=Philosophical Transactions of Biological Sciences|publisher=Royal Society for Biological Sciences|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of statistical predictions have been confirmed by social data {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and there is a large body of scientific literature from studies in experimental [[animal model]]s, and [[Naturalistic observation|naturalistic studies]] among many organisms.

==Criticism==
The claim that long periods of helplessness in young would select for more parenting effort in protecting the young at the same time as high levels of predation would select for less parenting effort is criticized for assuming that absolute chronology would determine direction of selection. This criticism argues that the total amount of predation threat faced by the young has the same effective protection need effect no matter if it comes in the form of a long childhood and far between the natural enemies or a short childhood and closely spaced natural enemies, as different life speeds are subjectively the same thing for the animals and only outwardly looks different. One cited example is that small animals that have more natural enemies would face approximately the same amount of threats and need approximately the same amount of protection at the relative timescale of the animals as large animals with fewer natural enemies that grow more slowly (e.g. that many small carnivores that could not eat even a very young human child could easily eat multiple very young blind [[meerkat]]s). This criticism also argues that when a carnivore eats a batch stored together, there is no significant difference in the chance of one surviving depending on the number of young stored together, concluding that humans do not stand out from many small animals such as [[mice]] in selection for protecting helpless young.&lt;ref&gt;2014"The psychometric assessment of human life history strategy: A meta-analytic construct validation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2015"Race, monogamy, and other lies they told you: Busting myths about human nature"&lt;/ref&gt;

There is criticism of the claim that [[menopause]] and somewhat earlier age-related declines in female fertility could coevolve with a long term dependency on monogamous male providers who preferred fertile females. This criticism argues that the longer the time the child needed parental investment relative to the lifespans of the species, the higher the percentage of children born would still need parental care when the female was no longer fertile or dramatically reduced in her fertility. These critics argue that unless male preference for fertile females and ability to switch to a new female was annulled, any need for a male provider would have selected against menopause to use her fertility to keep the provider male attracted to her, and that the theory of monogamous fathers providing for their families therefore cannot explain why menopause evolved in humans.&lt;ref&gt;2017"Reproductive Ecology and Human Evolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2015"Evolutionary contributions to the study of human fertility"&lt;/ref&gt;

One criticism of the notion of a trade-off between mating effort and parenting effort is that in a species in which it is common to spend much effort on something other than mating, including but not exclusive to parenting, there is less energy and time available for such for the competitors as well, meaning that species-wide reductions in the effort spent at mating does not reduce the ability of an individual to attract other mates. These critics also criticize the dichotomy between parenting effort and mating effort for missing the existence of other efforts that take time from mating, such as survival effort which would have the same species-wide effects.&lt;ref&gt;2016"Monogamy and nonmonogamy: Evolutionary considerations and treatment challenges"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2008"Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition"&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also criticisms of size and organ trade-offs, including criticism of the claim of a trade-off between body size and longevity that cites the observation of longer lifespans in larger species, as well as criticism of the claim that big brains promoted sociality citing primate studies in which monkeys with large portions of their brains surgically removed remained socially functioning though their technical problem solving deteriorated in flexibility, computer simulations of chimpanzee social interaction showing that it requires no complex cognition, and cases of socially functioning humans with microcephalic brain sizes.&lt;ref&gt;2016"50 Great Myths of Human Evolution: Understanding Misconceptions about Our Origins"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2013"The evolution of human growth"&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of language as a 'system' appears in the linguistic theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[J.R. Firth]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Michael Halliday]].

The paradigmatic principle - the idea that the process of using language involves choosing from a specifiable set of options - was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. “valeur”), and of signs as terms in a system, “showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='System' in systemic functional linguistics==
“System” is used in two related ways in [[systemic functional linguistics]] (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. “the system of language”). This usage derives from [[Louis Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]] &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, [[Jay Lemke]] describes language as an open, dynamic system.

There is also the notion of “system” as used by [[John Rupert Firth|J.R. Firth]], where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959. London: Longman. p183.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that, unlike system in the sense in which it was used by Firth was a conception only found in Firth’s linguistic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Systemic Background. In "Systemic Perspectives on Discourse, Vol. 1: Selected Theoretical Papers" from the ''Ninth International Systemic Workshop'', James D. Benson and William S. Greaves (eds). Ablex. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this use of the term “system”, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, “the most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1992. Systemic Grammar and the Concept of a “Science of Language”. In Waiguoyu (Journal of Foreign Languages), No. 2 (General Series No. 78), pp1-9. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halliday’s early work, “system” was considered to be one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar, the others being unit, structure and class. The category of ‘system’ was invoked to account for “the occurency of one rather than another from among a number of like events” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 52&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Halliday defined grammar as “that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‘what does it construe?’ ‘what effect does it have in a context of use?’), below (‘how is this function realized?’) and round about (‘what else is in the neighbourhood?’ ‘what other things does this thing have to interact with?’). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of [[complex systems]].

Image courtesy of the [http://americanhistory.si.edu/ National Museum of American History] from [http://americanhistory.si.edu/powering/ Powering a Generation of Change]&lt;hr /&gt;]]
[[File:Duck_Curve_CA-ISO_2016-10-22.agr.png|thumb|300px|Graphs by hour of California's total electric load, the total load less solar and wind power (known as the [[duck curve]]) and solar power output. Data is for October 22, 2016, a day when the wind power output was low and steady throughout the day.]]
In [[electrical engineering]], a '''load profile''' is a graph of the variation in the [[electrical load]] versus time.  A load profile will vary according to customer type (typical examples include residential, commercial and industrial), temperature and holiday seasons.  Power producers use this information to plan how much electricity they will need to make available at any given time.  [[Teletraffic engineering]] uses a similar load curve.

== Power generation ==

In a power system, a load curve or load profile is a chart illustrating the variation in demand/electrical load over a specific time. Generation companies use this information to plan how much power they will need to generate at any given time. A [[Load Duration Curve|load duration curve]] is similar to a load curve. The information is the same but is presented in a different form. These curves are useful in the selection of [[Electrical generator|generator]] units for supplying electricity.

==Electricity distribution==
In an [[electricity distribution]] [[Grid (electricity)|grid]], the load profile of electricity usage is important to the efficiency and reliability of power transmission. The power [[transformer]] or [[battery-to-grid]] are critical aspects of power distribution and sizing and modelling of batteries or transformers depends on the load profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/44343/story.htm|publisher=Planet Ark|title=E.ON UK Plans Giant Battery to Store Wind Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory specification of transformers for the optimization of [[Transformer#Energy losses|load losses versus no-load losses]] is dependent directly on the characteristics of the load profile that the transformer is expected to be subjected to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eromon | first =David I. | title = The Dynamics of Transformer Purchasing in a Transformed Electric Market | journal = The International Journal of Modern Engineering | volume = 6| issue = 1  | year=2005 | url = http://www.ijme.us/issues/fall2005/articles/p33.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes such characteristics as average [[Load factor (electrical)|load factor]], [[diversity factor]], [[utilization factor]], and [[demand factor]], which can all be calculated based on a given load profile.  

On the [[Electricity market|power market]] so-called [[Electricity Forward Agreement|EFA blocks]] are used to specify the [[Trader (finance)|traded]] [[forward contract]] (on the delivery of a certain amount of electrical energy at a certain time.

==Retail energy markets==

In retail energy markets, supplier obligations are settled on an hourly or subhourly basis.  For most customers, consumption is measured on a monthly basis, based on meter reading schedules.  Load profiles are used to convert the monthly consumption data into estimates of hourly or subhourly consumption in order to determine the supplier obligation.  For each hour, these estimates are aggregated for all customers of an energy supplier, and the aggregate amount is used in market settlement calculations as the total demand that must be covered by the supplier.

== Calculating and recording load profiles ==
Load profiles can be determined by direct metering but on smaller devices such as distribution network transformers this is not routinely done. Instead  a load profile can be inferred from customer billing or other data.  An example of a practical calculation used by utilities is using a transformer's maximum demand reading and taking into account the known number of each customer type supplied by these transformers. This process is called [[load research]].

Actual demand can be collected at strategic locations to perform more detailed load analysis; this is beneficial to both distribution and end-user customers looking for peak consumption. [[Smart grid]] [[smart meter|meters]], utility meter load profilers, data logging sub-meters and portable data loggers are designed to accomplish this task by recording readings at a set interval.

{{About|the carnal desire}}

[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Luxuria).jpg|thumb|right|280px|Detail: ''Luxuria'' (Lust), in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'', by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
{{emotion}}
'''Lust''' is a psychological force producing intense wanting for an object, or circumstance fulfilling the emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lazarus with Bernice N Lazarus, ''Passion and Reason: Making Sense of Our Emotions'', 1994, New York: Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0-19-510461-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality, money or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food as distinct from the need for food.

==In religion==

Religions, especially Christianity, tend to draw a distinction between passion and lust by further categorizing lust as an inappropriate desire or a desire that is inappropriately strong, and therefore morally wrong, whereas passion (for proper purposes)  is maintained to be something God-given and moral.

===Buddhism===
{{Main article|tanha}}

Lust holds a critical position in the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhist reality.  It is named in the second of the [[Four Noble Truths]], which are that 
# Suffering ([[dukkha]]) is inherent in all life.
# Suffering is caused by ''lust''.
# There is a natural way to eliminate all suffering from one's life.
# The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is that way.

Lust is the, attachment to, identification with, and passionate desire for certain things in existence, all of which relate to the [[Five skandhas#The five skandhas|form, sensation, perception, mentality, and consciousness]] that certain combinations of these things engender within us. Lust is thus the ultimate cause of general imperfection and the most immediate ''root'' cause of a certain suffering.

The passionate desire for either non-existence or for freedom from lust is a common misunderstanding. For example, the headlong pursuit of lust (or other "[[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]]") in order to fulfill a [[death instinct|desire for death]] is followed by a reincarnation accompanied by a self-fulfilling [[karma]], resulting in an endless [[wheel of life]], until the right way to live, the right worldview, is somehow discovered and practiced. Beholding an [[endless knot]] puts one, symbolically, in the position of the one with the right worldview, representing that person who attains freedom from lust.

In existence are four kinds of things that engender the clinging: rituals, worldviews, pleasures, and the self.  The way to eliminate lust is to learn of its unintended effects and to pursue righteousness as concerns a worldview, intention, speech, behavior, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in the place where lust formerly sat.
[[File:Sankt_Bartholomäus_(Reichenthal)_04.jpg|left|thumb|156x156px|Detail of ''Lust'' at the [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Sankt Bartholomäus]] church ([[Reichenthal]]), [[Pulpit]] (1894)]]

===Christianity===
==== New Testament ====
In many translations of the [[New Testament]], the word "lust" translates the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω, particularly in [[Matthew 5:27-28]]:
{{"|Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust (ἐπιθυμέω) after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.}}

In English-speaking countries, the term "lust" is often associated with [[sexual desire]], probably because of this verse. But just as the English word was originally a general term for ''desire'', the Greek word ἐπιθυμέω was also a general term for desire. The [[LSJ]] lexicon suggests "set one's heart upon a thing, long for, covet, desire" as glosses for ἐπιθυμέω, which is used in verses that clearly have nothing to do with sexual desire. In the [[Septuagint]], ἐπιθυμέω is the word used in the commandment to not covet:

{{"|You shall not covet your neighbor's wife; you shall not covet your neighbor's house or his field or his male slave or his female slave or his ox or his draft animal or any animal of his or whatever belongs to your neighbor.|Exodus 20:17, New English Translation of the Septuagint}}

While coveting your neighbor's wife may involve sexual desire, it's unlikely that coveting a neighbor's house or field is sexual in nature. And in most New Testament uses, the same Greek word, ἐπιθυμέω, does not have a clear sexual connotation. For example, from the [[American Standard Version]] the same word is used outside of any sexual connotation:

# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#13:17|Matthew 13:17]]: For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men ''desired'' to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:15|Luke 22:15-16]]: And he said unto them, With ''desire'' I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#20:33|Acts 20:33]]: I ''coveted'' no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
# [[Wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:14|Luke 15:14-16]]: And when [the [[prodigal son]]] had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he ''would fain'' have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

====Catholicism====
[[File:Daemon.jpg|left|thumb|A demon [[masturbation|satiating his lust]] in a 13th-century manuscript]]
[[File:La Luxure dans l'art roman.JPG|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] representing lust]]

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], a Christian's heart is lustful when "venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Lust}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] said that lust devalues the eternal attraction of male and female, reducing personal riches of the opposite sex to an object for gratification of sexuality.&lt;ref name="PopeJohn"&gt;Pope John Paul II, ''Mutual Attraction Differs from Lust''.L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English, 22 September 1980, p. 11. Available at http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2tb39.htm .&lt;/ref&gt;

Lust is considered by [[Catholicism]] to be a disordered desire for [[sexual pleasure]], where sexual pleasure is "sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes".&lt;ref&gt;'Catechism of the Catholic Church, n° 2351 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Catholicism, sexual desire in itself is good, and is considered part of God's plan for humanity. However, when sexual desire is separated from God's love, it becomes disordered and self-seeking. This is seen as lust.

The Latin for ''extravagance'' (Latin: ''luxuria'') was used by St [[Jerome]] to translate a variety of biblical sins, including drunkenness and sexual excess.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory the Great]] placed ''luxuria'' as one of the seven capital sins (it is often considered the least serious of the seven deadly sins), narrowing its scope to disordered desire,&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 39-40; [https://www.academia.edu/8268216/_Luxure_cléricale_gouvernement_de_l_Église_et_royauté_capétienne_au_temps_de_la_Bible_de_saint_Louis_Revue_Mabillon_25_2014_p._165-194 Julien Théry, "Luxure cléricale, gouvernement de l’Église et royauté capétienne au temps de la 'Bible de saint Louis'", ''Revue Mabillon'', 25, 2014, p. 165-194]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was in this sense that the Middle Ages generally took ''luxuria'', (although the [[Old French]] [[cognate]] was [[loan word|adopted]] into English as ''luxury'' without its sexual meaning by the 14th century{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}).

In [[Romanesque art]], the [[Anthropomorphism|personified]] Luxuria is generally feminine,&lt;ref&gt;J. Jerman/A. Weir, ''Images of Lust'' (2013) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; often represented by a [[siren (mythology)|siren]] or a naked woman with breasts being bitten by snakes. [[Prudentius]] in his [[Psychomachia]] or Battle of the Soul had described&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Luxury, lavish of her ruined fame, Loose-haired, wild-eyed, her voice a dying fall, Lost in delight....&lt;/blockquote&gt; For [[Dante]], Luxuria was both the first of the circles of incontinence (or self-indulgence) on the descent into hell, and the last of the cornices of Mount Purgatory, representing the excessive (disordered) love of individuals;&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell' (1975) p. 101; Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 67 and p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; while for [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] luxuria was synonymous with the power of desire.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Berry, ''The Idea of Luxury'' (1994) p. 97-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The daughters (by-products) of Luxuria, for Gregory and subsequent [[Thomism]], included mental blindness, self-love, haste and excessive attachment to the present:&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy'' (1994) p. 37-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marianne Dashwood]] has been seen as embodying such characteristics for a later age – as a daughter of Luxuria.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Liddell, ''The Novels of Jane Austen'' (London 1963) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]], an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], declared in verse 21 that lust is one of the gates to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] or hell.

{{Quote|[[Arjuna]] said: O descendant of Vrsni, by what is one impelled to [[sin]]ful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force? Then Krishna said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into [[wrath]], and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world. As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust. Thus the wise living entity's pure [[consciousness]] becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire. The [[senses]], the [[mind]] and the [[intelligence]] are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him. Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of [[sin]]—(lust) by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of [[knowledge]] and [[self-realization]]. The working [[senses]] are superior to dull [[matter]]; [[mind]] is higher than the [[senses]]; [[intelligence]] is still higher than the [[mind]]; and he [the soul] is even higher than the [[intelligence]]. Thus knowing oneself to be [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] to the material senses, mind and intelligence, O mighty-armed Arjuna, one should steady the mind by deliberate [[Spirituality|spiritual]] intelligence and thus—by spiritual strength—conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust. ([[Bhagavad-Gita]], 3.36–43)}}

In this ancient manuscript the idea behind the word 'Lust' is best comprehended as the psychological force called 'Wanting'.

====Brahma Kumaris====
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]], a spiritual organization which is based on [[Hindu philosophy]], sexual lust is the greatest enemy to all mankind&lt;ref&gt;''Through open doors: a view of Asian cultures in Kenya''. Cynthia Salvadori, Andrew Fedders, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and the gateway to hell.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring New Religions''. p. 196, George D. Chryssides, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason followers do not eat onions, garlic, eggs, or non-vegetarian food, as the "sulphur" in them can excite sexual lust in the body, otherwise bound to celibacy.

The physical act of sex is "impure", leading to body-consciousness and other crimes. This impurity "poisons" the body and leads to many kinds of "diseases".

The Brahma Kumaris teach that sexuality is like foraging about in a dark sewer. Students at Spiritual University must conquer lust in order to find the [[Golden Age]], a heaven on earth, where children are conceived by an asexual power of mind, and lasting for 2,500 years in the peace and purity of a holy swan moving on earth, over water, and in air.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; purity: the story of the Brahma Kumaris : a spiritual revolution By [[Liz Hodgkinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A history of celibacy'', p. 172. Elizabeth Abbott, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], intentional lascivious glances are forbidden. Lascivious thoughts are disliked, for they are the first step towards adultery, rape and other antisocial behaviors. [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] also stressed the magnitude of the "second glance", as the first glance towards an attractive member of the opposite sex could be just accidental or observatory, the second glance could be that gate into lustful thinking.&lt;ref&gt; [[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]],2701 "The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: "O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.".&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does not advocate [[celibacy]] but it requires marriage to conduct sex legally.

===Judaism===

{{main article|Yetzer hara#The evil inclination in Jewish tradition}}
In [[Judaism]], all evil inclinations and lusts of the flesh are characterized by ''[[Yetzer hara]]'' (Hebrew, יצר הרע, the evil inclination). Yetzer hara is not a demonic force; rather, it is man's misuse of the things which the physical body needs to survive, and is often contrasted with ''yetzer hatov'' (Hebrew, יצר הטוב, the positive desire).

''Yetzer HaRa'' is often identified with [[Satan]] and the angel of death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bava Bathra|pages=16a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is sometimes a tendency to give a personality and separate activity to the ''yetzer''. For the ''yetzer'', like Satan, misleads man in this world, and testifies against him in the world to come. The ''yetzer'' is, however, clearly distinguished from Satan, and on other occasions is made exactly parallel to sin. The [[Torah]] is considered the great antidote against this force. Though, like all things which God has made, the ''yetzer hara'' (evil inclination) can be manipulated into doing good: for without it, man would never marry, beget a child, build a house, or occupy himself in a trade.

===Paganism===

Few ancient, [[Paganism|pagan religions]] actually considered lust to be a vice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of a widespread religious movement practicing lechery as a ritual is the [[Bacchanalia]] of the [[Ancient Roman]] [[Bacchantes]]. However, this activity was soon outlawed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC in the decree ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]''. The practice of sacred prostitution, however, continued to be an activity practiced often by the [[Dionysian]]s.

===Sikhism===

In [[Sikhism]], lust is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities, the others being [[Wrath]], ego, [[greed (deadly sin)|greed]] and [[Attachment theory|attachment]]. Uncontrollable expression of sexual lust, as in rape or [[sexual addiction]], is an evil.

===Meher Baba's teachings===

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described the differences between lust and love:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In lust there is reliance upon the object of sense and consequent spiritual subordination of the soul to it, but love puts the soul into direct and co-ordinate relation with the reality which is behind the form. Therefore lust is experienced as being heavy and love is experienced as being light. In lust there is a narrowing down of life and in love there is an expansion in being...If you love the whole world you vicariously live in the whole world, but in lust there is an ebbing down of life and a general sense of hopeless dependence upon a form which is regarded as another. Thus, in lust there is the accentuation of separateness and suffering, but in love there is the feeling of unity and joy....&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org/ ''Discourses'']. Volume I. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 159–160. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In culture==

===Medieval prostitutes===

Medieval prostitutes lived officially sanctioned in "red light districts." In Ruth Mazo Karras' book ''Common Women'', she discusses the meaning of prostitution and how people thought the proper use of prostitutes by unmarried men helped contain male lust. Prostitution was thought of as having a beneficial effect by reducing the [[sexual frustration]] in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Karras, Ruth Mazo. Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England. New York: Oxford UP, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==

[[File:Mujeres riendo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Goya]]'s [[Man Mocked by Two Women]] (''Dos Mujeres y un hombre''), c. 1820]]

=== Literature ===

From [[Ovid]] to the works of ''[[poète maudit|les poètes maudits]]'', characters have always been faced with scenes of lechery, and long since has lust been a common motif in world literature. Many writers, such as [[Georges Bataille]], [[Casanova]] and [[Prosper Mérimée]], have written works wherein scenes at bordellos and other unseemly locales take place.

[[Baudelaire]], author of ''[[Les fleurs du mal]]'', had once remarked, in regard to the artist, that:

{{cquote|The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself.}}

The most notable work to touch upon the sin of lust, and all of the Seven Deadly Sins, is Dante's ''[[la Divina Commedia]]''. Dante's criterion for lust was an "excessive love of others," insofar as an excessive love for man would render one's love of God secondary.

In the first canticle of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'', the lustful are punished by being continuously swept around in a whirlwind, which symbolizes their passions. The damned who are guilty of lust, like the two famous lovers, Paolo and Francesca, receive what they desired in their mortal lives, their passions never give them rest for all eternity. In ''[[Purgatorio]]'', of the selfsame work, the penitents choose to walk through flames in order to purge themselves of their lustful inclinations.

==In philosophy==

The link between [[love]] and lust has always been a problematic question in philosophy.

===Schopenhauer===

[[Schopenhauer]] notes the misery which results from [[sexual relationship]]s. According to him, this directly explains the sentiments of shame and sadness which tend to follow the act of sexual intercourse. For, he states, the only power that reigns is the inextinguishable desire to face, at any price, the blind love present in human existence without any consideration of the outcome. He estimates that a genius of his species is an industrial being who wants only to produce, and wants only to think. The theme of lust for Schopenhauer is thus to consider the horrors which will almost certainly follow the culmination of lust.

===St. Thomas Aquinas===

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]] defines the sin of Lust in questions 153 and 154 of his Summa Theologica. Aquinas says the sin of lust is of "voluptuous emotions," and makes the point that sexual pleasures, "unloosen the human spirit," and set aside right reason (Pg.191). Aquinas restricts lust's subject matter to physical desires specifically arising from sexual acts, but Aquinas does not assume all sex-acts are sinful. Sex is not a sin in marriage, because sex is the only way for humans to reproduce. If sex is used naturally and the end purpose is reproduction there is no sin. Aquinas says, "if the end be good and if what is done is well-adapted to that, then no sin is present," (Pg.193). However, sex simply for the sake of pleasure is lustful and therefore, a sin. A man who uses his body for lechery wrongs the Lord.

Sex may have the attributes of being sinless; however, when a person seeks sex for pleasure, he or she is sinning with lust. Lust is best defined by its specific attribute of rape, adultery, wet dreams, seduction, unnatural vice, and simple fornication.

[[Wet dreams]]: St. Thomas Aquinas defined and discussed the topic of nocturnal emission, which occurs when one dreams of physical pleasure. Aquinas argues those who say that wet dreams are a sin and comparable to the actual experience of sex are wrong. Aquinas believes that such an action is sinless, for a dream is not under a person's control or free judgment. When one has a "nocturnal orgasm," it is not a sin, but it can lead to sins (Pg. 227). Aquinas says that wet dreams come from a physical cause of inappropriate pictures within your imagination, a psychological cause when thinking of sex while you fall asleep and a demonical cause where by demons act upon the sleepers body, "stirring the sleeper's imagination to bring about a orgasm," (Pg. 225).  In the end, though, dreaming of lustful acts is not sinful. The "mind's awareness is less hindered," as the sleeper lacks right reason; therefore, a person cannot be accountable for what they dream while sleeping, (Pg. 227).

[[Adultery]]: One of the main forms of lust seen frequently during the Middle Ages was the sin of adultery. The sin of adultery occurs when a person is unfaithful to his or her spouse, hence "invading of a bed not one's own," (Pg.235). Adultery is a special kind of ugliness and many difficulties arise from it. When a man enters the bed of a married woman it not only is a sin, but it "wrongs the offspring," because the woman now calls into question the legitimacy of children. (Pg.235). If a wife has committed adultery before, then, her husband will question if all his wife's children are his offspring. 
	
[[Fornication|Simple fornication]]: Simple fornication is having sex with one's wife for enjoyment rather than for bearing children. Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says, "fornication is a deadly crime," (Pg.213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, "Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit" (Pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if you do wrong to her, you then do wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.

[[Rape]]: Rape is a kind of lust that often coincides with seduction and is defined as a type of lechery. Rape comes with force and violence: Rape occurs when a person craves the pleasures of sex so intensely that he uses force to obtain it. Rape is committed when violence is used to seduce, or deflower a virgin. Rape harms both the unmarried girl and her father, because the girl is property of her father. Rape and seduction can be discussed together, because both sins involve the deflowering of a virgin; however, rape can happen without seduction, as when a man attacks a widow or a sexually experienced woman and violates her. Therefore, wherever violence accompanies sex, you have the quality of rape and the sin of lust.

[[Seduction]]: Seduction is a type of lust, because seduction is a sex act, which ravishes a virgin. Lust is a sin of sexual activity, and, "…a special quality of wrong that appears if a maid still under her father's care is debauched" (Pg.229). Seduction involves a discussion of property, as an unmarried girl is property of her father. A virgin, even though free from the bond of marriage, is not free from the bond of her family. When a virgin is violated without a promise of engagement, she is prevented from having honorable marriage, which is shameful to herself and her family. A man who performs sexual acts with a virgin must "endow her and have her to wife," and if the father, who is responsible for her, says no, then a man must pay a dowry to compensate for her loss of virginity and future chance of marriage. (Pg.229)

'''Unnatural vice:''' Unnatural vice is the worst kind of lust because it is unnatural in act and purpose. Unnatural vice happens variously, but Aquinas provides several examples including [[bestiality]] or intercourse with a "thing of another species," for example animals. Aquinas said, "bestiality goes beyond the bands of humanity" and is therefore, unnatural.

==Contemporary spiritual perspective==

[[Barry Long]] states that lusting is simply thinking or fantasising about an [[sexual fantasy|imagined sexual scene]] and private parts of the body. The action of thinking or fantasising stirs the natural, pure sexual energy into a coarser, more degraded emotional form (lust).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barrylong.org/statements/manschallenge.shtml |title=Barry Long Foundation International |publisher=Barrylong.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'MAKING LOVE Sexual Love the Divine Way' Barry Long, Book {{ISBN|978-1-899324-14-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Long, Gold Coast Talks audio, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Long encourages lovemaking as the practice of converting sexual energy into the knowledge of love: "You don’t need a celibate body, you need a celibate mind".&lt;ref&gt;Gold Coast Talks audio April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychoanalysis and psychology==

{{Main article|libido}}
Lust, in the domain of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychology]], is often treated as a case of "heightened [[libido]]".

A person is more likely to lust after someone who does not resemble themself. Self-relatedness is a cue of kinship and causes an instinctual reaction to not be attracted. Therefore, self-resemblance decreases attractiveness and sexual desire in a person, while less resemblance increases attractiveness and sexual desire, creating a higher possibility of lust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.3003| title = Trustworthy but not lust-worthy: Context-specific effects of facial resemblance| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences| volume = 272| issue = 1566| pages = 919–22| year = 2005| last1 = Debruine | first1 = L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6890">[[File:Soft starters1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Examples of motor soft starters]]
A '''motor soft starter''' is a device used with [[AC motor|AC electrical motor]]s to temporarily reduce the load and [[torque]] in the [[power train]] and electric current surge of the motor during start-up. This reduces the [[mechanical stress]] on the motor and shaft, as well as the [[electrodynamics|electrodynamic]] stresses on the attached power cables and [[electricity distribution|electrical distribution network]], extending the lifespan of the system.&lt;ref name=Siskind&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles S. | last=Siskind | author link= | year=1963 | title=Electrical Control Systems in Industry | edition= | publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. | location=New York | isbn= 0-07-057746-3 | page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can consist of mechanical or electrical devices, or a combination of both. Mechanical soft starters include [[clutch]]es and several types of [[coupling]]s using a [[fluid coupling|fluid]], magnetic forces, or steel [[Lead shot|shot]] to transmit torque, similar to other forms of [[torque limiter]]. Electrical soft starters can be any control system that reduces the torque by temporarily reducing the [[voltage]] or [[electric current|current]] input, or a device that temporarily alters how the motor is connected in the [[electric circuit]].
[[File:Digital Soft Starter with Motor Protection and In Built By Pass.jpg|thumb|Digital Soft Starter]]
Across-the line starting of induction motors is accompanied by inrush currents up to 7-10 times higher than running current, and starting torque up to 3 times higher than running torque. The increased torque results in sudden mechanical stress on the machine which leads to a reduced service life. Moreover, the high inrush current stresses the power supply, which may lead to voltage dips. As a result, lifespan  of sensitive equipment may be reduced.&lt;ref name="Siskind" /&gt;

A soft starter eliminates the undesired side effects. Several types based on control of the supply voltage or mechanical devices such as slip clutches were developed. The list provides an overview of the various electric start-up types. The current and torque characteristic curves show the behavior of the respective starter solution.
Torque surges entail high mechanical stress on the machine, which results in higher service costs and increased wear. High currents and current peaks lead to high fixed costs charged by the power supply companies (peak current calculation) and to increased mains and generator loads.

A soft starter continuously controls the three-phase motor’s voltage supply during the start-up phase. This way, the motor is adjusted to the machine’s load behavior. Mechanical operating equipment is accelerated smoothly. This lengthens service life, improves operating behavior, and smooths work flows. Electrical soft starters can use [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] devices to control the [[Electric current|current]] flow and therefore the voltage applied to the motor. They can be connected in [[series circuits|series]] with the line voltage applied to the motor, or can be connected inside the delta (Δ) loop of a [[Y-Δ transform|delta-connected motor]], controlling the voltage applied to each winding. Solid state soft starters can control one or more [[three-phase electric power|phases]] of the voltage applied to the induction motor with the best results achieved by three-phase control. Typically, the voltage is controlled by reverse-[[parallel circuits|parallel]]-connected [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s ([[thyristor]]s), but in some circumstances with three-phase control, the control elements can be a reverse-parallel-connected SCR and [[diode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/engineering-essentials/soft-starters|title= Soft starters |publisher=machinedesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to limit motor starting current is a series [[inductor|reactor]].  If an air core is used for the series reactor then a very efficient and reliable soft starter can be designed which is suitable for all types of 3 phase induction motor [ synchronous / asynchronous ] ranging from 25 kW 415 V to 30 MW 11 kV.  Using an air core series reactor soft starter is very common practice for applications like pump, compressor, fan etc.  Usually high starting torque applications do not use this method.

==Applications==
Soft starters can be set up to the requirements of the individual application. In pump applications, a soft start can avoid pressure surges. Conveyor belt systems can be smoothly started, avoiding jerk and stress on drive components. Fans or other systems  with belt drives can be started slowly to avoid belt slipping. Soft starts are seen in electrical R/C helicopters, and allow the rotor blades to spool-up in a smooth, controlled manner rather than a sudden surge. In all systems, a soft start limits the inrush current and so improves stability of the power supply and reduces transient voltage drops that may affect other loads.

The '''National Women's Front''' (NWF) was formed in 2009 with the stated objective of [[Women's empowerment|empowerment of women]] of [[India]]. In the view of the NWF, "the world's largest [[democracy]] still has women [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] and [[Oppression|oppressed]]". The NWF seeks to create a platform for Indian women to oppose [[injustice]] and claim their [[Women's rights|rights]].

== Background ==
{{See also|Women in India}}
The status of Indian women is progressing towards gender equality, but women continue to encounter patriarchal standards. Despite the steps towards gender equality, women still face abuse from society. India has [[Rape in India|a high rate of rapes]], while physical assault and acid attacks are on the rise as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/07/27/acid-attacks-women-india-survivors-fight-back/486007001/|title=Acid Attacks on Women in India: Survivors Fight Back|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Women's Front was founded with the hope of empowering women in the fight for justice and equality. 

===History of the organization===
Although NGOs and humanitarian organizations lend support to women's rights in India, western approaches to feminism may not provide the relief necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, M. (2004). The Indian Women's Movement. ''Contemporary Sociology'', 33(6), 635–639. {{JSTOR|3593826}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2009, the National Women's Front was launched to "create a platform for women through which women can stand up against injustice and fight for their rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwfindia.com/home/content/about-nwf|title=The National Women's Front|work=NWFIndia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization started and worked in three states, but is now working within eight states. The aim is to provide support and encourage women living in rural communities that are often overlooked by the government to fight for their equality. 

== Programs and campaigns==
In 2014, the NWF [[Delhi]] State unit held an [[International Women's Day]] celebration with their nationwide campaign "Women Representation – The Power to Empower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwfindia.com/home/content/nwf%C2%A0organized-womens-march-india-gate|title=NWF Organized a women's march at India gate|work=nwfindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November of the same year, the NWF organised a conference ‘Awakening’ to debate issues concerning Indian women at [[Coimbatore]].&lt;ref name=deccan1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141116/nation-current-affairs/article/women%E2%80%99s-conference-coimbatore-today|title=Women's conference in Coimbatore today|work=Deccan Chronicle| date = 2014-11-16 |access-date = 2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the conference, an expo on [[women's rights]] and issues was inaugurated by [[Popular Front of India]] state president A.S.Ismail.  Graphic illustrations of [[domestic violence]], [[rape]], [[Sex-selective abortion|female foeticide]] and [[riot]]s victims have been presented at the expo.&lt;ref name=deccan1 /&gt;

A workshop on Women Safety was organized by the National Women's Front at the India Islamic Cultural Center in [[New Delhi]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://twocircles.net/2013feb18/national_womens_front_organizes_workshop_women.html#.VyoOVIR97cc | title = NWF organizes workshop for women | newspaper = TCN News | date = 2013-02-18 | access-date = 2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year National Women's Front organized the national campaign "Right to Hijab" across the country to create awareness about [[hijab]] and also promote the right to [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right to Hijab|url=http://www.nwfindia.com/home/content/right-hijab|website=National Women's Front}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

NWF conducted a campaign related to [[human rights]] and [[legal awareness]] in various States of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights|url=http://nwfindia.com/home/content/human-rights|website=nwfindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign sprang from a perception that, under the garb of preventing [[terrorism]], [[extremism]], and [[Maoism]], law enforcement targets [[Minority group|minorities]], [[dalit]]s, and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|tribals]] by taking them into illegal custody, keeping them in jail, and even killing them in fake encounters, and that none of the [[List of political parties in India|political parties]] were taking a principled stand against what NWF regarded as this injustice. 

The [[Kerala]] State committee of National Women's Front organized a campaign against the [[Uniform Civil Code]], as a part of national level of initiative to create awareness of the threat posed by the Code to the [[cultural diversity]] of India.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|title=National Women's Front opposes Uniform Civil Code|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Women%E2%80%99s-front-opposes-Uniform-Civil-Code/article16088802.ece|accessdate=2016-12-02|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They termed the Uniform Civil Code "anti-national" as it eliminates the diversity of different communities ultimately destroying [[Indian Nationalism]].&lt;ref name=hindu1 /&gt; According to them it is a manifestation of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Muslim]] and anti-dalit tendencies of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].&lt;ref name=hindu1 /&gt;

==Condemnation of the arrest of Irom Chanu Sharmila==
[[Irom Chanu Sharmila]] has been [[fasting]] since 2000 demanding the withdrawal of [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act|Armed Forces Special Powers Act]] (AFSPA) imposed in [[Manipur]]. The arrest of Irom Chanu Sharmila, after the release order from the [[Imphal]] [[Sessions Court]], was condemned by the NWF national secretariat members who gathered a meeting in their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.nwfindia.com/home/news?page=4 | title = NWF strongly condemns the arrest of irom sharmila | date = 2014-10-16 | access-date = 2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Irom Chanu Sharmila called an end to her 16 long year fast to enter politics, she received a negative response from the people of Manipur itself. But NWF supported her decision in this cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Women's Front appreciates Irom Sharmila's initiative|url=http://www.popularfrontindia.org/?q=sat-08132016-1407|website=Popular Front of India|accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NWF president AS Sainaba strongly condemned the disgraceful attack on Muslim women at the [[Mandsaur]] railway station in Madhya Pradesh. It was an attack of cow protection vigilantes. She called for an end to violence, for the culprits to be brought to justice, and for the Government to control hate speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=control hindutwa vigilante|url=http://www.popularfrontindia.org/?q=sat-08132016-1414|website=Popular Front of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oogenesis''', '''ovogenesis''', or '''oögenesis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|oʊ|.|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|s|ɪ|s}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Oogenesis Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary Definition: Oogenesis]&lt;/ref&gt; is the differentiation of the [[ovum]] (egg cell) into a cell competent to further development when fertilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|date=2000-01-01|title=Oogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10008/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is developed from the primary oocyte by maturation. Oogenesis is initiated in the embryonic stage.  

==Oogenesis in mammals==

In [[mammal]]s, the first part of oogenesis starts in the [[germinal epithelium (female)|germinal epithelium]], which gives rise to the development of [[ovarian follicles]], the functional unit of the [[ovary]].

Oogenesis consists of several sub-processes: oocytogenesis, [[ootidogenesis]], and finally maturation to form an ovum (oogenesis proper). [[Folliculogenesis]] is a separate sub-process that accompanies and supports all three oogenetic sub-processes.

Oocyte meiosis, important to all animal life cycles yet unlike all other instances of animal cell division, occurs completely without the aid of [[Spindle apparatus|spindle]]-coordinating [[centrosomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szollosi D, Calarco P, Donahue RP | year = 1972 | title = Absence of centrioles in the first and second meiotic spindles of mouse oocytes | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 521–541 | pmid = 5076360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15385423 | doi=10.1095/biolreprod.104.031245 | volume=72 | title=Centrosome reduction during gametogenesis and its significance | date=January 2005 | journal=Biol. Reprod. | pages=2–13 | vauthors=Manandhar G, Schatten H, Sutovsky P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The creation of oogonia===
The creation of [[oogonia]] traditionally doesn't belong to oogenesis proper, but, instead, to the [[Gametogenesis#Common path|common process]] of gametogenesis, which, in the female human, begins with the processes of [[folliculogenesis]], oocytogenesis, and [[ootidogenesis]].

==Human oogenesis==

===Oogenesis===
Oogenesis starts with the process of developing primary oocytes, which occurs via the transformation of [[oogonium|oogonia]] into primary [[oocyte]]s, a process called oocytogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.4695 NCBI - The saga of the germ line]&lt;/ref&gt; Oocytogenesis is complete either before or shortly after birth.

====Number of primary oocytes====
It is commonly believed that, when oocytogenesis is complete, no additional primary oocytes are created, in contrast to the male process of spermatogenesis, where gametocytes are continuously created. In other words, primary oocytes reach their maximum development at ~20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lobo RA |title=Early ovarian ageing: a hypothesis. What is early ovarian ageing? |journal=Hum. Reprod. |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=1762–4 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12923124 |doi= 10.1093/humrep/deg377|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12923124}}&lt;/ref&gt; weeks of gestational age, when approximately seven million primary oocytes have been created; however, at birth, this number has already been reduced to approximately 1-2 million.

Recently, however, two publications have challenged the belief that a finite number of oocytes are set around the time of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Johnson J, Bagley J, Skaznik-Wikiel M, etal |title=Oocyte generation in adult mammalian ovaries by putative germ cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood |journal=Cell |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=303–15 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16051153 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.06.031 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson J, Canning J, Kaneko T, Pru J, Tilly J | title = Germline stem cells and follicular renewal in the postnatal mammalian ovary | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979 | pages = 145–50 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15014492 | doi = 10.1038/nature02316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewal of ovarian follicles from germline stem cells (originating from bone marrow and peripheral blood) has been reported in the postnatal mouse ovary. In contrast, DNA clock measurements do not indicate ongoing oogenesis during human females' lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster P, Hohoff C, Dunkelmann B, Schürenkamp M, Pfeiffer H, Neuhuber F, Brinkmann B |title=Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers |journal=Proc R Soc B |volume=282 |issue= |pages=20142898 |year=2015 |pmid=25694621 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 |pmc=4345458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, further experiments are required to determine the true dynamics of small follicle formation.

===Ootidogenesis===
The succeeding phase of ootidogenesis occurs when the [[primary oocyte]] develops into an ootid. This is achieved by the process of meiosis. In fact, a primary oocyte is, by its biological definition, a cell whose primary function is to divide by the process of meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-P/primary_oocyte.html Biochem]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although this process begins at prenatal age, it stops at [[prophase I]]. In late fetal life, all oocytes, still primary oocytes, have halted at this stage of development, called the [[dictyate]]. After [[menarche]], these cells then continue to develop, although only a few do so every [[menstrual cycle]].

====Meiosis I====
[[Meiosis I]] of ootidogenesis begins during embryonic development, but halts in the [[diplotene]] stage of prophase I until puberty. The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate ([[Leptotene stage|leptotene]], [[Meiosis#Zygotene|zygotene]] and [[Meiosis#Pacytene|pachytene]]) stages of meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guli CL, Smyth DR | year = 1988 | title = UV-induced DNA repair is not detectable in pre-dictyate oocytes of the mouse | url = | journal = Mutat Res | volume = 208 | issue = 2| pages = 115–119 | pmid = 3380109 | doi=10.1016/s0165-7992(98)90010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those primary oocytes that continue to develop in each menstrual cycle, however, [[synapsis]] occurs and [[Meiosis#Meiosis I|tetrads]] form, enabling [[chromosomal crossover]] to occur. As a result of meiosis I, the primary oocyte has now developed into the [[secondary oocyte]] and the first [[polar body]].

====Meiosis II====
Immediately after meiosis I, the [[haploid]] secondary oocyte initiates [[meiosis II]]. However, this process is also halted at the [[metaphase II]] stage until [[fertilization]], if such should ever occur. When meiosis II has completed, an ootid and another polar body have now been created.

====Folliculogenesis====
{{Main article|Folliculogenesis}}
Synchronously with ootidogenesis, the [[ovarian follicle]] surrounding the ootid has developed from a primordial follicle to a preovulatory one.

===Maturation into ovum===
Both polar bodies disintegrate at the end of Meiosis II, leaving only the ootid, which then eventually undergoes maturation into a mature ovum.

The function of forming polar bodies is to discard the extra haploid sets of chromosomes that have resulted as a consequence of meiosis.

===In vitro maturation===
{{Main article|In vitro maturation}}
''In vitro maturation'' (''IVM'') is the technique of letting [[ovarian follicle]]s mature [[in vitro]]. It can potentially be performed before an [[IVF]]. In such cases, [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] isn't essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body prior to IVF. Hence, no (or at least a lower dose of) gonadotropins have to be injected in the body.&lt;ref name=vejledning&gt;[http://www.sst.dk/publ/Publ2006/KOT/kunstig_befrugtning/Vejl_ivf_oa_dec06.pdf Vejledning om kunstig befrugtning 2006 (Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Immature eggs have been grown until maturation ''in vitro'' at a 10% survival rate, but the technique is not yet clinically available.&lt;ref name="McLaughlinAlbertini2018"&gt;

==Oogenesis in non-mammals==
[[File:Parasite160001-fig6 - Oogenesis in Crepidostomum metoecus (Digenea) (diagram).png|thumb|Diagram of oogenesis in a [[digenea]]n ([[Platyhelminthes]])]]
{{Main article|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}

Some [[algae]] and the [[oomycete]]s produce eggs in [[oogonia]]. In the brown alga ''[[Fucus]]'', all four egg cells survive oogenesis, which is an exception to the rule that generally only one product of female meiosis survives to maturity.

In [[plant]]s, oogenesis occurs inside the female [[gametophyte]] via [[mitosis]]. In many plants such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and [[gymnosperm]]s, egg cells are formed in [[archegonia]]. In [[flowering plant]]s, the female gametophyte has been reduced to an eight-celled [[embryo sac]] within the [[ovule]] inside the [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] of the flower. Oogenesis occurs within the embryo sac and leads to the formation of a single egg cell per ovule.

In ''[[ascaris]]'', the oocyte does not even begin meiosis until the [[sperm]] touches it, in contrast to mammals, where meiosis is completed in the [[estrus]] cycle.

The '''Overseas Development Institute''' ('''ODI''') is an independent [[think tank]] on [[international development]] and humanitarian issues, founded in 1960. Based in London, its mission is "to inspire and inform policy and practice which lead to the reduction of poverty, the alleviation of suffering and the achievement of sustainable livelihoods in [[developing countries]]." It does this by "locking together high-quality applied research, practical policy advice, and policy-focused dissemination and debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/about/mission-values.asp |title=Organisational information – About us – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1960 ODI began in small premises in Regent's Park, central London and operated a library devoted to international development issues as well as performing consultancy work and contracts with the [[Department for International Development]] (then known as the Overseas Development Agency) of the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/50years/default.asp#timeline |title=at 50 – About ODI – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has moved several times and is currently{{when|date=January 2015}} on Blackfriars Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/about/contact-details |title=Contact details and directions – About us – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004 it has had a Partnership Programme Arrangement with the UK's Department for International Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/funding/ppa/currentppas/odi-ppa-2008-11.pdf?epslanguage=en|title= Partnership Program Arrangement (PPA) between UK Department for International Development (DFID) and Overseas Development Institute (ODI) 2008–2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also developed a strong focus on communications and 'bridging research and policy'.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Simon, and Diane L. Stone, eds. Global knowledge networks and international development. Routledge, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the ODI was named 'Think Tank of the Year' by ''Public Affairs News'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicaffairsnews.com publicaffairsnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was named 'Think-tank to Watch' in the ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' 'Think-tank of the Year' awards in 2005 and is considered to be in international policy circles to be one of the world's leading think tanks on development.

=== Fellowship ===
ODI runs a fellowship scheme, which sends young postgraduate economists of all nationalities to work in the public sectors of developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific on two-year contracts. Since 1963 ODI has sent over 900 post-graduate economists to work in 40 mostly low-income countries. Participants were initially known as Overseas Development Institute Nuffield Fellows (ODINs) and later titled as ODI Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/fellowship-scheme/ |title=Fellowship Scheme – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
As a [[registered charity]], ODI's income relies on "grants and donations from foundations, non-governmental organisations, the private sector, governments, multilateral agencies and academia".

For its £28,541,000 income (USD 42,811,000 as of January 2015) per its annual report from 2013 to 2014 ending 31 March 2014,&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|title=annual report 2013-14|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9127.pdf|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=25 January 2015|pages=1|format=pdf|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ODI provided a list of these "major donors", which include Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Oxfam, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Research Triangle Institute, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Swiss Federal Government, The Prince's Youth Business International, UN Women, UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, US Agency for International Development, Wiley-Blackwell, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, World Bank.&lt;ref name=donors&gt;{{cite web|title=Major donors|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9133.pdf|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=25 January 2015|pages=1|format=pdf|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
David Steven of Global Dashboard criticised the ODI for not making the distinction between subsidy and having a lower [[VAT]] rate on fuel comparison to other goods.&lt;ref name=GlobalDashboard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldashboard.org/2013/11/07/odi-calls-vat-hike-energy-bills/|title=ODI calls for VAT hike on energy bills (updated: ODI fights back)|publisher=Global Dashboard|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postmodern philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that arose in the second half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as a critical response to assumptions allegedly present in [[modern philosophy|modernist philosophical ideas]] regarding culture, identity, history, or language that were developed during the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duignan|first1=Brian|title=postmodernism (philosophy) (Encyclopædia Britannica)|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmodern|title=Definition of POSTMODERN|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Postmodernist thinkers developed concepts like [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]], repetition, [[Trace (deconstruction)|trace]], and [[hyperreality]] to subvert "[[grand narratives]]," [[univocity of being]], and epistemic certainty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/postmodernism/|chapter=Postmodernism|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Aylesworth|first=Gary|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern philosophy questions the importance of power relationships, personalization, and [[discourse]] in the "construction" of truth and world views. Many postmodernists appear to deny that an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] reality exists, and appear to deny that there are objective moral values.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined philosophical postmodernism in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'', writing "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge|last=Lyotard|first=J.-F.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where what he means by [[metanarrative]] is something like a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically certain story about everything that is. Postmodernists reject metanarratives because they reject the concept of truth that metanarratives presuppose. Postmodernist philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and social context rather than being absolute and universal and that truth is always partial and "at issue" rather than being complete and certain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Postmodern philosophy is often particularly skeptical about simple binary oppositions characteristic of [[structuralism]], emphasizing the problem of the philosopher cleanly distinguishing knowledge from ignorance, social progress from reversion, dominance from submission, good from bad, and presence from absence.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Stuart. ''Routledge Companion to Postmodernism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Victor and Charles Winquist. ''Encyclopedia of Postmodernism'' "Binary Opposition"&lt;/ref&gt; But, for the same reasons, postmodern philosophy should often be particularly skeptical about the complex spectral characteristics of things, emphasizing the problem of the philosopher again cleanly distinguishing concepts, for a concept must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as existence and nothingness, normality and abnormality, speech and writing, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques; Bass, Alan (2001). "7 :Freud and the Scene of Writing". Writing and Difference (New ed.). London: Routledge. p. 276. {{ISBN|0203991788}}. Retrieved 8 September 2017. The model of hieroglyphic writing assembles more strikingly—though we find it in every form of writing—the diversity of the modes and functions of signs in dreams. Every sign—verbal or otherwise—may be used at different levels, in configurations and functions which are never prescribed by its "essence," but emerge from a play of differences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern philosophy also has strong relations with the substantial literature of [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society. Vol. 23 (2-3). Sage, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristic claims ==
Many postmodern claims are a deliberate repudiation of certain 18th-century Enlightenment values. Such a postmodernist believes that there is no objective natural reality, and that logic and reason are mere conceptual constructs that are not universally valid. Two other characteristic postmodern practices are a denial that [[human nature]] exists, and a (sometimes moderate) skepticism toward claims that science and technology will change society for the better. Postmodernists also believe there are no objective moral values. Thus, postmodern philosophy suggests equality for all things. One's concept of good and another's concept of evil are to be equally correct, since good and evil are subjective. Since both good and evil are equally correct, a postmodernist then [[tolerate]]s both concepts, even if he or she disagrees with them subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, Maria and Carter, J. Adam, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/relativism/ Relativism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Simon|title=[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|entry=Postmodernism|isbn=9780198610137|language=en|quote=In its poststructuralist aspects it includes a denial of... any fixed reality or truth or fact to be the object of enquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern writings often focus on [[deconstruction|deconstructing]] the role that power and ideology play in shaping discourse and belief. Postmodern philosophy shares [[ontology|ontological]] similarities with classical [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] and [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] belief systems, and shares political similarities with modern [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that "The assumption that there is no common denominator in 'nature' or 'truth' ... that guarantees the possibility of neutral or objective thought" is a key assumption of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Ermarth, Elizabeth Deeds. Postmodernism, 1998, doi:10.4324/9780415249126-N044-1. Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Taylor and Francis, https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/postmodernism/v-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] has characterized the belief that "social science research can never generate objective or trustworthy knowledge" as an example of a postmodernist belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council|first1=National Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Education|first3=Center for|last4=Research|first4=Committee on Scientific Principles for Education|title=Scientific Research in Education|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=9780309082914|pages=20, 25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s seminal 1979 ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' stated that its hypotheses "should not be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but strategic value in relation to the questions raised". Lyotard's statement in 1984 that "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives" extends to incredulity toward science. [[Jacques Derrida]], who is generally identified as a postmodernist, stated that "every referent, all reality has the structure of a differential trace".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; [[Paul Feyerabend]], one of the most famous twentieth-century philosophers of science, is often classified as a postmodernist; Feyerabend held that modern science is no more justified than witchcraft, and has denounced the "tyranny" of "abstract concepts such as 'truth', 'reality', or 'objectivity', which narrow people's vision and ways of being in the world".&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preston|first1=John|title=Paul Feyerabend|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/feyerabend/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 April 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Denis Charles|last2=Burbules|first2=Nicholas C.|title=Postpositivism and Educational Research|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847691227|page=1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Ian James|title=Was Feyerabend a Postmodernist?|journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science|date=21 December 2016|volume=30|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.1080/02698595.2016.1240463|quote=This article asks whether the philosophy of Paul K. Feyerabend can be reasonably classified as postmodernist, a label applied to him by friends and foes alike.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend also defended astrology, adopted alternative medicine, and sympathized with creationism. Defenders of postmodernism state that many descriptions of postmodernism exaggerate its antipathy to science; for example, Feyerabend denied that he was "anti-science", accepted that some scientific ''theories'' are superior to other theories (even if science itself isn't superior to other modes of inquiry), and attempted conventional medical treatments during his fight against cancer.&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horgan|first1=John|authorlink1=John Horgan|title=Was Philosopher Paul Feyerabend Really Science's "Worst Enemy"?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/was-philosopher-paul-feyerabend-really-science-s-worst-enemy/|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=[[Scientific American]] Cross-check (blog)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierre|first1=Elizabeth Adams St|title=Comment: “Science” Rejects Postmodernism|journal=Educational Researcher|date=July 2016|volume=31|issue=8|pages=25–27|doi=10.3102/0013189X031008025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitional issues ==
Philosopher [[John Deely]] has argued for the contentious claim that the label "postmodern" for thinkers such as [[Derrida]] ''et al.'' is ''premature''.  Insofar as the "so-called" postmoderns follow the thoroughly ''modern'' trend of [[idealism]], it is more an ''ultra''modernism than anything else. A postmodernism that lives up to its name, therefore, must no longer confine itself to the premodern preoccupation with "things" nor with the modern confinement to "ideas," but must come to terms with the way of signs embodied in the semiotic doctrines of such thinkers as the Portuguese philosopher [[John Poinsot]] and the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, ''Four Ages of Understanding: The First Postmodern Survey of Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twenty-First Century'' (Toronto: U. of Toronto, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Deely,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The epoch of Greek and Latin philosophy was based on ''being'' in a quite precise sense: the existence exercised by things independently of human apprehension and attitude. The much briefer epoch of modern philosophy based itself rather on the instruments of human knowing, but in a way that unnecessarily compromised being. As the 20th century ends, there is reason to believe that a new philosophical epoch is dawning along with the new century, promising to be the richest epoch yet for human understanding. The postmodern era is positioned to synthesize at a higher level—the level of experience, where the being of things and the activity of the finite knower compenetrate one another and provide the materials whence can be derived knowledge of nature and knowledge of culture in their full symbiosis—the achievements of the ancients and the moderns in a way that gives full credit to the preoccupations of the two. The postmodern era has for its distinctive task in philosophy the exploration of a new path, no longer the ancient way of things nor the modern way of ideas, but the way of signs, whereby the peaks and valleys of ancient and modern thought alike can be surveyed and cultivated by a generation which has yet further peaks to climb and valleys to find.&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, "Philosophy and Experience," ''American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly'' LXVI.4 (Winter 1992), 299–319, esp. 314–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
===Precursors===
Postmodern philosophy originated primarily in France during the mid-20th century. However, several philosophical antecedents inform many of postmodern philosophy's concerns.

It was greatly influenced by the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in the 19th century and other early-to-mid 20th-century philosophers, including [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille]], and the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Postmodern philosophy also drew from the world of the arts and architecture, particularly [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[John Cage]] and artists who practiced [[collage]], and the architecture of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and the [[Pompidou Centre]].

===Early postmodern philosophers===
The most influential early postmodern philosophers were [[Jean Baudrillard]],  [[Jean-François Lyotard]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].  [[Michel Foucault]] is also often cited as an early postmodernist although he personally rejected that label. Following Nietzsche, Foucault argued that knowledge is produced through the operations of ''power'', and changes fundamentally in different historical periods.

The writings of Lyotard were largely concerned with the role of narrative in human culture, and particularly how that role has changed as we have left modernity and entered a "postindustrial" or [[postmodernity|postmodern condition]].  He argued that modern philosophies legitimized their truth-claims not (as they themselves claimed) on logical or empirical grounds, but rather on the grounds of accepted stories (or "[[metanarratives]]") about knowledge and the world—comparing these with Wittgenstein's concept of [[language-game]]s.  He further argued that in our postmodern condition, these metanarratives no longer work to legitimize truth-claims.  He suggested that in the wake of the collapse of modern metanarratives, people are developing a new "language-game"—one that does not make claims to absolute truth but rather celebrates a world of ever-changing relationships (among people and between people and the world).

Derrida, the father of [[deconstruction]], practiced philosophy as a form of textual criticism.  He criticized Western philosophy as privileging the concept of presence and ''logos'', as opposed to absence and markings or writings.

In the United States, the most famous pragmatist and self-proclaimed postmodernist was [[Richard Rorty]].  An analytic philosopher, Rorty believed that combining [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction with [[Wilfrid Sellars]]'s critique of the "[[Myth of the Given]]" allowed for an abandonment of the view of the thought or language as a mirror of a reality or external world.  Further, drawing upon [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s criticism of the dualism between conceptual scheme and empirical content, he challenges the sense of questioning whether our particular concepts are related to the world in an appropriate way, whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways.  He argued that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of a social practice and language was what served our purposes in a particular time; ancient languages are sometimes untranslatable into modern ones because they possess a different vocabulary and are unuseful today.  Donald Davidson is not usually considered a postmodernist, although he and Rorty have both acknowledged that there are few differences between their philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/rorty.html|title=An interview with Rorty|author=|date=|website=unc.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, D., 1986, "A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge," Truth And Interpretation, Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson, ed.

'''Roger Searle Payne''' (born January 29, 1935) is an [[United States|American]] [[biologist]] and [[environmentalist]] famous for the 1967 discovery (with Scott McVay) of [[whale song]] among [[humpback whales]]. Payne later became an important figure in the worldwide campaign to end [[whaling|commercial whaling]].

==History==
Payne was born in [[New York, New York]], and received his BA degree at [[Harvard University]] and his Ph.D. at [[Cornell]]. He spent the early years of his career studying [[animal echolocation#Bats|echolocation]] in [[bat]]s (and how their food, [[moth]]s, avoid them) and [[Sound localization|auditory localization]] in [[owls]]. Desiring to work with something more directly linked to conservation he later focused his research on [[whales]] where, together with researcher Scott McVay, in 1967 they discovered the complex sonic arrangements performed by the male humpback whales during the [[breeding season]].

Payne describes the whale songs as "exuberant, uninterrupted rivers of sound" with long repeated "themes", each song lasting up to 30 minutes and sung by an entire group of male humpbacks at once. The songs would be varied slightly between each breeding season, with a few new phrases added on and a few others dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whaletrust.org/what-we-do/humpback-whale-research/whale-song/song-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;  Payne has led many expeditions on the world's oceans studying whales, their migrations, cultures and vocalizations.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;https://www.pbs.org/odyssey/odyssey/roger_payne.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne was also the first to suggest [[fin whale]]s and [[blue whale]]s can communicate with sound across whole oceans, a theory since confirmed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some of Payne's recordings were released in 1970 as an [[LP album|LP]] called ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'' (still the best-selling nature sound record of all time&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;) which helped to gain momentum for the Save the Whales movement seeking to end [[commercial whaling]], which at the time was pushing many species dangerously close to [[extinction]]. Commercial whaling was finally banned by the [[International Whaling Commission]] in 1986.

In 1975 a second LP was released, and in 1987 Payne collaborated with musician [[Paul Winter]] putting whalesong to human music.

Whale recordings by Frank Watlington (with commentary by Roger Payne) were released on a [[Flexi disc]] soundsheet inside the January 1979 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine. This issue, at 10.5 million copies, became the largest single press run of any record at the time.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/radiox/humpback/hw_archive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723011927/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/radiox/humpback/hw_archive.html |archivedate=2015-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to whale recordings Payne has also published books and worked with film crews on many [[television]] [[documentary]] productions and on the [[IMAX]] [[movie]] ''Whales: An Unforgettable Journey''.

In 1971, Payne founded [[Ocean Alliance]], a [[501(c)3]] organization working with whale and ocean conservation. It is based in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].  He still heads the organization.  He was also an [[assistant professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Rockefeller University]] and, concurrently, a research [[zoologist]] at the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior, run by [[Rockefeller University]] and the [[New York Zoological Society]].&lt;ref name=WhoWho&gt;"Roger Searle Payne."

From 1960-1985 Roger Payne was married to noted elephant researcher [[Katharine Payne]], who performed similar research on the vocalizations of elephants (and Humpbacks).&lt;ref&gt;http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/8903200609/rap-songs-from-deep&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influence==
*Singer [[Judy Collins]] released her best-selling album ''[[Whales &amp; Nightingales]]'' in 1970, which featured some of Roger's whale recordings on the track "Farewell to Tarwathie."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richieunterberger.com/whales.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Also in 1970 composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] composed [[And God Created Great Whales]], the score for which calls for excerpts from Payne's recordings
*In 1977 Roger Payne's [[Whale vocalization|recordings of Humpback whales]] were included in the [[Voyager Golden Record]] carried aboard the [[Voyager program]] spacecraft, the first human artifacts to leave our [[Solar System]].
*Singer [[Kate Bush]]'s debut album ''[[The Kick Inside]]'' in 1978 features a portion of 'slowed-down solo whale' (from ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'') as an intro to the opening track "[[Moving (Kate Bush song)|Moving]]".
*[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] (1986) features Payne's recordings, in a plot about rescuing Humpback whales from extinction by moving a breeding pair from 1986 to three hundred years in the future.
*In 2010, the band [[Glass Wave]] included Payne's whale recordings in the first track ("Balena") and last track ("Moby Dick") of their album.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">'''Russell T. McCutcheon''' is a Canadian scholar with a Ph.D. in religious studies from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1995. He is a professor and was department chair from 2001-2009 at the [[University of Alabama]]. He was one of the editors of the quarterly periodical ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 1997-2001''. In 2005, McCutcheon was elected President of the Council of Societies for the Study of Religion (CSSR), headquartered at [[Rice University]]. He is the founder and series editor for the anthology series, ''Critical Categories in the Study of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/Critical-Categories-in-the-Study-of-Religion/book-series/TFSE00054 ''Critical Categories in the Study of Religion''] accessed June 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been noted for a controversy concerning methodology in the field of Religious Studies.  This controversy centered on a rather polemical exchange between McCutcheon and Dr. [[Robert A. Orsi]], who held a teaching position at [[Harvard University]] and [[Harvard Divinity School]], with Orsi referring to McCutcheon's book, ''The Discipline of Religion'', as "chilling". Orsi also made the comment, "the assumption appears to be that the scholar of religion by virtue of his or her normative epistemology, theoretical acuity, and political knowingness, has the authority and the right to make the lives of others the objects of his or her scrutiny. He or she theorizes them." McCutcheon responded with a paper included in the [[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]] entitled, "It's a Lie. There's No Truth in It! It's a Sin!: On the Limits of the Humanistic Study of Religion and the Costs of Saving Others from Themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_american_academy_of_religion/v074/74.3mccutcheon01.html ""It's a Lie.

[[File:Soweto township.jpg|thumb|Shanty town in [[Soweto]], South Africa, 2005]]

A '''shanty town''' or '''squatter area''' is a settlement of improvised housing which is known as shanties or [[shack]]s, made of [[plywood]], [[corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated metal]], sheets of plastic, and cardboard boxes. Such settlements are usually found on the periphery of cities, in public parks, or near railroad tracks, rivers, lagoons or city [[landfill|trash dump]] sites. Sometimes called a squatter, [[housing#Informal housing in developing countries|or spontaneous settlement]], a typical shanty town often lacks adequate infrastructure, including proper sanitation, safe water supply, electricity, hygienic streets, or other basic necessities to support human settlements.

Shanty towns are mostly found in [[Developing country|developing nations]], but also in some parts of developed nations.&lt;ref name=ta2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/6147072/Greek-immigration-crisis-spawns-shanty-towns-and-squats.html Greek immigration crisis spawns shanty towns and squats] Nick Squires and Paul Anast, The Telegraph, (September 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/150824559/showdown-looms-over-europes-largest-shantytown Showdown Looms Over Europe's Largest Shantytown] LAUREN FRAYER, National Public Radio (Washington DC), April 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Müllgebiet Ezbet Al Nakhl.jpg|thumb|Shanty towns sometimes have an active [[informal economy]], such as garbage sorting, pottery making, textiles, and leather works. This allows the poor to earn an income. The above shanty town image is from Ezbet Al Nakhl, in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where garbage is sorted manually. Residential area is visible at the top of the image.]]
Since construction is informal and unguided by urban planning, there is typically no formal [[grid plan|street grid]], house numbers, or named streets. Such settlements also lack some or all basic public services such as a sewage network, [[electric power|electricity]], safe running water, rain water drainage, garbage removal, access to public transport, or insect and disease control services. Even if these resources are present, they are likely to be disorganized, unreliable, and poorly maintained. Shanty towns also tend to lack basic services present in more formally organized settlements, including policing, mail delivery, medical services, and fire fighting. Fires are a particular danger for shanty towns not only for the lack of fire fighting stations and the difficulty fire trucks have traversing the settlement in the absence of formal street grids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2009/07/04/ccs_art_solo-tres-unidades-d_1460015.shtml|title=Sólo tres unidades de bomberos atienden 2 mil barrios de Petare|author=Jorge Hernández|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because of the high density of buildings and flammability of materials used in construction.&lt;ref&gt;See the report on shack fires in South Africa by Matt Birkinshaw [http://abahlali.org/files/Big_Devil_Politics_of_Shack_Fire.pdf] as well as the wider collection of articles in fires in shanty towns at [http://www.abahlali.org/taxonomy/term/841]&lt;/ref&gt; A sweeping fire on the hills of [[Shek Kip Mei]], Hong Kong, in late 1953 left 53,000 dwellers homeless, prompting the colonial government to institute a resettlement estate system.

Shanty towns have high rates of [[crime]], [[suicide]], [[recreational drug use|drug use]], and [[disease]]. However, Swiss journalist [[Georg Gerster]] has noted (with specific reference to the ''invasões'' of [[Brasilia]]) that "squatter settlements [as opposed to [[Slum|slums]]], despite their unattractive building materials, may also be places of hope, scenes of a counter-culture, with an encouraging potential for change and a strong upward impetus".&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Gerster]], ''Flights of Discovery: The Earth from Above'', 1978, London: Paddington, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stewart Brand]] has also written, more recently, that "squatter cities are [[environmentally friendly|Green]]. They have maximum density—a million people per square mile in Mumbai—and minimum energy and material use. People get around by foot, bicycle, rickshaw, or the universal [[shared taxi]] ... Not everything is efficient in the slums, though. In the Brazilian favelas where electricity is stolen and therefore free, Jan Chipchase from Nokia found that people leave their lights on all day. In most slums recycling is literally a way of life." (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Brand, "[http://newurbannetwork.com/article/stewart-brand-new-urbanism-and-squatter-communities-13243 Stewart Brand on New Urbanism and squatter communities]", ''The New Urban Network'', reprinted from ''Whole Earth Discipline'', Penguin,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing countries===
Shanty towns are present in a number of countries. The largest shanty town in Asia is [[Orangi]] in [[Karachi]], Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/5-biggest-slums-world-381338 5 biggest slums in the world] Daniel Tovrov, IB Times (December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[francophone]] countries, shanty towns are referred to as ''[[wikt:bidonville#French|bidonvilles]]'' (French for "can town" - can being a reference to tin metal); such countries include [[Tunisia]] and [[Haiti]]. Other countries with shanty towns include [[South Africa]] (where they are often called ''[[Township (South Africa)|Townships]]'') or Imijondolo, [[Kenya]] (including the [[Kibera]] and [[Mathare]] slums), the [[Philippines]] (often called ''squatter areas''), [[Venezuela]] (where they are known as [[barrio]]s), Brazil ([[favela]]s), [[Argentina]] ([[villas miseria]]), [[West Indies]] such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] (where they are known as shanty towns), and [[Peru]] (where they are known as [[pueblos jóvenes|"young towns"]]). There is also a major shanty town population in countries such as [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isuh.org/download/dhaka.pdf|title=ISUH home|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=1419&amp;section=insight Demolitions limit slum villages to city outskirts.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502012550/http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=1419&amp;section=insight |date=2009-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200509/09/eng20050909_207472.html|title=People's Daily Online -- "Slums" sting Chinese cities, hamper building of harmonious society|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article288 Jane Kelly, Review: Planet of Slums, by Mike Davis, Verso, 2006, £15.99.

===Developed countries===
Although shanty towns are less common in [[developed country|developed countries]], there are some cities that have them. While shanty towns are less common in Europe, the growing influx of immigrants have fueled shantytowns in cities commonly used as a point of entry into the EU, including [[Athens]] and [[Patras]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/6147072/Greek-immigration-crisis-spawns-shanty-towns-and-squats.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first1=Nick |last1=Squires |first2=Paul |last2=Anast |title=Greek immigration crisis spawns shanty towns and squats |date=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Madrid]], Spain, a low-class neighborhood named [[Cañada Real]] (which is considered a shanty town) has no formal education system, professional nurseries or modern health clinics and is considered the largest slum in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/in-spains-heart-a-slum-to-shame-europe-6268652.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alasdair |last=Fotheringham |title=In Spain's heart, a slum to shame Europe |date=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, shanty towns known as "barracas" or "bairros de lata" are made up of immigrants from former Portuguese African colonies and [[Romani People|Roma]] from Eastern Europe. Most of them are located in [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]]. In the United States, some cities such as [[Newark, New Jersey#Poverty and lack of investment|Newark]] and [[Oakland#Demographics|Oakland]] have witnessed the creation of [[Tent city|tent cities]]. Other settlements in developed countries that are comparable to shanty towns include the [[Colonia (United States)|Colonias]] near the border with Mexico, and [[poverty in France#Bidonvilles|bidonvilles in France]], which may exist in the peripheries of some cities.

In some cases, shanty towns can persist in gentrified areas that local governments have yet to redevelop, or in regions of political dispute. Examples of this include [[Ras Khamis]] in Israel and the [[Kowloon Walled City]] in Hong Kong.

==Development==
[[File:Shanty housing in Hong Kong.jpeg|thumb|Shanty towns may be large or small settlements. Above shanty town is in [[Hong Kong]].]]
While most shanty towns begin as precarious establishments haphazardly thrown together without basic social and civil services, over time, some have undergone a certain amount of development. Often the residents themselves are responsible for the major improvements.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohaforum.org/2011/08/16/some-young-towns-in-lima-not-so-young-anymore/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823044812/http://cohaforum.org/2011/08/16/some-young-towns-in-lima-not-so-young-anymore/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 August 2011|title=Some "Young Towns" in Lima Not So Young Anymore|publisher=COHA Staff|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community organizations sometimes working alongside [[NGO]]s, private companies, and the government, set up connections to the municipal water supply, pave roads, and build local schools.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"/&gt; Some of these shanties have become middle class [[suburbs]]. One such extreme example is the [[Los Olivos District|Los Olivos]] Neighborhood of [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. Chameh is, one of Lima's largest, along with [[gated communities]], [[casino]]s, and even plastic surgery clinics, are just a few of many developments that have transformed what used to be a decrepit shanty.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"/&gt; A few Brazilian [[favelas]] have also seen improvements in recent years, enough so to attract tourists who flock to catch a glimpse of the colorful lifestyle perched atop [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/megacities/2011/05/16/favela-tourism-provides-entrepreneurial-opportunuties-in-rio/|title= Favela Tourism Provides Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Rio |work=Forbes |first=Felicity |last=Clarke |date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development occurs over a long period of time and newer towns still lack basic services. Nevertheless, there has been a general trend whereby shanties undergo gradual improvements, rather than relocation to even more distant parts of a metropolis and replacement by [[gated communities]] constructed over their ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1324/87|title=Informality: Re-Viewing Latin American Cities|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shanty towns are starting to implement the use of [[composting toilets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/bill-gates-foundation-puts-money-on-solar-powered-toilet|title=Thomson Reuters Foundation|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416032241/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/bill-gates-foundation-puts-money-on-solar-powered-toilet|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[solar panels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5172|title=Youth Bring Low-Cost Solar Panels to Kenyan Slum|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the people living in slums may have access to cell phones and even the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/oct/17/itforschools.schools5 |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=IT for schools, Schools, Education, Technology, UK news, Online learning e-learning (Education) |date=May 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of all this, inequality associated with shanty towns has only increased over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN study says wealth gap in Latin America increases- A study by the United Nations suggests the gap between the rich and the poor in much of Latin America is widening.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19339636|accessdate=6 January 2013 |work=BBC News|date=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Jakarta slumlife66.JPG|thumb|A shanty town in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]
Shanty is probably from Canadian French ''chantier'', a winter station established for the organization of lumberjacks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible derivation is from the [[Irish language]] ''sean tí'' meaning ''old house''.

Hutment means an "encampment of huts". When the term is used by the military, it means "temporary living quarters specially built by the army for soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hutment |title=Hutment |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also a synonym for shanty town, particularly in [[developing country|developing countries]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Sigma''' (Science in General Management) was a [[limited company]] established by [[Henry Novy]], [[Stafford Beer]] and [[Roger Eddison]] in 1961. It sold [[operational research]] OR in the [[United Kingdom]] and overseas. Beer was responsible for the cybernetic models of organisation and corporate planning which were the firm's specially. Eddison was the Operations Director.

The consultancy arose following discussions between the Société d’Économie et de Mathématiques Appliquées (SEMA) and Martech Consultants Limited. Novy, who ran Maretch, was given the job of selecting the people to run the company, inviting several OR practitioners to come to Paris for an interview. After he selected Beer, Beer only agreed if Eddison would also join him. This was arranged and the company was launched with a reception at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in October 1961.&lt;ref name="Beer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beer |first1=Stafford |title=Roger Tatham Eddison: an appreciation |journal=Journal of the Operational Research Society |date=August 2000 |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=1004–1007 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600989 |accessdate=29 September 2018 |language=en |issn=0160-5682}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Over the next five years Sigma developed into a substantial organisation providing services to several leading companies across the UK as well as for six government departments. It also took on contracts in the United States and several developing countries. Amongst the diverse areas it worked in were energy, for the [[Gas Council]], transportation, for [[British Rail]] and the [[Port of London Authority]], shipbuilding, for the [[Geddes Committee]], education for [[Yugoslavia]], tourism, for [[Israel]], nationalised industry in South America, and distribution for a variety of industrial firms.&lt;ref name="GCF"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cabezas Fuentealba|first1=Guido|title=Beer|url=http://www.oocities.org/gicabezas/Beer.html|website=www.oocities.org|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sigma, Martech, and Proplan were amalgamated to form what afterwards became the Metra Consulting Group in the United Kingdom.

[[File:Statement von GS Kyrle zur Befreiung der Jemen Geiseln (8724149668).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public figures use [[press conference]]s so often as a way to control the timing and specificity of their messages to the media that press conference facilities have been nicknamed "[[spin room]]s".]]
In [[public relations]] and [[politic]]s, '''spin''' is a form of [[propaganda]], achieved through providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to persuade [[public opinion]] in favor or against some organization or public figure. While traditional public relations and [[advertising]] may also rely on altering the presentation of the facts, "spin" often implies the use of [[Wikt:disingenuous|disingenuous]], [[deceptive]], and highly [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html The Spinner Spun]", ''New York Times'', December 22, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the frequent association between spin and [[press conference]]s (especially [[government]] press conferences), the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a "[[spin room]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Powell. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/us/politics/22scene.html "Tit for Tat on a Night Where Spin Is Master,"] ''New York Times.'' February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations advisors, pollsters and media [[consultant]]s who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as "'''spin doctors'''" or "'''spinmeisters'''".

As such, a standard tactic used in "spinning" is to reframe, reposition, or otherwise modify the perception of an issue or event, to reduce any negative impact it might have on public opinion. For example, a company whose top-selling product is found to have a significant safety problem may "reframe" the issue by criticizing the safety of its main competitor's products or indeed by highlighting the risk associated with the entire product category. This might be done using a "catchy" [[slogan]] or [[sound bite]] that can help to persuade the public of the company's biased [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. This tactic could enable the company to defocus the public's attention on the negative aspects of its product. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

As it takes experience and training to "spin" an issue, spinning is typically a service provided by paid media advisors and media [[consultant]]s. The largest and most powerful companies may have in-house employees and sophisticated units with expertise in spinning issues. While spin is often considered to be a private sector tactic, in the 1990s and 2000s, some politicians and political staff have been accused by their opponents of using deceptive "spin" tactics to manipulate public opinion or deceive the public. Spin approaches used by some political teams include "burying" potentially negative new information by releasing it at the end of the workday on the last day before a long weekend; selectively [[cherry-picking]] quotes from previous speeches made by their employer or an opposing politician to give the impression that they advocate a certain position; and purposely [[News leak|leaking]] [[misinformation]] about an opposing politician or candidate that casts them in a negative light.{{cn|date=June 2017}}


== History ==
[[Edward Bernays]] has been called the "Father of Public Relations". As [[Larry Tye]] describes in his book ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and The Birth of [[Public Relations]]'', Bernays was able to help [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] companies use techniques to make certain behaviors more socially acceptable in 20th-century United States. Tye claims that Bernays was proud of his work as a propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Stauber, John and Sheldon Rampton. [http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html  "Book Review: ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays &amp; The Birth of PR'' by Larry Tye,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121185416/http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html |date=2008-11-21 }} ''PR Watch'' (Second Quarter 1999). Vol. 6, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As information technology has increased dramatically since the end of the 20th century, commentators like [[Joe Trippi]] have advanced the theory that modern [[Internet activism]] spells the end for political spin. By providing immediate counterpoint to every point a "spin doctor" can come up with, this theory suggests, the omnipresence of the Internet in some societies will inevitably lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of spin.&lt;ref&gt;Branigan, Tania, "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/13/newmedia.egovernment Internet spells end for political spin, says US web guru]", ''[[The Guardian]]''. 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
The techniques of spin include:
*[[File:Picking Cherries.jpg|alt=Cherry picking as a farming and a public relations practice.|thumb|Cherry picking is a practice of using selective facts to present to the public. It refers to the farming practice of picking only ripe cherries. ]]Selectively presenting facts and quotes that support one's position ("[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]"). For example, a pharmaceutical company could pick and choose two trials where their product shows a positive effect, ignoring hundreds of unsuccessful trials, or a politician's staff could handpick short speech quotations from past years which appear to show their candidate's support for a certain position.
* [[Non-denial denial]]
* [[Non-apology apology]]
* "[[Mistakes were made]]" is an example of [[distancing language]] commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was managed by using low-quality or inappropriate handling but evades any direct admission or accusation of responsibility by not specifying the person or organization who made the mistakes. Grammatically, the expression uses the [[English passive voice|passive voice]] to focus on the action while omitting the actor. The acknowledgement of "mistakes" is framed in an abstract sense, with no direct reference to who made the mistakes. The speaker neither accepts personal responsibility nor accuses anyone else. The word "mistakes" also does not imply intent. A less evasive [[active voice]] construction would place the focus on the actor, such as: "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." 
* Phrasing in a way that [[Begging the question|assumes unproven claims]], or [[avoiding the question]]&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html Are these examples of political spin?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815015401/http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html |date=2012-08-15 }}". ''[[BBC Learning Zone]]''. Clip 7265. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Burying bad news": announcing unpopular things at a time when it is believed that the media will focus on other news. In some cases, governments have released potentially controversial reports on summer long weekends, to avoid significant news coverage. Sometimes that "other news" is supplied by deliberately announcing popular items at the same time.
* Misdirection and diversion&lt;ref name=weissman&gt;Weissman, Jerry. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-weissman/spin-versus-topspin_b_218103.html Spin vs. Topspin]". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. 19 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Limited hangout]]

For years, businesses have used fake or misleading [[Testimonial#Customer testimonials|customer testimonials]] by editing/spinning customers to reflect a much more satisfied experience than was actually the case. In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] updated their laws to include measures to prohibit this type of "spinning" and have been enforcing these laws as of late. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

Several companies that verify the authenticity of the testimonials businesses present on the marketing materials in an effort to convince one to become a customer have arisen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://business.trustedcompany.com/blog/en/testimonials-vs-verified-reviews/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Bordeaux''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Université de Bordeaux'') was founded in 1441 in France. In 1970, the University was split up in four separate universities. It was reestablished on 1 January 2014 from the merger of three of the new universities: [[University of Bordeaux 1|Bordeaux 1]], [[Bordeaux Segalen University|Victor Segalen University (Bordeaux 2)]], and [[Montesquieu University - Bordeaux IV|Montesquieu University (Bordeaux 4)]]. The University of Bordeaux is part of the [[Community of universities and higher education institutions of Aquitaine]].

== History ==
The original ''Université de Bordeaux'' was established by the papal bull of [[Pope Eugene IV]] on 7 June 1441 when Bordeaux was an English town. The initiative for the creation of the university is attributed to Archbishop [[Pey Berland]]. It was originally composed of four faculties: arts, medicine, law, and theology. The law faculty later split into faculties of civil law and canon law. A professorship in mathematics was founded in 1591 by Bishop [[François de Foix]], son of Gaston de Foix, [[Earl of Kendal]].

This university was disestablished in 1793, and then was re-founded on 10 July 1896.

In 1970 the university was split into three universities: Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux 2, and Bordeaux 3. In 1995, Bordeaux 4 split off from Bordeaux 1.

In 2007 the universities were grouped together as ''[[Community of universities and higher education institutions of Aquitaine|Communauté d'universités et établissements d'Aquitaine]]''

From 1 January 2014, the university of Bordeaux were reunited, except for [[Bordeaux Montaigne University|Bordeaux 3]] which chose not to take part to the merger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-bordeaux.fr/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''von Karman Institute for [[Fluid Dynamics]]''' (VKI) is a non-profit educational and scientific organization which specializes in three specific fields: aeronautics and aerospace, environment and applied fluid dynamics, turbomachinery and propulsion. Founded in 1956, it is located in [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], Belgium.

==About VKI==
&lt;!--[[File: VKI Building.jpg|thumb|left|VKI Building]]--&gt;
The von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics is a non-profit international, educational and scientific organization which is working in three specific fields: ''[[aeronautics]] and [[aerospace]], environment and applied fluid dynamics, [[turbomachinery]] and [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]''.

The VKI provides education in these specific areas for students from all over the world. A hundred students come to the Institute each year to study fluid dynamics, for a PhD programme, a research master in Fluid Dynamics, a final year project and also to gather further knowledge while doing a work placement in a specific area. 
 
Each year, Lecture Series and events are being organized inside and outside of the organization. These events emphasize on topics of great importance such as aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer with application to aeronautics, space, turbomachinery, the environment and also industrial fluid dynamics. The Institute has built an international renown in these domains. Students who study these fields, researchers, industrials and engineers want to follow these Lecture Series. The information presented is accurate and reliable.

==History==
In the course of 1955, Professor [[Theodore von Kármán]] proposed with his assistants the establishment of an institution devoted to training and research in aerodynamics which would be open to young engineers and scientists of the [[NATO]] nations. It was strongly felt that this form of international undertaking would fulfil the important objective of fostering fruitful exchanges and understanding between the participating nations in a well-defined technical field. 

The von Karman Institute was established in October 1956 in the buildings which formed what then was the aeronautical laboratory of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Belgian Ministry of Communications.

The history of the laboratory goes back to 1922 when, on farmland purchased by the Belgian Government, the first building was erected to house the STAé (Service Technique de l'Aéronautique), i.e. the technical services of the Civil Aviation Authority then under the Ministry of Defence. The building was designed to accommodate a large low speed wind tunnel of the [[Gustave Eiffel#Later career|Eiffel]] type with an open return circuit and open-jet test section of 2 m diameter, as well as offices and shops. It still exists and has been refurbished internally after removal of the low speed tunnel to make room for modern turbomachinery and high speed facilities. A second building was added in 1935 to house offices and laboratories. It is now the Institute's administrative building. The last addition was made after the war, in 1949, with the construction of a large building specially designed to house a supersonic tunnel and a multi-configuration low speed facility.

It is interesting to recall what had been recommended by the AGARD Study Group of 1955 in terms of training and research: “The Institute should aim toward a training which, apart from its direct and obvious ties with aeronautical industries, would be of value in wider areas such as industrial or scientific research where the application of experimental techniques of aerodynamics would be profitable''.

In 1957, to celebrate the first anniversary of the institution, Theodore von Kármán began the event which would become known as the "beer meeting". At the end of this historic event, von Kármán declared that "the beer meeting must take place every Wednesday, beginning at 17:30 sharp".

==Structure==
There are three departments which are hosted at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics, from the older to the younger:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:plasma2.jpg|thumb|right|Plasma]] --&gt;
* '''Aeronautics and Aerospace'''
A wide spectrum of facilities and computational tools covers the flow range from the low-speed regime of commercial aircraft to the supersonic and hypersonic regime of atmospheric space entry. The department focuses in particular on the modeling, simulation and experimental validation of atmospheric entry flows and thermal protection systems (TPS), including transition to turbulence and stability. The experimental studies are carried out in its top level Mach 14, Mach 6 and Induction Coupled Plasma windtunnels, for which dedicated measuring techniques have been developed e.g. involving spectroscopic laser techniques. On the computational simulation side the department has developed an extendable software platform [[Coolfluid]] for high performance computational flow simulation which incorporates the research on numerical algorithms, advanced physico-chemical and plasma models as well as fluid-structure interaction and conjugate heat transfer.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: Turbomachinery VKI.jpg|thumb|left|Turbomachinery]] --&gt;
* '''Turbomachinery &amp; Propulsion'''
The [[Turbomachinery]] and [[Air propulsion|Propulsion]] department specializes in the aero-thermal aspects of turbomachinery components for aero-engines and industrial gas turbines, space propulsion units, steam turbines and process industry compressors and pumps. It has accumulated wide skills in high speed wind tunnel testing and related measurement techniques development and application. The department has acquired a world recognised expertise on steady/unsteady aerodynamic and aero/thermal aspects of high pressure, including cooling, and low pressure turbomachinery components through the design, development and use of a number of unique wind tunnels.

On the computational side, the department has over 20 years of experience in the analysis of flow in turbomachines, and in the design techniques and multi-disciplinary optimization methods or their components.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Station Polaire.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Station]] --&gt;
* '''Environmental and applied Fluid Dynamics'''
The [[Environmental science|Environmental]] and Applied [[Fluid Dynamics]] (EA) department covers all kinds of activities complementary to the other two departments related to fluid dynamics in the academic and industrial world.  It has a large expertise in the study of aeroacoustics, multiphase flows, vehicle aerodynamics, biological  flows and environmental flows (including the study of interaction between atmospheric winds and human activities).  The department is also involved in the modeling of turbulence and in the development of advanced measurement techniques for fluid dynamics.  The department has acquired a unique expertise in the  study of fluid dynamics in industrial processes, with the development and construction of experimental facilities dedicated to the study of industrial  processes and also in the simulation of industrial flows using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) codes.

==Lecture series==
The VKI organises up to twelve different one-week Lecture Series with about 50 to 60 participants on specialized topics every year on various fields: industrial applications, [[turbomachinery]], [[aerospace]], [[aerodynamics]], [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]], [[aero engine]], [[aeroacoustics]], biological flows, [[large eddy simulation]].
Each year, the VKI also organises thematic conferences in collaboration with Belgian &amp; foreign universities and research institutes.

These courses have gained worldwide recognition. Subjects are chosen carefully and the lecturers are well known for their professionalism and excellency in specific fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">A '''water eductor''' or '''water dredge''' is an [[eductor-jet pump]]-based tool used by [[underwater archaeology|underwater archaeologists]] to remove sediments from an underwater archaeological site.  [[airlift (dredging device)|Airlift]]s may be used for the same purpose.

[[Image:Water dredge.jpg|thumb|Archaeologists preparing a water dredge on a shallow site]]
It consists of a large bore straight tube to which is attached a hose pipe through which clean water is [[pump]]ed.  The [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli effect]] from the flow of pumped water causes suction at the mouth of the dredge.  Water and sediment are sucked from the excavation site and released from the far end of the tube.  The tube can be made of any rigid material such as [[steel]] or [[plastic]].  The diameter of the tube depends on the power available from the pump and whether delicate work is required.

In the hands of a trained archaeologist, the water dredge performs the same function as a wheelbarrow on land.  It is used to carry away sediments, not to dig holes.  The archaeologist dislodges the material using a trowel, brush or by making a fanning motion with the hand to cause a current to dislodge sediment.  The archaeologist can also place overburden material directly into the mouth of the dredge.  As the water dredge will remove particles held in suspension in the water, provided it is used correctly it will improve visibility in the immediate area of the excavation.  Careful use of the water dredge ensures that artifacts can be recorded in [[archaeological context|context]] and [[feature (archaeology)|features]] and [[stratigraphy]] can be studied.

Using a water dredge or airlift, the underwater archaeologist has an advantage over terrestrial counterparts, as the spoil is removed without effort and without needing to be transported across other parts of the archaeological site.

Where there is a possibility of small [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] being missed because of poor visibility, a trap may be used at the outlet so that the lifted sediment can be filtered.

Water eductors are also used by marine treasure hunters to suck sediments for filtering for buried artifacts.  Using the water dredge to directly suck sediments means that archaeological information on context and [[stratigraphy]] is not recorded.

An eductor can also form part of a [[wet scrubber]] system which are designed to remove soluble gases and particulate by inducing a gas flow using high pressure liquid focused into a [[Venturi tube#Venturi tubes|venturi]] throat. Additionally, eductor scrubbers can be used for direct-contact condensation.

The '''Wolfram Demonstrations Project''' is an organized, open-source&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/issues/v40_1/2.htm Interactive Economic Models from the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Journal of Economic Education.&lt;/ref&gt; collection of small (or medium-size) interactive programs called Demonstrations, which are meant to visually and interactively represent ideas from a range of fields. It is hosted by [[Wolfram Research]], whose stated goal is to bring computational exploration to the widest possible audience.  At its launch, it contained 1300 demonstrations&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/product/P000002568 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] CERN Courier June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but has grown to over 10,000. The site won a [[Parents' Choice Award]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=24826&amp;StepNum=1 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Parents Choice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- May 2012--&gt;

==Technology==
The Demonstrations run in ''[[Mathematica]]'' 6 or above and in ''[[CDF Player|Wolfram CDF Player]]'' which is a free modified version of Wolfram's ''Mathematica'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_05_02_07.html Math Games] MAA Online, May 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificcomputing.com/Adventures-with-the-Wolfram-Demonstrations-Project.aspx Adventures with the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] John Wass, Scientific Computing&lt;/ref&gt; and can operate as a web browser plugin.

They typically consist of a very direct user interface to a graphic or visualization, which dynamically recomputes in response to user actions such as moving a slider, clicking a button, or dragging a piece of graphics. Each Demonstration also has a brief description of the concept.

Demonstrations are now easily embeddable into any website or blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaurov|first=Vitaliy|title=Add a Wolfram Demonstration to Your Site in One Easy Step|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/04/24/add-a-wolfram-demonstration-to-your-site-in-one-easy-step/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Demonstration page includes a snippet of JavaScript code in the Share section of the sidebar.

==Topics==
The website is organized by topic: for example, science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/molecular-wolfram-demonstrations.html Molecular Wolfram Demonstrations] ScienceBase&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics, computer science, art, biology, and finance. They cover a variety of levels, from elementary school mathematics to much more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and models of biological organisms.  The site is aimed at both educators and students, as well as researchers who wish to present their ideas to the broadest possible audience.

==Process==
Wolfram Research's staff organizes and edits the Demonstrations, which may be created by any user of ''Mathematica'', then freely published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific-computing.com/education/archives/29 Throwing beanbags in Mathematica 6], Scientific Computing, May 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and freely downloaded. The Demonstrations are open-source, which means that they not only demonstrate the concept itself but also show how to implement it.

==Alternatives==
The use of the web to transmit small interactive programs is reminiscent of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Java applet]]s, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], and the open-source [[Processing (programming language)|processing]]. However, those creating Demonstrations have access to the algorithmic and visualization capabilities of ''Mathematica'' making it more suitable for technical demonstrations. 

The Demonstrations Project also has similarities to user-generated content websites like [[Wikipedia]] and [[Flickr]].  Its business model is similar to Adobe's [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat]] and Flash strategy of charging for development tools but providing a free reader.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

The '''World Register of Marine Species''' ('''WoRMS''') is a [[database]] that aims to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php |title=Towards a World Register of Marine Species |publisher=World Register of Marine Species |accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The content of the registry is edited and maintained by scientific specialists on each group of organism. These [[taxonomist]]s control the quality of the information, which is gathered from malacological journals and several regional and taxon-specific databases. WoRMS maintains valid names of all marine organisms, but also provides information on [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] and invalid names. It will be an ongoing task to maintain the registry, as new species are constantly being discovered and described by scientists. In addition, the nomenclature and taxonomy of existing species is often corrected or changed as new research is constantly being published.

==History==
WoRMS was founded in 2008 and grew out of the [[MarBEF Data System|European Register of Marine Species]] and the UNESCO-IOC Register of Marine Organisms (URMO), which was compiled by Jacob van der Land  (and several colleagues) at the National Museum of Natural History, Leiden &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/about.php|title=About|publisher=World Register of Marine Species|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily funded by the [[European Union]] and hosted by the [[Flanders Marine Institute]] in [[Ostend]], Belgium.  WoRMS has established formal agreements with several other biodiversity projects, including the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] and the [[Encyclopedia of Life]]. In 2008, WoRMS stated that it hoped to have an up-to-date record of all marine species completed by 2010, the year in which the [[Census of Marine Life]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14206-how-many-species-live-in-the-sea.html|title=How many species live in the sea? |date=2008-06-25 |author=Catherine Brahic|publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of February 2018, WoRMS contained listings for 480,931 marine species names (including synonyms) of which 240,633 are valid marine species (95 % checked). Their goal is to have a listing for each of the approximately more than 240,000 marine species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinespecies.org|title=WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species|publisher=World Register of Marine Species|accessdate=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costello|first1=MJ|last2=Bouchet|first2=P|last3=Boxshall|first3=GW|last4=Fauchald|first4=K|last5=Gordon|first5=DP|last6=et|first6=al.|title=Global coordination and standardisation in marine biodiversity through the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and related databases|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e51629|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051629|pmid=23505408|pmc=3541386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohamedeagle.jpg|thumb|Zoomorphic text]]
The word ''zoomorphism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ζωον (''zōon''), meaning "[[animal]]", and μορφη (''morphē''), meaning "shape" or "form". It can mean:
* Art that [[anthropomorphism|imagines humans as non-human animals]]&lt;ref&gt;Hope B. Werness, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in Art'',
Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004, px. {{ISBN|0-8264-1525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Art that portrays one species of animal like another species of animal
* Art that creates patterns using animal imagery, or [[animal style]]
* Deities depicted in animal form, such as exist in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]&lt;ref&gt;Simson R Najovits, ''Egypt, Trunk of the Tree: A Modern Survey of
an Ancient Land'', Algora Publishing, 2004, p 279. {{ISBN|0-87586-201-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Therianthropy]]: the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into animal form&lt;ref&gt;Gerina Dunwich, ''Wicca A to Z: A Modern Witch's Encyclopedia'', Kensington Pub Corp, 1998, p 155. {{ISBN|0-8065-1930-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attributing animal form or other animal characteristics to anything other than an animal; similar to but broader than [[anthropomorphism]]
* The tendency of viewing human behaviour in terms of the behaviour of animals, contrary to [[anthropomorphism]], which views animal or non-animal behaviour in human terms

==Examples==

===Zoomorphic representation in religion===
*The appearance of the [[Holy Spirit]] like a [[dove]] in the [[New Testament]] (The Gospel According to Luke 3: 22), "and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove..."  
*[[Mark the Evangelist]] as a [[lion]] in later Christian [[iconography]]. 
* The [[netjer|Egyptian gods]] were often depicted as zoomorphic or as [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]]
* The names of the two most prominent Hebrew Bible female prophets - Deborah and Huldah - were in the Babylonian Talmud interpreted in zoomorphic terms as "wasp" and "weasel."&lt;ref&gt;Blaženka Scheuer;  Animal Names for Hebrew Bible Female Prophets, ''Literature and Theology'', Volume 31, Issue 4, 1 December 2017, Pages 455–471, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/litthe/frx032&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoomorphic language for things, ideas===
*A literary phrase such as "The roar of the ocean".
*[[Christian views of sin|Sin]] lurking like a beast waiting to devour [[Cain]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Synthesis: bulletin du Comité national de littérature comparée / Comitetul Național pentru Literatură Comparată, Institutul de Istorie și Teorie Literară "G. Călinescu." - 2002 "Sin is personified as (an animal?) which "crouches" at the door of Cain (Gen 4:7). As [[Gerhard von Rad]] (Genesis, 105) remarks, 'The comparison of sin with a beast of prey lying before the door is strange, as is the purely decorative use "&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanity portrayed in evolutionary context===

[[Desmond Morris]] in [[The Naked Ape]] and [[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]], [[Robert Ardrey]] in [[African Genesis]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] in [[On Aggression]] all wrote from a [[sociobiological]] perspective. They viewed the human species as an animal, subject to the evolutionary law of [[Survival of the fittest]] through adaptation to the [[biophysical environment]].&lt;ref&gt; [[William Ickes]], ''Compatible and Incompatible Relationships'', Springer Verlag, 1985, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
*[[Fenrisulfr]], a wolf in Norse mythology
*[[Airavata]], the king god of elephants in Indian mythology.
* [[Paw feet]] [[bathtub]], with feet in the shape of a lion's paws
* The [[sphinx]] from the "[[Oedipus Rex]]" by [[Sophocles]]
* [[Elephantine Colossus]], a hotel
* In ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', the [[dinosaur]]s [[Dino Flintstone|Dino]] and "Rexy" behave and vocalize like [[dog]]s.
* [[Aslan]] in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] is a lion that is the king of Narnia
* Robotic pets, like [[AIBO]], modeled on dogs or other animals
* In 2010 [[city planner]]s from [[Southern Sudan]], which would become independent a year later, unveiled plans for the city center of its capital, [[Juba]], to be built in the shape of a [[rhinoceros]]. The city of [[Wau, South Sudan|Wau]] was to be transformed in the shape of a [[giraffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howden |first=Daniel |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/turn-left-at-the-horn-rhino-city-revealed-2056321.html |title=Turn left at the horn: 'Rhino City' revealed - Daniel Howden, '&amp;#39;9 August 2010'&amp;#39;.
