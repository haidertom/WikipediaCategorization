'''ASTRON''' is the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. Its main office is in [[Dwingeloo]] in the [[Dwingelderveld National Park]] in the province of Drenthe. ASTRON is part of  [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO).

==Goals==
ASTRON's main mission is to make discoveries in radio astronomy happen, via the development of new and innovative technologies, the operation of world-class radio astronomy facilities, and the pursuit of fundamental astronomical research. Engineers and astronomers at ASTRON have an outstanding international reputation for novel technology development, and fundamental research in galactic and extra-galactic astronomy. 

ASTRON's programme has three principal elements:
*The operation of front line observing facilities, including especially the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] and [[LOFAR]],
* The pursuit of fundamental astronomical research using ASTRON facilities, together with a broad range of other telescopes around the world and space-borne instruments (e.g. Sptizer, HST etc.)
*A strong technology development programme, encompassing both innovative instrumentation for existing telescopes and the new technologies needed for future facilities.

In addition, ASTRON is active in the international science policy arena and is one of the leaders in the international SKA project. The [[Square Kilometre Array]] will be the world’s largest and most sensitive radio telescope with a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre. The SKA will be built in Southern Africa and in Australia. It is a global enterprise bringing together 11 countries from the 5 continents.

==Observing facilities==
===Radio telescopes===
[[File:Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope WSRT (1357-59).jpg|thumb|[[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] in 2010]]
ASTRON operates the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] (WSRT), one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. The WSRT and [[LOFAR|the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT)]] are dedicated to explore the universe at radio frequencies from 8 GHz down to 10 MHz.

In addition to its use as a stand-alone radio telescope, the Westerbork array participates in the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) of radio telescopes.

ASTRON is the host institute for the [[Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe]] (JIVE). Its primary task is to operate the EVN MkIV VLBI Data Processor (correlator). JIVE also provides a high-level of support to astronomers and the Telescope Network. ASTRON also hosts the NOVA Optical/ Infrared instrumentation group.

==Technology development==
[[File:SKA site, South Africa 2014 45.jpg|thumb|right|Mid-frequency aperture array test site for the SKA, in South Africa]]
Discovery in astronomy goes hand in hand with innovation in technology. ASTRON pursues an proactive programme of technical development, aimed both at providing innovative instrumentation for use on current observing facilities, and at laying the groundwork for future generations of telescopes and signal processing instrumentation.

To these ends, the ASTRON facility in Dwingeloo maintains a well equipped R&amp;D division specializing in the design, prototyping and qualification of:
* Low noise, ambient and cryogenic radio receiver systems (0.2 - 345 GHz)
* Very high speed digital electronics
* Antennas, especially in the array environment
* Advanced instrumentation for use at optical and infrared wavelengths
* Algorithm and software engineering for instrument control and for imaging

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="859">In the [[sociology of religion]], [[Luc de Heusch]] coined the term '''adorcism''' for practices to placate or accommodate [[spiritual entities]] in a [[Spirit_possession|possessed]] person or place. Unlike [[exorcism]], the relationship with the entities is potentially positive. This is sometimes used as [[initiation]] into a spirit cult.&lt;ref&gt;Luc de Heusch. Cultes de possession et religions initiatiques de salut en Afrique. Annales du Centre d'etudes des Religions, ii. 226-44. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Oughourlian defines adorcism as "voluntary, desired, and curative possessions".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Oughourlian. The Puppet of Desire: The Psychology of Hysteria, Possession, and Hypnosis [Eugene Webb, trans. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1991], p. 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">'''Artificial empathy''' ('''AE''') is the development of AI systems − such as companion robots − that are able to detect and respond to human [[emotion]]s. According to scientists, although the technology can be perceived as scary or threatening by many people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Jan-Philipp Stein|author2=Peter Ohler|date=2017|title=Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind—The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716303055|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=160|pages=43–50|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2016.12.010|issn=0010-0277|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it could also have a significant advantage over humans in professions which are traditionally involved in emotional role-playing such as the health care sector.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Do Emotions Matter in the Ethics of Human-Robot Interaction? |work=Artificial Empathy and Companion Robots |author=Bert Baumgaertner |author2=Astrid Weiss |publisher=European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. 288146 (“HOBBIT”); and the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) under grant agreement T623-N23 (“V4HRC”) |url=http://doc.gold.ac.uk/aisb50/AISB50-S19/AISB50-S19-Baumgaertner-paper.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the care-giver perspective for instance, performing emotional labor above and beyond the requirements of paid labor often results in chronic stress or burnout, and the development of a feeling of being desensitized to patients. However, it is argued that the emotional role-playing between the care-receiver and a robot can actually have a more positive outcome in terms of creating the conditions of less fear and concern for one's own predicament best exemplified by the phrase: "if it is just a robot taking care of me it cannot be that critical." Scholars debate the possible outcome of such technology using two different perspectives. Either, the AE could help the socialization of care-givers, or serve as role model for emotional detachment.&lt;ref name="Baumgaertner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asada"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Affective Developmental Robotics |work=How can we design the development of artifcial empathy? |author=Minoru Asada |publisher=Dept. of Adaptive Machine Systems, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University |location=Osaka, Japan |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~kl360/HRI2014W/submission/S7.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of research ==
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Ethics of artificial intelligence}}
There are a variety of philosophical, theoretical, and applicative questions related to AE. For example:
# Which conditions would have to be met for a robot to respond competently to a human emotion?
# What models of empathy can or should be applied to Social and Assistive Robotics?
# Does the interaction of humans with robots have to imitate affective interaction between humans?
# Can a robot help science learn about affective development of humans?
# Would robots create unforeseen categories of inauthentic relations?
# What relations with robots can be considered truly authentic? &lt;ref name="Damiano"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Artificial Empathy: An Interdisciplinary Investigation |publisher=IJSR |work=Special issue |author=Luisa Damiano |author2=Paul Dumouchel |author3=Hagen Lehmann |url=http://www00.unibg.it/dati/persone/1931/7067-IJSR_Special_Issue_Damiano_et_al.pdf |format=PDF |via=direct download |date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics''' ('''CITA''') is a national [[research institute]] funded by the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council]], located at the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. CITA's mission is "to foster interaction within the Canadian theoretical [[Astrophysics]] community and to serve as an international center of excellence for theoretical studies in astrophysics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/reports/annrep/AnnRep01/|title = CITA Annual Report 2001|publisher = Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CITA was incorporated in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nserc.gc.ca/programs/real2000/submissions/gsc17a_e.htm|title = Reallocations Exercise: 2000-2002|publisher = National Science and Engineering Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CITA has close administrative and academic relations with the [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]] (CIFAR); several CITA faculty also serve as members of CIFAR.

==History==
The concept of a nationally-supported institute for theoretical astrophysics dates back to discussions within the [[Canadian Astronomical Society]] in the early 1980s. A series of committees advocated a model of a university‑based institute governed by a council of Canadian astrophysicists.  Proposals were solicited from universities across the country to host this institute, which by now had been named the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics/Institut Canadien d'astrophysique theorique (CITA/ICAT). The [[University of Toronto]] won the resulting spirited competition, and CITA ([[University of Toronto]]) was established as an institute within the School of Graduate Studies in June 1984, with staff consisting of a single professor ([[Peter G. Martin]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/news/cita_professor_peter_martin_elected_to_royal_society_of_canada|title = CITA Professor Peter Martin Elected to Royal Society of Canada|publisher = Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120722053248/http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/news/cita_professor_peter_martin_elected_to_royal_society_of_canada|archivedate = 2012-07-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the Acting Director and a visiting professor from [[Queen's University]] (Richard Henriksen) and a temporary administrative assistant.  Today there are 7 faculty members two of which are [[Canada Research Chairs]], two administrative staff, a Systems Manager and technical computing staff.

At the same time, Professor [[Richard Henriksen]] worked on establishing CITA, Inc. (a separate entity from CITA the institute at the University of Toronto) as an incorporated national institute and charity governed by an elected Council of Canadian astrophysics/relativity professors to promote research in theoretical astrophysics across the country.  CITA Council is selected from CITA Inc members.  There are presently 55 members of CITA, Inc.

CITA's research activities are supported by the [[University of Toronto]], [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|NSERC]], multiple grants by the Ontario and Federal governments, as well as private sponsors including the [[Simons Foundation]] and [[CIFAR]].

==Membership==
CITA has a small number of long-term faculty members, and a larger number of short term (3- or 5-year) postdoctoral positions, as well as an active visitor program; the purpose of the relatively high influx of new researchers or visitors is to ensure that timely topics are well represented at CITA.  There are currently approximately 20 postdoctoral researchers at CITA, and 4 full-time administrative and computer staff.  Several graduate students in the [[University of Toronto]] Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics or Department of Physics work with CITA researchers throughout their graduate work, and typically ten undergraduates come to CITA to work over the summer.

In 1985, Scott D. Tremaine came to CITA as its first Director; Margaret Fukunaga was hired as the permanent Business Officer and Richard Bond arrived as the second faculty member.  [[J. Richard Bond|Richard Bond]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/nsae-wca031407.php|title = World-leading cosmologist at University of Toronto wins Canada's most prestigious science prize|publisher = EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the Director in 1996 and Norman Murray was director 2006-2016.

Since 1984, the directors of the institute have been as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''City rhythm''' is a [[metaphor]] for the regular coming and going in [[city|cities]], the repetitive activities, the sounds and smells that occur regularly in cities. The recognition of city rhythms is a useful metaphor, helping to understand [[modernity|modern]] city life. The concept of city rhythm makes it possible to understand the multitude of aspects of city life. Traditional approaches to urban thinking focus on one such rhythm only, normally the dominant one. This leads to the omission of many aspects of city life.

''Dominant rhythm'' is a metaphor used in conjunction with city rhythm. It is the most powerful rhythm in a [[city]], enabling the shaping and forming of time and space, both within the city and in faraway places through [[city network|networks]].

These dominant rhythms are not fixed and indeed change. [[religion|Religious]] rhythms were more dominant in the past, whereas at present [[economics|economic]] rhythms prevail.

'''Clinical empathy''' is expressed as the skill of understanding what a patient says and feels, and effectively communicating this understanding to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Olson|first = Joanne K.|date = 1995-12-01|title = Relationships Between Nurse-Expressed Empathy, Patient-Perceived Empathy and Patient Distress|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1547-5069.1995.tb00895.x/abstract|journal = Image: the Journal of Nursing Scholarship|language = en|volume = 27|issue = 4|pages = 317–322|doi = 10.1111/j.1547-5069.1995.tb00895.x|issn = 1547-5069}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of clinical empathy is clinical detachment.

From a student's first year to their fourth year in medical school, empathy scores on the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (S-version) decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Daniel|last2=Lew|first2=Robert|last3=Hershman|first3=Warren|last4=Orlander|first4=Jay|date=2007-07-26|title=A Cross-sectional Measurement of Medical Student Empathy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=22|issue=10|pages=1434–1438|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x|issn=0884-8734|pmc=2305857|pmid=17653807}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both gender and specialty choice affect empathy scores, favoring women and [[primary care]] specialties.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Clinical empathy ==
Clinical empathy is a main component of the patient-provider relationship. It is seen as a commonly accepted pillar of professionalism for medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Veloski|first = J.

This contrasts the affective aspect of empathy which involves joining in the patient's emotional experiences and feelings, which correlates closer to sympathy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Empathetic physicians share understanding with patients, which serves to benefit the patient in their physical, mental and social well-being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Coastal Observatory''' in Liverpool Bay is housed at the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] in Brownlow Street
[[Liverpool]], [[England]].

== Objectives ==
The objective of the Coastal Observatory is to study a typical coastal sea's response both to natural forces and to the effects of human activity. The Observatory integrates real-time data measurements with data from models into a "pre-operational coastal prediction system"&lt;sup&gt;[http://cobs.pol.ac.uk/cobsadmin/about.html]&lt;/sup&gt; whose results will be displayed on the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site].

The concept is founded on obtaining data in real time, using telemetry, sending the data from underwater to the sea surface, to land, to the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] to the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site], enabling what is often known as 'armchair oceanography'.

The aim of the Coastal Observatory is to build a time series of data. The Observatory has a particular interest in such areas as storm surges, seasonality, and variations in river discharge, with an emphasis on the River Mersey.

== Measurements ==
August 2007 marked five years of continuous running of the Coastal Observatory in Liverpool Bay, taking measurements such as:
*In situ time series of current, temperature and salinity profiles and of waves and weather. A second site, and measurements of turbidity and chlorophyll are now also operational.
*The [http://www.cefas.co.uk/Products/smartbuoy.htm CEFAS SmartBuoy] for surface properties including nutrients and chlorophyll.
*Instrumented ferries for near surface temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll and later, nutrient data. The first route was Liverpool to Douglas (Isle of Man), with the ferry travelling between Birkenhead (Liverpool) and Dublin (Ireland)
*Drifters, measuring surface currents and properties such as temperature and salinity.
*Tide gauges, with sensors for meteorological, waves, temperature and salinity data, where appropriate.
*Meteorological data from HF radar and tide gauge sites.
*Shore-base HF radar measuring waves and surface currents out to a range of 50&amp;nbsp;km.
*Satellite data - infra-red (for [[sea surface temperature]]) and visible (for chlorophyll and suspended sediment) spectra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22319">'''Cognitive semantics''' is part of the [[cognitive linguistics]] movement. [[Semantics]] is the study of linguistic meaning. Cognitive semantics holds that language is part of a more general human [[Cognition|cognitive ability]], and can therefore only describe the world as people conceive of it.&lt;ref name=Croft&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author=Croft, William and D. Alan Cruse|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|pages=1,105,7–15,33–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=I6Z9H-eRSgoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is implicit that different linguistic communities conceive of simple things and processes in the world differently (different cultures), not necessarily some difference between a person's conceptual world and the real world (wrong beliefs).

The main tenets of cognitive semantics are:
* That grammar manifests a conception of the world held in a culture;
* That knowledge of language is acquired and contextual;
* That the ability to use language draws upon general cognitive resources and not a special [[language module]].&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

As part of the field of cognitive linguistics, the cognitive semantics approach rejects the traditional separation of [[linguistics]] into [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[pragmatics]], etc. Instead, it divides semantics into ''meaning-construction'' and ''knowledge representation''. Therefore, cognitive semantics studies much of the area traditionally devoted to [[pragmatics]] as well as [[semantics]]. 

The techniques native to cognitive semantics are typically used in [[lexicology|lexical]] studies such as those put forth by [[Leonard Talmy]], [[George Lakoff]], [[Dirk Geeraerts]], and [[Bruce Wayne Hawkins]]. Some cognitive semantic frameworks, such as that developed by Talmy, take into account syntactic structures as well.

== Points of contrast ==

As a field, semantics is interested in three big questions: what does it mean for units of language, called [[lexeme]]s, to have "meaning"? What does it mean for sentences to have meaning? Finally, how is it that meaningful units fit together to compose complete sentences? These are the main points of inquiry behind studies into [[lexical semantics]], [[structural semantics]], and theories of [[compositionality]] (respectively). In each category, traditional theories seem to be at odds with those accounts provided by cognitive semanticists.

Classic theories in semantics (in the tradition of [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]) have tended to explain the meaning of parts in terms of ''necessary and sufficient conditions'', sentences in terms of ''truth-conditions'', and composition in terms of ''[[propositional function]]s''. Each of these positions is tightly related to the others. According to these traditional theories, the meaning of a particular sentence may be understood as the conditions under which the proposition conveyed by the sentence hold true. For instance, the expression "snow is white" is true if and only if snow is, in fact, white. Lexical units can be understood as holding meaning either by virtue of [[Extension (semantics)|set of things]] they may apply to (called the "extension" of the word), or in terms of the [[Intension|common properties]] that hold between these things (called its "intension"). The intension provides an [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] with the necessary and sufficient conditions that let a thing qualify as a member of some lexical unit's extension. Roughly, propositional functions are those abstract instructions that guide the interpreter in taking the free variables in an [[open sentence]] and filling them in, resulting in a correct understanding of the sentence as a whole.

Meanwhile, cognitive semantic theories are typically built on the argument that lexical meaning is conceptual. That is, meaning is not necessarily reference to the entity or relation in some real or possible world. Instead, meaning corresponds with a concept held in the mind based on personal understanding. As a result, semantic facts like "All bachelors are unmarried males" are not treated as special facts about our language practices; rather, these facts are not distinct from encyclopaedic knowledge. In treating linguistic knowledge as being a piece with everyday knowledge, the question is raised: how can cognitive semantics explain paradigmatically semantic phenomena, like category structure? Set to the challenge, researchers have drawn upon theories from related fields, like [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive anthropology]]. One proposal is to treat in order to explain category structure in terms of ''nodes'' in a ''knowledge network''. One example of a theory from cognitive science that has made its way into the cognitive semantic mainstream is the theory of [[prototype theory|prototypes]], which cognitive semanticists generally argue is the cause of [[polysemy]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Cognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is unduly limited in its account of full sentence meaning. While they are not on the whole hostile to truth-conditional semantics, they point out that it has limited explanatory power. That is to say, it is limited to indicative sentences, and does not seem to offer any straightforward or intuitive way of treating (say) commands or expressions. By contrast, cognitive semantics seeks to capture the full range of [[grammatical mood]]s by also making use of the notions of framing and mental spaces.

Another trait of cognitive semantics is the recognition that meaning is not fixed but a matter of [[construal]] and conventionalization. The processes of linguistic construal, it is argued, are the same psychological processes involved in the processing of encyclopaedic knowledge and in perception. This view has implications for the problem of compositionality. An account in cognitive semantics called the [[dynamic construal theory]] makes the claim that words themselves are without meaning: they have, at best, "default construals," which are really just ways of using words. Along these lines, cognitive semantics argues that compositionality can only be intelligible if pragmatic elements like context and intention are taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

== The structure of concepts ==

Cognitive semantics has sought to challenge traditional theories in two ways: first, by providing an account of the meaning of sentences by going beyond truth-conditional accounts; and second, by attempting to go beyond accounts of word meaning that appeal to necessary and sufficient conditions. It accomplishes both by examining the structure of concepts.

===Frame semantics===
{{Main|Frame semantics (linguistics)}}
Frame semantics, developed by [[Charles J. Fillmore]], attempts to explain meaning in terms of their relation to general ''understanding'', not just in the terms laid out by truth-conditional semantics. Fillmore explains meaning in general (including the meaning of lexemes) in terms of ''"frames"''. By "frame" is meant any concept that can only be understood if a larger system of concepts is also understood.

==== Fillmore: framing ====

Many pieces of linguistic evidence motivate the frame-semantic project. First, it has been noted that word meaning is an extension of our bodily and cultural experiences. For example, the notion of ''restaurant'' is associated with a series of concepts, like ''food, service, waiters, tables, and eating''.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; These rich-but-contingent associations cannot be captured by an analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, yet they still seem to be intimately related to our understanding of "restaurant".

Second, and more seriously, these conditions are not enough to account for asymmetries in the ways that words are used. According to a semantic feature analysis, there is nothing more to the meanings of "boy" and "girl" than:

# BOY [+MALE], [+YOUNG]
# GIRL [+FEMALE], [+YOUNG]

And there is surely some truth to this proposal. Indeed, cognitive semanticists understand the instances of the concept held by a given certain word may be said to exist in a ''schematic relation'' with the concept itself. And this is regarded as a legitimate approach to semantic analysis, so far as it goes.

However, linguists have found that language users regularly apply the terms "boy" and "girl" in ways that go beyond mere semantic features. That is, for instance, people tend to be more likely to consider a young female a "girl" (as opposed to "woman"), than they are to consider a borderline-young male a "boy" (as opposed to "man").&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; This fact suggests that there is a latent frame, made up of cultural attitudes, expectations, and background assumptions, which is part of word meaning. These background assumptions go up and beyond those necessary and sufficient conditions that correspond to a semantic feature account. Frame semantics, then, seeks to account for these puzzling features of lexical items in some systematic way.

Third, cognitive semanticists argue that truth-conditional semantics is incapable of dealing adequately with some aspects of the meanings at the level of the sentence. Take the following:

# You didn't spare me a day at the seaside; you deprived me of one.

In this case, the truth-conditions of the claim expressed by the antecedent in the sentence are not being denied by the proposition expressed after the clause. Instead, what is being denied is the way that the antecedent is framed.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

Finally, with the frame-semantic paradigm's analytical tools, the linguist is able to explain a wider range of semantic phenomena than they would be able to with only necessary and sufficient conditions. Some words have the same definitions or intensions, and the same extensions, but have subtly different domains. For example, the lexemes ''land'' and ''ground'' are synonyms, yet they naturally contrast with different things -- ''sea'' and ''air'', respectively.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; 

As we have seen, the frame semantic account is by no means limited to the study of lexemes—with it, researchers may examine expressions at more complex levels, including the level of the sentence (or, more precisely, the utterance). The notion of framing is regarded as being of the same cast as the pragmatic notion of ''background assumptions''. Philosopher of language [[John Searle]] explains the latter by asking readers to consider sentences like "The cat is on the mat". For such a sentence to make any sense, the interpreter makes a series of assumptions: i.e., that there is gravity, the cat is parallel to the mat, and the two touch. For the sentence to be intelligible, the speaker supposes that the interpreter has an idealized or default frame in mind.

==== Langacker: profile and base ====

An alternate strain of Fillmore's analysis can be found in the work of [[Ronald Langacker]], who makes a distinction between the notions of ''profile'' and ''base''. The profile is the concept symbolized by the word itself, while the base is the encyclopedic knowledge that the concept presupposes. For example, let the definition of "radius" be "a line segment that joins the center of a circle with any point on its circumference". If all we know of the concept ''radius'' is its profile, then we simply know that it is a line segment that is attached to something called the "circumference" in some greater whole called the "circle". That is to say, our understanding is fragmentary until the base concept of ''circle'' is firmly grasped.

When a single base supports a number of different profiles, then it can be called a "''domain''". For instance, the concept profiles of ''arc, center, and circumference'' are all in the domain of ''circle'', because each uses the concept of ''circle'' as a base. We are then in a position to characterize the notion of a frame as being either the base of the concept profile, or (more generally) the domain that the profile is a part of.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt;

=== Categorization and cognition ===
{{Main|Prototype theory}}

[[File:Prototype membership.gif|left|thumb|Membership of a graded class]]

A major divide in the approaches to cognitive semantics lies in the puzzle surrounding the nature of category structure. As mentioned in the previous section, semantic feature analyses fall short of accounting for the frames that categories may have. An alternative proposal would have to go beyond the minimalistic models given by classical accounts, and explain the richness of detail in meaning that language speakers attribute to categories.

''Prototype theories'', investigated by [[Eleanor Rosch]], have given some reason to suppose that many natural lexical category structures are graded, i.e., they have prototypical members that are considered to be "better fit" the category than other examples. For instance, [[American robin|robins]] are generally viewed as better examples of the category "[[bird]]" than, say, [[penguin]]s. If this view of category structure is the case, then categories can be understood to have central and peripheral members, and not just be evaluated in terms of members and non-members.

In a related vein, [[George Lakoff]], following the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], noted that some categories are only connected to one another by way of ''family resemblances''. While some classical categories may exist, i.e., which are structured by necessary and sufficient conditions, there are at least two other kinds: ''generative'' and ''radial''. 

''Generative categories'' can be formed by taking central cases and applying certain principles to designate category membership. The principle of similarity is one example of a rule that might generate a broader category from given prototypes.

''Radial categories'' are categories motivated by conventions, but not predictable from rules. The concept of "mother", for example, may be explained in terms of a variety of conditions that may or may not be sufficient. Those conditions may include: being married, has always been female, gave birth to the child, supplied half the child's genes, is a caregiver, is married to the genetic father, is one generation older than the child, and is the legal guardian.&lt;ref name=Lakoff&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|author=Lakoff, George|pages=82–83, 70|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any one of the above conditions might not be met: for instance, a "single mother" does not need to be married, and a "surrogate mother" does not necessarily provide nurturance. When these aspects collectively cluster together, they form a prototypical case of what it means to be a mother, but nevertheless they fail to outline the category crisply. Variations upon the central meaning are established by convention by the community of language users.

For Lakoff, prototype effects can be explained in large part due to the effects of [[idealized cognitive model]]s. That is, domains are organized with an ideal notion of the world that may or may not fit reality. For example, the word "bachelor" is commonly defined as "unmarried adult male". However, this concept has been created with a particular ideal of what a bachelor is like: an adult, uncelibate, independent, socialized, and promiscuous. Reality might either strain the expectations of the concept, or create false positives. That is, people typically want to widen the meaning of "bachelor" to include exceptions like "a sexually active seventeen-year-old who lives alone and owns his own firm" (not technically an adult but seemingly still a bachelor), and this can be considered a kind of straining of the definition. Moreover, speakers would tend to want to exclude from the concept of ''bachelor'' certain false positives, such as those adult unmarried males that don't bear much resemblance to the ideal: i.e., the Pope, or Tarzan.&lt;ref name=Lakoff /&gt; Prototype effects may also be explained as a function of either [[basic-level categorization]] and typicality, closeness to an ideal, or stereotyping.

So viewed, prototype theory seems to give an account of category structure. However, there are a number of criticisms of this interpretation of the data. Indeed, Rosch and Lakoff, themselves chief advocates of prototype theory, have emphasized in their later works that the findings of prototype theory do not necessarily tell us anything about category structure. Some theorists in the cognitive semantics tradition have challenged both classical and prototype accounts of category structure by proposing the dynamic construal account, where category structure is always created "on-line"—and so, that categories have no structure outside of the context of use.

=== Mental spaces===
{{Main|Mental space}}
[[File:Prop-attitudes-example.gif|thumb|250px|right|Propositional attitudes in Fodor's presentation of truth-conditional semantics]]

In traditional semantics, the meaning of a sentence is the situation it represents, and the situation can be described in terms of the possible world that it would be true of. Moreover, sentence meanings may be dependent upon [[propositional attitude]]s: those features that are relative to someone's beliefs, desires, and mental states. The role of propositional attitudes in truth-conditional semantics is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy|author=Bunnin, Nicholas and E. P. Tsui-James|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by at least one line of argument, truth-conditional semantics seems to be able to capture the meaning of belief-sentences like "Frank believes that the [[Red Sox]] will win the next game" by appealing to propositional attitudes. The meaning of the overall proposition is described as a set of abstract conditions, wherein Frank holds a certain propositional attitude, and the attitude is itself a relationship between Frank and a particular proposition; and this proposition is the possible world where the Red Sox win the next game.&lt;ref name=Fodor&gt;{{cite book|title=Propositional Attitudes|author=Fodor, Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, many theorists have grown dissatisfied with the inelegance and dubious ontology behind possible-worlds semantics. An alternative can be found in the work of [[Gilles Fauconnier]]. For Fauconnier, the meaning of a sentence can be derived from "mental spaces". Mental spaces are cognitive structures entirely in the minds of interlocutors. In his account, there are two kinds of mental space. The ''base space'' is used to describe reality (as it is understood by both interlocutors). ''Space builders'' (or ''built space'') are those mental spaces that go beyond reality by addressing possible worlds, along with temporal expressions, fictional constructs, games, and so on.&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; Additionally, Fauconnier semantics distinguishes between ''roles'' and ''values''. A semantic role is understood to be description of a category, while values are the instances that make up the category. (In this sense, the role-value distinction is a special case of the [[type-token distinction]].) 

Fauconnier argues that curious semantic constructions can be explained handily by the above apparatus. Take the following sentence:

# In 1929, the lady with white hair was blonde.

The semanticist must construct an explanation for the obvious fact that the above sentence is not contradictory. Fauconnier constructs his analysis by observing that there are two mental spaces (the present-space and the 1929-space). His ''access principle'' supposes that "a value in one space can be described by the role its counterpart in another space has, even if that role is invalid for the value in the first space".&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; So, to use the example above, the value in 1929-space is ''the blonde'', while she is being described with the role of ''the lady with white hair'' in present-day space.

== Conceptualization and construal ==
{{Main|Construal}}

As we have seen, cognitive semantics gives a treatment of issues in the construction of meaning both at the level of the sentence and the level of the lexeme in terms of the structure of concepts. However, it is not entirely clear what cognitive processes are at work in these accounts. Moreover, it is not clear how we might go about explaining the ways that concepts are actively employed in conversation. It appears to be the case that, if our project is to look at ''how'' linguistic strings convey different semantic content, we must first catalogue ''what'' cognitive processes are being used to do it. Researchers can satisfy both requirements by attending to the ''construal operations'' involved in language processing—that is to say, by investigating the ways that people ''structure their experiences'' through language.

Language is full of conventions that allow for subtle and nuanced conveyances of experience. To use an example that is readily at hand, framing is all-pervasive, and it may extend across the full breadth of linguistic data, extending from the most complex utterances, to tone, to word choice, to expressions derived from the composition of [[morpheme]]s. Another example is ''[[Image schema|image-schemata]]'', which are ways that we structure and understand the elements of our experience driven by any given sense.

According to linguists [[William Croft (linguist)|William Croft]] and [[D. Alan Cruse]], there are four broad cognitive abilities that play an active part in the construction of construals. They are: attention/[[salience (language)|salience]], [[judgment]]/comparison, [[situatedness]], and constitution/[[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]].&lt;ref name=Croft /&gt; Each general category contains a number of subprocesses, each of which helps to explain the ways we encode experience into language in some unique way.

'''Computational informatics''' is a subfield of [[informatics]] that emphasizes issues in the design of computing solutions rather than its underlying infrastructure. Computational informatics can also be interpreted as the use of computational methods in the information sciences.

== Development ==
From a historical viewpoint, medical informatics scientists (also known as medical informaticians) started to use artificial intelligence and [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] statistical methods in [[diagnosis]] and medical decision making, as early as in the 1970s.  An example is the [[MYCIN]] system developed at [[Stanford University]].  The field has since evolved to use a wide range of computational methods and to interact with all possible scientific and other disciplinary domains.  Later, the field integrated the following:

* Computational techniques: [[artificial intelligence]], [[algorithm]]s (for architectures ranging from single [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] to [[massively parallel]] machines), programming, [[object-oriented]] system design, [[database]]s, information retrieval, computer graphics and visualization, [[data mining]], information extraction.
* [[Probability]], [[statistics]] and decision science: Theory of probability, statistical inference, cost/risk-benefit analysis, probabilistic analysis, stochastic modeling, decision theory, statistical data analysis, probabilistic networks, pattern classification, statistical learning and modeling, statistical data mining.
* Applied [[mathematics]]: [[graph theory]], [[differential equation]]s, [[optimization theory]], [[wavelet]]s, [[group theory]].
* [[Electrical engineering]] methods: signal and image processing.
* [[Domain knowledge]]: [[art]] and cultural heritage, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], the [[World Wide Web]].
* User sciences: design, human-computer interaction, evaluation.
* Cyberinfrastructure for informatics: [[search engine]]s, digital repositories, storage.
* [[Scientometrics]], [[bibliometrics]] and [[economics]]: science and policy evaluation, data mining and information extraction, knowledge discovery.
* Social sciences: [[social network]] analysis and metrics.

== Education ==
Several universities offer graduate programs in this area.  One example is the [[Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology]].  Another example is the [[Hamburg University of Technology]] which offers a consecutive Bachelor and Master program with emphasis on computational techniques. Some programs are targeted at specific domains.  For instance, the Biomedical Informatics Program at [[Stanford University]] focuses on technologies and methods for understanding biomedical data and to improve health care.

In Tunisia, University of Manouba offers a Master program called Intelligent and Decisional Informatics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MR IDIAG (Informatique décisionnelle et intelligence appliquée à la gestion)|url=http://www.esct.rnu.tn/site/index.php/formations/masteres/mridiag|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tries to cover all aspect of computational informatics.

'''Data analysis''' is a process of inspecting, [[Data cleansing|cleansing]], [[Data transformation|transforming]], and [[Data modeling|modeling]] [[data]] with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, while being used in different business, science, and social science domains.

[[Data mining]] is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while [[business intelligence]] covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171018181046/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-analysis Exploring Data Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In statistical applications, data analysis can be divided into [[descriptive statistics]], [[exploratory data analysis]] (EDA), and [[Statistical hypothesis testing|confirmatory data analysis]] (CDA). EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data while CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing [[hypotheses]]. [[Predictive analytics]] focuses on application of statistical models for predictive forecasting or classification, while [[text analytics]] applies statistical, linguistic, and structural techniques to extract and classify information from textual sources, a species of [[unstructured data]]. All of the above are varieties of data analysis.

[[Data integration]] is a precursor to data analysis,{{according to whom|date=March 2018}} and data analysis is closely linked{{how|date=March 2018}} to [[data visualization]] and data dissemination. The term ''data analysis'' is sometimes used as a synonym for data modeling.

==The process of data analysis==
[[File:Data visualization process v1.png|right|350px|thumb|Data science process flowchart from "Doing Data Science", Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt, 2013]]
Analysis refers to breaking a whole into its separate components for individual examination. Data analysis is a [[Process theory|process]] for obtaining raw data and converting it into information useful for decision-making by users. Data are collected and analyzed to answer questions, test hypotheses or disprove theories.&lt;ref name="Judd and McClelland 1989"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Judd, Charles and
| first = McCleland, Gary
| year = 1989
| title = [[Data Analysis]] | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
| isbn = 0-15-516765-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistician [[John Tukey]] defined data analysis in 1961 as: "Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."&lt;ref&gt;[http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177704711 John Tukey-The Future of Data Analysis-July 1961]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several phases that can be distinguished, described below. The phases are iterative, in that feedback from later phases may result in additional work in earlier phases.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"&gt;{{cite book
| last = O'Neil, Cathy and
| first = Schutt, Rachel
| year = 2013
| title = [[Doing Data Science]] | publisher = O'Reilly
| isbn = 978-1-449-35865-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data requirements===
The data are necessary as inputs to the analysis, which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analysis or customers (who will use the finished product of the analysis). The general type of entity upon which the data will be collected is referred to as an experimental unit (e.g., a person or population of people). Specific variables regarding a population (e.g., age and income) may be specified and obtained.  Data may be numerical or categorical (i.e., a text label for numbers).&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Data collection===
Data are collected from a variety of sources. The requirements may be communicated by analysts to custodians of the data, such as information technology personnel within an organization. The data may also be collected from sensors in the environment, such as traffic cameras, satellites, recording devices, etc. It may also be obtained through interviews,  downloads from online sources, or reading documentation.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Data processing===
[[File:Relationship of data, information and intelligence.png|thumb|350px|The phases of the [[intelligence cycle]] used to convert raw information into actionable intelligence or knowledge are conceptually similar to the phases in data analysis.]]
Data initially obtained must be processed or organised for analysis. For instance, these may involve placing data into rows and columns in a table format (i.e., [[data model|structured data]]) for further analysis, such as within a spreadsheet or statistical software.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Data cleaning===
Once processed and organised, the data may be incomplete, contain duplicates, or contain errors. The need for data cleaning will arise from problems in the way that data are entered and stored. Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors. Common tasks include record matching, identifying inaccuracy of data, overall quality of existing data,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/clean-data-in-crm-the-key-to-generate-sales-ready-leads-and-boost-your-revenue-pool/ Clean Data in CRM: The Key to Generate Sales-Ready Leads and Boost Your Revenue Pool] Retrieved 29th July, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; deduplication, and column segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Cleaning|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/datacleaning/|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques. For example, with financial information, the totals for particular variables may be compared against separately published numbers believed to be reliable.&lt;ref name="Koomey1"&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/b-eye/quantitative_data.pdf Perceptual Edge-Jonathan Koomey-Best practices for understanding quantitative data-February 14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual amounts above or below pre-determined thresholds may also be reviewed.  There are several types of data cleaning that depend on the type of data such as phone numbers, email addresses, employers etc.  Quantitative data methods for outlier detection can be used to get rid of likely incorrectly entered data. Textual data spell checkers can be used to lessen the amount of mistyped words, but it is harder to tell if the words themselves are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hellerstein|first=Joseph|title=Quantitative Data Cleaning for Large Databases|journal=EECS Computer Science Division|date=27 February 2008|page=3|url=http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/papers/cleaning-unece.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploratory data analysis===
Once the data are cleaned, it can be analyzed. Analysts may apply a variety of techniques referred to as [[exploratory data analysis]] to begin understanding the messages contained in the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Selecting the Right Graph For Your Message-September 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cll.stanford.edu/~willb/course/behrens97pm.pdf Behrens-Principles and Procedures of Exploratory Data Analysis-American Psychological Association-1997]&lt;/ref&gt; The process of exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data, so these activities may be iterative in nature. [[Descriptive statistics]], such as the average or median, may be generated to help understand the data. [[Data visualization]] may also be used to examine the data in graphical format, to obtain additional insight regarding the messages within the data.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Modeling and algorithms===
Mathematical formulas or models called [[algorithms]] may be applied to the data to identify relationships among the variables, such as [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] or [[causality|causation]]. In general terms, models may be developed to evaluate a particular variable in the data based on other variable(s) in the data, with some residual error depending on model accuracy (i.e., Data = Model + Error).&lt;ref name="Judd and McClelland 1989"/&gt;

[[Inferential statistics]] includes techniques to measure relationships between particular variables.  For example, [[regression analysis]] may be used to model whether a change in advertising (independent variable X) explains the variation in sales (dependent variable Y). In mathematical terms, Y (sales) is a function of X (advertising). It may be described as Y = aX + b + error, where the model is designed such that a and b minimize the error when the model predicts Y for a given range of values of X. Analysts may attempt to build models that are descriptive of the data to simplify analysis and communicate results.&lt;ref name="Judd and McClelland 1989"/&gt;

===Data product===
A data product is a computer application that takes data inputs and generates outputs, feeding them back into the environment. It may be based on a model or algorithm. An example is an application that analyzes data about customer purchasing history and recommends other purchases the customer might enjoy.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

===Communication===
[[File:Social Network Analysis Visualization.png|thumb|250px|[[Data visualization]] to understand the results of a data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 10| issue = 3| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = La connaissance est un réseau| journal =Les Cahiers du Numérique| date = 2014| pages = 37–54| url = http://www.martingrandjean.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Grandjean-2014-Connaissance-reseau.pdf| doi=10.3166/lcn.10.3.37-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main article|Data visualization}}
Once the data are analyzed, it may be reported in many formats to the users of the analysis to support their requirements. The users may have feedback, which results in additional analysis. As such, much of the analytical cycle is iterative.&lt;ref name="O'Neil and Schutt 2013"/&gt;

When determining how to communicate the results, the analyst may consider [[data visualization]] techniques to help clearly and efficiently communicate the message to the audience. Data visualization uses [[information displays]] (such as tables and charts) to help communicate key messages contained in the data. Tables are helpful to a user who might lookup specific numbers, while charts (e.g., bar charts or line charts) may help explain the quantitative messages contained in the data.

==Quantitative messages==
{{Main article|Data visualization}}
[[File:Total Revenues and Outlays as Percent GDP 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A time series illustrated with a line chart demonstrating trends in U.S. federal spending and revenue over time.]]
[[File:U.S. Phillips Curve 2000 to 2013.png|thumb|right|250px|A scatterplot illustrating correlation between two variables (inflation and unemployment) measured at points in time.]]
Stephen Few described eight types of quantitative messages that users may attempt to understand or communicate from a set of data and the associated graphs used to help communicate the message. Customers specifying requirements and analysts performing the data analysis may consider these messages during the course of the process.
#Time-series: A single variable is captured over a period of time, such as the unemployment rate over a 10-year period. A [[line chart]] may be used to demonstrate the trend.
#Ranking: Categorical subdivisions are ranked in ascending or descending order, such as a ranking of sales performance (the ''measure'') by sales persons (the ''category'', with each sales person a ''categorical subdivision'') during a single period.  A [[bar chart]] may be used to show the comparison across the sales persons.
#Part-to-whole: Categorical subdivisions are measured as a ratio to the whole (i.e., a percentage out of 100%).  A [[pie chart]] or bar chart can show the comparison of ratios, such as the market share represented by competitors in a market.
#Deviation: Categorical subdivisions are compared against a reference, such as a comparison of actual vs. budget expenses for several departments of a business for a given time period.  A bar chart can show comparison of the actual versus the reference amount.
#Frequency distribution: Shows the number of observations of a particular variable for given interval, such as the number of years in which the stock market return is between intervals such as 0–10%, 11–20%, etc. A [[histogram]], a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis.
#Correlation: Comparison between observations represented by two variables (X,Y) to determine if they tend to move in the same or opposite directions. For example, plotting unemployment (X) and inflation (Y) for a sample of months. A [[scatter plot]] is typically used for this message.
#Nominal comparison: Comparing categorical subdivisions in no particular order, such as the sales volume by product code. A bar chart may be used for this comparison.
#Geographic or geospatial: Comparison of a variable across a map or layout, such as the unemployment rate by state or the number of persons on the various floors of a building. A [[cartogram]] is a typical graphic used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/the_right_graph.pdf Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Selecting the Right Graph for Your Message-2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Graph_Selection_Matrix.pdf Stephen Few-Perceptual Edge-Graph Selection Matrix]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques for analyzing quantitative data==
{{See also|Problem solving}}
Author Jonathan Koomey has recommended a series of best practices for understanding quantitative data.  These include:
*Check raw data for anomalies prior to performing your analysis;
*Re-perform important calculations, such as verifying columns of data that are formula driven;
*Confirm main totals are the sum of subtotals;
*Check relationships between numbers that should be related in a predictable way, such as ratios over time;
*Normalize numbers to make comparisons easier, such as analyzing amounts per person or relative to GDP or as an index value relative to a base year;
*Break problems into component parts by analyzing factors that led to the results, such as [[DuPont analysis]] of return on equity.&lt;ref name="Koomey1"/&gt;

For the variables under examination, analysts typically obtain [[descriptive statistics]] for them, such as the mean (average), [[median]], and [[standard deviation]]. They may also analyze the [[probability distribution|distribution]] of the key variables to see how the individual values cluster around the mean.
[[File:US_Employment_Statistics_-_March_2015.png|thumb|250px|right|An illustration of the [[MECE principle]] used for data analysis.]] The consultants at [[McKinsey and Company]] named a technique for breaking a quantitative problem down into its component parts called the [[MECE principle]]. Each layer can be broken down into its components; each of the sub-components must be [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]] of each other and [[Collectively exhaustive events|collectively]] add up to the layer above them. The relationship is referred to as "Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive" or MECE.  For example, profit by definition can be broken down into total revenue and total cost. In turn, total revenue can be analyzed by its components, such as revenue of divisions A, B, and C (which are mutually exclusive of each other) and should add to the total revenue (collectively exhaustive).

Analysts may use robust statistical measurements to solve certain analytical problems. [[Hypothesis testing]] is used when a particular hypothesis about the true state of affairs is made by the analyst and data is gathered to determine whether that state of affairs is true or false. For example, the hypothesis might be that "Unemployment has no effect on inflation", which relates to an economics concept called the [[Phillips Curve]]. Hypothesis testing involves considering the likelihood of [[Type I and type II errors]], which relate to whether the data supports accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.

[[Regression analysis]] may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X affects dependent variable Y (e.g., "To what extent do changes in the unemployment rate (X) affect the inflation rate (Y)?"). This is an attempt to model or fit an equation line or curve to the data, such that Y is a function of X.

[https://www.erim.eur.nl/centres/necessary-condition-analysis/ Necessary condition analysis] (NCA) may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X allows variable Y (e.g., "To what extent is a certain unemployment rate (X) necessary for a certain inflation rate (Y)?"). Whereas (multiple) regression analysis uses additive logic where each X-variable can produce the outcome and the X's can compensate for each other (they are sufficient but not necessary), necessary condition analysis (NCA) uses necessity logic, where one or more X-variables allow the outcome to exist, but may not produce it (they are necessary but not sufficient). Each single necessary condition must be present and compensation is not possible.

==Analytical activities of data users==
Users may have particular data points of interest within a data set, as opposed to general messaging outlined above. Such low-level user analytic activities are presented in the following table. The taxonomy can also be organized by three poles of activities: retrieving values, finding data points, and arranging data points.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Amar, James Eagan, and John Stasko (2005) [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~stasko/papers/infovis05.pdf "Low-Level Components of Analytic Activity in Information Visualization"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Newman (1994) [http://www.mdnpress.com/wmn/pdfs/chi94-pro-formas-2.pdf "A Preliminary Analysis of the Products of HCI Research, Using Pro Forma Abstracts"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Shaw (2002) [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Compose/ftp/shaw-fin-etaps.pdf "What Makes Good Research in Software Engineering?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConTaaS"&gt;{{cite web|title=ConTaaS: An Approach to Internet-Scale Contextualisation for Developing Efficient Internet of Things Applications|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/41879|website=ScholarSpace|publisher=HICSS50|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers to effective analysis==
Barriers to effective analysis may exist among the analysts performing the data analysis or among the audience. Distinguishing fact from opinion, cognitive biases, and innumeracy are all challenges to sound data analysis.

===Confusing fact and opinion===
{{quote box|quote=You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.|source=[[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]|width = 250px}}

Effective analysis requires obtaining relevant [[fact]]s to answer questions, support a conclusion or formal [[opinion]], or test [[hypotheses]]. Facts by definition are irrefutable, meaning that any person involved in the analysis should be able to agree upon them. For example, in August 2010, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimated that extending the [[Bush tax cuts]] of 2001 and 2003 for the 2011–2020 time period would add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21670|title=Congressional Budget Office-The Budget and Economic Outlook-August 2010-Table 1.7 on Page 24 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone should be able to agree that indeed this is what CBO reported; they can all examine the report. This makes it a fact. Whether persons agree or disagree with the CBO is their own opinion.

As another example, the auditor of a public company must arrive at a formal opinion on whether financial statements of publicly traded corporations are "fairly stated, in all material respects." This requires extensive analysis of factual data and evidence to support their opinion. When making the leap from facts to opinions, there is always the possibility that the opinion is [[Type I and type II errors|erroneous]].

===Cognitive biases===
There are a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es that can adversely affect analysis. For example, [[confirmation bias]] is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. In addition, individuals may discredit information that does not support their views.

Analysts may be trained specifically to be aware of these biases and how to overcome them. In his book ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'', retired CIA analyst [[Richards Heuer]] wrote that analysts should clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference and specify the degree and source of the uncertainty involved in the conclusions. He emphasized procedures to help surface and debate alternative points of view.&lt;ref name="Heuer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art3.html|title=Introduction|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innumeracy===
Effective analysts are generally adept with a variety of numerical techniques. However, audiences may not have such literacy with numbers or [[numeracy]]; they are said to be innumerate.  Persons communicating the data may also be attempting to mislead or misinform, deliberately using bad numerical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-10-28/bad-math-that-passes-for-insight Bloomberg-Barry Ritholz-Bad Math that Passes for Insight-October 28, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, whether a number is rising or falling may not be the key factor. More important may be the number relative to another number, such as the size of government revenue or spending relative to the size of the economy (GDP) or the amount of cost relative to revenue in corporate financial statements. This numerical technique is referred to as normalization&lt;ref name="Koomey1"/&gt; or common-sizing. There are many such techniques employed by analysts, whether adjusting for inflation (i.e., comparing real vs. nominal data) or considering population increases, demographics, etc. Analysts apply a variety of techniques to address the various quantitative messages described in the section above.

Analysts may also analyze data under different assumptions or scenarios. For example, when analysts perform [[financial statement analysis]], they will often recast the financial statements under different assumptions to help arrive at an estimate of future cash flow, which they then discount to present value based on some interest rate, to determine the valuation of the company or its stock.  Similarly, the CBO analyzes the effects of various policy options on the government's revenue, outlays and deficits, creating alternative future scenarios for key measures.

==Other topics==

===Smart buildings===
A data analytics approach can be used in order to predict energy consumption in buildings.&lt;ref name="Towards energy efficiency smart buildings models based on intelligent data analytics"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The different steps of the data analysis process are carried out in order to realise smart buildings, where the building management and control operations including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting and security are realised automatically by miming the needs of the building users and optimising resources like energy and time.

===Analytics and business intelligence===
{{Main article|Analytics}}
Analytics is the "extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions." It is a subset of [[business intelligence]], which is a set of technologies and processes that use data to understand and analyze business performance.&lt;ref name="Competing on Analytics 2007"&gt;{{cite book

===Education===
[[File:User-activities.png|Analytic activities of data visualization users|thumb|right|350px]]
In [[education]], most educators have access to a [[data system]] for the purpose of analyzing student data.&lt;ref&gt;Aarons, D. (2009). [http://search.proquest.com/docview/202710770?accountid=28180 Report finds states on course to build pupil-data systems.] ''Education Week, 29''(13), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These data systems present data to educators in an [[over-the-counter data]] format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve the accuracy of educators’ data analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, March 28). [https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/recording/playback/link/table/dropin?sid=2008350&amp;suid=D.4DF60C7117D5A77FE3AED546909ED2 How data Systems &amp; reports can either fight or propagate the data analysis error epidemic, and how educator leaders can help.] ''Presentation conducted from Technology Information Center for Administrative Leadership (TICAL) School Leadership Summit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practitioner notes==
This section contains rather technical explanations that may assist practitioners but are beyond the typical scope of a Wikipedia article.

===Initial data analysis===
The most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase and the main analysis phase, is that during initial data analysis one refrains from any analysis that is aimed at answering the original research question. The initial data analysis phase is guided by the following four questions:{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|p=337}}

====Quality of data====
The quality of the data should be checked as early as possible. Data quality can be assessed in several ways, using different types of analysis: frequency counts, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median), normality (skewness, kurtosis, frequency histograms, n: variables are compared with coding schemes of variables external to the data set, and possibly corrected if coding schemes are not comparable.
*Test for [[common-method variance]].
The choice of analyses to assess the data quality during the initial data analysis phase depends on the analyses that will be conducted in the main analysis phase.{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=338-341}}

====Quality of measurements====
The quality of the [[measuring instrument|measurement instruments]] should only be checked during the initial data analysis phase when this is not the focus or research question of the study. One should check whether structure of measurement instruments corresponds to structure reported in the literature.

There are two ways to assess measurement: [NOTE: only one way seems to be listed]
*Analysis of homogeneity ([[internal consistency]]), which gives an indication of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of a measurement instrument. During this analysis, one inspects the variances of the items and the scales, the [[Cronbach's alpha|Cronbach's α]] of the scales, and the change in the Cronbach's alpha when an item would be deleted from a scale{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=341-342}}

====Initial transformations====
After assessing the quality of the data and of the measurements, one might decide to impute missing data, or to perform initial transformations of one or more variables, although this can also be done during the main analysis phase.{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|p=344}}&lt;br /&gt;
Possible transformations of variables are:&lt;ref&gt;Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007, p. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Square root transformation (if the distribution differs moderately from normal)
*Log-transformation (if the distribution differs substantially from normal)
*Inverse transformation (if the distribution differs severely from normal)
*Make categorical (ordinal / dichotomous) (if the distribution differs severely from normal, and no transformations help)

====Did the implementation of the study fulfill the intentions of the research design?====
One should check the success of the [[randomization]] procedure, for instance by checking whether background and substantive variables are equally distributed within and across groups. &lt;br /&gt;
If the study did not need or use a randomization procedure, one should check the success of the non-random sampling, for instance by checking whether all subgroups of the population of interest are represented in sample.&lt;br /&gt;
Other possible data distortions that should be checked are:
*[[Dropout (electronics)|dropout]] (this should be identified during the initial data analysis phase)
*Item [[Response rate (survey)|nonresponse]] (whether this is random or not should be assessed during the initial data analysis phase)
*Treatment quality (using [[manipulation check]]s).{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=344-345}}

====Characteristics of data sample====
In any report or article, the structure of the sample must be accurately described. It is especially important to exactly determine the structure of the sample (and specifically the size of the subgroups) when subgroup analyses will be performed during the main analysis phase.&lt;br /&gt;
The characteristics of the data sample can be assessed by looking at:
*Basic statistics of important variables
*Scatter plots
*Correlations and associations
*Cross-tabulations{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|p=345}}

====Final stage of the initial data analysis====
During the final stage, the findings of the initial data analysis are documented, and necessary, preferable, and possible corrective actions are taken.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, the original plan for the main data analyses can and should be specified in more detail or rewritten.&lt;br /&gt; In order to do this, several decisions about the main data analyses can and should be made:
*In the case of non-[[Normal distribution|normal]]s: should one [[Data transformation (statistics)|transform]] variables; make variables categorical (ordinal/dichotomous); adapt the analysis method?
*In the case of [[missing data]]: should one neglect or impute the missing data; which imputation technique should be used?
*In the case of [[outlier]]s: should one use robust analysis techniques?
*In case items do not fit the scale: should one adapt the measurement instrument by omitting items, or rather ensure comparability with other (uses of the) measurement instrument(s)?
*In the case of (too) small subgroups: should one drop the hypothesis about inter-group differences, or use small sample techniques, like exact tests or [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]]?
*In case the [[randomization]] procedure seems to be defective: can and should one calculate [[Propensity score matching|propensity scores]] and include them as covariates in the main analyses?{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=345-346}}

====Analysis====
Several analyses can be used during the initial data analysis phase:{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=346-347}}
*Univariate statistics (single variable)
*Bivariate associations (correlations)
*Graphical techniques (scatter plots)

It is important to take the measurement levels of the variables into account for the analyses, as special statistical techniques are available for each level:{{sfn|Adèr|2008a|pp=349-353}}

*Nominal and ordinal variables
**Frequency counts (numbers and percentages)
**Associations
***circumambulations (crosstabulations)
***hierarchical loglinear analysis (restricted to a maximum of 8 variables)
***loglinear analysis (to identify relevant/important variables and possible confounders)
**Exact tests or bootstrapping (in case subgroups are small)
**Computation of new variables
*Continuous variables
**Distribution
***Statistics (M, SD, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
***Stem-and-leaf displays
***Box plots

====Nonlinear analysis====
Nonlinear analysis will be necessary when the data is recorded from a [[nonlinear system]]. Nonlinear systems can exhibit complex dynamic effects including [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]], [[chaos theory|chaos]], [[harmonics]] and [[subharmonics]] that cannot be analyzed using simple linear methods.  Nonlinear data analysis is closely related to [[nonlinear system identification]].&lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. "Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains". Wiley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main data analysis===
In the main analysis phase analyses aimed at answering the research question are performed as well as any other relevant analysis needed to write the first draft of the research report.{{sfn|Adèr|2008b|p=363}}

====Exploratory and confirmatory approaches====
In the main analysis phase either an exploratory or confirmatory approach can be adopted. Usually the approach is decided before data is collected. In an exploratory analysis no clear hypothesis is stated before analysing the data, and the data is searched for models that describe the data well. In a confirmatory analysis clear hypotheses about the data are tested.

[[Exploratory data analysis]] should be interpreted carefully. When testing multiple models at once there is a high chance on finding at least one of them to be significant, but this can be due to a [[type 1 error]]. It is important to always adjust the significance level when testing multiple models with, for example, a [[Bonferroni correction]]. Also, one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset. An exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory, but not to test that theory as well. When a model is found exploratory in a dataset, then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same [[type 1 error]] that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place. The confirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis.{{sfn|Adèr|2008b|pp=361-362}}

====Stability of results====
It is important to obtain some indication about how generalizable the results are.{{sfn|Adèr|2008b|pp=361-371}} While this is hard to check, one can look at the stability of the results. Are the results reliable and reproducible? There are two main ways of doing this:
* [[Cross-validation (statistics)|Cross-validation]]: By splitting the data in multiple parts we can check if an analysis (like a fitted model) based on one part of the data generalizes to another part of the data as well.
* [[Sensitivity analysis]]: A procedure to study the behavior of a system or model when global parameters are (systematically) varied. One way to do this is with bootstrapping.

====Statistical methods====
Many statistical methods have been used for statistical analyses. A very brief list of four of the more popular methods is:
* [[General linear model]]: A widely used model on which various methods are based (e.g. [[t test]], [[ANOVA]], [[ANCOVA]], [[MANOVA]]). Usable for assessing the effect of several predictors on one or more continuous dependent variables.
* [[Generalized linear model]]: An extension of the general linear model for discrete dependent variables.
* [[Structural equation modelling]]: Usable for assessing latent structures from measured manifest variables.
* [[Item response theory]]: Models for (mostly) assessing one latent variable from several binary measured variables (e.g. an exam).

{{Muhammad}}
The permissibility of '''depictions of Muhammad''' in [[Islam]] has been a contentious issue. Oral and written descriptions of [[Muhammad]] are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions.&lt;ref name=best&gt;{{cite journal

Esposito - 2011 p. 14; for hadith see [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], Hadith: 7.834, 7.838, 7.840, 7.844,  7.846&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted.

The question of whether images in [[Islamic art]], including those depicting Muhammad, can be considered as [[religious art]] remains a matter of contention among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; They appear in illustrated books that are normally works of history or poetry, including those with religious subjects; the Quran is never illustrated: "context and intent are essential to understanding Islamic pictorial art. The Muslim artists creating images of Muhammad, and the public who beheld them, understood that the images were not objects of worship. Nor were the objects so decorated used as part of religious worship".&lt;ref&gt;Cosman, Pelner and Jones, Linda Gale.

However, scholars concede that such images have "a spiritual element", and were also sometimes used in informal religious devotions celebrating the day of the [[Mi'raj]].&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.27 (quote) and 43&lt;/ref&gt; Many visual depictions only show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame; other images, notably from before about 1500, show his face.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), pp. 239, 247–253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="January2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brendan January|title=The Arab Conquests of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9XGWkkFy0sC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 February 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-8744-6|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Safi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Omid Safi|title=Memories of Muhammad: Why the Prophet Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s63i21E9dr8C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=2 November 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123135-3|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the notable exception of modern-day Iran,&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt; depictions of Muhammad were rare, never numerous in any community or era throughout Islamic history,&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Gorgias Press LLC|isbn = 978-1-931956-91-8|last = Arnold|first = Thomas W.|title = Painting in Islam, a Study of the Place of Pictorial Art in Muslim Culture|orig-year = First published in 1928 |date = 2002–2011|pages = 91–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plas1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk van der Plas|title=Effigies dei: essays on the history of religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ops3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=1987|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-08655-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared almost exclusively in the private medium of Persian and other [[Persian miniature|miniature]] book illustration.&lt;ref name="Ernst2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst|first1=Carl W.|authorlink1=Carl W.

Visual images of Muhammad in the non-Islamic West have always been infrequent. In the Middle Ages they were mostly hostile, and most often appear in illustrations of [[Dante]]'s poetry.  In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, Muhammad was sometimes depicted, typically in a more neutral or heroic light. These depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims, and in the age of the internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy, and been associated with violence.

==Background==
{{main|Aniconism in Islam}}
In Islam, although nothing in the [[Quran]] explicitly bans images, some supplemental [[hadith]] explicitly ban the drawing of images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or [[Prophets of Islam|any other prophet]] such as [[Moses]] or [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name=best/&gt;&lt;ref name=USSC&gt;{{cite web|url={{SCOTUS URL|about/north&amp;southwalls.pdf}} |format=PDF|title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls|author=Office of the Curator|date=2003-05-08|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=Information Sheet, Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=explaining&gt;{{cite news|title=Explaining the outrage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-02-08/news/0602080383_1_prophet-muhammad-cartoons-muslims|date=2006-02-08|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Sunni]] Muslims believe that visual depictions of all the [[prophets of Islam]] should be prohibited&lt;ref name=Larsson&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsson|first=Göran|title=Muslims and the New Media|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-4094-2750-6|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63BsneOUJ?url=http://www.hf.uib.no/religion/popularikonografi/devotion04.html Devotion in pictures: Muslim popular iconography – The prophet Muhammad], [[University of Bergen]]&lt;/ref&gt; The key concern is that the use of images can encourage [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;{{cite book|last=Eaton|first=Charles Le Gai|title=Islam and the destiny of man|year=1985|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-161-5|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions.&lt;ref name=BergenMuhammad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Walker Arnold]] says "It was not merely Sunni schools of law but Shia jurists also who fulminated against this figured art. Because the Persians are Shiites, many Europeans writers have assumed that the Shia sect had not the same objection to representing living being as the rival set of the Sunni; but such an opinion ignores the fact that Shiisum did not become the state church in Persia until the rise of the Safivid dynasty at the beginning of the 16th century."&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/things/depictions-of-muhammad-in-islamic-art.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06|title=Islamic Figurative Art and Depictions of Muhammad|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major religions have experienced times during their history when [[aniconism|images of their religious figures were forbidden]]. In Judaism, one of the [[Ten Commandments]] forbids "graven images".  In [[Byzantine]] Christianity during the periods of [[byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] in the 8th century, and again during the 9th century, visual representations of sacred figures were forbidden, and only the [[Christian cross|Cross]] could be depicted in churches. The visual representation of Jesus and other religious figures remains a concern in parts of [[Protestant Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Halicks&gt;{{cite news|title=Images of Muhammad: Three ways to see a cartoon|author=Richard Halicks|date=2006-02-12|work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portraiture of Muhammad in Islamic literature==

A number of ''hadith'' and other writings of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. [[Abu Hanifa Dinawari]], [[Ibn al-Faqih]], [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] and [[Abu Nu`aym]] tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from [[Alexander the Great]] and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains a portrait of a prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. [[Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni]] tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. [[Kisa'i]] tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam.&lt;ref name=Grabar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grabar|first=Oleg|title=The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad|journal=Studia Islamica|year=2003|issue=96|pages=19–38|jstor=1596240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell a second story in which a Meccan merchant visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asani|first=Ali|title=Celebrating Muhammad: Images of the Prophet in Popular Muslim Piety|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an 11th-century story, Muhammad is said so have sat for a portrait by an artist retained by [[Sassanid]] king [[Kavadh II]]. The king liked the portrait so much that he placed it on his pillow.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

Later, [[Al-Maqrizi]] tells a story in which [[Muqawqis]], ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to describe Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which he has on a piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait.&lt;ref name=Grabar/&gt;

In a 17th-century [[Islam in China|Chinese]] story, the king of China asks to see Muhammad, but Muhammad instead sends his portrait. The king is so enamoured of the portrait that he is converted to Islam, at which point the portrait, having done its job, disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Donald|title=Islam in Traditional China|year=1986|publisher=Canberra College of Advanced Education|location=Canberra|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction by Muslims==

===Verbal descriptions===
{{main|Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Hilya}}
[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[hilya|Hilye]]'' by [[Hâfiz Osman]] (1642–1698)]]
In one of the earliest sources, [[Ibn Sa'd]]'s ''Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', there are numerous verbal descriptions of Muhammad. One description sourced to [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] is as follows:

: ''The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, is neither too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but a mixture of the two. He is a man of black hair and large skull. His complexion has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long ''al-masrubah'' which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] I never saw a man like him before him or after him.''&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sa'd – ''Kitabh al-Tabaqat al-Kabir'', as translated by S. Moinul and H.K. Ghazanfar, Kitab Bhavan, New Delhi, n.d.{{unreliable source?|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period onwards such texts have been presented on calligraphic ''[[hilya]]'' panels (Turkish: ''hilye'', pl. ''hilyeler''), commonly surrounded by an elaborate frame of [[Ottoman illumination|illuminated decoration]] and either included in books or, more often, [[muraqqa]]s or albums, or sometimes placed in wooden frames so that they can hang on a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), p.231-232&lt;/ref&gt;  The elaborated form of the calligraphic tradition was founded in the 17th century by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]]. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Muhammad's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of Muhammad, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.  Several parts of the complex design were named after parts of the body, from the head downwards, indicating the explicit intention of the hilya as a substitute for a figurative depiction.&lt;ref name="Peters2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Peters|title=Jesus and Muhammad: Parallel Tracks, Parallel Lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olEi-1LZYYQC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=5 November 2011|date=10 November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974746-7|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan E.

The Ottoman ''hilye'' format customarily starts with a [[basmala]], shown on top, and is separated in the middle by {{cite quran|21|107|style=ref}}: "And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds".&lt;ref name="Brockopp2010" /&gt; Four compartments set around the central one often contain the names of the [[Rashidun|Rightly-Guided Caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]], each followed by "radhi Allahu anhu" ("may God be pleased with him").

&lt;/div&gt;

===Calligraphic representations===
The most common visual representation of the Muhammad in Islamic art, especially in Arabic-speaking areas, is by a calligraphic representation of his name, a sort of [[monogram]] in roughly circular form, often given a decorated frame. Such inscriptions are normally in Arabic, and may rearrange or repeat forms, or add a blessing or honorific, or for example the word "messenger" or a contraction of it.  The range of ways of representing Muhammad's name is considerable, including [[ambigram]]s; he is also frequently symbolised by a rose.

The more elaborate versions relate to other Islamic traditions of special forms of calligraphy such as those writing the [[Names of God in Islam|names of God]], and the secular [[tughra]] or elaborate monogram of Ottoman rulers.

===Figurative visual depictions===
[[File:Medieval Persian manuscript Muhammad leads Abraham Moses Jesus.jpg|thumb|Muhammad leads [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]] and others in prayer. Persian miniature]]
Throughout Islamic history, depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art were rare.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Even so, there exists a "notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times".&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"&gt;Gruber (2005), p. 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of [[Persian miniature]]s as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the [[Persianate]] world (''Warka and Gulshah'', [[Topkapi Palace]] Library H. 841, attributed to [[Konya]] 1200–1250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, p. 19; Gruber (2005), p. 235 (from where the date range), Blair, Sheila S., ''The Development of the Illustrated Book in Iran'', ''Muqarnas'', Vol. 10, Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar (1993), p. 266, BRILL, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523191 JSTOR] says "c. 1250"&lt;/ref&gt;

This book dates to before or just around the time of the [[Mongol invasion]] of [[Anatolia]] in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom  |author2=S. Blair |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiane Gruber traces a development from "veristic" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more "abstract" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of [[calligraphic]] representation, with the older types also remaining in use.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229, and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the "inscribed portrait" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with "Ya Muhammad" ("O Muhammad") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to [[Sufi]] thought.  In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2005, p. 240-241"/&gt; According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2005), 229&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the [[Ilkhanid]] period under the new [[Mongol]] rulers, including a ''[[Marzubannama]]'' dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid [[MS Arab 161]] of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of [[Al-Biruni]]'s ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and [[`Ali]] according to [[Shi`ite]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), pp.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote [[Sunni]] Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), quote p. 43; generally pp.29-45&lt;/ref&gt; although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the [[Jalayrid]] period of Shia rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Tauris Academic Studies| isbn = 1-84511-499-X| last = Gruber| first = Christiane| title = The Ilkhanid Book of Ascension| date = 2010-03-15| page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siyer-i Nebi 158b.jpg|thumb|upright|Muhammad, shown with a veiled face and halo, at [[Mount Hira]] (16th-century Ottoman illustration of the [[Siyer-i Nebi]])]]
Depictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dynasties, and Turkish [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]'' commissioned by the Ottoman sultan [[Murat III]] for his son, the future [[Mehmed III]], containing over 800 illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Hürriyet Vakfı Yayınları| last = Tanındı| first = Zeren| title = Siyer-i nebî: İslam tasvir sanatında Hz. Muhammedʹin hayatı| year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the commonest narrative scene represented is the [[Mi'raj]]; according to Gruber, "There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (Iranica)&lt;/ref&gt;  These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 [[Rajab]], when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: "Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences".  Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from much earlier appear to have fulfilled the same function.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.43&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise a large number of different scenes may be represented at times, from Muhammad's birth to the end of his life, and his existence in Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;The birth is rare, but appears in an early manuscript in Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Halo ====
In the earliest depictions Muhammad may be shown with or without a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the earliest halos being round in the style of Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 95&lt;/ref&gt; but before long a flaming halo or [[aureole]] in the [[Buddhist]] or Chinese tradition becomes more common than the circular form found in the West, when a halo is used.  A halo or flame may surround only his head, but often his whole body, and in some images the body itself cannot be seen for the halo.  This "luminous" form of representation avoided the issues caused by "veristic" images, and could be taken to convey qualities of Muhammad's person described in texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, 230, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  If the body is visible, the face may be covered with a veil (see gallery for examples of both types). This form of representation, which began at the start of the [[Safavid]] period in Persia,&lt;ref&gt;Brend, Barbara. ''Islamic Art'', p. 161, British Museum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was done out of reverence and respect.&lt;ref name="Arnold"/&gt; Other [[prophets of Islam]], and Muhammad's wives and relations, may be treated in similar ways if they also appear.

[[Thomas Walker Arnold|T. W. Arnold]] (1864–1930), an early historian of Islamic art, stated that "Islam has never welcomed painting as a handmaid of religion as both Buddhism and Christianity have done. Mosques have never been decorated with religious pictures, nor has a pictorial art been employed for the instruction of the heathen or for the edification of the faithful."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Comparing Islam to Christianity, he also writes: "Accordingly, there has never been any historical tradition in the religious painting of Islam – no artistic development in the representation of accepted types – no schools of painters of religious subjects; least of all has there been any guidance on the part of leaders of religious thought corresponding to that of ecclesiastical authorities in the Christian Church."&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

Images of Muhammad remain controversial to the present day, and are not considered acceptable in many countries in the Middle East.  For example, in 1963 an account by a Turkish author of a [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] was banned in [[Pakistan]] because it contained reproductions of miniatures showing Muhammad unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie, ''Deciphering the signs of God: a phenomenological approach to Islam'', p.45, n. 86, SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7914-1982-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Iran===
[[File:760 - Jeune arabe.jpg|thumb|upright|A colourised version of the original photograph by [[Lehnert &amp; Landrock (disambiguation)|Lehnert &amp; Landrock]], which later became the base of an Iranian depiction of a young Muhammad.]]
Despite the ban on the representation of Muhammad, images of Muhammed are not uncommon in Iran. The Iranian Shi'ism seems more tolerant on this point than Sunnite orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; In Iran, depictions have considerable acceptance to the present day, and may be found in the modern forms of the poster and [[postcard]].&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruber (2010), p.253, illustrates a postcard bought in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, experts in Islamic iconography discovered images, printed on paper in Iran, portraying Mohammed as a teenager wearing a turban.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; There are several variants, all show the same juvenile face, identified by an inscription such as "Muhammad, the Messenger of God", or a more detailed legend referring to an episode in the life of Muhammad and the supposed origin of the image.&lt;ref name="etudes"/&gt; Some Iranian versions of these posters attributed the original depiction to a [[Bahira]], a Christian monk who met the young Muhammad in Syria. By crediting the image to a Christian and predating it to the time before Muhammad became a prophet, the manufacturers of the image exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="iconic"/&gt;

The motif was taken from a photograph of a young Tunisian taken by the Germans [[Rudolf Franz Lehnert]] and [[Ernst Heinrich Landrock]] in 1905 or 1906, which had been printed in high editions on picture post cards till 1921.&lt;ref name="etudes"&gt;Pierre Centlivres, Micheline Centlivres-Demont: [http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/index747.html Une étrange rencontre. La photographie orientaliste de Lehnert et Landrock et l'image iranienne du prophète Mahomet], ''Études photographiques'' Nr. 17, November 2005 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; This depiction has been popular in Iran as a form of curiosity.&lt;ref name="iconic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/mohammed/ |title=Mohammed  {{!}} Iconic Photos |publisher=Iconicphotos.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tehran]], a mural depicting the prophet – his face veiled – riding [[Buraq]] was installed at a public road intersection in 2008, the only mural of its kind in a Muslim-majority country.&lt;ref name="GruberHaugbolle2013"&gt;Christiane Gruber: [https://www.academia.edu/4061369/Images_of_the_Prophet_In_and_Out_of_Modernity_The_Curious_Case_of_a_2008_Mural_in_Tehran Images of the Prophet In and Out of Modernity: The Curious Case of a 2008 Mural in Tehran], in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLfEClsscNIC&amp;pg=PA25|title=Visual Culture in the Modern Middle East: Rhetoric of the Image|author1=Christiane Gruber|author2=Sune Haugbolle|date=17 July 2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00894-7|pages=3–31}} See also [http://arthistorygradforum.tumblr.com/post/74830788716] and [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Motahhari+-+Modarres+Exit,+Tehran,+Iran/@35.724081,51.424456,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m5!1e2!3m3!1s89306537!2e1!3e10!4m2!3m1!1s0x3f8e015c2dbdb1c7:0x86a5a3f81513f9a2].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|List of films about Muhammad|Depictions of Muhammad in film}}
Very few films have been made about Muhammad.  The 1976 film ''The Message'', also known as ''[[Mohammad, Messenger of God]]'', focused on other persons and never directly showed Muhammad or most members of his family.  A devotional cartoon called ''[[Muhammad: The Last Prophet]]'' was released in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finemediagroup.com/user/finemedia/press.cfm|title=Fine Media Group|accessdate=2006-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi was released in 2015 named ''[[Muhammad (2015 film)|Muhammad]]''. It is the first part of the trilogy film series on Muhammad by Majid Majidi.

While [[Sunni]] Muslims have always explicitly prohibited the depiction of Muhammad on film,&lt;ref name=fatwa_important&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alessandra. Raengo  |author2=Robert Stam  |lastauthoramp=yes |title = A Companion To Literature And Film |publisher = Blackwell Publishing |year = 2004|isbn=0-631-23053-X |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary [[Shi'a]] scholars have taken a more relaxed attitude, stating that it is permissible to depict Muhammad, even in television or movies, if done with respect.&lt;ref name=sistani&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1 |title=Istifta |accessdate=2006-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017223013/http://www.sistani.org/html/eng/menu/4/?lang=eng&amp;view=d&amp;code=234&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2006-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction by non-Muslims==
{{Commons category|Western depictions of Muhammad}}
Western representations of Muhammad were very rare until the explosion of images following the invention of the [[printing press]]; he is shown in a few medieval images, normally in an unflattering manner, often influenced by his brief mention in [[Dante|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.  Muhammad sometimes figures in Western depictions of groups of influential people in world history. Such depictions tend to be favourable or neutral in intent; one example can be found at the [[United States Supreme Court building#Sculptural program|United States Supreme Court building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Created in 1935, the frieze includes major historical lawgivers, and places Muhammad alongside [[Hammurabi]], [[Moses]], [[Confucius]], and others. In 1997, a controversy erupted surrounding the frieze, and tourist materials have since been edited to describe the depiction as "a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor to honor Muhammad" that "bears no resemblance to Muhammad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrepublican.com/sup_crt_frieze.html|title=The Daily Republican: Supreme Court Frieze|accessdate=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, a statue of Muhammad was removed from a courthouse in New York City after the ambassadors of [[Indonesia]], Pakistan, and [[Egypt]] requested its removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210055800/http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com/pubarchive_show_message.php?montrealmuslimnews+7289|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-10|accessdate=2006-03-10|date=2006-02-12|title=Archive "Montreal News Network": Images of Muhammad, Gone for Good}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely rare representations of Muhammad in [[monumental sculpture]] are especially likely to be offensive to Muslims, as the statue is the classic form for idols, and a fear of any hint of idolatry is the basis of Islamic prohibitions. Islamic art has almost always avoided large sculptures of any subject, especially free-standing ones; only a few animals are known, mostly fountain-heads, like those in the Lion Court of the [[Alhambra]]; the [[Pisa Griffin]] is perhaps the largest.

In 1997, the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]], a Muslim advocacy group in the United States, wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] requesting that the sculpted representation of [[Muhammad]] on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. The court rejected CAIR's request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%e2%80%9cban%e2%80%9d-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 MSN : "How the “Ban” on Images of Muhammad Came to Be" by Jackie Bischof]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526045614/http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/other/how-the-%E2%80%9Cban%E2%80%9D-on-images-of-muhammad-came-to-be/ar-AA8lQj0 |date=May 26, 2015 }} January 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been numerous book illustrations showing Muhammad.

[[Dante]], in ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|The Divine Comedy: Inferno]]'', placed Muhammad in Hell, with his entrails hanging out (Canto 28):

:No barrel, not even one where the hoops and staves go every which way, was ever split open like one frayed Sinner I saw, ripped from chin to where we fart&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove--&gt; below.
:His guts hung between his legs and displayed His vital organs, including that wretched sack Which converts to shit&lt;!-- this is the actual quotation; do not remove --&gt; whatever gets conveyed down the gullet.
:As I stared at him he looked back And with his hands pulled his chest open, Saying, ''"See how I split open the crack in myself! See how twisted and broken Mohammed is! Before me walks [[Ali]], his face Cleft from chin to crown, grief–stricken."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seth Zimmerman|title=The Inferno of Dante Alighieri |page=191 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3hWDEjN7JcC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2003 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-28090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene was sometimes shown in illustrations of the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' before modern times. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century [[fresco]] ''[[Last Judgement]]'' by [[Giovanni da Modena]] and drawing on Dante, in the [[Church of San Petronio]], [[Bologna, Italy]].&lt;ref name=fresco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,742914,00.html|title=Al-Qaida plot to blow up Bologna church fresco|date=2002-06-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Philip Willan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artwork by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[William Blake]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/02/11/MNGRCH6UQK1.DTL|title=What's behind Muslim cartoon outrage|date=2006-02-11|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Ayesha Akram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies in the 21st century==
The start of the 21st century has been marked by controversies over depictions of Muhammad, not only for recent caricatures or cartoons, but also regarding the display of historical artwork.

[[File:Mohammeds Berufung, Hosemann 1847.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Die Berufung Mohammeds durch den Engel Gabriel'' by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1847, published by ''Spiegel'' in 1999]]
In a story on morals at the end of the millennium in December 1999, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, [[Jesus]], [[Confucius]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. In the subsequent weeks, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing the picture of Muhammad. The Turkish TV-station [[Show TV]] broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613871.html Terror am Telefon], ''Spiegel'', February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadeem Elyas, leader of the [[Central Council of Muslims in Germany]] said that the picture should not be printed again in order to avoid hurting the feelings of Muslims intentionally. Elyas recommended to whiten the face of Muhammad instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carolin Emcke]]: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-15613870.html Fanatiker sind leicht verführbar], Interview with Nadeem Elyas, February 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, the ''Spiegel'' with consideration of Islamic laws published a picture of Muhammed with a whitened face on its title page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45774322.html, 6. Februar 2006 Betr.: Titel], ''Spiegel'', 6 February 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same picture of Muhammad by Hosemann had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, but then without evoking similar protests.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiegel Special'' 1, 1998, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Italian police reported that they had disrupted a terrorist plot to destroy a church in [[Bologna]], which contains a 15th-century [[fresco]] depicting an image of Muhammad (see above).&lt;ref name=fresco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D9163CF931A1575BC0A9649C8B63|title=Italy frees Fresco Suspects|date=2002-08-22|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of depictions of Muhammad being altered include a 1940 mural at the [[University of Utah]] having the name of Muhammad removed from beneath the painting in 2000 at the request of Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad depiction controversy lurks in U’s past|url=http://archive.dailyutahchronicle.com/2006/02/22/muhammad-depiction-controversy-lurks-in-us-past/|work=Daily Utah Chronicle|agency=University of Utah|date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published a set of [[editorial cartoons]], many of which depicted Muhammad. In late 2005 and early 2006, Danish Muslim organizations ignited a [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversy]] through public protests and by spreading knowledge of the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref name=Halicks/&gt; According to John Woods, Islamic history professor at the University of Chicago, it was not simply the depiction of Muhammad that was offensive, but the implication that Muhammad was somehow a supporter of terrorism.&lt;ref name=explaining/&gt; In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of ''Jyllands-Posten'', but Foreign Affairs Minister [[Laila Freivalds]] and the [[Swedish Security Service]] pressured the [[internet service provider]] to shut the page down.

[[File:South park muhammad.jpg|thumb|Muhammad appeared in the 2001 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Super Best Friends]]". The image was later removed from the 2006 episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]" and the 2010 episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" due to controversies regarding Muhammad cartoons in European newspapers.]]
In 2006, the controversial American [[animated]] television comedy program ''[[South Park]]'', which had previously depicted Muhammad as a [[superhero]] character in the July 4, 2001 episode "[[Super Best Friends]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Super Best Friends | episodelink = Super Best Friends | series = South Park | serieslink = South Park | airdate = 2001-07-04 | season = 5 | number = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/15/south-parks-been-showing-muhammad-all-season/ |title=Ryan j Budke.

In the episode, "[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to [[Peter Griffin]], a character from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[Family Guy]]''. However, [[Comedy Central]], who airs ''South Park'', rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the [[Islamic world]]. The creators of ''South Park'' reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's [[double standard]] for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of "Cartoon Wars Part II" in which [[President of the United States|American president]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Jesus]] defecate on the [[flag of the United States]].

The [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]] began in July 2007 with a series of drawings by [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist [[Lars Vilks]] which depicted Muhammad as a [[roundabout dog]]. Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on August 18 to illustrate an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from [[Islam in Sweden|Muslims in Sweden]] as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=2007-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release |title=PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE PUBLICATION OF OFFENSIVE SKETCH IN SWEDEN |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=2007-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]]&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jordan]],&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the inter-governmental [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC).&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release |title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy occurred about one and a half years after the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark in early 2006.

Another controversy emerged in September 2007 when [[Bangladesh]]i cartoonist [[Arifur Rahman]] was detained on suspicion of showing disrespect to Muhammad.  The interim government confiscated copies of the [[Bengali language|Bengali]]-language ''[[Prothom Alo]]'' in which the drawings appeared. The cartoon consisted of a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man.  The man asks the boy his name, and he replies "Babu". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name.

He then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies "Muhammad the cat". The cartoon caused a firestorm in Bangladesh, with militant [[Islamists]] demanding that Rahman be executed for [[blasphemy]]. A group of people [[book burning|torched copies of the paper]] and several Islamic groups protested, saying the drawings ridiculed Mohammad and his companions. They demanded "exemplary punishment" for the paper's editor and the cartoonist. Bangladesh does not have a [[blasphemy law]], although one had been demanded by the same extremist Islamic groups.

On November 2, 2010, the office of the French satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' at Paris was attacked with a firebomb and its website hacked, after it had announced plans to publish a special edition with Muhammad as its “chief editor”, and the title page with a cartoon of Muhammad had been pre-issued on social media.

In September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which feature nude caricatures of him. In January 2013, ''Charlie Hebdo'' announced that they would make a [[comic book]] on the life of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Jerome|title=It's Charlie Hebdo's right to draw Muhammad, but they missed the opportunity to do something profound|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/its-charlie-hebdos-right-to-draw-muhammad-but-they-missed-the-opportunity-to-do-something-profound-8435693.html|accessdate=12 October 2014|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, commonly known as [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]''.

The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in January 2010 confirmed to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that it had quietly removed all historic paintings which contained depictions of Muhammad from public exhibition. The Museum quoted objections on the part of conservative Muslims which were "under review."  The museum's action was criticized as excessive [[political correctness]], as were other decisions taken close to the same time, including the renaming of the "Primitive Art Galleries" to the "Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas" and the projected "Islamic Galleries" to "Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/jihad_jitters_at_met_76yj3VNUy4hcRAnhOcPCHP 'Jihad' jitters at Met – Mohammed art gone] by Isabel Vincent, 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the [[Internet]] on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing representing Muhammad, on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit [[freedom of speech]].

{{Certainty}}

'''Determinism''' is the philosophical idea that all events, including moral choices, are determined completely by previously existing causes. Determinism is at times understood to preclude free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do. It can also be called as [[hard determinism]] from this point of view. [[Hard determinism]] is a position on the relationship of determinism to free will. The theory holds that the universe is utterly rational because complete knowledge of any given situation assures that unerring knowledge of its future is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/determinism Determinism] Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers suggest variants around this basic definition.&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;A list of a dozen varieties of determinism is provided in {{cite book |title=Free Will: The Scandal in Philosophy |author=Bob Doyle |pages=145–146 ''ff'' |isbn=0983580200 |year=2011 |publisher=I-Phi Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeA_gFfHMgoC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. The opposite of determinism is some kind of [[indeterminism]] (otherwise called nondeterminism). Determinism is often contrasted with [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;For example, see {{cite book |title=Freewill and determinism: a study of rival conceptions of man |author=Richard Langdon Franklin |year=1968 |publisher=Routledge &amp; K. Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51wIAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism often is taken to mean ''causal determinism'', which in physics is known as cause-and-effect. It is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. This meaning can be distinguished from other varieties of determinism mentioned below.

Other debates often concern the scope of determined systems, with some maintaining that the entire universe is a single determinate system and others identifying other more limited determinate systems (or [[multiverse]]). Numerous historical debates involve many philosophical positions and varieties of determinism. They include debates concerning determinism and free will, technically denoted as [[compatibilistic]] (allowing the two to coexist) and [[incompatibilistic]] (denying their coexistence is a possibility). Determinism should not be confused with [[Self-determination_theory|self-determination]] of human actions by reasons, motives, and desires. Determinism rarely requires that perfect [[prediction]] be practically possible.

==Varieties==
"Determinism" may commonly refer to any of the following viewpoints:

[[File:Bled (9664110474).jpg|thumb|right|140px|Many philosophical theories of determinism frame themselves with the idea that reality follows a sort of predetermined path.]]
* Causal determinism is "the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature".&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hoefer |first=Carl | title=Causal Determinism | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2009 edition) |date=Apr 1, 2008 |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2009/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings something about. In other words, even though our deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, it is still the case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way".&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 |date=Nov 18, 2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/moral-responsibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing in the universe that is uncaused or [[causa sui|self-caused]]. [[Historical determinism]] (a sort of [[path dependence]]) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions.&lt;ref name=StanfordIncompatibilism&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ Arguments for Incompatibilism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding events&amp;mdash;a combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="SEPcausaldeterminism"/&gt; Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).&lt;ref name="SEPmoralresponsibility"/&gt;
** {{anchor|Nomological determinism}} Nomological determinism is the most common form of causal determinism. It is the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Nomological determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]].&lt;ref name=laplace&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Nomological determinism is sometimes called 'scientific' determinism, although that is a misnomer. Physical determinism is generally used synonymously with nomological determinism (its opposite being [[Indeterminism|physical indeterminism]]).
** [[Necessitarianism]] is closely related to the causal determinism described above. It is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that denies all mere possibility; there is exactly one way for the world to be.

A weaker version holds that, though not predestined to happen, everything that happens has been eternally known by virtue of the divine foreknowledge of an omniscient divinity. If this divinity is also omnipotent, as in the case of the Judeo-Christian religions, this weaker version is hard to distinguish from the previous one because, though able to prevent what happens and knowing that it is going to happen, God lets it happen. To this, advocates of free will reply that God permits it to happen in order to make room for the free will of humans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;mdash;"because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed".&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism|quote=Theological determinism constitutes a fifth kind of determinism.

Either way, the consequence is that everything that happens becomes God's action, and determinism is closely linked to divine action and God's omnipotence. According to the second type of theological determinism, God has perfect knowledge of everything in the universe because God is omniscient. And, as some say, because God is outside of time, God has the capacity of knowing past, present, and future in one instance. This means that God knows what will happen in the future. And because God's omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (i.e. they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J.

We might think of God here as the all-powerful movie director who writes script and causes everything to go accord with it. We should note, as an aside, that there is some debate over what would be sufficient for theological determinism to be true. Some people claim that God's merely knowing what will happen determines that it will, while others believe that God must not only know but must also cause those events to occur in order for their occurrence to be determined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions", more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

* Logical determinism or ''Determinateness'' is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either [[Law of excluded middle|true or false]]. Note that one can support causal determinism without necessarily supporting logical determinism and vice versa (depending on one's views on the nature of [[time]], but also [[randomness]]). The problem of free will is especially salient now with logical determinism: how can choices be free, given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (i.e. it is already determined as either true or false)? This is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]]. [[File:Iimatyas.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Adequate determinism focuses on [[quantum mechanics|the fact that]], even without a full understanding of microscopic physics, we can predict the distribution of 1000 coin tosses.]]
** Often synonymous with logical determinism are the ideas behind spatio-temporal determinism or [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]: the view of special relativity. [[J. J. C. Smart]], a proponent of this view, uses the term "tenselessness" to describe the simultaneous existence of past, present, and future. In physics, the "block universe" of [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Albert Einstein]] assumes that time is a fourth dimension (like the three spatial dimensions). In other words, all the other parts of time are real, like the city blocks up and down a street, although the order in which they appear depends on the driver (see [[Rietdijk–Putnam argument]]).
* Adequate determinism is the idea that [[quantum indeterminacy]] can be ignored for most macroscopic events. This is because of [[quantum decoherence]]. Random quantum events "average out" in the [[Expected value|limit of large numbers]] of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of classical mechanics).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/adequate_determinism.html The Information Philosopher website], "Adequate Determinism", from the site: "''We are happy to agree with scientists and philosophers who feel that quantum effects are for the most part negligible in the macroscopic world. We particularly agree that they are negligible when considering the causally determined will and the causally determined actions set in motion by decisions of that will.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of [[quantum mechanics]] is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the predictions of [[classical mechanics]], which are quite accurate (albeit still [[Uncertainty principle|not perfectly certain]]) at larger scales.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: "the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets.", and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (emphasis in original, discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; Something as large as an [[cell (biology)|animal cell]], then, would be "adequately determined" (even in light of quantum indeterminacy).
* The [[many-worlds interpretation]] accepts the linear causal sets of sequential events with adequate consistency yet also suggests constant forking of causal chains creating "multiple universes" to account for multiple outcomes from single events.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Adrian. "One world versus many: the inadequacy of Everettian accounts of evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation." Many worlds (2010): 307–354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning the causal set of events leading to the present are all valid yet appear as a singular linear time stream within a much broader unseen conic probability field of other outcomes that "split off" from the locally observed timeline.  Under this model causal sets are still "consistent" yet not exclusive to singular iterated outcomes.  The interpretation side steps the exclusive retrospective causal chain problem of "could not have done otherwise" by suggesting "the other outcome does exist" in a set of parallel universe time streams that split off when the action occurred.  This theory is sometimes described with the example of agent based choices but more involved models argue that recursive causal splitting occurs with all particle wave functions at play.&lt;ref&gt;Vaidman, Lev. "Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics." (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  This model is highly contested with multiple objections from the scientific community.

==Philosophical connections==

===With nature/nurture controversy===
[[File:JuliusOttoGrimm-Sculpture.jpg|thumb|140px|Nature and nurture interact in humans. A scientist looking at a sculpture after some time does not ask whether we are seeing the effects of the starting materials or of environmental influences.]]
Although some of the above forms of determinism concern human behaviors and [[cognition]], others frame themselves as an answer to the debate on [[nature and nurture]]. They will suggest that one factor will entirely determine behavior. As scientific understanding has grown, however, the strongest versions of these theories have been widely rejected as a [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]].&lt;ref name="melo-martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Melo-Martín I|title=Firing up the nature/nurture controversy: bioethics and genetic determinism |journal=J Med Ethics|volume=31 |issue=9|pages=526–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16131554 |pmc=1734214|doi=10.1136/jme.2004.008417|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the modern deterministic theories attempt to explain how the interaction of both nature ''and'' nurture is entirely predictable. The concept of [[heritability]] has been helpful in making this distinction.

[[Biological determinism]], sometimes called [[genetic determinism]], is the idea that each of human behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by human genetic nature.

[[Behaviorism]] involves the idea that all behavior can be traced to specific causes—either environmental or reflexive. [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]] developed this nurture-focused determinism.

[[Cultural determinism]] or [[social determinism]] is the nurture-focused theory that the culture in which we are raised determines who we are.

[[Environmental determinism]], also known as climatic or geographical determinism, proposes that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture. Supporters of environmental determinism often{{quantify|date=August 2014}} also support [[Behaviorism|Behavioral determinism]]. Key proponents of this notion have included [[Ellen Churchill Semple]], [[Ellsworth Huntington]], [[Thomas Griffith Taylor]] and possibly [[Jared Diamond]], although his status as an environmental determinist is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

===With particular factors===
[[File:Using Mobile Phone 0251.JPG|thumb|right|150px|A technological determinist might suggest that technology like the mobile phone is the greatest factor shaping human civilization.]]
Other 'deterministic' theories actually seek only to highlight the importance of a particular factor in predicting the future. These theories often use the factor as a sort of guide or constraint on the future. They need not suppose that complete knowledge of that one factor would allow us to make perfect predictions.

[[Psychological determinism]] can mean that humans must act according to reason, but it can also be synonymous with some sort of [[Psychological egoism]]. The latter is the view that humans will always act according to their perceived best interest.

[[Linguistic determinism]] claims that our language determines (at least limits) the things we can think and say and thus know. The [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] argues that individuals experience the world based on the grammatical structures they habitually use.

[[Economic determinism]] attributes primacy to economic structure over politics in the development of human history. It is associated with the [[dialectical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]].

[[Technological determinism]] is a reductionist theory that presumes that a society's technology drives the development of its social structure and cultural values.

===With free will===
{{Main article|Free will}}
[[File:DeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|right|300px|A table showing the different positions related to free will and determinism]]
Philosophers have debated both the truth of determinism, and the truth of free will. This creates the four possible positions in the figure. [[Compatibilism]] refers to the view that [[free will]] is, in some sense, compatible with determinism. The three [[incompatibilist]] positions, on the other hand, deny this possibility. The [[hard incompatibilism|hard incompatibilists]] hold that both determinism and free will do not exist, the [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianists]] that determinism does not hold, and free will might exist, and the [[hard determinism|hard determinists]] that determinism does hold and free will does not exist.

The standard argument against free will, according to philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] focuses on the implications of determinism for 'free will'.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. C. Smart, "Free-Will, Praise and Blame,"''Mind'', July 1961, p.293-4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he suggests free will is denied whether determinism is true or not. On one hand, if determinism is true, all our actions are predicted and we are assumed not to be free; on the other hand, if determinism is false, our actions are presumed to be random and as such we do not seem free because we had no part in controlling what happened.

In his book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', author and neuroscientist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] also argues against free will. He offers one thought experiment where a mad scientist represents determinism. In Harris' example, the mad scientist uses a machine to control all the desires, and thus all the behavior, of a particular human. Harris believes that it is no longer as tempting, in this case, to say the victim has "free will". Harris says nothing changes if the machine controls desires at random - the victim still seems to lack free will. Harris then argues that we are also the victims of such unpredictable desires (but due to the unconscious machinations of our brain, rather than those of a mad scientist). Based on this introspection, he writes "This discloses the real mystery of free will: if our experience is compatible with its utter absence, how can we say that we see any evidence for it in the first place?"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.216, note102&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "Whether they are predictable or not, we do not cause our causes."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape (2010), pg.217, note109&lt;/ref&gt; That is, he believes there is compelling [[evidence of absence]] of free will.

===With the soul===
Some determinists argue that [[materialism]] does not present a complete understanding of the universe, because while it can describe determinate interactions among material things, it ignores the [[mind]]s or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of conscious beings.

A number of positions can be delineated:

# Immaterial souls are all that exist ([[Idealism]]).
# Immaterial souls exist and exert a non-deterministic causal influence on bodies. (Traditional free-will, [[interactionist dualism]]).&lt;ref&gt;By 'soul' in the context of (1) is meant an [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] immaterial agent that has the power to control the body but not to be controlled by the body (this theory of determinism thus conceives of conscious agents in [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] terms). Therefore the soul stands to the activities of the individual agent's body as does the creator of the universe to the universe. The creator of the universe put in motion a deterministic system of material entities that would, if left to themselves, carry out the chain of events determined by ordinary causation. But the creator also provided for souls that could exert a causal force analogous to the primordial causal force and alter outcomes in the physical universe via the acts of their bodies. Thus, it emerges that no events in the physical universe are uncaused. Some are caused entirely by the original creative act and the way it plays itself out through time, and some are caused by the acts of created souls. But those created souls were not created by means of physical processes involving ordinary causation. They are another order of being entirely, gifted with the power to modify the original creation. However, determinism is not necessarily limited to matter; it can encompass energy as well. The question of how these immaterial entities can act upon material entities is deeply involved in what is generally known as the [[mind-body problem]]. It is a significant problem which philosophers have not reached agreement about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/ Free Will (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Immaterial souls exist, but are part of deterministic framework.
# Immaterial souls exist, but exert no causal influence, free or determined ([[epiphenomenalism]], [[occasionalism]])
# Immaterial souls do not exist — there is no [[mind-body problem|mind-body]] [[dichotomy]], and there is a [[Materialism|Materialistic]] explanation for intuitions to the contrary.

===With ethics and morality===
Another topic of debate is the implication that Determinism has on [[Ethics|morality]]. [[Hard determinism]] (a belief in determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral judgments impossible. Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.

Philosopher and incompatibilist [[Peter van Inwagen]] introduces this thesis as such:

Argument that [[Free Will]] is Required for Moral Judgments
# The moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X implies that you should have done something else instead
# That you should have done something else instead implies that there was something else for you to do
# That there was something else for you to do implies that you could have done something else
# That you could have done something else implies that you have free will
# If you don't have free will to have done other than X we cannot make the moral judgment that you shouldn't have done X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Inwagen|first=Peter|title=The Powers of Rational Beings: Freedom of the Will|year=2009|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a compatibilist might have an issue with Inwagen's process because one can not change the past like his arguments center around. A compatibilist who centers around plans for the future might posit:
# The moral judgment that you should not have done X implies that you can do something else instead
# That you can do something else instead implies that there is something else for you to do
# That there is something else for you to do implies that you can do something else
# That you can do something else implies that you have free will for planning future recourse
# If you have free will to do other than X we can make the moral judgment that you should do other than X, and punishing you as a responsible party for having done X that you know you should not have done can help you remember to not do X in the future.

== History ==
Determinism has been established by the Greek philosophers, during the 7th and 6th centuries BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus, Leucippus and mainly by the Stoics with the universal causal determinism and Aristotle. Some of the main philosophers who have dealt with this issue are [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Baron d'Holbach]] (Paul Heinrich Dietrich), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[William James]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and, more recently, [[John Searle]], [[Sam Harris]], [[Ted Honderich]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].

Mecca Chiesa notes that the [[probabilistic]] or selectionistic determinism of [[B.F. Skinner]] comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] at all. Mechanistic determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, Mecca (2004) ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy &amp; The Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ringen | first1 = J.

In the West, some elements of determinism have been expressed in Greece from the 6th century BC by the Presocratics Heraclitus&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 5 ([[Heraclitus]])&lt;/ref&gt;  and Leucippus.&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus ''Eclogae'' I 4 ([[Leucippus]])&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the [[Stoics]], as part of their theory of universal causal determinism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]] ''Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy'' (Oxford 1998) chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom,&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bobzien ''The Inadvertent Conception and Late Birth of the Free-Will Problem'' (Phronesis 43, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; an issue that is known in theology as the [[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]. The writings of [[Epictetus]] as well as [[Middle Platonist]] and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frede]] ''A Free Will: Origins of the Notion in Ancient Thought'' (Berkeley 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god:&lt;ref&gt;Though Moses Maimonides was not arguing against the existence of God, but rather for the incompatibility between the full '''exercise''' by God of his [[omniscience]] and genuine human [[free will]], his argument is considered by some as affected by Modal Fallacy. See, in particular, the article by Prof. Norman Swartz for ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm Foreknowledge and Free Will] and specifically [http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/foreknow.htm#section6 Section 6: The Modal Fallacy]&lt;/ref&gt; "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [that] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determinism in the West is often associated with [[Newtonian physics]], which depicts the physical matter of the universe as operating according to a set of fixed, knowable laws. The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of every event that will ever occur (''[[Laplace's demon]]''). In this sense, the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.

Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the [[speed of light]] and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.

[[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as any following physical theories are results of observations and experiments, and so they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in western philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, Norman (2003) The Concept of Physical Law / Chapter 10: Free Will and Determinism ( https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related theological views of [[Classical Pantheism]].

=== Eastern tradition ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2010}}
The idea that the entire universe is a [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic system]] has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religion, philosophy, and literature.

In ''[[I Ching]]'' and [[Philosophical Taoism]], the ebb and flow of favorable and unfavorable conditions suggests the path of least resistance is effortless (see [[wu wei]]).

In the philosophical schools of India, the concept of precise and continual effect of laws of [[Karma]] on the existence of all sentient beings is analogous to western deterministic concept. Karma is the concept of "action" or "deed" in Indian religions. It is understood as that which causes the entire cycle of cause and effect (i.e., the cycle called saṃsāra) originating in ancient India and treated in Hindu, Jain, and Sikh. Karma is considered predetermined and deterministic in the universe, and in combination with the decisions (free will) of living beings, accumulates to determine futuristic situations that the living being encounters.

=== Generative processes ===
{{Main article|Emergence}}
Although it was once thought by scientists that any indeterminism in quantum mechanics occurred at too small a scale to influence biological or neurological systems, there is indication that [[nervous system]]s are influenced by quantum indeterminism due to [[chaos theory]]{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It is unclear what implications this has for the problem of [[free will]] given various possible reactions to the problem in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–247 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many biologists don't grant determinism: Christof Koch argues against it, and in favour of [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]], by making arguments based on generative processes ([[emergence]]).&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koch |first1=Christof |authorlink1=Christof Koch |editor1-first=Nancy|editor1-last=Murphy |editor2-first=George |editor2-last=Ellis |editor3-first=Timothy|editor3-last=O'Connor |title=Downward Causation and the Neurobiology of Free Will |url= |date=September 2009 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=New York, USA|isbn=978-3-642-03204-2 |pages= |chapter=Free Will, Physics, Biology and the Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proponents of emergentist or [[emergence|generative philosophy]], [[cognitive science]]s and [[evolutionary psychology]], argue that a certain form of determinism (not necessarily causal) is true.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.

[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|120px|In [[Conway's Game of Life]], the interaction of just four simple rules creates patterns that seem somehow "alive".]]

As an illustration, the strategy board-games [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] have rigorous rules in which no information (such as cards' face-values) is hidden from either player and no [[randomness|random]] events (such as dice-rolling) happen within the game. Yet, chess and especially Go with its extremely simple deterministic rules, can still have an extremely large number of unpredictable moves. When chess is simplified to 7 or fewer pieces, however, endgame tables are available that dictate which moves to play to achieve a perfect game.  This implies that, given a less complex environment (with the original 32 pieces reduced to 7 or fewer pieces), a perfectly predictable game of chess is possible.  In this scenario, the winning player can announce that a checkmate will happen within a given number of moves, assuming a perfect defense by the losing player, or fewer moves if the defending player chooses sub-optimal moves as the game progresses into its inevitable, predicted conclusion. By this analogy, it is suggested, the experience of free will emerges from the interaction of finite rules and deterministic parameters that generate nearly infinite and practically unpredictable behavioural responses. In theory, if all these events could be accounted for, and there were a known way to evaluate these events, the seemingly unpredictable behaviour would become predictable.&lt;ref name= "Kenrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Nowak"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Axtell"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Epstein"/&gt; Another hands-on example of generative processes is [[John Horton Conway]]'s playable [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ John Conway's Game of Life]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] is wary of such models, and coined the term "[[ludic fallacy]]".

=== Compatibility with the existence of science ===
Certain [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] argue that while causal determinism in which everything including the brain/mind is subject to the laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the [[brain]] reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: Conjectures and refutations&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical models ===
Many [[mathematical models]] of physical systems are deterministic. This is true of most models involving [[differential equations]] (notably, those measuring rate of change over time). Mathematical models that are not deterministic because they involve randomness are called [[stochastic]]. Because of [[sensitive dependence on initial conditions]], some deterministic models may appear to behave non-deterministically; in such cases, a deterministic interpretation of the model may not be useful due to [[numerical instability]] and a finite amount of [[accuracy and precision|precision]] in measurement. Such considerations can motivate the consideration of a stochastic model even though the underlying system is governed by deterministic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Werndl | first1 = Charlotte | year = 2009 | title = Are Deterministic Descriptions and Indeterministic Descriptions Observationally Equivalent? | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.06.004 | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | bibcode = 2009SHPMP..40..232W | arxiv = 1310.1615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werndl, Charlotte (2009).

=== Quantum and Classical Mechanics ===

====Day-to-day physics====
{{further information|Macroscopic quantum phenomena}}
Since the beginning of the 20th century, [[quantum mechanics]]—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of [[Phenomenon|event]]s. Before that, [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]—the physics of everyday life—dominated. Taken in isolation (rather than as an [[approximation]] to quantum mechanics), Newtonian physics depicts a universe in which objects move in perfectly determined ways. At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet). But whereas in theory, [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute knowledge]] of the forces accelerating a bullet would produce an absolutely accurate prediction of its path, modern quantum mechanics casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism.

Relevant is the fact that [[certainty]] is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's [[problem of induction]]). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This is an example of the [[butterfly effect]], which is one of the subjects of [[chaos theory]]. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to [[predict]] real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to ''predict'' or attain ''certainty'' as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.

====[[Quantum realm]]====
Quantum physics works differently in many ways from Newtonian physics. Physicist [[Aaron D. O'Connell]] explains that understanding our universe, at such small scales as atoms, requires a different logic than day-to-day life does. O'Connell does not deny that it is all interconnected: the scale of human existence ultimately does emerge from the quantum scale. O'Connell argues that we must simply use different models and constructs when dealing with the quantum world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ted.com/2011/06/02/struggling-with-quantum-logic-qa-with-aaron-oconnell/ "Struggling with quantum logic: Q&amp;A with Aaron O'Connell]&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum mechanics is the product of a careful application of the [[scientific method]], [[logic]] and [[empiricism]]. The [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is frequently confused with the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]. The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time &amp;mdash; if we increase the accuracy in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose accuracy in measuring the other. "These uncertainty relations give us that measure of freedom from the limitations of classical concepts which is necessary for a consistent description of atomic processes."&lt;ref name="Heisenberg1930"&gt;{{cite book |first=Werner |last=Heisenberg |authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|year=1949 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie |trans-title=Physical Principles of Quantum Theory |location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel/University of Chicago Press |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzMBh4ZxKJsC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=9780486601137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|thumb|right|Although it is not possible to predict the trajectory of any one particle, they all obey determined probabilities which do permit some prediction.]]
This is where [[statistical mechanics]] come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. "Path" is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one that quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived path of the particle). As [[Stephen Hawking]] explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities.&lt;ref name=GDesign&gt;[[The Grand Design (book)|Grand Design]] (2010), page 32: ''"the molecular basis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws of physics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of the planets...so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion"'', and page 72: ''"Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed by laws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form of determinism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of nature determine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determining the future and past with certainty."'' (discussing a [[Many worlds interpretation]])&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development is at least as predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes [[wave function]]s that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many [[Quantum mechanics#Applications|applications]], and allow us to build [[transistors]] and [[lasers]]. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world.&lt;ref name="WhatIsItGoodFor?"&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=everyday-quantum-physics Scientific American, "What is Quantum Mechanics Good For?"]&lt;/ref&gt; None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of [[quantum mechanics]] are not still [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|up for debate]].

On the topic of predictable probabilities, the [[double-slit experiment]]s are a popular example. [[Photon]]s are fired one-by-one through a double-slit apparatus at a distant screen. Curiously, they do not arrive at any single point, nor even the two points lined up with the slits (the way you might expect of bullets fired by a fixed gun at a distant target). Instead, the light arrives in varying concentrations at widely separated points, and the distribution of its collisions with the target can be calculated reliably. In that sense the behavior of light in this apparatus is deterministic, but there is no way to predict where in the resulting [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern any individual [[photon]] will make its contribution (although, there may be ways to use [[weak measurement]] to acquire more information without violating the [[Uncertainty principle]]).

Some (including [[Albert Einstein]]) argue that our inability to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]] insisted that, "I am convinced God does not play dice" in a private letter to [[Max Born]], 4 December 1926, [http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 Albert Einstein Archives] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819045822/http://www.alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=38009 |date=19 August 2010 }} reel 8, item 180&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or "[[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable]]s" that determine ''absolutely'' in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.

[[John S. Bell]] criticized Einstein's work in his famous [[Bell's Theorem]], which proved that quantum mechanics can make statistical predictions that would be violated if local hidden variables really existed. A number of experiments have tried to verify such predictions, and so far they do not appear to be violated. Improved continue to verify the result, including the 2015 "[[Bell test experiments#Hensen et al..2C Giustina et al..2C Shalm et al. .282015.29: .22loophole-free.22 Bell tests|Loophole Free Test]]" that plugged all known sources of error and the 2017 "[[Bell test experiments#Johannes Handsteiner et al. .282017.29: .22Cosmic Bell Test.22 - Measurement Settings from Milky Way Stars|Cosmic Bell Test]]" that based the experiment cosmic data streaming from different directions toward the Earth, precluding the possibility the sources of data could have had prior interactions. However, it is possible to augment quantum mechanics with non-local hidden variables to achieve a deterministic theory that is in agreement with experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jabs | first=Arthur | year=2016 | title= A conjecture concerning determinism, reduction, and measurement in quantum mechanics | doi= 10.1007/s40509-016-0077-7 | journal= Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations | volume= 3 | issue= 4 | pages=279–292| arxiv=1204.0614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Bohm's Interpretation, though, violates special relativity and it is highly controversial whether or not it can be reconciled without giving up on determinism.

More advanced variations on these arguments include [[Quantum contextuality]], by Bell, [[Simon B. Kochen]] and [[Ernst Specker]] in which argues that hidden variable theories cannot be "sensible," which here means that the values of the hidden variables inherently depend on the devices used to measure them.

This debate is relevant because it is easy to imagine specific situations in which the arrival of an electron at a screen at a certain point and time would trigger one event, whereas its arrival at another point would trigger an entirely different event (e.g. see [[Schrödinger's cat]] - a thought experiment used as part of a deeper debate).

Thus, quantum physics casts reasonable doubt on the traditional determinism of classical, Newtonian physics in so far as reality does not seem to be absolutely determined. This was the subject of the famous [[Bohr–Einstein debates]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]] and there is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics#Comparison|still no consensus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop |first1=Robert C. |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Kane |title=The Oxford Handbook of Free Will |edition=Second |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=9780195399691 | oclc=653483691 |page=90 |chapter=Chaos, Indeterminism, and Free Will |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzcFDsWg0GEC&amp;pg=PA90 |quote=The key question is whether to understand the nature of this probability as epistemic or ontic. Along epistemic lines, one possibility is that there is some additional factor (i.e., a hidden mechanism) such that once we discover and understand this factor, we would be able to predict the observed behavior of the quantum stoplight with certainty (physicists call this approach a "hidden variable theory"; see, e.g., Bell 1987, 1–13, 29–39; Bohm 1952a, 1952b; Bohm and Hiley 1993; Bub 1997, 40–114, Holland 1993; see also the preceding essay in this volume by Hodgson). Or perhaps there is an interaction with the broader environment (e.g., neighboring buildings, trees) that we have not taken into account in our observations that explains how these probabilities arise (physicists call this approach decoherence or consistent histories&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;). Under either of these approaches, we would interpret the observed indeterminism in the behavior of stoplights as an expression of our ignorance about the actual workings. Under an ignorance interpretation, indeterminism would not be a fundamental feature of quantum stoplights, but merely epistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge about the system. Quantum stoplights would turn to be deterministic after all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim E.|title=Beyond Measure: Modern Physics, Philosophy, and the Meaning of Quantum Theory|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York|isbn=0-19-852536-2|oclc=52486237|page=203|chapter=Complementarity and Entanglement|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVdjwsqrgz8C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=scientific+consensus+determinism+bell+theorem&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4v8PUaL5MarK0QWk8oCwBw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific%20consensus%20determinism%20bell%20theorem&amp;f=false|quote=So, was Einstein wrong? In the sense that the EPR paper argued in favour of an objective reality for each quantum particle in an entangled pair independent of the other and of the measuring device, the answer must be yes. But if we take a wider view and ask instead if Einstein was wrong to hold to the realist's belief that the physics of the universe should be objective and deterministic, we must acknowledge that we cannot answer such a question. It is in the nature of theoretical science that there can be no such thing as certainty. A theory is only 'true' for as long as the majority of the scientific community maintain a consensus view that the theory is the one best able to explain the observations. And the story of quantum theory is not over yet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate determinism (see [[Determinism#Varieties|Varieties]], above) is the reason that Stephen Hawking calls [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|Libertarian free will]] "just an illusion".&lt;ref name="GDesign"/&gt; see [[Free will]] for further discussions on this topic.

====Other matters of quantum determinism====
{{essay|section|date=November 2017}}
{{unsourced section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:HEUraniumC.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Chaotic radioactivity is the next explanatory challenge for physicists supporting determinism.]]
All uranium found on earth is thought to have been synthesized during a [[supernova]] explosion that occurred roughly 5 billion years ago. Even before the laws of quantum mechanics were developed to their present level, the [[radioactivity]] of such elements has posed a challenge to determinism due to its unpredictability. One gram of [[uranium-238]], a commonly occurring radioactive substance, contains some 2.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. Each of these atoms are identical and indistinguishable according to all tests known to modern science. Yet about 12600 times a second, one of the atoms in that gram will decay, giving off an [[alpha particle]]. The challenge for determinism is to explain why and when decay occurs, since it does not seem to depend on external stimulus. Indeed, no extant theory of physics makes [[testable]] predictions of exactly when any given atom will decay. At best scientists can discover determined probabilities in the form of the element's [[half life]].

The time dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] gives the first time [[derivative]] of the [[quantum state]]. That is, it explicitly and uniquely predicts the development of the [[wave function]] with time.
::&lt;math&gt;i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}+V(x)\psi&lt;/math&gt;
So if the wave function itself is reality (rather than probability of classical coordinates), then the unitary evolution of the wave function in quantum mechanics, can be said to be deterministic. But the unitary evolution of the wave function is not the entirety of quantum mechanics.

Asserting that quantum mechanics is deterministic by treating the wave function itself as reality might be thought to imply a [[Universal wavefunction|single wave function for the entire universe]], starting at the origin of the universe. Such a "wave function of everything" would carry the probabilities of not just the world we know, but every other possible world that could have evolved. For example, large voids in the distributions of [[galaxy|galaxies]] are believed by many cosmologists to have originated in quantum fluctuations during the big bang. (''See'' [[cosmic inflation]], [[primordial fluctuations]] and [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]].)

However, neither the posited reality nor the proven and extraordinary accuracy of the wave function and quantum mechanics at small scales can imply or reasonably suggest the existence of a single wave function for the entire universe. Quantum mechanics breaks down wherever gravity becomes significant, because nothing in the wave function, or in quantum mechanics, predicts anything at all about gravity. And this is obviously of great importance on larger scales.

Gravity is thought of as a large-scale force, with a longer reach than any other. But gravity becomes significant even at masses that are tiny compared to the mass of the universe.

A wave function the size of the universe might successfully model a universe with no gravity. Our universe, with gravity, is vastly different from what quantum mechanics alone predicts. To forget this is a colossal error.

[[Objective collapse theory|Objective collapse theories]], which involve a dynamic (and non-deterministic) collapse of the wave function (e.g. [[Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory]], [[Penrose interpretation]], or [[causal fermion system]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) avoid these absurdities. The theory of [[causal fermion system]]s for example, is able to unify [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]], via a more fundamental theory that is non-linear, but gives rise to the linear behaviour of the wave function and also gives rise to the non-linear, non-deterministic, wave-function collapse. These theories suggest that a deeper understanding of the theory underlying quantum mechanics shows the universe is indeed non-deterministic at a fundamental level.

'''Developmental dysfluency''' is considered a normal part of childhood development. About twenty-five percent of children experience some loss in fluency.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of developmental dysfluency include the repetition of sounds or pauses between words. These symptoms have generally been noted within youngsters from 18 months to 5 years of age. This may persist for weeks or months but eventually disappears due to the maturation of the child's nervous system.

ex.: "Daddy, I was, I was, um, um, I was..."

Instances like the aforementioned example indicate that the child is learning to use language. On the other hand, children with [[stutter|stuttering disorder]], will likely repeat sounds or one-syllable words three or more times. They may also prolong sounds for two or more seconds. In comparison, stuttering can be seen as a process where a word appears to become "stuck," and the person may grimace, jerk the head or neck as he struggles to overcome the stutter.

Children with normal dysfluency tend to have stuttering difficulties that come and go. Generally this is during [[preschool]] years and the problem normally ceases altogether by the time a child starts school.

The '''Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance''' (EIEF) is a [[Rome]] based economics research institute, funded by the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]]. 

The Institute builds on the tradition of its predecessor, the Ente Luigi Einaudi, that has fostered economic research in Italy for the past fifty years.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

The Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance produces research, with an emphasis on policy relevant topics. It also seeks to influence public thinking and to train the next generation of scholars by running seminar series, graduate level courses and conferences.

The '''Ewa Reactor''' was [[Poland]]'s first research [[nuclear reactor]]. Its name was derived from the first letters of the [[Polish language|Polish]] words: '''''E'''ksperymentalny'' (Experimental), '''''W'''odny'' (Water), and '''''A'''tomowy'' (Atomic) as a reference to [[Ève Curie]].

==History==
The reactor was activated on June 14, 1958, in the Instytut Badań Jądrowych (Institute of Nuclear Research) (Currently the Instytut Energii Atomowej [Atomic Energy Institute] ) in [[Otwock]] near [[Warsaw]]. It was deactivated it in February 1995 due to a shortage of [[uranium]] for experiments, and reactivated in April of the same year after the acquisition of new fuel. The reactor is currently deactivated and partially dismantled.

Ewa was based on the Soviet [[LWR|VVR]]-S design, had an initial power of 2 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]], was fueled by [[Uranium enrichment|enriched uranium]], and moderated by pressurized water. In 1963 and 1967, the reactor underwent two major overhauls that improved the safety of the reaction and allowed for the use of better enriched fuels. After these changes, the reactor's power increased first to 4 MW and ultimately to 10 MW. Its primary use was for producing radioactive [[isotopes]]. It functioned an average of 3500 hours a year.

Because of its design, the reactor is currently considered a potential site for the future site of storage of the spent fuel from the [[Maria reactor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' is an annual promotional campaign which happens once every year, organized and funded by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] to increase awareness of Fairtrade products. It makes use of volunteers who support the goals of Fairtrade but who may also be committed to the more general concepts of fair trade, ethical trading or concerned by development issues. The concept was pioneered by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], initially held in 1997 in Scotland and directed by [[Barnaby Miln]].

The inaugural national launch was on 12 February 1997&lt;ref&gt;Herald, 13 February 1997, Retailing by Simon Bain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Evening News, 14 February 1997, Shop around for fair trade by John Vidal&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Augustine United Church]] on [[Edinburgh]]'s George IV Bridge by Lady [[Marion Fraser]], chairman of the charity [[Christian Aid]]. She broke a bar of Fairtrade chocolate to launch the event. It turned out to be a highly successful campaign to get every supermarket throughout Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Life and Work magazine, March 1997, Pester power puts fairness into focus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Episcopalian, April 1997, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Aid News, April/June 1997, Pester power rules! page 12&lt;/ref&gt; to stock Fairtrade products. Barnaby Miln sent supporters of Christian Aid Scotland, [[SCIAF]], [[Traidcraft]], [[Oxfam]] and the [[World Development Movement]] a list of 85 supermarkets in Scotland's cities and larger towns, and encouraged during the Fortnight to go and ask for Fairtrade products.

'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' spread to the rest of the United Kingdom the following year; today, Fairtrade Fortnights are celebrated in several countries, most notably [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Awareness raising and promotion of [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade certified products]] to the public are the main objectives of the Fortnight.

Usually events held during the fortnight include:
* Fetes
* Fairs
* [[Fairtrade]] food and drink tastings,
* Fashion shows
* Community, school, college and university events

These events are often supported by local authorities and governments, Fairtrade Steering Groups, dozens of [[charities]] and [[Alternative trading organization|ATOs]], all seeking to ensure that the local populace purchase fair and ethically traded goods. Local schools and colleges where Fairtrade is a frequently discussed topic can also play significant roles during Fairtrade Fortnight.

Events are highlighted and recorded on various nations' Fairtrade licensing bodies' websites (e.g. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK or [[Fairtrade Canada]]). Most media outlets are keen to support a fast-growing trend in which previously disadvantaged third world producers have a fairer market to sell their wares and develop their economic capabilities.

'''In 2018 Fairtrade Fortnight is celebrated from 28 February to 11 March.'''

==Criticism of Fairtrade==
{{Main|Fair trade debate}}

Critics in the [[Fair trade debate]] claim that some volunteers can have an incorrect view of Fairtrade, because the information is concealed from them,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P. (2012),  “Ethical Objections to Fairtrade”, Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm, Accessed 2 February 2012; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular that the evidence that little or none of the extra amount paid by consumers always reaches the producers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N.

Sellers, F. S. (2005), ‘Gift-wrapped guilt?’, Washington Post, 18 December.;
&lt;/ref&gt; and an alleged lack of evidence that Fairtrade has a positive impact on Third World producers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is now largely obsolete as FLO-CERT, the Fairtrade Foundation and other nations' representative organisations and overseas development agencies continue to publish commodity reports and market analyses clearly indicating the benefits of the Fairtrade certification scheme over standard free market trade.

Using volunteers who allegedly do not understand the facts has in the past been criticised by Messrs. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; in their report that The Day Chocolate Company, "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

Fairtrade International and The Fairtrade Foundation produce a significant volume of information and resources for volunteers and interested people who wish to learn more about all aspects of the Fairtrade framework, in addition to more in-depth commodity reports and market analyses across all commodity sectors where it licenses products.

A '''film''', also called a '''movie''', '''motion picture''', '''moving picture''', '''theatrical film''', or '''photoplay''', is a series of still images that, when shown on a [[Projection screen|screen]], create the illusion of moving images. (See the [[glossary of motion picture terms]].)

This [[optical illusion]] causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed in rapid succession. The process of [[filmmaking]] is both an [[art film|art]] and an [[film industry|industry]]. A film is created by [[photography|photographing]] actual scenes with a [[movie camera|motion-picture camera]], by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional [[animation]] techniques, by means of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]], or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other [[visual effects]].

The word "'''cinema'''", short for [[cinematography]], is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|title=The Movie Theater of the Future Will Be In Your Mind|last=Severny|first=Andrei|date=2013-09-05|work=[[Tribeca Film Festival|Tribeca]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907214603/http://tribecafilm.com/future-of-film/future-of-the-movie-theater-is-in-your-mind|archivedate=September 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films were originally recorded onto plastic film through a [[Photographic film|photochemical]] process and then shown through a [[movie projector]] onto a large screen. Contemporary films are now often [[Digital recording|fully digital]] through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]] (a graphic [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of the spoken words, music and other [[sound]]s that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected).

Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for [[documentary film|educating]]—or [[propaganda film|indoctrinating]]—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] to [[translation|translate]] the dialog into other languages.

The individual images that make up a film are called [[Film frame|frames]]. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as [[persistence of vision]], whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called the [[phi phenomenon]].

The name "film" originates from the fact that [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock]]) has historically been the [[Recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including ''picture'', ''picture show'', ''moving picture'', ''photoplay'', and ''flick''. The most common term in the [[United States]] is ''movie'', while in [[Europe]] ''film'' is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include ''the big screen'', ''the silver screen'', ''the movies'', and ''cinema''; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word ''sheet'' was sometimes used instead of ''screen''.

(Pictured here is a [[variety show]] at the theater in July 1940.)]]

===Preceding technologies===
Preceding film in origin by thousands of years, early [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[dances]] had elements common to film: [[Script (performing arts)|scripts]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[costumes]], [[Filmmaking#Production|production]], [[Film director|direction]], [[actors]], [[audiences]], [[storyboards]] and [[Film score|scores]]. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as [[mise en scène]] (roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.

The [[magic lantern]], probably created by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s, could be used to project [[animation]], which was achieved by various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed one on top of the other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc.&lt;ref name="Barber, Theodore X. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barber | first1 = Theodore X | year = 1989 | title = Phantasmagorical Wonders: The Magic Lantern Ghost Show in Nineteenth-Century America | url = | journal = Film History | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 73–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century, inventions such as [[Joseph Plateau]]'s [[phenakistoscope]] and the later [[zoetrope]] demonstrated that a carefully designed sequence of drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of [[persistence of vision]] to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each sequence was limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions. By the late 1880s, the last major device of this type, the [[praxinoscope]], had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a [[magic lantern]] to project them onto a screen.

The use of sequences of [[photography|photographs]] in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses because the available [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]] were not sensitive enough to allow the short [[exposure (photography)|exposures]] needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] created the first animated image sequences photographed in real-time. A row of cameras was used, each, in turn, capturing one image on a [[photographic plate|photographic glass plate]], so the total number of images in each sequence was limited by the number of cameras, about two dozen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyze the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects. Hand-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his [[zoopraxiscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Alan Larson (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=Eadweard%20Muybridge%20horse%20-%20english%20photographer Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428103430/https://books.google.com/books?id=ESVZOghoi6kC&amp;pg=PA17 |date=2016-04-28 }} Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===First motion pictures===
By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of [[celluloid]] [[photographic film]] and the invention of [[Movie camera|motion picture cameras]], which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact [[reel]] of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a "peep show" device such as the [[Kinetoscope]] and the [[mutoscope]]. Others were intended for a [[movie projector|projector]], mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these "moving pictures" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was [[Blacksmith Scene]], produced by [[Edison Manufacturing Company]] in 1893. The following year the company would begin [[Edison Studios]], which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including [[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]], and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films.

The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American [[Woodville Latham]] and his sons, using films produced by their company, and by the – arguably better known – French brothers [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with ten of their own productions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the Lumière brothers'.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Another opinion is that the first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in America was at [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|Brooklyn Institute]] in [[New York City]] 9 May 1893.

===Early evolution===
The earliest films were simply one static [[Shot (filming)|shot]] that showed an event or action with no [[Film editing|editing]] or other [[cinematic technique]]s. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several [[Scene (filming)|scenes]] together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until [[sound film]] became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely [[visual arts|visual art]], but these innovative [[silent film]]s had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a [[piano|pianist]] or [[organ (music)|organist]] or, in large urban theaters, a full [[orchestra]] to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete [[film score]]s were composed for major productions.

[[File:Charlie Chaplin, the Marriage Bond.ogg|thumb|alt=A clip from the Charlie Chaplin silent film, The Bond from 1918 Motion Picture Division of the U.S. National Archives|A clip from the [[Charlie Chaplin]] silent film ''[[The Bond]]'' (1918)]]

The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]], while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], typified most prominently by the innovative work of [[D. W. Griffith]] in [[The Birth of a Nation]] (1915) and [[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]] (1916). However, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|F. W. Murnau]] and [[Fritz Lang]], in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith, along with the contributions of [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and others, quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium.

===Sound===
In the 1920s, the development of electronic [[sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] technologies made it practical to incorporate a [[soundtrack]] of speech, music and [[sound effects]] synchronized with the action on the screen.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The resulting [[sound film]]s were initially distinguished from the usual silent "moving pictures" or "movies" by calling them "talking pictures" or "talkies."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as "the old medium."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Colour===
Another major technological development was the introduction of "[[color motion picture film|natural color]]," which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from "natural" in appearance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the [[Technicolor]] process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action [[short film]]s and isolated sequences in a few [[feature film]]s, then for an entire feature film, ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'', in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased [[box office]] receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year.

===1950s developments===
In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, [[widescreen]] processes, [[polarized 3D system|polarized 3D projection]], and [[stereophonic sound]] were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of "star" directors such as [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===1960s and later===
The decades following the decline of the [[studio system]] in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the [[French New Wave]], [[Parallel Cinema|Indian New Wave]], [[Japanese New Wave]], and [[New Hollywood]]) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Film theory==
[[File:BolexH16.jpg|right|thumb|alt=16 mm spring-wound Bolex H16 Reflex camera|This [[16 mm film|16 mm]] spring-wound [[Bolex]] "H16" Reflex camera is a popular entry level camera used in [[film school]]s.]]
"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as [[art]]. The concept of film as an art-form began with [[Ricciotto Canudo]]'s ''The Birth of the Sixth Art''. [[Formalist film theory]], led by [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[Béla Balázs]], and [[Siegfried Kracauer]], emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid [[fine art]]. [[André Bazin]] reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s [[semiotics]] among other things has given rise to [[psychoanalytic film theory]], [[structuralist film theory]], [[feminist film theory]], and others. On the other hand, critics from the [[analytical philosophy]] tradition, influenced by [[Wittgenstein]], try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a [[Form of life (philosophy)|form of life]].

===Language===
Film is considered to have its own [[language]]. [[James Monaco]] wrote a classic text on film theory, titled "How to ''Read'' a Film," that addresses this. Director [[Ingmar Bergman]] famously said, "[[Andrei Tarkovsky]] for me is the greatest [[Film director|director]], the one who invented a ''new language'', true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream." An example of the language is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile, followed by another speaking actor's right profile, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. This describes another theory of film, the [[180-degree rule]], as a visual story-telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing. The "[[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood style]]" includes this narrative theory, due to the overwhelming practice of the rule by movie studios based in Hollywood, California, during film's classical era. Another example of cinematic language is having a shot that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating that the first person is remembering a past self, an edit of compositions that causes a time transition.

===Montage===
{{Main|Montage (filmmaking)|l1=Montage}}
Montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage. Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning with [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name=JNFilmtheory&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelmes|first=Jill|title=An introduction to film studies|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-26269-9|page=394|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jcCADouuE_UC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;q=montage|edition=3rd ed., Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of musical and visual [[counterpoint]], and scene development through [[mise en scene]], [[editing]], and effects has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in [[opera]] and [[ballet]].

===Film criticism===
{{Main|Film criticism}}

Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in [[newspaper]]s and other media. Film critics working for newspapers, [[magazine]]s, and [[broadcast media]] mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate their opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on the audience response and attendance at films, especially those of certain [[film genre|genres]]. Mass marketed [[action film|action]], [[horror film|horror]], and [[comedy film]]s tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film and the assessment of the director's and screenwriters' work that makes up the majority of most film reviews can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most [[drama film|dramas]] and [[art film]]s, the influence of reviews is important. Poor reviews from leading critics at major papers and magazines will often reduce audience interest and attendance.

The impact of a reviewer on a given film's [[box office]] performance is a matter of debate. Some observers claim that [[movie marketing]] in the 2000s is so intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot prevent a poorly written or filmed [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] from attaining market success. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires, as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result. Journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers. Critics who take a more academic approach to films, through publishing in film journals and writing books about films using [[film theory]] or [[film studies]] approaches, study how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their reviews published in newspapers or appearing on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals or up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities as professors or instructors.

==Industry==
{{World Cinema}}
{{Main|Film industry}}
[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|alt=Babelsberg Studio near Berlin gate with pedestrian island|Founded in 1912, the [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world, and the forerunner to [[Hollywood]]. It still produces global blockbusters every year.]]
The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumières]] quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen additional product commercially. The [[Oberammergau Passion Play]] of 1898{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated [[movie theater|theaters]] and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major [[celebrity|celebrities]] and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 [[Charlie Chaplin]] had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for [[television programming]] until the introduction of [[videotape recorder]]s.

In the United States, much of the film industry is centered around [[Hollywood, California]]. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as [[Mumbai]]-centered [[Bollywood]], the [[Cinema of India|Indian film industry's]] [[Hindi]] cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html Bollywood Hots Up] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307024113/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/04/07/india.sexywood/index.html |date=2008-03-07 }} cnn.com. Retrieved June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the expense involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of [[movie studio]]s, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish.

Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large [[cost overruns]], an example being [[Kevin Costner]]'s ''[[Waterworld]]''. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The [[Academy Awards]] (also known as "the Oscars") are the most prominent film awards in the [[United States]], providing recognition each year to films, based on their artistic merits. There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts. Revenue in the industry is sometimes volatile due to the reliance on [[blockbuster film]]s released in [[movie theater]]s. The rise of alternative home entertainment has raised questions about the future of the cinema industry, and Hollywood employment has become less reliable, particularly for medium and low-budget films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopherson|first=Susan|date=2013-03-01|title=Hollywood in decline?

==Associated fields==
{{Further|Film theory|Product placement|Propaganda}}
Derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking, as in [[film theory]] and analysis. Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film, such as [[film criticism]], [[film history]], divisions of [[film propaganda]] in authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create derivative fields, such as a [[movie review]] section in a newspaper or a television guide. Sub-industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn makers, and film-related toys (e.g., [[Star Wars action figures|''Star Wars'' figures]]). Sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as [[product placement]] and other [[advertising]] within films.

==Terminology==
The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between [[British and American English]]. In British usage, the name of the medium is "film". The word "movie" is understood but seldom used.&lt;ref name="britam"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English/American English Vocabulary|url=https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191145/http://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/british-american.htm|archivedate=21 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sdope"&gt;{{cite web|title=British English vs. U.S. English – film vs. movie|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|work=Straight Dope Message Board|accessdate=26 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110091840/http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=363802|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "the pictures" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be called "the movies", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or [[movie theatre]]. By contrast, in the United States, "movie" is the predominant form. Although the words "film" and "movie" are sometimes used interchangeably, "film" is more often used when considering [[artistic]], [[theoretical]], or [[technology|technical]] aspects. The term "movies" more often refers to [[entertainment]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] aspects, as where to go for fun evening on a date. For example, a book titled "How to Understand a Film" would probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled "Let's Go to the Movies" would probably be about the history of entertaining movies and [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]].

Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media used in the film industry. "Motion pictures" and "moving pictures" are frequently used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition, such as, for instance, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. "[[DVD]]" and "[[videotape]]" are video formats that can reproduce a photochemical film. A reproduction based on such is called a "transfer." After the advent of theatrical film as an industry, the television industry began using videotape as a recording medium. For many decades, tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred. "Film" and "filming" refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording respectively. However, the act of shooting images with other visual media, such as with a digital camera, is still called "filming" and the resulting works often called "films" as interchangeable to "movies," despite not being shot on film. "[[Silent films]]" need not be utterly silent, but are films and movies without an audible dialogue, including those that have a musical accompaniment. The word, "[[Talkies]]," refers to the earliest sound films created to have [[Hearing (sense)|audible]] [[dialogue]] recorded for playback along with the film, regardless of a musical accompaniment. "Cinema" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or it is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition, and both are capitalized when referring to a category of art. The "[[silver screen]]" refers to the projection screen used to exhibit films and, by extension, is also used as a [[metonym]] for the entire film industry.

"[[Widescreen]]" refers to a larger width to height in the [[film frame|frame]], compared to earlier historic [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: W |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722052010/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/W |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "feature-length film", or "[[feature film]]", is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening.&lt;ref name="imdbmovietermsf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |title=Movie Terminology Glossary: F |work= |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722051945/http://www.imdb.com/glossary/F |archivedate=2010-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[short subject|short]]" is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film, often screened with other shorts, or preceding a feature-length film. An "[[Independent film|independent]]" is a film made outside the conventional film industry.

In US usage, one talks of a "[[Film screening|screening]]" or "[[Movie projector|projection]]" of a movie or video on a [[Projection screen|screen]] at a public or private "theater." In British English, a "film showing" happens at a [[movie theatre|cinema]] (never a "[[theatre]]", which is a different medium and place altogether).&lt;ref name="sdope" /&gt; A cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films, where the screen is affixed to a wall, while a theater usually refers to a place where live, non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from a podium or other type of stage, including the amphitheater. Theaters can still screen movies in them, though the theater would be retrofitted to do so. One might propose "going to the cinema" when referring to the activity, or sometimes "to the pictures" in British English, whereas the US expression is usually "going to the movies." A cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or, more recently, with a digital projector. But, cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need, such as movies that exist only in their transferred state, which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed. Due to the advent of [[digital cinema|digital film production and distribution]], physical film might be absent entirely. A "[[double feature]]" is a screening of two independently marketed, stand-alone feature films. A "viewing" is a watching of a film. "[[Sales]]" and "at the box office" refer to tickets sold at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A "[[Film release|release]]" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A "[[preview (theatre)|preview]]" is a screening in advance of the main release.

Any film may also have a "[[sequel]]", which portrays events following those in the film. ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' is an early example. When there are more films than one with the same characters, story arcs, or subject themes, these movies become a "series," such as the [[James Bond]] series. And, existing outside a specific story timeline usually, does not exclude a film from being part of a series. A film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a "[[prequel]]," an example being ''[[Butch and Sundance: The Early Days]]''.

The "credits," or "end credits," is a list that gives credit to the people involved in the production of a film. Films from before the 1970s usually start a film with credits, often ending with only a title card, saying "The End" or some equivalent, often an equivalent that depends on the language of the production{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. From then onward, a film's credits usually appear at the end of most films. However, films with credits that end a film often repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice, such as that film's acting leads, while less frequently some appearing near or at the beginning only appear there, not at the end, which often happens to the director's credit. The credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are usually called "titles" or "beginning titles." A [[post-credits scene]] is a scene shown after the end of the credits. ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' has a post-credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should go home.

A film's "cast" refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear, or "star," in a film. A star is an actor or actress, often a popular one, and in many cases, a [[celebrity]] who plays a central character in a film. Occasionally the word can also be used to refer to the fame of other members of the crew, such as a director or other personality, such as [[Martin Scorsese]]. A "crew" is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical construction outside cast participation, and it could include directors, film editors, photographers, grips, gaffers, set decorators, prop masters, and costume designers. A person can both be part of a film's cast and crew, such as [[Woody Allen]], who directed and starred in ''[[Take the Money and Run]]''.

A "film goer," "movie goer," or "film buff" is a person who likes or often attends films and movies, and any of these, though more often the latter, could also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process. Intense interest in films, film theory, and film criticism, is known as [[cinephilia]]. A film enthusiast is known as a cinephile or cineaste.

===Preview===
{{main|Test screening}}
A preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience, usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections based on the [[audience response]]. One example of a film that was changed after a negative response from the test screening is 1982's ''[[First Blood]]''. After the test audience responded very negatively to the death of protagonist [[John Rambo]], a [[Vietnam veteran]], at the end of the film, the company wrote and re-shot a new ending in which the character survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/first-blood-turns-30-rambo-original-dark-end-174610790.html|title='First Blood' Turns 30: Rambo's original dark end|location=[[Yahoo!

===Trailer and teaser===
{{main|Film trailer}}

Trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had only one or two screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Film studios realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the "A film" in a [[double feature]] program) begins. Film trailers are also common on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Trailers are created to be engaging and interesting for viewers. As a result, in the Internet era, viewers often seek out trailers to watch them. Of the ten billion videos watched online annually in 2008, film trailers ranked third, after news and user-created videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011641/http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasers are a much shorter preview or advertisement that lasts only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers are used to get patrons excited about a film coming out in the next six to twelve months. Teasers may be produced even before the film production is completed.

==Education and propaganda==
{{Main|Educational film|Propaganda film}}

Film is used for a range of goals, including education and propaganda. When the purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an "[[educational film]]". Examples are recordings of academic lectures and experiments, or a film based on a classic novel. Film may be [[propaganda film|propaganda]], in whole or in part, such as the films made by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]. They may also be works of political protest, as in the films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], or more subtly, the films of [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]. The same film may be considered educational by some, and propaganda by others as the categorization of a film can be subjective.

== Production ==
{{Main|Filmmaking}}

At its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the [[zoetrope]] merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can, therefore, take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera, as in [[Stan Brakhage]]'s 1963 film ''[[Mothlight]]''), or thousands of actors, extras, and crew members for a live-action, feature-length epic.

The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception, planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical [[production cycle]] of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as [[Script development|development]], [[pre-production]], [[Film production|production]], [[post-production]] and [[Film distributor|distribution]].

This production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up with ''development''. The second year comprises ''preproduction'' and ''production''. The third year, ''post-production'' and ''distribution''. The bigger the production, the more resources it takes, and the more important [[Film budgeting|financing]] becomes; most [[feature film]]s are artistic works from the creators' perspective (e.g., [[film director]], [[cinematographer]], [[screenwriter]]) and for-profit business entities for the production companies.

===Crew===
{{Main|Film crew}}

A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the "production" or "photography" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. ''Crew'' is distinguished from ''cast'', who are the [[actor]]s who appear in front of the [[camera]] or provide voices for characters in the film. The ''crew'' interacts with but is also distinct from the ''production staff'', consisting of producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such as [[screenwriter]]s and [[film editor]]s. Communication between ''production'' and ''crew'' generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well-defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and production special effects. [[Caterer]]s (known in the film industry as "craft services") are usually not considered part of the crew.

===Technology===
{{see also|Cinematic techniques}}
[[Film stock]] consists of transparent [[celluloid]], [[acetate]], or [[polyester]] [[film base|base]] coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the [[film format]] for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm]] prints.
Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked [[movie camera|cameras]] and [[movie projector|projectors]]; though 1000 frames per minute (16{{sfrac|2|3}} frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |title=Silent Film Speed |publisher=Cinemaweb.com |date=1911-12-02 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407224839/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/18_car_1.htm |archivedate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sound film]] was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras&amp;nbsp;– allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design&amp;nbsp;– allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large "blimps" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated [[film stock|filmstocks]] and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], allowing [[Film director|directors]] to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously.

As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for [[photography]]. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into [[multimedia]] presentations and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of [[separation masters]]: three B&amp;W negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the [[Technicolor]] process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. [[Film preservation]] of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage.

Some films in recent decades have been recorded using [[analog (signal)|analog]] [[video]] technology similar to that used in [[television production]]. Modern [[Digital video|digital video cameras]] and [[digital projector]]s are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred by some film-makers, especially because footage shot with [[digital cinema]] can be evaluated and edited with [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE) without waiting for the film stock to be processed. The migration was gradual, and as of 2005, most major motion pictures were still shot on film.{{update after|2015|6|3}}

===Independent===
{{Main|Independent film}}
[[File:Fratelli Lumiere.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Auguste and Louis Lumière brothers seated looking left|[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|The Lumière Brothers]], who were among the first filmmakers]]
Independent filmmaking often takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major film studio]]. Creative, business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century. On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also lead to conservative choices in cast and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by [[Warner Bros.]] in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in 1987).&lt;ref name="VARIETY_2003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Meredith|last=Amdur|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|title=Sharing Pix is Risky Business|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2003-11-16|accessdate=June 23, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915040337/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VR1117895718&amp;categoryid=10|archivedate=September 15, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles.

Before the advent of [[digital cinematography|digital]] alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. But the advent of consumer [[camcorder]]s in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high-resolution [[digital video]] in the early 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; in the 2000s, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based [[personal computer]]. Technologies such as [[DVD]]s, [[FireWire]] connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade [[video editing software]] make film-making relatively affordable.

Since the introduction of digital video [[DV]] technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on [[film festival]]s to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet-based video websites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Veoh]] has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to make their films available to the public.

===Open content film===
{{Main|Open content film}}

An open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced through open collaborations; its source material is available under a [[license]] which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create [[fan fiction]] or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place outside Hollywood, or other major [[studio system]]s.

===Fan film===
{{Main|Fan film}}

A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, [[television program]], [[comic book]] or a similar source, created by [[fan (aficionado)|fans]] rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the most notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures.

==Distribution==
{{Main|Film distribution|Film release}}

Film distribution is the process through which a film is made available for viewing by an [[audience]]. This is normally the task of a professional [[film distributor]], who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set the [[film release|release date]] and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a [[movie theater]] (historically the main way films were distributed) or [[television]] for [[home video|personal home viewing]] (including on [[DVD-Video]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]], online [[download]]ing, [[television program]]s through [[broadcast syndication]] etc.). Other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as [[VHS]] tape or [[DVD]], or [[Internet]] [[download]]ing of [[streaming media|streaming]] using a computer.

==Animation==
{{Main|Animation}}
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|An animated image of a horse, made using eight pictures.]]
Animation is a technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see [[claymation]] and [[stop motion]]), and then photographing the result with a special [[animation camera]]. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the [[phi phenomenon]]). Generating such a film is very labor-intensive and tedious, though the development of [[computer animation]] has greatly sped up the process. Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for [[Television|TV]] and films comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of [[independent animation]] has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.

[[Limited animation]] is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using "short cuts" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and popularized by [[Hanna-Barbera]] in the [[United States]], and by [[Osamu Tezuka]] in [[Japan]], and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from [[movie theater]]s to [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|title= Hanna Barbera's golden age of animation|accessdate= 2007-01-25|last= Savage|first= Mark|date= 2006-12-19|work= |publisher= BBC News|pages= |language= |deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061219211006/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm|archivedate= 2006-12-19|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Camera-less animation, made famous by film-makers like [[Norman McLaren]], [[Len Lye]], and [[Stan Brakhage]], is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.

The '''Full-Scale Tunnel'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_FSTdemo.html Langley News (NASA)]&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated '''FST''', also known as the '''30-by 60-Foot Tunnel'''&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;) was a [[wind tunnel]] at [[NASA]]'s [[Langley Research Center]]. It was a [[National Historic Landmark]].

In 1929, [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] began construction of the world's first full-scale wind tunnel. The design team was led by Smith J. DeFrance. The tunnel was completed in 1931 (dedicated 27 May) at a cost just under $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/643 NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a double-return tunnel capable of moving air at speeds up to 118 miles/hour (190&amp;nbsp;km/h) through its circuit. It had a 30&amp;nbsp;ft by 60&amp;nbsp;ft (9.1 m x 18.3 m) open throat, which is capable of testing aircraft with spans of 40&amp;nbsp;ft (12.2 m).The wind tunnel is a double-return, atmospheric pressure tunnel with two fans powered by 4,000&amp;nbsp;hp electric motors.

The [[Vought O2U Corsair|Vought O3U-1 biplane observation]] airplane was the first complete airplane tested in the tunnel. After that, it was used to test virtually every high-performance aircraft used by the [[United States]] in [[World War II]]. For much of the war, when it was operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the full-scale tunnel was the only tunnel in the free world large enough to perform these tests.

[[File:Man examining fan of Langley Research Center 16 foot transonic wind tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maintenance on the fan]]

After the war, many types of aircraft were tested in the tunnel including the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] fighter, the [[F-16]], the [[Boeing 2707|American supersonic transport]], the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Moon landing|Lunar Landing Test Vehicle]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the tunnel was modified and upgraded several times. The principal improvement was adding the ability to test free-flying scale models in the test throat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/30X60.html NASA Langley's 30- by 60-foot Tunnel]&lt;/ref&gt; The wind tunnel was in use through the 2000s, testing procedures such as free-flight and high angle of attack.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html#FST NASA Langley's National Historic Landmarks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509185106/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fund for Peace''' is a [[US]] [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] research and educational institution. Founded in 1957, FFP "works to prevent violent conflict and promote sustainable [[International security|security]]."

The Fund for Peace works towards sustainable security and development in [[failed state]]s by focusing on conflict assessment and early warning, transnational threats, [[peacekeeping]], and security and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Fund for Peace [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=435&amp;Itemid=598 "Mission"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund for Peace maintains programs in [[Nigeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Liberia]], and works with private business in conflict zones to better secure the interests of businesses, local populations, and their governments.

FFP publishes the annual [[Failed States Index|Fragile States Index]], used by researchers, educators, and governments across the world.

==History==
The Fund for Peace was founded in 1957 by Randolph Compton. The organization was created in the memory of Randolph Compton's youngest son, John Parker Compton, who was killed in [[World War II]]. At a young age, John Parker wrote an essay, discussing the effects of war and the need for human civilization to embrace other methods of conflict resolution. After John Parker's death, Compton created the Fund for Peace, an organization based on the ideals of justice, environment, peace, and population.&lt;ref&gt;Fund for Peace [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=96 "History"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant programs==

===The Fragile States Index===
The [[Failed States Index|Fragile States Index]] assesses the pressures experienced by nations based on social, economic, and political indicators such as demographic pressures, refugee flows, uneven economic development or severe economic decline, and human rights, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fundforpeace/docs/cr-10-97-ca-conflictassessmentindicators-1105c/2 |title=Conflict Assessment Indicators Pocket Guide |publisher=Issuu.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Failed States Index" debuted in 2005 with a limited assessment of approximately 75 countries; this was expanded to 146 countries in 2006, and then to 177 countries the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/faq-01-how-many-countries-in-fsi|title=How Many Countries are Included in the Fragile States Index?|website=fsi.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Sudan was added to the assessment in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/fsi12-southsudan|title=An Inauspicious Welcome to South Sudan|website=library.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, The Fund for Peace announced that the ranking would be renamed "''Fragile'' States Index", claiming that the controversial term 'failed' had "[become] a distraction away from the point of the Index, which is to encourage discussions that support an increase in human security and improved livelihoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/blog-20140528-fsirenamed|title=Renaming the Failed States Index|website=library.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fragile States Index uses color-coded maps, tables, and a four level-ranking system ("Alert," "Warning," "Moderate," "Sustainable") to determine the current conditions and negative potential in the future. All four nations on high "Alert" are a part of the African continent: [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. At the "Warning" level were many Latin American or former Soviet nations, including [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Mexico]]. At "Moderate" were the [[United States]] and several European states, such as [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]]. Only a few nations, such as the Scandinavian countries, [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were rated as "Sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/?q=fsi-grid2011 |title=The Failed States Index 2011 Interactive Grid |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fragile States Index is subject to criticism, in part, because it takes institutions and data to draw its conclusions, as opposed to the Human Development Index or other more telling signs. The FSI is checked against human analysis.

===UNLocK===
UNLocK  links global information technologies with local social networks for the benefits of stakeholders.  FFP conducts workshops in the conflict-affected countries of [[Liberia]], [[Uganda]], and [[Nigeria]], training local participants in the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST).  They train others at the community level.  Data collected from field reports by the participants are analyzed for signs of early-warning conflict.  The aggregate data is privately disseminated back to the participants and used to resolve disputes, identify priority issues at the community level, and as a way to obtain more immediate early warning and conflict prevention information.

While the recent elections in [[Nigeria]] were widely recognized as a major step forward in the difficult journey toward democracy, UNLocK Nigeria provided a ground-level view of challenges that remained, including incidents of ballot box snatching, vote-buying, abductions, and violence.  This report focuses on the [[Niger Delta|Niger Delta Region]], with a particular emphasis on the [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom]] and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/library/cr-11-18-ul-unlocknigeria-1106a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threat convergence===

CSTC performs ground research in the [[Black Sea]]/[[South Caucasus|South Caucasus region]], the [[Triple Frontier|Tri-border area of Latin American]], [[East Africa|East]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Southeast Asia]].  It partners with regional and sub regional organizations like [[NATO]], the [[European Union|EU]], and [[african union|the African Union]].

The Center for the Study of Threat Convergence is funded by the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], and the [[Ploughshares Fund]].

===Business and FFP===
Created in 1997, the '''Human Rights and Business Roundtable''' brings together businesses and human rights organizations to ensure compliance with international standards, particularly in regard to the conduct of security forces in and around industrial operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/?q=program-hrbrt |title=Human Rights and Business Roundtable |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the challenges faced, particularly in the extractive industries, in balancing human rights and security.  FFP works with various private companies in the oil, mining, agribusiness, renewable energy, and infrastructure sectors in both stable and conflict zones around the world. The '''Sustainable Development &amp; Security''' program supports companies in their development of human rights and security policies, conflict and human rights assessments, community relations and stakeholder engagement, and monitoring and reporting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sds.fundforpeace.org/sds|title=Sustainable Development &amp; Security {{!}} The Fund for Peace|website=sds.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; FFP is a long-standing civil society participant of the [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|Voluntary Principles on Security &amp; Human Rights]] initiative, and currently serves on the initiative's Steering Committee and Board of Directors.

===CAST===
For [[Conflict analysis|conflict assessment]], the Fund for Peace utilizes the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST). CAST was created in 1996 as a system of locating and analyzing potential conflicts in [[failed states]]. It works by incorporating "theoretical rationale, a conceptual framework, quantitative and qualitative indicators...and a rating system for trend analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/cast/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Conflict Assessment System Tool - About CAST |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "  However, CAST may be criticized for putting too much emphasis on technology and equations, and not enough on the human analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jennifer [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=241795 "From Nation State to Failed State"], Columbia Human Rights Law Review, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, CAST is a tool that remains static, despite the specific conflict at hand. Each case is unique, and CAST does not have the mathematical ability to assess the uniqueness and specific needs of varying failed states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=145], The Fund for Peace, CAST.&lt;/ref&gt;

FFP maintains relationships with the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[South Korea]]n government, among others.

==Past programs==

===Genocide prevention===
As the Fund for Peace works in regions prone to genocide, the organization developed a relationship with the [https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/index.shtml Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/index.shtml "Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Mission Statement"] UN Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Adviser played a role in researching and delivering information to aid the Special Adviser in his responsibilities. The Special Adviser and the Fund for Peace were involved in researching human rights violations, sharing information and giving warnings to the Secretary General and the Security Council on matters of genocide, and making recommendations on courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=444&amp;Itemid=892], The Fund for Peace, Genocide Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace and Stability Operations Project===
Originally called the Regional Responses to Internal War Project, the program looks to shed light on regional organizations and their "political will" to maintain peaceful relations. The Peace and Stability Operations Project also serves to form relationships with actors in other sectors, such as scholars, research institutions, journalists, and experts. The Fund for Peace believes that, through these extended relationships, the international community can work together to maintain peace in typically violent areas. The Fund for Peace has been successful in advancing the international dialogue on peacekeeping by holding public meetings with international representatives, performing research missions in over thirty-five countries, and holding workshops. By collaborating with actors in other sectors, the Fund for Peace is able to gather the ideas and opinions of other experts and publish them in their issues of [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=125&amp;Itemid=173 Reality Check: Diverse Voices on Internal Conflict].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=208&amp;Itemid=257], The Fund for Peace, Peace and Stability Operations Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States foreign policy===
The second initiative is the Use and Purpose of American Power. The goal of this initiative is to promote ongoing dialogue and debate on the role of the United States in the international arena. It does so by asking four questions:
* What are our interests and values as we act in the world?
* What are the specific goals we should set and the things we should do?
* What tools do we use to achieve these?
* How as Americans do we influence events as they so obviously affect us?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=309&amp;Itemid=566], the Fund for Peace, Use and Purpose of American Power.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Use and Purpose of American Power also has three main components. The first is the National Dialogue forums. In 2008 and 2009, the Fund for Peace partnered up with local organizations, such as chambers of commerce and universities, across the country and organized "'traveling town halls.'" The purpose of these were to discuss topics relating to the presidential election, and the condition of the United States and its population. The format of the forums were designed to encourage participation and dialogue on behalf of Americans to actively and critically think about their role, their country's condition, and the government's responsibility. Throughout two years, the National Dialogue forums took place in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Mexico, Alabama, Idaho, Florida, and California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=328&amp;Itemid=563], The Fund for Peace, National Dialogue Forums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second component is the American Conversation. While the National Dialogue forums were designed to spark interest and discussion, the purpose of the American Conversation is an online discussion hosted by [https://groups.google.com/group/american-conversation?hl=en Google Groups] to continue conversations that began at the National Dialogue forums. The American Conversation is an effort by the Fund for Peace to encourage ongoing critical thinking in the minds of Americans and their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=331&amp;Itemid=879], The Fund for Peace, American Conversation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third component of the Use and Purpose of American Power is the Final Report. The Final Report is a summary of the National Dialogue forums and the ideas and concepts presented at the forums. The Final Report, titled [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/images/pdf/use_and_purpose_of_american_power_final_report.pdf The Use and Purpose of American Power in the 21st Century] highlights five main points:
* "Economic security is vital to American national security; but America’s structural economic problems prevent it from operating from a position of strength in the world."
* "National leaders should first ‘take care of their own’ because of the gravity of the economic challenges; however, America’s welfare is also closely tied to the world economy."
* "Nation-building and democracy-building projects are a mission impossible; still, the U.S. should promote good governance, human rights, and equitable development."
* "Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are lesser threats than America’s economic problems."
* "U.S. leaders’ inability to adapt to new global realities poses the greatest challenge to America’s standing in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=448&amp;Itemid=897], The Fund for Peace, Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace's efforts in United States foreign policy is based on the fear of "spillover" and the influence and multiplication of failed states.&lt;ref&gt;Mallaby, Sebastian [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57800/sebastian-mallaby/the-reluctant-imperialist-terrorism-failed-states-and-the-case-f "The Reluctant Imperialist"], Foreign Affairs, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Dialogue forums were sponsored by the Fund for Peace. The Final Report was funded by the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=448&amp;Itemid=897], The Fund for Peace, Funding.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
Another initiative to promote human rights is the Globalization and Human Rights Series. This consists of publications dedicated to discussing pertinent topics relating to human rights, the impact of failing states, and corruption. Four issues have been published since 2005 in an effort to continue to educate the industries and the public on the harmful effects of failing governments, and the need for the recognition of, and commitment to, human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=112&amp;Itemid=156], The Fund for Peace, Globalization and Human Rights Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Fund for Peace is a supporter of the [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights]], which guides businesses who voluntarily participate on how to align their security practices with human rights considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/ "Voluntary Principles"] The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|Voluntary Principles]] are important because of the potentially harmful impacts security practices can have when operating in a failed state or conflict zone, but also because the international community is putting increasing emphasis on the rights of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=438&amp;Itemid=601], The Fund for Peace, Civil Society and Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other collaboration==
The Fund for Peace does not limit its partnerships to select sectors. The organization has collaborated with [[Georgetown University]]'s Center for Peace and Security Studies and the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]. Together, the three institutions developed a [http://www.press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/peace-operations thesis on the increased participation of regional organizations] and their member states in promoting peacekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=209&amp;Itemid=248], The Fund for Peace, ''Peace Operations: Trends, Progress, and Prospects''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace partnered with the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] in 2007. From September 4–6, thirty participants from varying Middle Eastern countries, as well as Australia, the United States, and Canada, met in Istanbul, Turkey. The participants came from academia, international organizations, the Arab League, the United Nations, governments, and human rights organizations. The representatives were faced with the task of determining what steps should be taken to efficiently protect civilians. The conference promoted a sense of international unity by asking the representatives to leave aside their political ideologies and keep the welfare of human beings as their priority. The conference ended with the unanimous support of [[International Humanitarian Law]] and the [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/images/pdf/the%20bosphorous%20consensus%20final%2011.07.07.pdf Bosphorous Consensus].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=252], The Fund for Peace, the Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace has also partnered with Logos Technologies, the [[United States Institute of Peace]], the [[PKSOI|United States Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute]], the [[Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization|U.S. State Department Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction]], and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to create a metrics framework for peacekeeping. The project includes concepts from the book ''The Quest for Viable Peace'' with the theoretical approach of the Fund for Peace's CAST methodology. The organizations involved are interested in helping governments determine the outcome of Stabilization and Reconstruction Operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=253], The Fund for Peace, Metrics for Stability.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J. Mc Keever and Nickolas Zouros (2005). Geoparks: Celebrating earth heritage, sustaining local communities. EPISODES, December 2005, pp. 274–278.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are global geoparks and national geoparks.

==Concepts==
A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &amp;#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.&lt;ref name="globalgeopark" /&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt; The Global Geoparks Network works in synergy with UNESCO's [[World Heritage]] Centre and [[Man and the Biosphere]] (MAB) World Network of Biosphere Reserves.&lt;ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/&gt;

===Qualification===
The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) is a UNESCO activity established in 1998. According to UNESCO, for a geopark to apply to be included in the GGN, it needs to:

* have a management plan designed to foster socio-economic development that is [[sustainable]] based on [[geotourism]]
* demonstrate methods for conserving and enhancing geological heritage and provide means for teaching geoscientific disciplines and broader environmental issues
* have joint proposals submitted by public authorities, local communities and private interests acting together, which demonstrate the best practices with respect to Earth heritage conservation and its integration into [[sustainable development]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;'April 2010 GEO4B/PM Advanced Level Examination - Advanced Information Booklet'&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta Q&lt;/math&gt; is the infinitesimal amount of heat absorbed by the system from the reservoir and &lt;math&gt;T_{surr}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]] of the external reservoir (surroundings) at a particular instant in time. In the special case of a reversible process, the equality holds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/ClausiusTheorem.html '''Clausius theorem'''] at [[Wolfram Research]]&lt;/ref&gt; The reversible case is used to introduce the [[entropy]] state function. This is because in a cyclic process the variation of a state function is zero. In words, the Clausius statement states that it is impossible to construct a device whose sole effect is the transfer of heat from a cool reservoir to a hot reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Finn, Colin B. P. ''Thermal Physics''. 2nd ed., CRC Press, 1993. &lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, heat spontaneously flows from a hot body to a cooler one, not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Giancoli, Douglas C.

In other words, tensile strength resists [[tension (physics)|tension]] (being pulled apart), whereas compressive strength resists [[compression (physics)|compression]] (being pushed together).

'''Gregory M. Herek''', Ph.D. (born 1954 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]) is a researcher, author, and professor of psychology at the [[University of California at Davis]] (UCD).

== Biography ==
Herek was born in 1954, the youngest of four children. He briefly attended the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], but dropped out to devote himself to political activism.&lt;ref name="awards" /&gt; He later received his B.A. degree from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Davis]]. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship at [[Yale University]], followed by a year of teaching at Yale. He then joined the faculty at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]]. In 1989, he returned to UC Davis, first as a research psychologist and then, since 1999, as a tenured professor.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{citation  |title=Awards for Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest |periodical=American Psychologist |year=1997 |volume=52 |pages=345–348 |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=96503453 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.52.4.345|last1=No Authorship Indicated }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Two principal foci of his original empirical research program are societal stigma based on sexual orientation and the social psychology of heterosexuals' attitudes towards lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. He has published at least 108 papers and chapters in scholarly journals and books, most of them related to sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS, or attitudes and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=author%3AHerek+author%3AGM&amp;as_sdt=2000&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1 |title=author:Herek author:GM - Google Scholar |publisher=Scholar.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has edited or coedited five books and two special issues of academic journals on these topics, and he has made more than 85 presentations at professional conferences and meetings. He has received numerous federal and state grants for his research with combined budgets totaling more than $5 million.

Over the 25 years, he has reviewed manuscripts on topics related to sexual orientation for a large number of scientific and professional journals spanning a variety of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, political science, sexuality studies, gender studies, and public health. He currently serves on the editorial boards of nine professional journals and he is frequently invited to serve as an ad hoc peer reviewer for others. He is also the Executive Editor Emeritus of Contemporary Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Psychology, a book series dedicated to scientific and professional works on sexual orientation and related topics, which is published by the American Psychological Association. He reviewed book proposals and edited manuscripts that addressed research on a variety of topics related to sexuality and sexual orientation.

As a member of a peer review panel for the National Institute of Mental Health from 1992 to 1995, and as an ad hoc reviewer for NIMH and the National Science Foundation on multiple occasions since then, he has reviewed proposals requesting federal funding for projects addressing an array of research questions related to sexuality. From 1995 to 2007, he served as chairperson of the Scientific Review Committee of the American Psychological Foundation's Wayne F. Placek Award competition, which funded empirical research in the behavioral and social sciences related to sexual minorities and sexual orientation.

He oversaw the review of more than 200 research proposals from a large number of academic disciplines. At UC Davis, he regularly teach an upper-division undergraduate course on sexual orientation and has also taught graduate seminars on this and related topics.&lt;ref name=doma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf |title=DOMA Expert Affidavit of Gregory M.

Herek was an early advocate for scientific research on [[hate crimes]] based on sexual orientation, testifying in 1986 on behalf of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) for the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee's hearings on anti-gay violence.&lt;ref name="greerw"&gt;{{citation |first=William R. |last=Greer |title=Violence against homosexuals rising, groups seeking wider protection say |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A0DE7D91638F930A15752C1A960948260 |date=November 23, 1986 |accessdate=2007-11-18}}. See also http://web1.msue.msu.edu/msue/imp/moddp/dp120303.html&lt;/ref&gt; He served as PhD advisor to graduate student [[Karen Franklin]] who also studied the psychology of [[violence]].

In 1993, he testified before the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] on behalf of the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], the [[American Counseling Association]], the [[American Nursing Association]], and the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]]. Herek summarized the results of an extensive review of the relevant published research from the social and behavioral sciences that the research data show that there is nothing about lesbians and gay men that makes them inherently unfit for military service, and there is nothing about heterosexuals that makes them inherently unable to work and live with gay people in close quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M.

Herek, Ph.D to the House Armed Services Committee - Made on behalf of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, American Counseling Association, American Nursing Association, and the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927012407/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/miltest2.html |date=2016-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He concluded that heterosexual personnel can overcome their prejudices and adapt to living and working in close quarters with lesbians and gay men and that lesbians and gay men are not inherently less capable of military service than are heterosexual women and men. "The assumption that heterosexuals cannot overcome their prejudices toward gay people is a mistaken one," said Herek.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M.

In the 1990s, he conducted the first federally funded scientific study to compare gay and lesbian hate crime victims with gay men and lesbians who were victimized in crimes of comparable severity that were not related to their sexual orientation. He found that hate crime survivors had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, compared to the other crime victims.&lt;ref name="herek1999"&gt;{{citation |first=Gregory M.

In recognition of this work, Herek was invited to participate in President Clinton's 1997 White House Conference on Hate Crimes, the only behavioral science researcher to be included among the invitees.&lt;ref name="ucdavisbio"&gt;{{citation |title=Gregory M.

'''Guido of Arezzo''' (also '''Guido Aretinus''', '''Guido Aretino''', '''Guido da Arezzo''', '''Guido Monaco''', '''Guido d'Arezzo''', or '''Guy of Arezzo''' also '''Guy d'Arezzo''') (991/992 – after 1033) was an Italian music theorist of the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] era. He is regarded as the inventor of modern [[musical notation#Early Europe|musical notation]] ([[Staff (music)|staff notation]]) that replaced [[neume|neumatic notation]]. His text, the ''[[Micrologus]]'', was the second most widely distributed treatise on music in the Middle Ages (after the writings of [[Boethius]]).

==Life==
Guido was a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] from the Italian city-state of [[Arezzo]]. Recent research has dated his ''Micrologus'' to 1025 or 1026; since Guido stated in a letter that he was thirty-four when he wrote it,&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi"&gt;Stuart Lyons, ''Horace's Odes and the Mystery of Do-Re-Mi with Full Verse Translation of the Odes''. Oxford: Aris &amp; Phillips, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-85668-790-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his birthdate is presumed to be around 991 or 992. His early career was spent at the [[Pomposa Abbey|monastery of Pomposa]], on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast near [[Ferrara]]. While there, he noted the difficulty that singers had in remembering [[Gregorian chant]]s.

He came up with a method for teaching the singers to learn chants in a short time, and quickly became famous throughout north Italy. However, he attracted the hostility of the other monks at the abbey, prompting him to move to Arezzo, a town which had no abbey, but which did have a large group of cathedral singers, whose training [[Tedald (Bishop of Arezzo)|Bishop Tedald]] invited him to conduct.

While at Arezzo, he developed new techniques for teaching, such as staff notation and the use of the "ut–re–mi–fa–so–la" ([[Solfège|do–re–mi–fa–so–la]]) [[mnemonic]] ([[solmization]]). The ut–re–mi-fa-so-la syllables are taken from the initial syllables of each of the first six half-lines of the first stanza of the [[hymn]] ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', whose text is attributed to the Italian monk and scholar [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]] (though the musical line either shares a common ancestor with the earlier setting of [[Horace]]'s "[[:la:s:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XI|Ode to Phyllis]]" (''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' 4.11), recorded in the Montpellier manuscript H425, or may have been taken from it).&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi" /&gt;  [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] is known for having changed the name of note "Ut" (C), renaming it "Do" (in the "Do Re Mi ..." sequence known as [[solfège]]).&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A seventh note, "Si" (from the initials for "Sancte Iohannes," Latin for St. John the Baptist) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale.&lt;ref&gt; Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 271–7). {{ISBN|978-0-19-520912-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-19-820171-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In anglophone countries, "Si" was changed to "Ti" by [[Sarah Glover]] in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might [[Tonic sol-fa|begin with a different letter]] (this also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp). "Ti" is used in [[tonic sol-fa]] and in the song "[[Do-Re-Mi]]".

The ''Micrologus'', written at the cathedral at Arezzo and dedicated to Tedald, contains Guido's teaching method as it had developed by that time. Soon it had attracted the attention of [[Pope John XIX]], who invited Guido to Rome. Most likely he went there in 1028, but he soon returned to Arezzo, due to his poor health. It was then that he announced in a letter to Michael of Pomposa ("{{Lang|la|Epistola de ignoto cantu|italic=no}}") his discovery of the "ut–re–mi" musical mnemonic. Little is known of him after this time.

==The Guidonian hand==
Guido is credited with the invention of the [[Guidonian hand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/11968 Claude V. Palisca and Dolores Pesce: "Guido of Arezzo [Aretinus&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;"]. ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', 11 February 2013. Accessed 11 February 2018. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/26154 "Solmization"] by Andrew Hughes and Edith Gerson-Kiwi, ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; a widely used mnemonic system where note names are mapped to parts of the human hand. However, only a rudimentary form of the Guidonian hand is actually described by Guido, and the fully elaborated system of natural, hard, and soft [[hexachord]]s cannot be securely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Theory, Theorists, §5: Early Middle Ages", ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, a development in teaching and learning music in a more efficient manner had arisen. Guido of Arezzo's alleged development of the Guidonian hand, more than a hundred years after his death, allowed for musicians to label a specific joint or fingertip with the [[Gamut (music)|gamut]] (also referred to as the hexachord in the modern era).{{Citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=Bonnie Blackburn certainly does not make this outrageous claim. Who in the modern era confuses a six-note system with a twenty-note one?}} Using specific joints of the hand and fingertips transformed the way one would learn and memorize solmization syllables. Not only did the Guidonian hand become a standard use in preparing music in the 12th century, its popularity grew more widespread well into the 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie J. Blackburn, "[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/17205 Lusitano, Vicente]", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. accessed 13 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge and use of the Guidonian hand would allow a musician to simply transpose, identify intervals, and aid in use of notation and the creation of new music. Musicians were able to sing and memorize longer sections of music and counterpoint during performances and the amount of time spent diminished dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Michael Randel]], "Guido of Arezzo", ''The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music'' (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1996): 339–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A monument to him was erected in his native Arezzo. He is one of the famous Tuscans honored by a statue in the [[Loggiato of the Uffizi]] in Florence. 

The [[Scorewriter|computer music notation]] system [[GUIDO music notation]] is named after him and his invention.

The "International Guido d'Arezzo Polyphonic Contest" (Concorso Polifónico Guido d'Arezzo) is named after him.

[[Francisco Valls]]' controversial ''Missa Scala Aretina'' took its name from Guido Aretinus' scale.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joke theft''' is the act of performing and taking credit for comic material written by another person without their [[consent]]. This is a form of [[plagiarism]] and can, in some cases, be [[copyright infringement]]. 
==History==
===Vaudeville years===
In [[music hall]]s and [[vaudeville]], it was common for performers to "borrow" material. According to [[Milton Berle]], [[etiquette]] only required that "the borrower add to the joke and make it his own".&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"&gt;Berle, Milton (1989) ''Private joke file'', ''Introduction'', p.xxiii quotation: {{quotation|Of course, in the days of vaudeville, it wasn't uncommon for a performer to "borrow" a joke from another performer. Etiquette demanded only that the borrower add to the joke and make it his own. Bert Williams, a star of the Ziegfeld Follies, pilfered a story about fish and added enough laughs to turn it into a classic fifteen-minute routine. Naturally, that routine happens to be in my file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. Most jokes at the time were one-liners and there was little in the way of proof of a joke's origin, but the value of each joke was immeasurable to a comedian.&lt;ref name="radartake"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berle and [[Bob Hope]] had a long-standing feud due to Hope's accusation that Milton Berle had stolen some of his jokes.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt; Berle never disputed the claim, but instead embraced the title "The Thief of Bad Gag".

Even the most famous of comics have found themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, stealing material. [[Bill Cosby]] admitted to stealing a joke by George Carlin involving an uneducated football player doing a television commercial. Cosby said that what makes the routine his own is the surreal phrase "little tiny hairs".&lt;ref name="funny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24,1,6252669,full.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |title=Funny, that was my joke |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Welkos |first=Robert W. |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221013725/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24%2C1%2C6252669%2Cfull.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |archivedate=21 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Cosby, Bill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AikgyewBn8k|title=Late Show with David Letterman – Bill Cosby's Race Against George Carlin|publisher=[[CBS]]|medium=TV|date=2009-06-01|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, [[Carlos Mencia]] performed a bit about athletes and their parents that hearkened back to a Cosby bit from his album ''[[Bill Cosby: Himself]]''.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The 1980s and 1990s saw the popularity of [[stand-up comedy]] continue to increase. The advent of pay-cable networks afforded comics the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft in which the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

[[Robin Williams]] was accused of stealing material from another comic. [[David Brenner]] claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.&lt;ref name="Comedy at the Edge"&gt;{{cite book | title=Comedy at the Edge | author=Richard Zoglin | year=2008 | publisher=Bloomsbury USA | isbn=978-1582346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1993 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=[[Kevin Booth]] and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170  |title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218140900/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = 2005-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Joe Rogan answers 20 Questions | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy Magazine |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | author=Tim McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=2006-03-20 | accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

In a 2008 appearance on ''The Opie and Anthony Show'', comedian [[Louis C.K.]] claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"/&gt; On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.&lt;ref name="radartake"/&gt;

In his memoir ''[[Gasping for Airtime]]'', [[Jay Mohr]] admitted that he lifted an entire routine from [[Rick Shapiro]]'s act for a 1995 ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued the show and was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohr|first1=Jay|title=Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live|date=2004|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=1401300065|pages=276–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and 2010s===
Louis C.K. has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'', that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on C.K.'s album ''Live in Houston''.  C.K. and Cook portray this rivalry with comedy and sincerity in an episode of C.K.'s series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thecomicscomic.com/2011/08/05/dane-cook-confronts-louis-ck-in-an-honest-way-about-joke-theft-read-the-transcript-watch-the-video/ | title = Dane Cook confronts Louis CK in an honest way about joke theft.

[[George Lopez]] has accused Carlos Mencia of plagiarizing his material and claimed that the two once had a physical altercation over the alleged plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |author=Goldyn, Debra |title=Is Carlos Mencia a thief? |work=Advocate |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Denver]] |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2007-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007092111/http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |archivedate=7 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fellow comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim and stated that it was he, not Lopez, who had originally penned the joke and that he had given Mencia permission to use it when he discovered that Lopez had stolen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216161529/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archivedate=16 February 2008|author=Kozlowski, Carl|title=Carlos Mencia Just Said That|work=|publisher=Los Angeles CityBeat|date=2007-03-29|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] was accused by anonymous bloggers of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce – Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |title=Luttazzi copia – Parte 1 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a "nugget" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danieleluttazzi.blogspot.com/|title=Caccia al tesoro|author=Luttazzi, Daniele}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml|title=Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=10 March 2012|publisher=corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this ruse "the [[Lenny Bruce]] trick" (named for the comic of same name).  Luttazzi asserts that the jokes he references are not "plagiarized" but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi's jokes are his own and not "plagiarised" ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caimotto|first1=M.Cristina|title=Transcreating a New Kind of Humor: the case of Daniele Luttazzi|url=http://www.cultusjournal.com/index.php/archive/16-issue-2014-v-7-transcreation-and-the-professions|website=cultusjournal.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' contestant Jordan Paris presented an act of stand-up comedy and quickly proceeded to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network gave him a chance to redeem himself and allowed him to compete in the semi-finals using his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well – "I just sacked my two writers – Copy and Paste" – had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism'], ''Brisbane Times'', 29 June 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site Facebook&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 |title=Fuck Someone Ugly|date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's ''Acid Bootleg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;[[Sicko (album)]]&lt;/ref&gt; nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==In other media==
Joke theft is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often jokes in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.
[[Dick Cavett]] wrote about joke theft in his autobiography. He'd written a bit about eating Chinese-German food and, an hour later, being hungry for power. After a few days of performing the bit, he discovered a column by [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] which attributed the joke to [[Rip Taylor]]. However, after calling Taylor to ask him to stop using the bit, he discovered that not only had Taylor never performed the bit, he had never even heard it and laughed heartily at the joke's humor. It was then that Cavett discovered that some journalists often falsely attribute jokes to the wrong comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Cavett | author=Dick Cavett, Christopher Porterfield | year=1974| publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |pages=227–228| isbn=978-0151161300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavett and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes, when he still lacked access to television, were regularly stolen by top mainstream shows ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' and ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-07-11}} quotation: {{quotation|Woody's best lines would show up, while he was still confined to little Village clubs, on the Red Skelton show and that alleged entertainment, Laugh-In.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]" and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''[[Family Guy]]'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from the Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V.

In 2017 the Australian television show host [[Grant Denyer]] was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Grill Team]]'', which is on [[2MMM]]. In the interview, ''The Grill Team''{{'}}s co-host [[Matty Johns]] told an amusing anecdote about introducing a child to the board game ''[[Test Match (board game)|Test Match]]''. Later that morning, Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Kyle and Jackie O Show]]'', which is on [[KIIS 106.5]]. In that interview, he told the same anecdote about ''Test Match'', passing it off as his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://au.be.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/a/34283262/grant-denyer-banned-from-triple-m-and-kiis-fm-radio-stations-for-stealing-story-yahoo7-be/#page1 | title = Grant Denyer Banned From Triple M and KIIS FM Radio Stations For Stealing Story | accessdate = 2017-01-28 | author = Leah Cohen | date = 2017-01-28 | work = Yahoo7Be | publisher = Yahoo!7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of joke theft. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a thieving comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt;

"You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy," said comedian [[David Brenner]]. "If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere – and what I just said is original."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/24/entertainment/et-joketheft24|title=Funny, that was my joke|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=2007-07-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'', "most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Patrick|date=2018-08-17|title=No Laughter among Thieves: Authenticity and the Enforcement of Community Norms in Stand-Up Comedy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418791174|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|pages=000312241879117|doi=10.1177/0003122418791174|issn=0003-1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"that accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes’ similarity, and enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''JRG Halad Museum''' is a musically-themed museum in [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]] that pays homage to the musical heritage of Cebu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/cebu-lifestyle/2014/03/20/1303068/jrg-halad-museum "JRG Halad Museum"].

==Location==
Located along V. Gullas St. (former Manalili) and D. Jakosalem St. [[Cebu City]], the old building of [[The Freeman Newspaper]] has been converted to a museum which houses Cebuano and Visayan musical treasures and memorabilia.

==History==
Founded by Jose "Dodong" R. Gullas, the Halad Museum was inaugurated on January 12, 2010 and opened to the public on February 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://208.184.76.175/Article.aspx?articleId=543137&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=111]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piramide|first=Aven|title=Halad Museum from a different angle|url=http://www.philstar.com/freeman-opinion/699716/halad-museum-different-angle|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lao|first=Garry|title=Council lauds Gullas for Halad Museum|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=699005&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the founder's support, reviving works of long forgotten composers was achieved via concerts of an award-winning university-based choir, the UV Chorale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2009: A great year for the UV Chorale|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=536169&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the first of the ''Halad'' concerts came about in 2007 wherein a group of composers were honored posthumously including [[Ben Zubiri]], composer of ''Matud Nila'',&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite news|title=Ben Zubiri's piano another addition to Kinaiyang Sugbuanon Museum|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=496461&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=51|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vicente Rubi, composer of [[Kasadya Ning Taknaa]]. This started the donations of family members of the honorees for the three Halad concerts  (in 2007, 2008 and 2010) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=50876]&lt;/ref&gt; from lyric sheets to instruments, prompting the idea of a repository—a museum. Eventually, the founder was inspired to actively acquire other musical memorabilia, not just to keep the memory of the honorees alive, but also hopefully, to educate youngsters on how rich Cebu's musical heritage is.

''Halad'' means tribute or offering in the Cebuano language, as such, the museum is dedicated to the founder's parents, Don Vicente and Inday Pining Gullas, who founded the [[University of the Visayas]] in Cebu, Philippines.

In November 2010, expansion of the museum was carried out to make more room for the increasing collections held by the museum which includes memorabilia of Cebuano composers and artists in the 20th century, from musical instruments, lyric sheets to long-playing records.

The revamped and completed Halad Museum was opened to the public in June 13, 2011 with more musical pieces on exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duraliza|first=Debbie|title=Halad Museum now open to the public with more musical pieces on exhibit|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=695818&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=51|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum features three galleries dedicated to Cebuano music, ''kinaiyang Sugbuanon'' (Cebuano cultural traditions), and the founder's gallery.

==Mission-Vision==
The JRG Halad Museum pays tribute to the enduring legacies of  Cebuano cultural heritage as expressed through music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dioko|first=Eladio|title=Halad - museum for the heart|url=http://www.philstar.com/freeman-opinion/698756/halad-museum-heart|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors experience Cebuano music, performing arts, cultural heritage and research exhibitions.

==Permanent Exhibits==
The Halad Music Gallery displays composers from the 20th century who have produced well-known Cebuano songs, as well as artists who have earned international recognition for their talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sumacot|first=Nina|title=Cebuano culture gets boost with Gullas Halad Museum|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=540379&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights include original music sheets and musical instruments played by the composers themselves and numerous awards and personal items from gowns to gadgets owned by the artists. Turntables and digital music stations are also available for visitors.

The musical memorabilia plus instruments occupy the main section of the museum, but with its recent expansion, it is now home to other interests. The ''Kinaiyang Sugbuanon'' section showcases the Cebuano traditions over time including life-cycle events, popular practices and expressions of religiosity in the different artworks depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomada|first=Nathalie|title=Museum, concert to mark "Kinaiyang Sugbuanon"|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=529927&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another gallery is devoted to the founder who pays tribute to the most influential people in his life, his parents and his living commitment to heritage preservation.

==Resolution==

On June 22, 2011, the Cebu City Council commended the museum founder, Jose R. Gullas, for his efforts to help preserve Cebu's musical and cultural heritage through the Halad Museum. A commendation was made through a resolution sponsored by Councilor Margarita Osmeña, chairperson of the Council’s committee on tourism and culture.

In the Italian higher education system, the various [[:it:Accademia di belle arti|Academies of Fine Arts]] offer second level programs that lead to a "[[:it:Diploma accademico|Diploma Accademico]] di Secondo Livello in Arti Visive e Discipline dello Spettacolo" which translates to "Masters in Visual and Performing Arts". The degree bears this name regardless of whether the discipline studied was in the Visual Arts or the Performing Arts. This credential is thus equivalent if the discipline studied was a Performing Arts discipline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="716">An '''Measured Environmental Concentration (MEC)''' relates to a chemical substance found in an environmental sample. The concentration of the compound may result from direct contamination, transformation and/or metabolization of a different chemical contaminant, natural origin or a combination of these sources. 

MEC is to be used as a reference in the context of [[Chemical Safety Assessment]]s (CSA) and should be compared with the respective [[Predicted Environmental Concentration]] (PEC) and  [[Predicted No-Effect Concentration]] (PNEC) in order to decide whether exposure model is valid and the compound related risk is controlled.

'''''Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'N' Roll Music''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written in 1975 by [[Greil Marcus]]. It features critical essays centered around artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Sly Stone]], [[Robert Johnson]], and [[Randy Newman]].
==Authorship==
[[Greil Marcus]], rock critic and columnist for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and contributor to other publications, such as ''[[Creem]]'', the ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'', and ''[[Artforum]]'', wrote ''Mystery Train'' in 1975. In the prologue, he relates that the book "is no attempt at synthesis, but a recognition of unities in the American imagination that already exist."&lt;ref name=gre&gt;Marcus (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The writing, according to the author, took about "two years of doing nothing else."&lt;ref name=sheff&gt;Sheffield (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mystery Train'', according to one reviewer, reflects on what could be called "the historical turn" that rock took at the close of the [[1960s in music|60s]], initiated by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Band]], and followed through by everyone from [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] to [[Randy Newman]], the music moving "beyond rock'n'roll's teenage immersion in the present to an adult sophistication steeped in deep knowledge of rock's roots in blues and country and lyrics that likewise looked to the past for inspiration."&lt;ref name=rey&gt;Reynolds (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another reviewer, Marcus proceeds in his examination of American popular culture with the "democratic assumption" that Presley and [[Herman Melville]] are already cultural and political equals, and are, therefore, "in conversation with one another - having a dialogue about freedom and limits, innovation and tradition, American dreams and American obsessions."&lt;ref name=cant&gt;Cantwell (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When the 2nd edition came out, Elvis had recently died, and Marcus was asked to amend the chapter relating to Elvis by putting everything in the [[past tense]] but he refused, because, he said, "Elvis' presence was so powerful, I felt he's always in the [[present tense]]."&lt;ref name=&gt;Sheffield (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mystery Train'' opens with an episode on the ''[[Dick Cavett show]]'', where [[Little Richard]] interrupts a disagreement between a writer and a critic, and closes with a [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcript]] of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] arguing with producer [[Sam Phillips]] as they are setting up to record "[[Great Balls of Fire]]" in 1957.&lt;ref name=gre&gt;Marcus (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Critical reception==
[[Frank Rich]] reviewed the book for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and wrote that Marcus' "frame of reference is so vast that he never runs out of connections worth making between the music he loves and just about anything else that matters in American art and life.”&lt;ref name=garner/&gt; [[David Itzkoff]] and [[Alan Light]], in a 2005 critical roundup of music-related books, claimed that ''Myster Train'' is "perhaps the finest book ever written about pop music."&lt;ref name=itz&gt;Itzkoff, Light (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times]]'' literary critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] stated in 2015 that "most critics and serious listeners think [''Mystery Train'']’s almost certainly the best book yet written about American music in general, and about rock in particular."&lt;ref name=garner&gt;Garner (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine picked it among the "100 best and most influential [books] written in English since 1923."&lt;ref name=time&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National History Day''' is non-profit organization based in [[College Park, Maryland]] that operates an annual project-based contest for students in grades 6-12. It has affiliates in all fifty states, Washington, D.C., [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], South Korea, China, South Asia, and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhd.org/affiliates|title=Affiliates {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started as a local program in Cleveland, Ohio, headed by Dr. David Van Tassell, a history professor at [[Case Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref&gt;Gorn, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from 129 students in 1974 to over 500,000 students in 48 states in 1991, and 700,000 students and 40,000 teachers in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Page (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorn (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Today more than half a million students enter through local contests. They construct entries as an individual or a group in one of five categories: Documentary, Exhibit, Paper, Performance or Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhd.org/categories|title=Categories|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Nhd.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students then compete in a series of regional contests with top entries advancing to state/affiliate contests. The top two entries in each category and division are invited to compete at the National Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nhd.org/how-enter-contest|title=How to {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the National History Day Contest==
The contest started in Cleveland in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhd.org/about|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the History Department at [[Case Western Reserve University]] developed the initial idea for a history contest akin to Science Fair. Students gathered on campus to devote one day to history calling it "National History Day." Over the next few years, the contest expanded throughout Ohio and into surrounding Midwestern states. By 1980, with the help of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], National History Day had grown into a national non-profit organization and in 1992 National History Day moved its headquarters from Cleveland to the Washington, D.C., area. National History Day now runs multiple educational programs but the National Contest is still the largest of these. The national finals take place each June during a week-long event held at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Byers, David. "Four score and seven years ago... Costumed history buffs hit campus in national competition." The Diamondback Online 15 June 2006: 1-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National History Day Contest Annual Theme==
The annual theme is usually a phrase ending with "in history" and is often an alliteration, such as, "Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History." The theme frames students’ research within a historical theme. The theme is chosen for the broad application to world, national, or state history and its relevance to ancient history or to the more recent past. The 2018 theme was ''Conflict and Compromise in History,'' and the 2019 theme is ''Triumph and Tragedy in History''. "The intentional selection of the theme for the National History Day Contest is to provide an opportunity for students to push past the antiquated view of history as mere facts and dates and drill down into historical content to develop perspective and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nhd.org/node/542|title=Taking A Stand in History {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Themes are rotated each year and prior themes are often used after approximately seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/previous-annual-themes|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=www.nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

===Judging===
National History Day participants are judged on three deciding factors: Historical Quality, Relation to Theme, and Clarity of Presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/national-contest-judges%E2%80%99-information|title=National History Day &amp;#124; Classroom Connection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Nhd.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research should include primary and secondary sources. Additionally, sources need to be clearly cited with the inclusion of an annotated bibliography. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhd.org/annotated-bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a required process paper that needs to be included with the project, describing your process and struggles in creating an NHD project. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhd.org/annotated-bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and Regional Competitions===
In some regions, students who reach enough points in their judging advance to states, and any number of students at regional competitions can advance to states. In other states, such as California, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, the top three projects at the regional competition advance to the state competition. Regions can be divided by geographic area, population, or by county.

At the state/affiliate level contests, students compete for a variety of prizes. The top two entries in each category and division are invited to the National Contest held each June at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

===National Competition===
====Preliminaries====
In the preliminary rounds, each entry presents their project before a panel of three judges. In the case of the paper and website categories, the projects have been reviewed by the judges prior to the presentations. Performances, documentaries, and exhibits are presented for the judges for the first time at the contest. The top entry in each judging group advances to the final round, called "Run Offs."

====Finals====
Those in the performance and documentary categories are notified they advanced to the final round and then present their work to a panel of three new judges. Those in the paper, website, and exhibit categories are not informed if they have made it into the final round. Their projects are judged by a panel of three new judges, but the students are not interviewed in this round. Their project then has to stand alone for the final judging.

[[File:Scans0012.jpg|thumb|National History Day Medal: 2005-2006|200px|right|Example of a National History Day Medal]] The awards for first, second, and third place at the national level are $1000, $500, and $250, respectively. "Outstanding Entry" awards are also given to two projects from each state: one junior entry and one senior entry. There are also more than a dozen special prizes awarded worth between $250 and $2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/special-prizes|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=www.nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Impact on students ====
An independent study conducted in 2011 demonstrated that students who participate in the National History Day Contest outperform their non-participating peers and score higher on standardized tests, although this might be a reflection on the type of students who choose to participate in National History Day - those who seek to challenge themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.navyhistory.org/2012/07/alaska-students-awarded-nhf-national-history-day-prize/ Three Alaska Students Awarded NHF National History Day Prize]." ''Naval Historical Foundation,'' 17 July 2012. Accessed 10 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on historians===
Arnita Jones, executive director of the [[American Historical Association]], wrote in 2001:
:Perhaps the greatest impact of National History Day...was on the historical profession itself. I truly believe that never have so many historians enjoyed engaging in the pursuit of history outside their offices, their regular classrooms, and their academic research as have the thousands who have participated in National History Day as teachers, mentors, consultants and judges over more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gorn (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plushophilia''' (from "[[Stuffed toy|plushie]]" and "[[-phil-|-philia]]") is a [[paraphilia]] involving [[stuffed animals]]. Most plushophiles modify their [[plushies]] with a hole or holes reminiscent of those found in sex toys, to allow them to sexually interact with their plushies. Plushophiles are sometimes called ''plushies'', although this term (plushies) can also refer to non-sexual stuffed animal enthusiasts, and to stuffed animals in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Hill|first = Dave|title = Cuddle Time|newspaper = [[Salon.com]]|date = 2000-06-19|url =  http://archive.salon.com/sex/feature/2000/06/19/plushies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/04/news/cl-6207 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Once Seen as Taboos, Sexual Fetishes Are Gaining Acceptance | first=Kathleen | last=Kelleher | date=2001-06-04 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular plushies for plushophiles==
*[[Ponies]] – a plush in a pony form, a cartoon from [[My Little Pony]].
*[[Wolf]] – a plush in a wolf form.
*[[Jaguar]] – a plush in a jaguar form.
*[[Tiger]] – a plush in a tiger form.
*[[Bears]] – a large plush in a bear form.

== Furry fandom ==
Plushophilia is sometimes assumed to be a practice common within [[furry fandom]], due in part to a 2001 article by ''Vanity Fair'' that linked various members of the furry community with plushophilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Malisow |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-12-18/news/wild-kingdom/ |title=Wild Kingdom |publisher=Houston Press |date=2003-12-18 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/041201/cover.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830043412/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/041201/cover.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 30, 2002 |accessdate=November 15, 2009 |df= |title=Montreal's furries and furverts defend their unusual lifestyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kates |first=Tasha |url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-07-08/cb2.shtml |title=Animal Magnetism |publisher=Citypaper.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713170850/http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-07-08/cb2.shtml |archivedate=2015-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pittsburgh_city"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1998 survey of 360 members of the furry community suggested less than one percent (that is, fewer than four people) attested to being plushophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visi.com/~phantos/furrysoc.html |title=The Darken Hollow - Thoughts - Furry Sociology |publisher=Visi.com |date=2002-08-01 |accessdate=2013-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015191107/http://www.visi.com/~phantos/furrysoc.html |archivedate=2006-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography and sexual activity involving [[anthropomorphism|animal anthropomorphism]] (including plushophilia and paraphilias involving [[fursuit]]s and [[cartoon animal]]s) is known in the furry fandom community as "[[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|yiff]]" (and sexual acts as "yiffing").&lt;ref name="pittsburgh_city"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8355287.stm | work=BBC News | title=Who are the furries? | date=2009-11-13 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Being in another form ==
[[Anne Lawrence]] has proposed that sexual arousal that depends upon imagining one's self as plush or "representations of anthropomorphic animal characters in [[animated cartoon]]s" be termed '''autoplushophilia'''.&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;Lawrence, A. A. (2009). Erotic target location errors: An under appreciated paraphilic dimension. ''The Journal of Sex Research, 46,'' 194-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Paraphilic interests that involve being in another form have been referred to as [[erotic target location error]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20792">'''Retail design''' is a creative and [[Commerce|commercial]] discipline that combines several different areas of expertise
together in the [[design]] and construction of [[retail]] space. Retail design is primarily a specialized practice of [[architecture]] and [[interior design]], however it also incorporates elements of [[interior decoration]], [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[ergonomics]], and [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7BAPAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MneRTJBRwrvyBpu2vd8F&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA "Retail design"] by Otto Riewoldt, te Neues, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6v83ALvUN6kC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hXyRTPLKBMOB8gbx8q28Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Becoming an Architect: A Guide to Careers in Design"] by Lee W.

Retail design is a very specialized discipline due to the heavy demands placed on retail space. Because the primary purpose of retail space is to stock and sell product to consumers, the spaces must be designed in a way that promotes an enjoyable and hassle-free shopping experience for the consumer.
For example, research shows that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brett A. S. (2012), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Martin-JCR-2012.pdf "A Stranger’s Touch: Effects of Accidental Interpersonal Touch on Consumer Evaluations and Shopping Time"], ''Journal of Consumer Research'', 39 (June), 174-184.&lt;/ref&gt; The space must be specially-tailored to the kind of product being sold in that space; for example, a [[bookstore]] requires many large shelving units to accommodate small products that can be arranged categorically while a clothing store requires more open space to fully display product.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a_6CublRtYwC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Luxury retail design and atmosphere"], ''Luxury fashion branding: trends, tactics, techniques'' by Uché Okonkwo, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, Pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NfglUyGCCF4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Building type basics for retail and mixed-use facilities"] by Stephen A.

Retail spaces, especially when they form part of a [[retail chain]], must also be designed to draw people into the space to shop. The storefront must act as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] for the store, often employing large display windows that allow shoppers to see into the space and the product inside. In the case of a retail chain, the individual spaces must be unified in their design.&lt;ref name="Luxury" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R8N6qJeo1DAC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pHuRTKiHF8K78ga1v5i-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Boutiques and other retail spaces: the architecture of seduction"] by Leontine de Wit, Taylor &amp; Francis US, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Retail design first began to grow in the middle of the 19th century, with stores such as [[Bon Marche]] and [[Printemps]] in [[Paris]], "followed by Marshall Fields in Chicago, Selfridges in London and Macy's in New York." These early retail design stores were swiftly continued with an innovation called the [[chain store]]. 

The first known [[chain stores|chain department stores]] were established in Belgium in 1875, when Isidore, Benjamin and Modeste Dewachter incorporated ''Dewachter frères'' (Dewachter Brothers) selling [[ready-to-wear]] clothing for men and children and specialty clothing such as riding apparel and beachwear.&lt;ref name =ACTS&gt;Annexes to the Belgian Monitor of 1875. Acts, Extracts of Acts, Minutes and Documents relating to Corporations, Book #3, Page 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The firm opened with four locations&lt;ref name =ACTS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:La Louvière|The French Wikipedia site reports that ''Dewachter frères'' opened in La Louvière in 1865, but provides no reference.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1904, ''Maison Dewachter'' (House of Dewachter) had stores in 20 cities and towns in Belgium and France, with multiple stores in some cities.&lt;ref&gt;''Maison Dewachter'' Liège 1891 letterhead&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maison_Dewachter_Bordeaux,_France_Letterhead_1904.png ''Maison Dewachter'' Bordeaux 1904 letterhead listing 20 cities and towns and three stores in Bordeaux itself]&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore's eldest son, Louis Dewachter, managed the chain at its peak and also became an internationally known landscape artist, painting under the pseudonym [[Louis Dewis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisdewis.com LouisDewis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first retail chain store in the United States was opened in the early 20th century by [[Frank Winfield Woolworth]], which quickly became a franchise across the US. Other chain stores began growing in places like the UK a decade or so later, with stores like [[Boots UK|Boots]]. After [[World War II]], a new type of retail design building known as the [[shopping centre]] came into being. This type of building took two different paths in comparison between the US and Europe. Shopping centres began being built out of town within the United States to benefit the [[suburban]] family, while Europe began putting shopping centres in the middle of town. The first shopping centre in the [[Netherlands]] was built in the 1950s, as retail design ideas began spreading east.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPROj1JJIO4C&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=%22Retail+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1neRTLXQJoL68AaJ36XMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Retail%20design%22&amp;f=false "Retail Design"], ''Design: the key concepts'' by Catherine McDermott, Psychology Press, 2007, Pg. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The next evolution of retail design was the creation of the [[boutique]] in the 1960s, which emphasized retail design run by individuals. Some of the earliest examples of boutiques are the [[Biba]] boutique created by [[Barbara Hulanicki]] and the [[Habitat (retailer)|Habitat]] line of stores made by [[Terence Conran]]. The rise of the boutique was followed, in the next two decades, with an overall increase in consumer spending across the [[Developed country|developed world]]. This rise made retail design shift to compensate for increased customers and alternative focuses. Many retail design stores redesigned themselves over the period to keep up with changing consumer tastes. These changes resulted on one side with the creation of multiple "expensive, one-off designer shops" catering to specific [[fashion design]]ers and retailers.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

The rise of the [[internet]] and [[Online shopping|internet retailing]] in the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century saw another change in retail design to compensate. Many different sectors not related to the internet reached out to retail design and its practices to lure online shoppers back to physical shops, where retail design can be properly utilized.&lt;ref name="Key" /&gt;

==Usage==

===Role===
A retail designer must create a thematic experience for the [[consumer]], by using spatial cues to entertain as well as entice the consumer to purchase goods and interact with the space.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.9&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of their designs are not measured by design critics but rather the records of the store which compare amount of foot traffic against the overall productivity. Retail designers have an acute awareness that the store and their designs are the background to the merchandise and are only there to represent and create the best possible environment in which to reflect the merchandise to the target consumer group.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design elements===
Since the evolution of retail design and its impact on productivity have become clear, a series of standardisations in the techniques and design qualities has been determined. These standardisations range from alterations to the perspective of the structure of the space, entrances, circulation systems, atmospheric qualities (light and sound) and materiality. By exploring these standardisations in retail design the consumer will be given a thematic experience that entices them to purchase the merchandise. It is also important to acknowledge that a retail space must combine both permanent and non permanent features, that allow it to change as the needs of the consumer and merchandise change (e.g. per season).&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of retail space creates the constraints of the overall design; often the spaces already exist, and have had many prior uses. It is at this stage that logistics must be determined, structural features like columns, stairways, ceiling height, windows and emergency exists all must be factored into the final design. In retail one hundred percent of the space must be utilised and have a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.15-17&lt;/ref&gt; The floor plan creates the circulation which then directly controls the direction of the traffic flow based on the studied psychology of consumer movement pattern within a retail space. [[circulation (architecture)|Circulation]] is important because it ensures that the consumer moves through the store from front to back, guiding them to important displays and in the end to the cashier.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.&lt;/ref&gt; There are six basic store layouts and circulation plans that all provide a different experience:

# '''Straight plan:''' this plan divides transitional areas from one part of the store to the other by using walls to display merchandise. It also leads the consumer to the back of the store. This design can be used for a variety of stores ranging from pharmacies to apparel.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Pathway plan:''' is most suitable for large stores that are single level. In this plan there is a path that is unobstructed by shop fixtures, this smoothly guides the consumer through to the back of the store. This is well suited for apparel department stores, as the clothes will be easily accessible.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Diagonal plan:''' uses perimeter design which cause angular traffic flow. The cashier is in a central location and easily accessible. This plan is most suited for self-service retail.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.6"/&gt;
# '''Curved plan:''' aims to create an intimate environment that is inviting. In this plan there is an emphasis on the structure of the space including the walls, corners and ceiling this is achieved by making the structure curved and is enhance by circular floor fixtures. Although this is a more expensive layout it is more suited to smaller spaces like salons and boutiques.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.7&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Varied plan:''' in this plan attention is drawn to special focus areas, as well as having storage areas that line the wall. This is best suited for footwear and jewellery retail stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;
# '''Geometric plan:''' uses the racks and the retail floor fixtures to create a geometric floor plan and circulation movement. By lowering parts of the ceiling certain areas can create defined retail spaces. This is well suited for appeal stores.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p.7"/&gt;

Once the overall structure and circulation of the space has been determined, the atmosphere and thematics of the space must be created through lighting, sound, materials and visual branding. These design elements will cohesively have the greatest impact on the consumer and thus the level of productivity that could be achieved.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Lighting can have a dramatic impact on the space. It needs to be functional but also complement the merchandise as well as emphasize key points throughout the store. The lighting should be layered and of a variety of intensities and fixtures. Firstly, examine the natural light and what impact it has in the space. Natural light adds interest and clarity to the space; also consumers also prefer to examine the quality of merchandise in natural light.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.65-80&lt;/ref&gt; If no natural light exists, a sky light can be used to introduce it to the retail space. The lighting of the ceiling and roof is the next thing to consider. This lighting should wash the structural features while creating vectors that direct the consumer to key merchandise selling areas. The next layer should emphasize the selling areas. These lights should be direct but not too bright and harsh. Poor lighting can cause eye strain and an uncomfortable experience for the consumer. To minimize the possibility of eye strain, the ratio of luminance should decrease between merchandise selling areas. The next layer will complement and bring focus onto the merchandise; this lighting should be flattering for the merchandise and consumer. The final layer is to install functional lighting such as clear exit signs.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.147-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.183-191&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambiance can then be developed within the atmosphere through sound and audio, the music played within the store should reflect what your target market would be drawn to, this would also be developed through the merchandise that is being marketed. In a lingerie store the music should be soft, feminine and romanticized; where in a technology department the music would be more upbeat and more masculine.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, E. and Watson, H., 2007. "Fashion Retail". 2nd ed. West Sussex, England: John Wiley and Sons Ltd.p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Materiality (architecture)|Materiality]] is another key selling tool, the choices made must not only be aesthetically pleasing and persuasive but also functional with a minimal need for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.563-566&lt;/ref&gt; Retail spaces are high traffic area and are thus exposed to a lot of wear this means that possible finishes of the materials should be durable. The warmth of a material will make the space more inviting, a floor that is firm and somewhat buoyant will be more comfortable for that consumer to walk on and thus this will allow them to take longer when exploring the store.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p51-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.160-172&lt;/ref&gt; By switching materials throughout the store zones/ areas can be defined, for example by making the path one material and contrast it against another for the selling areas this help to guide the consumer through the store. Colour is also important to consider it must not over power or clash against the merchandise but rather create a complementary background for the merchandise. As merchandise will change seasonally the interior colours should not be trend based but rather have timeless appeal like neutral based colours.&lt;ref name="Barr, V 1990. p51-64"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel, L.J. 1994. p.160-172"/&gt;

Visual branding of the store will ensure a memorable experience for the consumer to take with them once they leave the store ensuring that they will want to return. The key factor is consistency exterior [[brand]]ing and signage should continue into the interior, they should attract, stimulate and dramatise the store. To ensure consistency the font should be consistent with the font size altering.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, L.J., 1994. "Store Planning/ Design". United States of America: John Wiley &amp; sons, INC.p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The interior branding should allow the consumer to easily self direct themselves through the store, proper placement of sales signs that will draw consumer in and show exactly where the cashier is located. The branding should reflect what the merchandise is and what the target market would be drawn to.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, V. and Broudy, C.E., 1990. "Designing to Sell". 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, INC.p.81-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perspective===
The final element of a well-executed retail space is the staging of the consumer's [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. It is the role of retail design to have total control of the view that the consumer will have of the retail space. From the exterior of a retail store the consumer should have a clear unobstructed view into the interior.&lt;ref&gt;*Lopez, M. J., 2003. "Retail Store Planning And Design Manual". 2nd ed. Cincinnati, Ohio: ST Publications.p.169-170&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Reye syndrome''' is a rapidly progressive [[encephalopathy]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Symptoms may include [[vomiting]], personality changes, confusion, [[seizure]]s, and [[loss of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; Even though [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]] typically occurs, [[jaundice]] usually does not.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Death occurs in 20–40% of those affected and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sch2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrör|first1=K|title=Aspirin and Reye syndrome: a review of the evidence.|journal=Paediatric drugs|date=2007|volume=9|issue=3|pages=195–204|pmid=17523700|doi=10.2165/00148581-200709030-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; It usually begins shortly after recovery from a [[viral infection]], such as [[influenza]] or [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Reye's Syndrome Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/reyes_syndrome/reyes_syndrome.htm|website=NINDS|accessdate=August 8, 2016|date=September 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801041308/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/reyes_syndrome/reyes_syndrome.htm|archive-date=August 1, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of cases in children are associated with [[aspirin]] (salicylate) use.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; [[Inborn errors of metabolism]] are also a risk factor.&lt;ref name=Sch2007/&gt; Changes on blood tests may include a [[hyperammonemia|high blood ammonia level]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar level]], and prolonged [[prothrombin time]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Often the [[hepatomegaly|liver is enlarged]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is typically by avoiding the use of aspirin in children.&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; When aspirin was withdrawn for use in children a decrease of more than 90% in rates of Reye syndrome was seen.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Early diagnosis improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; Treatment is [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; [[Mannitol]] may be used to help with the [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, history, and culture --&gt;
The first detailed description of Reye syndrome was in 1963 by [[Douglas Reye]], an Australian pathologist.&lt;ref name=Os2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillan|first1=Julia A.|last2=Feigin|first2=Ralph D.|last3=DeAngelis|first3=Catherine|last4=Jones|first4=M.

==Causes==
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; It usually begins shortly after recovery from a [[viral infection]], such as [[influenza]] or [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; About 90% of cases in children are associated with [[aspirin]] (salicylate) use.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; [[Inborn errors of metabolism]] are also a risk factor.&lt;ref name=Sch2007/&gt;

The association with aspirin has been shown through epidemiological studies. The diagnosis of "Reye Syndrome" greatly decreased in the 1980s, when genetic testing for [[inborn errors of metabolism]] was becoming available in [[developed country|developed countries]].&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"/&gt; A retrospective study of 49 survivors of cases diagnosed as "Reye's Syndrome" showed that the majority of the surviving patients had various metabolic disorders, particularly a fatty-acid oxidation disorder [[medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orlowski JP |title=Whatever happened to Reye's syndrome? Did it ever really exist? |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=1582–7 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10470768 |doi=10.1097/00003246-199908000-00032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspirin===
There is an association between taking [[aspirin]] for viral illnesses and the development of Reye syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hurwitz | first1 = E. S. | title = Reye's syndrome | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = 249–253 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2680560}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no animal model of Reye syndrome has been developed in which aspirin causes the condition.&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR |title=Is aspirin a cause of Reye's syndrome? A case against |journal=Drug Safety |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=225–31 |year=2002 |pmid=11994026 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/dsf/2002/00000025/00000004/art00001 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200225040-00001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023203232/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/dsf/2002/00000025/00000004/art00001 |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The serious symptoms of Reye syndrome appear to result from damage to cellular [[mitochondria]],&lt;ref name="pmid18725066"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gosalakkal JA, Kamoji V |title=Reye syndrome and reye-like syndrome |journal=Pediatric Neurology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=198–200 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18725066 |doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2008.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the liver, and there are a number of ways that aspirin could cause or exacerbate mitochondrial damage. A potential increased risk of developing Reye syndrome is one of the main reasons that aspirin has not been recommended for use in children and teenagers, the age group for which the risk of lasting serious effects is highest.

In some countries, oral mouthcare product [[Bonjela]] (not the form specifically designed for teething) has labeling cautioning against its use in children, given its [[salicylate]] content. There have been no cases of Reye syndrome following its use, and the measure is a precaution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON044014 |title=New advice on oral salicylate gels in under 16s |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426205906/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON044014 |archivedate=April 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other medications containing salicylates are often similarly labeled as a precaution.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be given to children under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses. Hence, in the [[United States]], it is advised that the opinion of a doctor or pharmacist should be obtained before anyone under 19 years of age is given any medication containing aspirin (also known on some medicine labels as acetylsalicylate, salicylate, acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, or salicylic acid).

Current advice in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] is that aspirin should not be given to those under the age of 16 years, unless specifically indicated in [[Kawasaki disease]] or in the prevention of blood clot formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[British National Formulary for Children]] |chapter=2.9 Antiplatelet drugs |year=2007 |pages=151 |publisher=British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Causes for similar symptoms include
* Various inborn [[metabolic disorders]]
* [[Viral encephalitis]]
* [[Drug overdose]] or [[poison]]ing
* [[Head trauma]]
* [[Liver failure]] due to other causes
* [[Meningitis]]
* [[Kidney failure]]
* [[Shaken baby syndrome]]

==Treatment==
Treatment is [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; [[Mannitol]] may be used to help with the [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Documented cases of Reye syndrome in adults are rare. The recovery of adults with the syndrome is generally complete, with liver and brain function returning to normal within two weeks of onset.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In children, mild to severe permanent brain damage is possible, especially in infants.  Over thirty percent of the cases reported in the United States from 1981 through 1997 resulted in fatality.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Epidemiology==
Reye syndrome occurs almost exclusively in children.  While a few adult cases have been reported over the years, these cases do not typically show permanent neural or liver damage. Unlike in the UK, the surveillance for Reye syndrome in the US is focused on patients under 18 years of age.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1980, after the CDC began cautioning physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses, the incidence of Reye syndrome in the United States began to decline. However, the decline began prior to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s issue of warning labels on aspirin in 1986.&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"/&gt; In the United States between 1980 and 1997, the number of reported cases of Reye syndrome decreased from 555 cases in 1980 to about 2 cases per year since 1994. During this time period 93% of reported cases for which racial data were available occurred in whites and the median age was six years. In 93% of cases a viral illness had occurred  in the preceding three-week period. For the period 1991-1994, the annual rate of hospitalizations due to Reye syndrome in the US was estimated to be between 0.2 and 1.1 per million population less than 18 years of age.

During the 1980s, a case-control study carried out in the United Kingdom also demonstrated an association between Reye syndrome and aspirin exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall SM, Plaster PA, Glasgow JF, Hancock P |title=Preadmission antipyretics in Reye's syndrome |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=857–66 |year=1988 |pmid=3415311 |doi=10.1136/adc.63.7.857 |pmc=1779086}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1986, the United Kingdom [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] issued warnings against the use of aspirin in children under 12 years of age and warning labels on aspirin-containing medications were introduced. UK surveillance for Reye syndrome documented a decline in the incidence of the illness after 1986. The reported incidence rate of Reye syndrome decreased from a high of 0.63 per 100,000 population less than 12 years of age in 1983/84 to 0.11 in 1990/91.

From November 1995 to November 1996 in France, a national survey of pediatric departments for children under 15 years of age with unexplained [[encephalopathy]] and a threefold (or greater) increase in serum aminotransferase and/or ammonia led to the identification of nine definite cases of Reye syndrome (0.79 cases per million children).  Eight of the nine children with Reye syndrome were found to have been exposed to aspirin.  In part because of this survey result, the French Medicines Agency reinforced the international attention to the relationship between aspirin and Reye syndrome by issuing its own public and professional warnings about this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Autret-Leca E |title=Incidence of Reye's syndrome in France: a hospital-based survey |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=857–62 |year=2001 |pmid=11470397|doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(00)00366-8 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Jonville-Béra AP |author3=Llau ME |display-authors=3 |last4=Bavoux |first4=F |last5=Saudubray |first5=JM |last6=Laugier |first6=J |last7=Devictor |first7=D |last8=Barbier |first8=P |last9=French Departments Of |first9=Paediatrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The syndrome is named after Dr. [[Douglas Reye]], who, along with fellow physicians Drs. Graeme Morgan and Jim Baral, published the first study of the syndrome in 1963 in ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reye RD, Morgan G, Baral J |title=Encephalopathy and fatty degeneration of the viscera. A Disease entity in childhood|journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue= 7311|pages=749–52 |year=1963 |pmid=14055046 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(63)90554-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, the occurrence of the syndrome may have first been reported in 1929. Also in 1964, Dr. George Johnson and colleagues published an investigation of an outbreak of influenza B that described 16 children who developed neurological problems, four of whom had a profile remarkably similar to Reye syndrome.  Some investigators refer to this disorder as Reye-Johnson syndrome, although it is more commonly called Reye syndrome. In 1979, Dr. Karen Starko and colleagues conducted a case-control study in Phoenix, Arizona and found the first statistically-significant link between aspirin use and Reye syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Starko KM, Ray CG, Dominguez LB, Stromberg WL, Woodall DF |title=Reye's syndrome and salicylate use| journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1980| volume=66|issue=6| pages=859–864|pmid=7454476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in Ohio and Michigan soon confirmed her findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortimor|first=Edward A., Jr.|title=Reye Syndrome-Ohio, Michigan|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|issue=29|date=June 1, 1980|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/6/810|pmid=7079050|volume=69|pages=532, 810–2|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611051716/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/6/810|archivedate=June 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to the use of aspirin during an upper respiratory tract or chickenpox infection as a possible trigger of the syndrome.  Beginning in 1980, the CDC cautioned physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children and teenagers with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses.  In 1982 the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory, and in 1986 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] required a Reye syndrome-related warning label for all aspirin-containing medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aspirin Labels to Warn About Reye Syndrome|author=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/aspirin-labels-to-warn-about-reye-syndrome.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 8, 1986|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064153/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/aspirin-labels-to-warn-about-reye-syndrome.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12125">The assessment of '''risk factors for [[genocide]]''' is an upstream prevention mechanism for genocide. This means that, if used correctly, the international community would be able to foresee a genocide before the killing took place, and prevent it. Countries can have many warning signs that it may be leaning in the direction of a future genocide. If signs are presented the international community takes notes of them and watches over the countries that have a higher risk. Many different scholars, and international groups, have come up with different factors that they think should be considered while examining whether a nation is at risk or not.  One predominant scholar in the field [[James Waller]] came up with his own four categories of risk factors; including, governance, conflict history, economic conditions, and social fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, James, Dr. "Upstream Prevention: Risk Assessment and Prediction." HGS 374 Comparative Genocide. [[Keene State College]], Keene. 03 Mar. 2015. Lecture.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dr. [[James Waller]]'s risk factors ==

=== Governance ===

The regime type of the government is an indicator on whether the nation is in danger of genocide or not. An anocratic, or a transitional government, is the government that is in the most danger while a full monarchy, in the most stable.  The nation also has a higher risk if there is state legitimacy deficit, which would include high corruption, disregard for constitutional norms, or mass protests. If a state structure is weak and provides poor basic services for the citizens, restricted the rule of law, or has a lack of civilian protection, it also creates a higher risk and could become unstable. If there is identity-based polar factionalism or systematic state-led discrimination through exclusionary ideology, or political contentious along identity line this can create a divide of people in the nation creating different ranks and violence amongst the civilians.

=== Conflict History ===

A state is more likely to experience genocide or mass atrocity if they have a history of identity-related tensions, otherwise known as a tendency of othering, or if the state had prior genocides/[[politicide]]s, this is because a government may already have the previous weapons, strategies, and power since the last genocide. They are also aware of how much damage they can do once more if they have gotten away in the past. Also if the state has had a record of serious violations of international human rights laws, as the country is more sensitized to the violence and may be less aware of what is happening around them.  Other conflict histories that put a state at risk are past cultural traumas that have hurt the core social identity of the state, or if the people have been known to have a legacy of group grievances or vengeance. The more conflict a country has had in the past can make them more unstable and more at risk for genocide.

=== Economic Conditions ===

States with low levels of economy development are more likely to have problems because it creates low opportunity cost for mass violence, as the citizen’s lives aren't valued as much as in an economy that has high levels. States that practice economic discrimination, make it so one group of people have the most economic opportunity, forcing the other group to be unemployed and or if they have horizontal economic inequalities, which is when a country’s economy is based on a small number of opportunities, products.  Those conditions with the addition of high unemployment rates, foreign debt, and informal economies such as growing [[black market]]s a country is at risk of its economic conditions playing into their risk factors for Genocide.

=== Social Fragmentation ===

Social fragmentation can by five major subcategories; identity-based social divisions, demographic pressures, unequal access to basic goods and services, gender inequalities, and political instability.  Identity-based social divisions, constitute of differential access to power, wealth, statues, and resources, meaning that certain people have more access to what the need to live than others, or when a state practices hate speech, like [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|RTLMC]] in Rwanda.  Demographic pressures can be experienced in a state has a high population density, massive movements of refugees or internal displaced peoples, or a male youth bulge, which means that there is a high male population with nothing really to do. Unequal access to basic goods and services, which can be shown by high infant mortality rates, as mothers and children would not be getting the proper care that they needed to grow and be healthy.  Gender inequalities are shown in rate of violence against women, as these are normally an indicator of how the country views their women, and if it is a low rate they normally see them more as equals.  Political instability can be revealed by hurtful regime changes, threats of armed conflict, proportions of populations that are armed, and where the country is in the world, and if its neighboring countries have conflict it has been known to spill into the neighboring regions.

If a nation has one or more of these risk factors it does not mean that they will have a genocide but they are simply additive factors that when put together can be used to help predict and defuse a tense, or dangerous, situation. There is no guarantee or formula that allows you to predict the future but instead thing to help us learn from the past to help protect the future.

== UN risk assessment “Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes" ==
The [[United Nations]] have their list of 14 risk factors for atrocity crimes with multiple indicators for each factor. These risk factors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/methodology.shtml | title=Office of The Special Adviser on The Prevention of Genocide | publisher=UN | work=UN News Center | accessdate=July 8, 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209184252/http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/methodology.shtml | archivedate= February 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common risk factors:
# Situation of armed conflict or other forms of instability
# Record of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law
# Weakness of State structures
# Motives or incentives
# Capacity to commit atrocity crimes
# Absence of mitigating factors
# Enabling circumstances or preparatory action
# Triggering factors
Risk factors specific to each international crime:

For genocide:
# Intergroup tensions or patterns of discrimination against protected groups
# Signs of an intent to destroy in whole or in part a protected group

For crimes against humanity:
# Signs of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population
# Signs of a plan or policy to attack any civilian population

For war crimes:
# Serious threats to those protected under IHL
# Serious threats to humanitarian or peacekeeping operations

The UN is different in that it separates specific factors that lead to different crimes. Such that “serious threats to humanitarian or peacekeeping operators” will lead to war crimes while “Intergroup tensions or patterns of discrimination against protected groups” (under Article 2 of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]) is a risk factor to genocide. These guidelines were expanded upon and published in 2014 as the booklet ''Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes: A tool for prevention''.&lt;ref name="UN Framework of Analysis"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/publications-and-resources/Framework%20of%20Analysis%20for%20Atrocity%20Crimes_EN.pdf | title=Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes: A tool for prevention | publisher=United Nations | author=United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect | year=2014 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fund for Peace’s Analysis: “Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST)”  ==
[[The Fund for Peace]] non-profit organization, has written a conflict assessment framework manual to help “meet security challenges stemming from weak and failing states.” CAST has 12 pressure indicators including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/cfsir1418 | title=CAST Conflict Assessment Framework Manual (CFSIR1418, 2014 Reprint) | publisher=[[The Fund for Peace]] | year=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Demographic pressures
# Refugees and internally displaced people
# Group grievance
# Human flight and brain drain
# Uneven economic development 
# Economic decline
# State Legitimacy  
# Public Services 
# Human rights and rule of law
# Security Apparatus 
# Factionalized Elites 
# External intervention

Along with each pressure indicator is a list of scores indicating when that indicator is becoming a serious risk factor. A score of 0 means there is no risk at all score of 10 would be a serious problem. Also included in the CAST is a guide to assessing the capacities of the state. The capacities are leadership, military, police, judiciary and civil service.

== European Commission: checklist for root causes of conflict ==
The [[European Commission]] has come up with their own risk factors to countries with possible atrocities coming in the near future. The eight risk factors they chose are:&lt;ref&gt;Ahlfors, K., and M. Van Bellingen Relex. [http://www.eplo.org/assets/files/3.%20Resources/EU%20Documents/European%20Commission_Programming%20Fiche_Conflict_Prevention.pdf "Programming Guide for Strategy Papers."] [[European Peacebuilding Liaison Office]]. European Commission, Nov. 2008. Web. 20 Apr. 2015. &lt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Legitimacy Deficit 
# Restrictions to the rule of law
# Violations on fundamental rights
# Weak civil society and media
# Tensions between communities/ Absence of dispute-resolution mechanisms 
# Poor economic management 
# Socio-economic regional inequalities 
# Geopolitical instability

Each risk factor has other multiple subsections that can point to more specific events that can be seen as potential risk factors for conflict. Along with the subsections, there are examples of what possible objectives could be in order to improve that specific risk factor.

== Dr. Gregory Stanton: "Ten Stages of Genocide"==
The International Alliance to End Genocide published [[Gregory Stanton]]’s list of ten stages of genocide, which include, in this order:&lt;ref name="Stanton-Ten Stages"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/genocide/tenstagesofgenocide.html | title=The Ten Stages of Genocide | publisher=The International Alliance to End Genocide|work=Genocide Watch | accessdate=July 8, 2017 | author=Stanton, Gregory H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Classification
# Symbolization
# Discrimination
# Dehumanization
# Organization
# Polarization
# Preparation
# Persecution
# Extermination
# Denial
These stages are can be seen with every genocide so far and can be used as red flags for future ones. Each stage has an explanation of what it is and examples of it. This list of risk factors has been used by the US State Department.

== Dr. Barbara Harff ==
[[Barbara Harff]] came up with a list of seven risk factors for genocide and politicide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gpanet.org/content/risks-new-onsets-genocide-and-politicide-2013 | title=Risks of New Onsets of Genocide and Politicide in 2013 | publisher=s | date=December 3, 2013| accessdate=July 8, 2017 | author=Harff, Dr. Barbara, and [[Ted Robert Gurr]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Recent changes in Geno/pol Hazards
# Current Instability
# Contention re Elite Ethnicity 
# Regime Type 
# Targets of Systematic Discrimination 
# Exclusionary Ideology 
# Past Geno/Politicides

Barbara Harff uses these risk factors and gives each potential country at risk a hazard ratio score along with each onset of genocide. This is a more complicated way of assessing the risks of other countries, but having a number is more relatable to assessing risk.

'''Roger Searle Payne''' (born January 29, 1935) is an [[United States|American]] [[biologist]] and [[environmentalist]] famous for the 1967 discovery (with Scott McVay) of [[whale song]] among [[humpback whales]]. Payne later became an important figure in the worldwide campaign to end [[whaling|commercial whaling]].

==History==
Payne was born in [[New York, New York]], and received his BA degree at [[Harvard University]] and his Ph.D. at [[Cornell]]. He spent the early years of his career studying [[animal echolocation#Bats|echolocation]] in [[bat]]s (and how their food, [[moth]]s, avoid them) and [[Sound localization|auditory localization]] in [[owls]]. Desiring to work with something more directly linked to conservation he later focused his research on [[whales]] where, together with researcher Scott McVay, in 1967 they discovered the complex sonic arrangements performed by the male humpback whales during the [[breeding season]].

Payne describes the whale songs as "exuberant, uninterrupted rivers of sound" with long repeated "themes", each song lasting up to 30 minutes and sung by an entire group of male humpbacks at once. The songs would be varied slightly between each breeding season, with a few new phrases added on and a few others dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whaletrust.org/what-we-do/humpback-whale-research/whale-song/song-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;  Payne has led many expeditions on the world's oceans studying whales, their migrations, cultures and vocalizations.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;https://www.pbs.org/odyssey/odyssey/roger_payne.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne was also the first to suggest [[fin whale]]s and [[blue whale]]s can communicate with sound across whole oceans, a theory since confirmed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some of Payne's recordings were released in 1970 as an [[LP album|LP]] called ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'' (still the best-selling nature sound record of all time&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;) which helped to gain momentum for the Save the Whales movement seeking to end [[commercial whaling]], which at the time was pushing many species dangerously close to [[extinction]]. Commercial whaling was finally banned by the [[International Whaling Commission]] in 1986.

In 1975 a second LP was released, and in 1987 Payne collaborated with musician [[Paul Winter]] putting whalesong to human music.

Whale recordings by Frank Watlington (with commentary by Roger Payne) were released on a [[Flexi disc]] soundsheet inside the January 1979 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine. This issue, at 10.5 million copies, became the largest single press run of any record at the time.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/radiox/humpback/hw_archive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723011927/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/radiox/humpback/hw_archive.html |archivedate=2015-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to whale recordings Payne has also published books and worked with film crews on many [[television]] [[documentary]] productions and on the [[IMAX]] [[movie]] ''Whales: An Unforgettable Journey''.

In 1971, Payne founded [[Ocean Alliance]], a [[501(c)3]] organization working with whale and ocean conservation. It is based in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].  He still heads the organization.  He was also an [[assistant professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Rockefeller University]] and, concurrently, a research [[zoologist]] at the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior, run by [[Rockefeller University]] and the [[New York Zoological Society]].&lt;ref name=WhoWho&gt;"Roger Searle Payne."

From 1960-1985 Roger Payne was married to noted elephant researcher [[Katharine Payne]], who performed similar research on the vocalizations of elephants (and Humpbacks).&lt;ref&gt;http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/8903200609/rap-songs-from-deep&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influence==
*Singer [[Judy Collins]] released her best-selling album ''[[Whales &amp; Nightingales]]'' in 1970, which featured some of Roger's whale recordings on the track "Farewell to Tarwathie."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richieunterberger.com/whales.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Also in 1970 composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] composed [[And God Created Great Whales]], the score for which calls for excerpts from Payne's recordings
*In 1977 Roger Payne's [[Whale vocalization|recordings of Humpback whales]] were included in the [[Voyager Golden Record]] carried aboard the [[Voyager program]] spacecraft, the first human artifacts to leave our [[Solar System]].
*Singer [[Kate Bush]]'s debut album ''[[The Kick Inside]]'' in 1978 features a portion of 'slowed-down solo whale' (from ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'') as an intro to the opening track "[[Moving (Kate Bush song)|Moving]]".
*[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] (1986) features Payne's recordings, in a plot about rescuing Humpback whales from extinction by moving a breeding pair from 1986 to three hundred years in the future.
*In 2010, the band [[Glass Wave]] included Payne's whale recordings in the first track ("Balena") and last track ("Moby Dick") of their album.

The '''Royal College of Science for Ireland''' ('''RCScI'''&lt;ref name="ucdrcsci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/rcsci.html|title=The Royal College of Science for Ireland|year=2011|work=Merrion Street|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an institute for [[higher education]] in Dublin which existed from 1867 to 1926, specialising in [[physical sciences]] and [[applied science]]. It was originally based on [[St. Stephen's Green]],  moving in 1911 to [[Government Buildings|a purpose-built "Royal College of Science" building]] on [[Merrion Street]]. In 1926 it was absorbed into [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) as the [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] of Science and Engineering.

==Foundation==
The Museum of Economic Geology was founded by the [[Dublin Castle administration]] in 1845, with chemist [[Robert Kane (chemist)|Robert Kane]] as curator, and a focus on [[mining in Ireland]] similar to the [[Geological Museum|Museum of Practical Geology]] in London.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380225 p.ix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|title=The Museum of Irish Industry|work=Permanent Exhibitions &gt; Out of Storage|publisher=[[National Museum of Ireland]]|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216193808/http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/exhibition-details-outofstorage.aspx?article=5be165bf-d84b-4c9a-a83f-4473c71bea70|archivedate=16 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Kane was promoted to director, expanding its remit, and renaming it the [[Museum of Irish Industry]] (MII).&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1853 a new [[Science and Art Department]] was created within [[Government of the United Kingdom|the Whitehall administration]], and in 1854 the MII placed under its remit.&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380230 p.xiv]&lt;/ref&gt; A School of Science applied to Mining and the Arts was created, modelled on the [[Royal School of Mines]] in London, with four professorships shared jointly by the MII school and the [[Royal Dublin Society]] (RDS).&lt;ref name="sc1864p14"/&gt; The MII and School shared premises at 51, St. Stephen's Green, acquired in 1846 and fitted out by 1852.&lt;ref name="sc1864p9"/&gt; In 1864, a [[select committee]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] recommended that the MII and School be entirely separated from the RDS and broadened into a government-supported College of Science for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee (1864) [http://www.dippam.ac.uk/eppi/documents/14615/page/380239 p.xxiii §§5–8]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[HM Treasury]] agreed and in 1867 a commission was appointed by the education committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The commission, headed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], outlined the scope and functions of the proposed college, and the RCScI mission statement on 11 September 1867 was:&lt;ref name="ucdarch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/archives/html/university/rcsi.htm|title=Royal College of Science in Ireland|work=Archives|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:The object of the Royal College of Science is to supply as far as practicable a Complete Course of instruction in Science applicable to the Industrial Arts, especially those which may be classed broadly under the heads of Mining, Agriculture, Engineering, and Manufactures, and to aid in the instruction of Teachers for the local Schools of Science

[[George Sigerson]] complained in 1868 that the RCScI was less open to Catholics than the MII had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Ireland: Its Vital Questions, Secret Societies, and Government |url=https://archive.org/details/modernirelandit00sigegoog |chapterurl=http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/ModIrelandRoyalCollege/index.php |year=1868 |publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer |location=London |pages=197–207 |chapter=The Royal College of Science for Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later development==
The RCScI's remit was later changed to exclude include agriculture and include "Physics and Natural Science".&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt;  The number of students enrolled increased gradually.&lt;ref name="ivrla30371"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.ucd.ie/view/ivrla:30371|title=RCSI numbers of attendence &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|date=1 December 2009|work=UCD Digital Library|publisher=UCD|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898 the RCScI had chairs of Mining and Mineralogy, Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Botany, Geology, Applied Mathematics and Mechanism, Descriptive Geometry and Engineering.&lt;ref name="ucdarch"/&gt; In 1900, control was transferred from the Science and Art Department in London to the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in Dublin, headed by [[Horace Plunkett]].&lt;ref name="ucdrcsci"/&gt; A new building was proposed in 1897 and a site from [[Merrion Street]] to [[Kildare Street]] was chosen in 1898; in 1899 the plan was extended to include government administrative offices as well as the new college.&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/newbuilding.html|title=The New Building|year=2011|work=Merrion Street|publisher=UCD|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building was designed by Sir [[Aston Webb]]; the [[foundation stone]] was laid in 1904 by [[Edward VII]] and it was opened in 1911 by [[George V]].&lt;ref name="ucdnewbldg"/&gt;

In 1926 the RCScI was absorbed into UCD where it became the UCD Science and Engineering faculties. Science moved to [[National Concert Hall|UCD's Earlsfort Terrace building]], and on to [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]]  in the 1960s; Engineering moved from Merrion Street to Belfield in 1989. The RCScI building was then absorbed into [[Government Buildings]] with the rest of Aston Webb's complex, lavishly renovated by [[Charles Haughey]] and used to house the [[Department of the Taoiseach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/History_of_Government_Buildings/|title=History of Government Buildings: 1904-1922 and 1990|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SOLAS''' ({{lang-ga|An tSeirbhís Oideachais Leanúnaigh agus Scileanna|lit=Further Education and Skills Service}}) is a [[Public service bodies of the Republic of Ireland|state agency]] in Ireland. SOLAS was established on {{start date|2013|10|27}}. Its mandate is set out in the Further Education and Training Act 2013. Among other functions such as research, monitoring and co-ordinating of further education and training provision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=A lot done in further education ... more to do|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/a-lot-done-in-further-education-more-to-do-1.1925529?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.irishtimes.com%252Fnews%252Feducation%252Fa-lot-done-in-further-education-more-to-do-1.1925529|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also advances moneys to education and training boards and other bodies engaged in the provision of further education and training programmes. 

The sixteen education and training boards (ETBs) were established on the dissolution of the 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs).&lt;ref name="irishtimes-2013"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=If Solas is the new FÁS, can it make a difference?|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/if-solas-is-the-new-f%25C3%25A1s-can-it-make-a-difference-1.1253198|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time FAS, the national training and employment authority established in 1987, was also dissolved.&lt;ref name="irishtimes-2013"/&gt; The [[Department of Social Protection]] took over the responsibility from FÁS for Community Employment and Employment Services and over 800 former FAS staff. In 2014 the transfer of the former FAS training centre network, its 600+ staff and training facilities to the newly established education and training boards was successfully completed.

ETBs grant aided by SOLAS, offer around 270,000 places on 20,000+ further education and training courses in any one year. SOLAS also administers the Irish apprenticeship system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-26|title=Thousands opt for further education programmes, apprenticeships, traineeships|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/thousands-opt-for-further-education-programmes-apprenticeships-traineeships-1.3601982|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOLAS publishes an annual services plan setting out what further education and training courses will be provided in the sixteen ETBs in any one year and how much these courses will cost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7720">The '''Safe Campus Act''' ({{USBill|114|H.R.|3403}}) was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] by [[Matt Salmon]] (R-AZ), [[Pete Sessions]] (R-TX), and [[Kay Granger]] (R-TX) on July 29, 2015.&lt;ref name="Fraternity Groups"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingkade|first1=Tyler|title=Fraternity Groups Push Bills To Limit College Rape Investigations|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fraternity-groups-college-rape_55c10396e4b0e716be074a7f|accessdate=18 October 2015|work=Huffingtonpost.com|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill aims to prevent colleges from pursuing internal investigations in cases of [[campus sexual assault]].&lt;ref name="28 Groups"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingkade|first1=Tyler|title=28 Groups That Work With Rape Victims Think The Safe Campus Act Is Terrible|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rape-victims-safe-campus-act_55f300cce4b063ecbfa4150b|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction would legally require alleged victims of [[sexual assault]] to report the crime to the police in order to see justice on campus.&lt;ref name="28 Groups" /&gt;

==Major provisions==
===Reporting to law enforcement===
The Safe Campus Act would require schools to report each allegation of sexual violence to local law enforcement for investigation after obtaining written consent from the alleged victim.  Schools would be required to wait for the results of a law enforcement investigation before beginning their own internal disciplinary procedures and would not be allowed to punish the accused in cases where the alleged victim did not consent to a law enforcement investigation.  In cases where deemed necessary to protect the safety of the alleged victim, schools would be permitted to impose interim measures such as temporary suspensions, no contact orders, adjustments to class schedules, and changes in housing assignments.  These interim measures would be lifted after the completion of the law enforcement investigation if it did not result in an indictment.  Alleged victims would have the right to submit a joint request with law enforcement for interim measures if both agreed that they would not protect the safety of the alleged victim, and schools would be required to honor such a request.  Students would be protected from being disciplined for violations of school rules that came to light as a result of their reporting of sexual violence.

===Due process===
The Safe Campus Act would require a formal hearing before students could be disciplined for sexual violence.  Schools would be required to provide all parties with at least two weeks notice before the hearing.  Both the accused and the alleged victim would have the right to an attorney at their own expense, the right to access all evidence, and the right to cross-examination, although such cross-examination would be prohibited from including any questions on the sexual history of the alleged victim.  Schools would be required to ensure that those adjudicating allegations do not have conflicts of interest.  Students who are found responsible for sexual violence would have the right to judicial review of that decision.  Schools would be required to publish their procedures for adjudicating allegations of sexual violence in their student handbooks.

=== Sexual Violence Education ===
The Safe Campus Act requires universities to educate all adult and student staff on sexual assault and reporting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3403/text|title=Safe Campus Act of 2015|last=Salmon|first=Matt|date=29 July 2015|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encourages but does not require the university to provide sexual assault education to the students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Universities must allocate funds to these programs and for programs to help victims of sexual assault on campus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The provision requiring an alleged victim to report an act of sexual violence to law enforcement before the accused student could be punished has generated controversy.

=== Opponents ===
The bill's opponents point to low reporting rates in cases of sexual assault and insist forced reporting to the police will inhibit even more victims from coming forward as victims of a sexual crime.&lt;ref name="Fraternity Groups"/&gt; Opponents also point out that this bill singles out sexual assault crimes, as colleges can still punish students with other accusations, even without a criminal investigation.&lt;ref name="28 Groups"/&gt; Some of the most outspoken opponents of this bill are the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] and the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|North American Inter-fraternity Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/11/forcing-colleges-to-involve-police-in-sexual-assault-investigations/416736/|title=Forcing Colleges to Involve Police in Sexual-Assault Investigations?|last=Bishop|first=Tyler|date=19 November 2015|website=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Fair Campus Act ====

The Fair Campus Act was introduced shortly after the Safe Campus Act as a response to the criticism of the Safe Campus Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/phi-mu-alpha-gamma-delta-safe-campus-act_us_5645f573e4b045bf3deead24|title=Several Sororities Back Away From Safe Campus Act|last=Editor/Reporter|first=Tyler Kingkade Senior|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=2015-11-13|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill is very similar but does not require sexual assault victims to report to the police in order for there to be a college investigation, which was the main issue for the opponents of the Safe Campus Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3408/text|title=The Fair Campus Act of 2015|last=Sessions|first=Pete|date=16 November 2015|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporters ===
Supporters of this bill claim mandatory police reporting will ensure students have access to fair representation during a trial, which may not be the case in a campus hearing, as it does not have criminal implications without the police.&lt;ref name="Fair hearing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svruluga|first1=Susan|title=Do students get a fair hearing? An effort to change how colleges handle sexual assaults.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/07/29/do-students-get-a-fair-hearing-an-effort-to-change-how-colleges-handle-sexual-assaults/|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Campus Act is supported by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and the National District Attorneys Association.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/07/29/do-students-get-a-fair-hearing-an-effort-to-change-how-colleges-handle-sexual-assaults/|last=Svrluga|first=Susan|title=Do students get a fair hearing?|journal=The Washington Post|date=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-group-backs-changes-to-college-campus-sexual-assault-investigations-1439569461|last=Bauerlein|first=Valerie|title=Prosecutors' Group Backs Changes to College Campus Sexual Assault Investigations|journal=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex surrogates''', sometimes referred to as '''surrogate partners''', are practitioners trained in addressing issues of intimacy and sexuality. A surrogate partner works in collaboration with a therapist to meet the goals of their client. This triadic model is used to dually support the client: the client engages in experiential exercises and builds a relationship with their surrogate partner while processing and integrating their experiences with their therapist or clinician.

==Overview==
The modality in which surrogate partners work is called '''Surrogate Partner Therapy'''. This modality is used to address obstacles to physical and emotional intimacy that a client is unable to resolve through traditional therapy and requires the involvement of a partner. Clients’ presenting issues have commonly included [[sexual dysfunction]]s, lack of healthy intimate experiences, or traumatic history.

==History==
[[Masters and Johnson]] introduced the practice in their book ''Human Sexual Inadequacy''&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT wikilink 'Human Sexual Inadequacy' so long as it redirects to [[Masters and Johnson]] --&gt;, published in 1970. They believed that people could learn about sexual intimacy only by experiencing it.  In their research, subjects that were partnered used these partners to aid in a series of exercises designed to help overcome sexual dysfunction.  Unpartnered subjects were paired with "surrogates" who would take the place of a partner, working under the direction of a trained therapist and acted as a form of mentor for the client. In their research, all of the surrogates were women who were assigned to work with single men. Today, most surrogates are women, but a few are men.&lt;ref name=freckelton&gt;{{citation|last=Freckelton|first=Ian|year=2013|title=Sexual Surrogate Partner Therapy: Legal and Ethical Issues|journal=Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Law|volume=20|issue=5|page=643|doi=10.1080/13218719.2013.831725}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice of Surrogate Partner Therapy reached its peak in the early 1980s with a few hundred surrogate partners practicing in the U.S. Since then, Surrogate Partner Therapy's popularity declined but has recently reentered social consciousness after the 2012 film ''[[The Sessions (film)|The Sessions]]'', which depicts one surrogate partner's work with a disabled man. Currently, those practicing Surrogate Partner Therapy are still very few in number. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists |date= February 2014|title= Sexual Surrogacy Revised |journal= Contemporary Sexuality|volume= 41|issue= 1}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical problems==
Patients frequently present with these specific problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Zilbergeld|first= Bernie|date= 1999|title= The New Male Sexuality|location= New York|publisher= Bantam Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Keesling|first= Barbara|date= 2006|title= Sexual Healing|location= Alameda|publisher= Hunter House Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

There are people who have experienced a change in sexual lifestyle due to an acquired [[disability]] (accident, paralysis, disease, trauma), and a surrogate can help them explore and develop sexual potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen Greene|first= Cheryl|date= 2012|title= An Intimate Life|location= Berkeley|publisher= Soft Skull Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of sexual concerns are numerous and the methods a surrogate might use to help improve a client's sexual life are varied.

==Therapy==

Since sexual problems are often psychological rather than physical, communication plays a key role in the therapeutic process between a patient and the surrogate partner, as well as between the surrogate partner and the therapist.
Surrogate partners offer therapeutic exercises to help the patient. These may include, but are not limited to [[relaxation techniques]], [[sensate focusing]], communication, establishing healthy [[body image]], teaching [[social skills]], [[sex education]], as well as sensual and some sexual touching.  Surrogate partner therapy begins with a meeting between client, therapist, and surrogate partner in which the goals of the client are discussed and the scope/duration of the therapy are established.  Throughout the process, communication between surrogate partner-client, client-therapist, and surrogate partner-therapist is maintained.  &lt;ref name=ipsa&gt;{{cite web|title=Surrogate Partner Therapy|author=International Professional Surrogates Association|url=http://www.surrogatetherapy.org/what-is-surrogate-partner-therapy/|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">The '''sharawadji effect''', not to be confused with [[sharawadgi]], is a [[musical perception]] or phenomenon regarding [[timbre]] and [[Texture (music)|texture]] described by Claude Shryer as, "a sensation of plenitude sometimes created by the contemplation of a complex [[soundscape]] whose beauty is inexplicable."&lt;ref&gt;Waterman, Ellen and Harley, James. "Open Ears Festival of Music and Sound." ''Computer Music Journal'' 23.1 (1999): 79-82. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that sharawadji is not a stimulus, but rather a reaction to a stimulus.&lt;ref name="Musicworks 1998 p. 22"&gt;{{cite book |title=Musicworks |publisher=Music Gallery |issue=nos. 70-72 |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMY4AQAAIAAJ |access-date=13 September 2018 |pages=22 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shryer also elaborated on searching for this, "state of awareness," by the means of, "one tend[ing] an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime beauty of a given sound in an unexpected context."&lt;ref&gt;Ulvaeus, edited by [[David Rothenberg]] &amp; Marta (2009). ''The Book of Music and Nature: An Anthology of Sounds, Words, Thoughts'' (Second edition. ed.). Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press. pp. 125. {{ISBN|9780819569356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the sharawadji sonic effect is often heavily dictated by personal context as well as the perception of the listener. One striking example of this effect is the appreciation of the sound of rumbling [[thunder]]: those who are being directly exposed to the element would be more likely to fear it compared to those who experience the sound while in a safe environment. Simply understood, "sharawadji sounds belong to everyday life, to a known musical style. They become sharawadji only through decontextualization, through a rupture of meaning."&lt;ref name="Augoyard" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Seventeenth-century European travelers originally coined the term as an aesthetic effect that, "comes about as a surprise and will carry you elsewhere, beyond strict representation — out of context." The term ''sharawadji'' was speculated to originate from China and was understood as, "the beauty that occurs with no discernible order or arrangement".&lt;ref name="Augoyard"&gt;Augoyard, Jean François et al., eds. ''Sonic Experience: A Guide to Everyday Sounds''. Montreal ; Ithaca: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2006. Print. [http://xenopraxis.net/readings/augoyard_sonicexperiencecomplete.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

"All of us are searching for that enveloping soundscape that takes us beyond to indescribable realms of beauty, what the Persian philosophers once called the ''sharawadji effect''&lt;!--italics original--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, David (2013). ''Bug Music'', p.193. St. Martin's Press: New York. {{ISBN|978-1-250-00521-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strephosymbolia''' is a term coined in 1925 by [[Samuel Orton]] to distinguish between itself and "[[dyslexia|word-blindness]]". No reasons were given for what these distinctions arise from, or what exactly strephosymbolia means other than "a descriptive name for the whole group of children who show unusual difficulty in learning to read".&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, Jane. "Gillingham: Contemporary After 76 Years", ''Annals of Dyslexia'' '''49''' (1989): 3-49.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was subsequently changed in 1937 to specify that, as a condition, it creates difficulty in seeing the ends of written words in unfamiliar languages, especially those in which the letters look similar to each other such as "b" and "d", "m" and "n" and "p" and "q".
