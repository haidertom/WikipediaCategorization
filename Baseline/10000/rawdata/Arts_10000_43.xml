The '''''Annunciation''''' is a panel-painting [[altarpiece]] or [[retable]] by [[Fra Angelico]] ([[tempera]] on panel, 154x194 cm the central panel, 194x194 including the [[predella]]) situated in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]] and created between the thirties of the 15th century. The work is probably the third of a series of great tables by Angelico representing the [[Annunciation]]; the other two are the ''[[Annunciation of Cortona]]'' and the ''[[Annunciation of San Giovanni Valdarno]]''. Dating is not concordant and some art historians invert the sequence putting the Prado table at first.

== History ==
The work has been painted in the [[Convent of San Domenico, Fiesole]], where Angelico himself lived as a friar, and it was one of his biggest altarpiece in the church, with the [[Fiesole Altarpiece|main altarpiece]] on the high altar (the oldest one, 1424–25, and the only one still in the convent) and the ''[[Coronation of the Virgin (Fra Angelico, Louvre)|Coronation of the Virgin]]'' in [[Louvre]] (1424-1435 circa).

The altarpiece was completed in 1435, when the works on the convent ended. After being sold, it became part of the royal collections of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]] before moving to Prado.

== Description ==
[[File:Angelico,_dettaglio_vergine.JPG|thumb|The Vergin (detail)]]
The scenes have a structure similar to the other two Annunciations but with some differences. As in the Annunciation of Cortona, the pictured surface is divided in three parts (the garden, the Angel's arch and the Virgin's arch), but the [[vanishing point]] is inside the home and not outside, like the [[Annunciation of San Giovanni Valdarno|Annunciation of San Giovanni]], focusing the viewer's attention on the Annunciation. Due to this scheme, the scene of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] expelled from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] could result less evident (in the Cortonese one they are near the vanishing point)  if Angelico didn't increased considerably their figures.[[Image:Fra Angelico 096.jpg|thumb|Detail: ''Adam and Eve hunted out of Paradise'' "walking on the roses of the garden of Mary"|left]]As in the other two works, they are moving in a flowered garden representing the virginity of Mary ("[[hortus conclusus]]"), inhabited by a multitude of plants and seedlings painted with great accuracy. Between the species with symbolic values, we can recognise the palm, representing the future martyrdom of Christ, and the red roses referring the blood of the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]]. The presence of Adam and Eve evidences the cycle of the human damnation, recomposed with the deliverance in Christ made possible by the accept of Mary.

From the high-left a ray of divine light illuminates, through the dove of [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]], the Virgin, who bends accepting his duty submissively. She's sitting on a seat covered with a rich drape acting as carpet too, and she has on her knees an open book, symbol of the happening Scriptures.

The Angel has a similar pose and vest to the work of San Giovanni, even if his figure appears more static and the folds of the vest are more schematic, maybe due to the brush strokes of a collaborator.

The scene is set under a renaissance portico with the light arches stretched with wisdom on [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which remember the architecture of [[Michelozzo]]. Light appears unified, unlike the pail of Cortona, and moves from left to right for all the element.

The overall effect is of a precious description of the various details, with cold and bright colours, almost crystallized, in the changing colour harmonies of blue and pink.

== Predella ==
In the [[predella]] there are five scenes from Mary's life ( ''Birth and Marriage'', the ''Visitation'', the ''Adoration of the Magi'',  ''Presentation at the temple'' and the ''dormition'') where the master had worked freely on the composition, less subjected to the iconographic tradition of the main scene.

The ''Sposalizio'' presents the background of a Renaissance church with portico, while the visitation shows a sidelong lodge, represented with ability. This scene does not reach the vivid expression of fatigue on the woman who is going to the chime as in the predella of the ''[[Annunciation of Cortona]]''. The ''Adoration of the Magi'' instead is completely original and shows an innovative frontal iconography years before the revolution of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] (''[[Adoration of the Magi (Botticelli, 1475)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' in the [[Uffizi]], 1475), enhanced by the complex perspective of the hut's ruins. Here can be noticed the distinct use of lights by Beato Angelico, who creates a pure and crystal illumination which models volumes, enhances the chromatic harmony and unifies the scenes.

The following scene of the ''Presentation'' is more innovative, with the ambient placed inside a circular temple which seems projected through lens to the viewer, improving the scheme already used on the ''[[Presentation at the Temple (Gentile da Fabriano)|Presentation at the Temple]]'' by [[Gentile da Fabriano]]. The ''Dormition'' is the most traditional scene though the invention of the avvallamento between the background mountains can be considered innovative, because it creates a perspective channel to the holy way suspended by the Angels on the top.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The '''Antwerp School''' was a school of artists active in [[Antwerp]], first during the 16th century when the city was the economic center of the [[Low Countries]], and then during the 17th century when it became the artistic stronghold of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] under [[Peter Paul Rubens]].

==History==
Antwerp took over from [[Bruges]] as the main trading and commercial center of the [[Low Countries]] around 1500. Painters, artists and craftsmen joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], which educated apprentices and guaranteed quality.

The first school of artists that emerged in the city were the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]], a group of anonymous late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters active in the city from about 1500 to 1520. They were followed by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painters in the Italian tradition that developed at the end of the [[High Renaissance]]. [[Jan Gossaert]] was a major artist in the city at this time. Other artists, such as [[Frans Floris]], continued this style.

The [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] riots ('[[Beeldenstorm]]' in Dutch) of 1566 that preceded the [[Dutch Revolt]] resulted in the destruction of many works of religious art, after which time the churches and monasteries had to be refurnished and redecorated. Artists such as [[Otto van Veen]] and members of the [[Francken]] family, working in a late mannerist style, provided new religious decoration. It also marked a beginning of economic decline in the city, as the [[Scheldt]] river was blockaded by the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1585 diminishing trade.

[[File:Paul de Vos, Ark van Noah.jpg|thumb|left|Paul de Vos, ''Ark van Noah'']]The city experienced an artistic renewal in the 17th century. The large workshops of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]], and the influence of [[Anthony van Dyck]], made Antwerp the center of the Flemish Baroque.  The city was an internationally significant publishing centre, and had a huge production of [[old master print]]s and book illustrations.  Antwerp ''[[animalier]]s'' or animal painters, such as [[Frans Snyders]], [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Paul de Vos]] dominated this speciality in Europe for at least the first half of the century.  Many artists joined the [[Guild of Romanists]], a society for which having visited Rome was a condition of membership. But as the economy continued to decline, and the [[Habsburg]] Governors and the Church reduced their patronage, many artists trained in Antwerp left for the Netherlands, England, France or elsewhere, and by the end of the 17th century Antwerp was no longer a major centre for art.

The artistic legacy of Antwerp is represented in many museums, and paintings of the Antwerp School are valued at [[auction]]s.

'''Barbara Mary Steyning Everard''' (27 July 1910 &amp;ndash; 17 June 1990) was a [[botanical illustrator]] whose work encompassed books, private commissions, botanical publications, gardening magazines, greetings cards and commemorative plates.

==Early life==

Barbara Beard was born the eldest daughter of three to Charles and Rosalie Beard at Telscombe Manor, Near Brighton, Sussex on 27 July 1910.

In 1936 Barbara obtained work at a fake antique business in Deans Yard in Soho, London, owned by Ernest and Walter Thornton-Smith. Here, while others copied [[Canaletto]]s and minute Chinese mirror paintings, she learned the art of making fake Chinese [[wallpaper]]s. Paid 30 shillings a week as a beginner, she soon rose to a senior position, being commissioned to work at [[Fortnum and Mason]]s to do murals, decorate teatables and a curtain for the new [[Dominion Theatre]] in Tottenham Court Road, and touch up furniture, fabrics and gilding in the homes of the wealthy. The training she received, together with night classes at [[Ealing School of Art]], contributed to her botanical watercolour work in later life.

During the [[Great Depression]] work dried up. In 1938 while working as a [[lady's companion]] to Lady Davis at [[Chilham Castle]], Kent, Barbara married in secret to Raymond Wallace Everard. Shortly after their wedding her husband was appointed to an assistant-manager's job in Singapore, then part of [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. However, he had not told his employers he was married so Barbara was forced to stay in England, only joining him when the pressure of separation grew too much.

==Malaya and the Second World War==
With the outbreak of [[World War II|war in Europe]], the couple felt that it was time to have a child. A son, Martin, was born on 7 July 1940. In February 1942, Singapore [[Battle of Singapore|fell to the Japanese]] and Raymond, having joined the [[Straits Settlements Volunteer Force|Malacca Volunteer Force]], was taken prisoner. Barbara and Martin escaped on the last boat, the [[SS Duchess of Bedford]] to successfully evade the Japanese and returned safely to England.

Raymond survived three and a half years of being a [[prisoner of war]], being forced to work on the [[Burma Railway]] and the infamous [[Bridge on the River Kwai]]. After a short repatriation to England to recuperate he returned to Malaya to help open up [[Plantation#Rubber|rubber plantation]]s for [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. Barbara and Martin sailed on the [[RMS Mauretania (1938)|RMS Mauretania]] to join him in 1946. While living on the rubber estates around Malacca, Barbara began collecting and painting [[tropical plant]]s and [[orchid]]s. Estate bungalows were large, ill-decorated and with bare walls, so inspired by a friend she started painting large watercolour [[still life]]s to fill the empty spaces. She began to exhibit at flower shows in Singapore, Malacca and [[Kuala Lumpur]], expanding her collection of living plants and her portfolio.

==Career as a botanical illustrator==
Barbara returned to England with her husband in 1952, Martin having been sent to boarding school three years earlier. On her return she exhibited a collection of studies of Malayan orchids at the Royal Horticulture Hall in Vincent Square, London, and was awarded the first [[Chelsea Flower Show#Awards|Grenfell Gold Medal]]. At later [[Royal Horticultural Society]] exhibitions she would be awarded many more.

For the next thirty years Barbara Everard embarked on a career as a commercial botanical artist, completing many private commissions of floral paintings together with illustrations on a number of [[coffee table book]]s, botanical publications, gardening magazines, greetings cards and commemorative plates. One of these commissions was for Mr John Gurney at the Medici Society to paint the studies of [[wild flower]]s of Britain, a task that took ten years and resulted in around 950 plates being completed. This work, designed to be a companion to the Bentham &amp; Hooker's Field Guide, has never been published. She also added to the family with the birth of a second son, Anthony, in 1963.

In 1975, with a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellowship, Barbara travelled back to Malaysia to create botanical paintings of endangered plant species, including the Rafflesia on Mt Kinabalu, and on completion of the project, was made a Lifetime Member of the Trust.

By the time of her death on 17 June 1990, Barbara had become one of the world's leading botanical artists.

A number of paintings and drawings have been donated to various botanical societies including some 250 plates and sketches given to the Library and Archive at the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens]], Kew. The centenary of her birth was celebrated with an exhibition of some of her work dating from the 1950s to the 1980s at the RHS Botanic Art exhibition in March 2011, together with the publication of her autobiography, ''Call Them the Happy Years''.

A '''cartoon''' is a type of [[illustration]], possibly animated, typically in a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for [[satire]], [[caricature]], or [[humor]]; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a ''[[cartoonist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the second sense they are usually called an ''[[animator]]''.

The concept originated in the [[Middle Ages]], and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, [[fresco]], [[tapestry]], or [[stained glass]] window. In the 19th century, beginning in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers. In the early 20th century, it began to refer to [[Animated cartoon|animated]] films which resembled print cartoons.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine art==
{{Main article|Modello}}
A cartoon (from {{Lang-it|cartone}} and {{Lang-nl|karton}}—words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy [[paper]] as a study or ''[[modello]]'' for a [[painting]], [[stained glass]], or [[tapestry]]. Cartoons were typically used in the production of [[fresco]]es, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp [[plaster]] over a series of days (''giornate'').{{sfn|Constable|1954|page=115}}

Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced" over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing"). Cartoons by [[Painting|painter]]s, such as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] in London, and examples by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the eye by the [[weaving|weavers]] on the [[loom]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;{{sfn|Adelson|1994|page=330}}

==Print media==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] --&gt;
[[File:SubstanceandShadow.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], ''Cartoon no.1: Substance and Shadow'', 1843, satirized preparatory cartoons for frescoes in the Palace of Westminster, creating the modern meaning of "cartoon"|alt=A detailed black-and-white illustration is vignetted in the center showing people of various sizes looking at pictures framed on the left and back walls.]]

In print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843, when ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Punch.co.uk|title=History of the Cartoon|url=http://punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|access-date=2007-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111013522/http://www.punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|archive-date=2007-11-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly sketches by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=30}} The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new [[Palace of Westminster]]. The original title for these drawings was ''Mr Punch's face is the letter Q'' and the new title "cartoon" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.

Cartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.

Modern single-panel [[gag cartoon|''gag cartoons'']], found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, or—less often—a [[speech balloon]].{{sfn|Bishop|2009|p=92}} Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by [[Mel Calman]], [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], [[Gary Larson]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]] and others. Many consider ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Peter Arno]] the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maslin |first1=Michael |title=The Peter Arno Cartoons That Help Rescue The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-peter-arno-cartoons-that-helped-rescue-the-new-yorker |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2018-09-16 |date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes [[Charles Addams]], [[Charles Barsotti]], and [[Chon Day]].

[[Bill Hoest]], [[Jerry Marcus]], and [[Virgil Partch]] began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated [[comic strips]]. [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]] is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' before creating his ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester "Chet" Brown's ''[[All in Sport]]''.

''[[Editorial cartoons]]'' are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using [[irony]] or [[satire]]. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s of note include [[Herblock]], [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], [[Jeff MacNelly]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], and [[Gerald Scarfe]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

''Comic strips'', also known as ''cartoon strips'' in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called "cartoons" themselves, but rather "comics" or "[[Sunday comics|funnies]]". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s—are usually referred to as "[[cartoonist]]s". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are [[Scott Adams]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[E. C. Segar]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Bill Watterson]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

===Political cartoons===
{{main article|Editorial cartoon}}

Political cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}} [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Birth+of+England%27s+pocket+cartoon%3B+LOCAL+HISTORY+Smile+awhile+through...-a0153110971| title=Birth of England's pocket cartoon|author=Chris Upton|publisher=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of [[revolutionary France]] and [[Napoleon]].{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} [[George Cruikshank]] became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.

[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Nast depicts the [[Tweed Ring]]: "Who stole the people's money?" / "'Twas him."|alt=A cartoon showing a circle of men pointing their fingers at the man to their right with grimaces on their faces.]]

By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. [[Thomas Nast]], in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=24}} His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the [[William M. Tweed|Tweed machine]] in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|pp=49–50}} Sir [[John Tenniel]] was the toast of London.{{sfn|Morris|Tenniel|2005|p=344}}

Political cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when [[J. H. Thomas]], the leader of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the [[British Communist Party]]. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain|Miners' Federation]]. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S.  Hyde, "'Please, Sir, he called me “Jimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921," ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521-550&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific cartoons===
Cartoons such as ''[[xkcd]]'' have also found their place in the world of [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[technology]]. Cartoons related to [[chemistry]] are, for example, the ''Wonderlab'', which looked at daily life in the lab.  In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is [[Sidney Harris (cartoonist)|Sidney Harris]]. Not all, but many of [[Gary Larson]]'s cartoons have a scientific flavor.

===Comic books&lt;!--'Humor comics' and 'Humour comics' redirect here--&gt;===
{{Main|Comic book}}
 
Books with cartoons are usually magazine-format "comic books," or occasionally [[Comics collection|reprints of newspaper cartoons]].

In Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by [[DC Thomson]]; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Sackville Turner]], ''Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.'' (3rd ed. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;  D.C. Thomson issued the first [[The Dandy|''The Dandy Comic'']] in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful.  Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product ''[[The Beano]]''  in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Keith Booker|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=2014|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with ''[[Think Small]]'', a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by [[Volkswagen]] dealers. [[Bill Hoest]] and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as [[H. Allen Smith]], [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] and [[Jean Shepherd]]. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.

==Animation==
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|200px|An [[animated cartoon]] horse, drawn by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos|alt=a running horse (animated)]]
{{Main article|Animated cartoon}}
Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, ''cartoon'' came to refer to [[animation]], and the word ''cartoon'' is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons.{{sfn|Walasek|2009|p=116}}  While ''animation'' designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word "cartoon" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals,{{sfn|Wells|2008|p=41}} [[superhero]]es, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.

In the 1980s, ''cartoon'' was shortened to ''toon'', referring to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', followed in 1990 by the animated TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.

'''Charbagh''' or '''Chahar Bagh''' ([[Urdu|Urdu:]] چارباغ, ''chār bāgh,'' [[Persian Language|Persian]]: چهارباغ, ''chahār bāgh'', meaning "four gardens") is a [[Persian gardens|Persian]] and [[Islamic garden|Islamic]] quadrilateral garden layout based on the four gardens of Paradise mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]. The quadrilateral garden is divided by walkways or flowing water into four smaller parts.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Vincent J. (2007) ''Voices of Islam: Voices of art, beauty, and science''  (volume 4 in the ''Voices of Islam'' series) Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RNTAHx95RqQC&amp;pg=PA94 pages 94-95], {{ISBN|978-0-275-98735-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The quadrilateral Charbagh concept is based on the four gardens of Paradise mentioned in Chapter (Surah) 55, [[Ar-Rahman]] "The Beneficient", in the Qur'an:

"And for him, who fears to stand before his Lord, are two gardens." (Chapter 55: Verse 46)&lt;br&gt;
"And beside them are two other gardens." (Chapter 55: Verse 62)

One of the hallmarks of Charbagh garden is the four-part garden laid out with axial paths that intersect at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful method for the organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles]], ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Charbagh gardens==
[[File:View from atop the left minaret 008.jpg|thumb|Layout of the Charbagh at the [[Tomb of Jahangir]] in [[Lahore]]]]
The [[Charbagh, Isfahan|Chahrbagh-e Abbasi]] (or Charbagh Avenue) in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]], built by [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]] in 1596, and the garden of the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[India]] are the most famous examples of this style. In the Charbagh at the Taj Mahal, each of the four parts contains sixteen flower beds.

In India, the Char Bagh concept in imperial mausoleums is seen in [[Humayun's Tomb]] in [[Delhi]] in a monumental scale. Humayan's father was the Central Asian Conqueror Babur who succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in the Indian Subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor. The tradition of [[paradise garden]] originated among the [[Mughals]], originally from Central Asia, which is found at [[Babur]]'s tomb, [[Bagh-e Babur]], in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name=gar&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wnKiKy9_2u4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Humayun%27s+Tomb&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Mughul Tomb Gardens]''The poetics of gardens'', by Charles Willard Moore, William J. Mitchell. Published by MIT Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-262-63153-9}}. ''Page 17''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This tradition gave birth to the [[Mughal gardens]] design and displayed its high form in the [[Taj Mahal]] — built by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], the great, great, grandson of the Central Asian Conqueror Babur, as a tomb for his favourite Indian wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]], in [[Agra]], India. Here, unlike most such tombs, the [[mausoleum]] is not in the centre of the garden, but on its northern end. The garden features Italian [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] trees (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]'') that symbolize death. Fruit trees in the garden symbolize life. The garden attracts many birds, which are considered one of the features of the garden.

In [[Pakistan]], the Mughal [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar Gardens]] and the garden in the [[Tomb of Jehangir]] in [[Lahore]] are based on the Charbagh concept.

==Contemporary==
A charbagh is located on the roof top of the [[Ismaili Centre, London|Ismaili Centre]] in [[South Kensington]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/place_in_paradise/islamic.shtml A Place in Paradise] - radio coverage from the [[BBC]] about the charbagh garden on top of the Ismaili Centre in South Kensington&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat]], located on [[Sussex Drive]] in the Canadian capital [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] contains a charbagh in a modern setting.{{cn|date=September 2016}} The Ismaili Center and Aga Khan Museum in Toronto features a modern interpretation of a charbagh between the buildings.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

The '''''Death of the Virgin''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea Mantegna]], from c. 1462–1464. 

In this picture Mantegna depicts the last moment of Mary's life within a space defined by classical architectures, with a squared pavement which leads the observer's eyes towards the bed on which the Virgin lies. In the background is a lake scene which is a detailed reproduction of the bridge and the burgh of the [[Castello di San Giorgio|Castle of St. George]] in [[Mantua]]. The work was originally part of the decoration of the Castle chapel, together with three panels now in the [[Uffizi]] of [[Florence]] (''[[Adoration of the Magi (Mantegna)|Adoration of the Magi]]'','' [[The Ascension (Mantegna)|The Ascension]]'' and ''[[The Circumcision (Mantegna)|The Circumcision]]'') and one now in [[Ferrara]] (''[[Christ Bearing the Soul of the Virgin]]'').

The unfinished appearance of the pilasters in the upper part of the picture suggests that it was once larger than it appears today. The fragment of ''Christ with the Virgin's Soul'', now in [[Ferrara]], was most likely part of the original composition.{{CN|date=February 2015}}

'''Design–build''' (or '''design/build''', and abbreviated '''D–B''' or '''D/B''' accordingly) is a [[Project delivery method|project delivery system]] used in the construction industry. It is a method to deliver a project in which the design and construction services are contracted by a single entity known as the '''design–builder''' or '''design–build contractor'''. It can be subdivided into '''architect-led design–build''' ('''ALDB''', sometimes known as '''designer-led design–build''') and '''contractor-led design–build'''.

In contrast to "[[design–bid–build]]" (or "design–tender"), design–build relies on a single point of responsibility contract and is used to minimize risks for the project owner and to reduce the delivery schedule by overlapping the design phase and construction phase of a project. "DB with its single point responsibility carries the clearest contractual remedies for the clients because the DB contractor will be responsible for all of the work on the project, regardless of the nature of the fault".&lt;ref&gt;“Construction Contracts: Law and management” by John Murdoch and Will Hughes, published in 2007 by “Taylor &amp; Francis E-library”, fourth edition, United Kingdom {{ISBN|0-203-96574-4}} simultaneously published in USA {{ISBN|978-0-415-39368-3}} and Canada {{ISBN|978-0-415-39369-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional approach for construction projects consists of the appointment of a designer on one side, and the appointment of a contractor on the other side. The design–build procurement route changes the traditional sequence of work. It answers the client's wishes for a single point of responsibility in an attempt to reduce risks and overall costs. It is now commonly used in many countries and forms of contracts are widely available.

Design–build is sometimes compared to the "master builder" approach, one of the oldest forms of construction procedure. Comparing design–build to the traditional method of procurement, the authors of ''Design-build Contracting Handbook'' noted that: “from a historical perspective the so-called traditional approach is actually a very recent concept, only being in use approximately 150 years. In contrast, the design–build concept—also known as the "master builder" concept—has been reported as being in use for over four millennia."&lt;ref&gt;"Design-Build Contracting Handbook", by Robert Frank Cushman &amp; Michael C. Loulakis, published in 2001 by Aspen Law &amp; Business, USA {{ISBN|0-7355-2182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) takes the position that design–build can be led by a contractor, a designer, a developer or a joint venture, as long as a design–build entity holds a single contract for both design and construction, some architects have suggested that [[architect-led design–build]] is a specific approach to design–build. 

Design-build plays important role in [[pedagogy]], both at universities and in independently organised events such as [[Rural Studio]] or [[ArchiCamp]].

==Design–build contractor==
The "design–builder" is often a [[general contractor]], but in many cases a project is led by a design professional ([[architect]], [[engineer]], [[architectural technologist]] or other professional designers). Some design–build firms employ professionals from both the design and construction sector. Where the design–builder is a general contractor, the [[designers]] are typically retained directly by the contractor. [[Partnership]] or a joint venture between a design firm and a construction firm may be created on a long term basis or for one project only.

Until 1979, the AIA [[American Institute of Architects]]' code of ethics and professional conduct prohibited their members from providing construction services. However today many architects in the United States and elsewhere aspire to provide integrated design and construction services, and one approach towards this goal is design–build. The AIA has acknowledged that design–build is becoming one of the main approaches to construction. In 2003, the AIA endorsed "''The architect's guide to design–build services''",&lt;ref&gt;"The architect's guide to design–build services" By G. William Quatman &amp; Ranjit Dhar, published in 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., USA {{ISBN|0-471-21842-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written to help their members acting as design–build contractors. This publication gives guidance through the different phases of the process: design services, contracts, management, insurances, and finances.

==Contractor-led design–build projects: the architect's role==
On contractor-led design–build projects, management is structured so that the owner works directly with a contractor who, in turn, coordinates subcontractors. Architects contribute to contractor-led design–build projects in one of several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

[[File:CLDB 3models.jpg|thumb|500px|center|alt=Three models of contractor-led design–build | Three models of contractor-led design–build]]

#Architect as employee of contractor: The architect works for the contractor as an in-house employee. The architect still bears professional risk and is likely to have less control than in other contractor-led design–build approaches.
#Architect as a subcontractor: Here, the architect is one of the many subcontractors on the team led by the contractor. The architect bears similar professional risk but still with little control.
#Architect as second party in contractor-led integrated project delivery (IPD): The architect and contractor work together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. The building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. The contractor leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the architect might defer to the contractor. The architect bears the same risk as they do in the traditional approach but has more control in IPD, even if they were to defer to the contractor.

==Architect-led design–build projects==
Architect-led design–build projects are those in which interdisciplinary teams of architects and building trades professionals collaborate in an agile management process, where design strategy and construction expertise are seamlessly integrated, and the architect, as owner-advocate, project-steward and team-leader, ensures high fidelity between project aims and outcomes.  In architect-led design–build projects, the architect works directly with the owner (the client), acts as the designer and builder, coordinating a team of consultants, subcontractors and materials suppliers throughout the project lifecycle.

Architects lead design–build projects in several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

[[File:ALDB 3models.jpg|thumb|500px|center|alt=Three models of architect-led design–build | Three models of architect-led design–build]]

#Architect as provider of extended services: Contracted to the owner, the architect extends his or her services beyond the design phase, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors on behalf of the owner. The architect bears similar risk but has more control over the project than in the traditional approach or on contractor-led design–build projects.
#Architect as primary party in architect-led integrated project delivery (IPD): Again, as in working together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. Again, the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. This time, the architect leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the contractor might defer to the architect. The architect might bear more risk than they do in the traditional approach but risk is shared with the owner and the contractor, as outlined in their agreement. An alternative approach to effectuating this delivery structure is for the architect to contract directly with the owner to design and build the project, and then to subcontract the procurement and construction responsibilities to its allied general contractor, who enters into further subcontracts with the trades.  This is a difference in form, rather than in substance, because the business and legal terms of the agreement between the architect and the general contractor may be the same regardless of whether they are characterized as a joint venture or as a subcontract.  It is the "flip side of the coin" of the contractor-led approach described above in which the general contractor subcontracts the design to the architect.
#Architect as full service leader of design build process: Contracted to the owner, the architect offers full service to the owner, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors, consultants and vendors, and involving them throughout the project, start to finish, from design through construction. The architect's role shifts during the project, from designer to site supervisor (effectively taking the role of a general contractor), but monitors the project vision, and is able to call upon subcontractors' construction expertise throughout. The architect bears the greatest risk but also has more control over the project than in either the traditional approach, or in the contractor-led and other architect-led design–build projects.

==Contracts==
A single set of integrated contracts combining design and construction responsibilities, rather than two discrete contracts for each, acknowledges the interdependence of the architects' and construction trades' project responsibilities, and reduces the likelihood of disputes.&lt;ref name="Dorwin"&gt;[http://www.fldbia.org/Documents/AIA%20DB%20%20Dorwin%20Thomas%20presentation.pdf ''Advanced Design-Build Strategies for Architects'' by Dorwin A.J. Thomas, DBIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321180400/http://www.fldbia.org/Documents/AIA%20DB%20%20Dorwin%20Thomas%20presentation.pdf |date=March 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design–build institutes==
In 1993, the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/|title=Home|work=dbia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed. Its membership is composed of design and construction industry professionals as well as project owners. DBIA promotes the value of design–build project delivery and teaches the effective integration of design and construction services to ensure success for owners and design and construction practitioners. The Design-Build Institute of America is an organization that defines, teaches and promotes best practices in design–build.

The Canadian Design-Build Institute (CDBI) describes itself as "The recognized voice of Design-Build practitioners in Canada, promoting and enhancing the proper utilization of Design-Build method of procurement and contracting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbi.org/|title=Canadian Design-Build Institute — Promoting and enhancing the design-build industry – where creativity and construction meet|work=cdbi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy===
Not all design–build projects are alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/resources/conteduc/archives/0511edit-1.asp  ''Hopes and Fears of Design–build'', Nancy Solomon, Architectural Record, November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, there is a distinction between design–build projects led by contractors and those led by architects. Architect-led Design Build is a form of 'design–build' that, according to the DBIA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbia.org Design Build Institute of America, or ''DBIA'']&lt;/ref&gt; has been rapidly gaining market share in the United States over the past 15 years. The Design Build Institute of America describes the design–build process as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Taking singular responsibility, the design–build team is accountable for cost, schedule and performance, under a single contract and with reduced administrative paperwork, clients can focus on the project rather than managing disparate contracts. And, by closing warranty gaps, building owners also virtually eliminate litigation claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The DBIA's 2005 chart shows the uptake of design–build methods in non-residential design and construction in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ ''What is Design Build?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511113024/http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |date=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect-led design–build is sometimes known by the more generic name "designer-led design–build". Although employed primarily by architects, [[architectural technologists]] and other architectural professions, the design–build structure works similarly for interior design projects led by an [[interior designer]] who is not an architect, and also for engineering projects where the design–build team is led by a professional structural, civil, mechanical or other [[engineers]]. In addition, it is common for the design professional who leads the design–build team to create a separate corporation or similar business entity through which the professional performs the construction and other related non-professional services.

Design–build continues to gain ground as a significant trend in design and construction today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdbmagazine.com/print/Residential-Design-and-Build/Architects-Should-Be-Leading-DesignBuild-Projects/1$4416 ''Architects Should Be Leading Design-build Projects'', by Luis Jauregui Residential Design Build magazine, October 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208140939/http://www.rdbmagazine.com/print/Residential-Design-and-Build/Architects-Should-Be-Leading-DesignBuild-Projects/1%244416 |date=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, industry consultants ZweigWhite published "Design-Bid-Build meets the opposition".&lt;ref&gt;The Zweig Letter, ISSN 1068-1310, issue 902&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they suggest that while Design-Bid-Build "still rules", the traditional approach is losing favor as "alternative project delivery methods threaten [the] design-bid-build model." While not referencing the architect-led design–build approach specifically, the article states that D/B already accounts for 27% of projects, according to their 2010 Project Management Survey and goes on to argue that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emerging trends in delivery seem to point to a return to the primordial concept of the masterbuilder, as exemplified by D/B and IPD [Integrated Project Delivery].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the DBIA, the design–build approach offers advantages to owners, including:
"One team, one contract, one unified flow of work from initial concept through completion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511113024/http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}{{cite web|url=http://www.westoverconstruction.com/Design_Build.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822011537/http://www.westoverconstruction.com/Design_Build.html |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate on the merits of design–build vs. design–bid–build==
[[File:dbbtimeline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Traditional Design Bid Build|Design-Bid-Build project timeline]]
[[File:aldbtimeline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Architect-led Design Build Timeline| ALDB project timeline]]

The rise of design–build project delivery has threatened the traditional hierarchies and silos of the design and construction industry. As a result, a debate has emerged over the value of design–build as a method of project delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructiondigital.com/architectural_design/designbuild-vs-architecture-firms|title=Design/Build VS. Architecture Firms|work=Architectural Design|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611204820/http://www.constructiondigital.com/architectural_design/designbuild-vs-architecture-firms|archivedate=2011-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the design–build approach claim that design–build limits the clients’ involvement in the design and allege that contractors often make design decisions outside their area of expertise. They also suggest that a designer—rather than a construction professional—is a better advocate for the client or project owner and/or that by representing different perspectives and remaining in their separate spheres, designers and builders ultimately create better buildings.

Proponents of design–build counter that design–build saves time and money for the owner, while providing the opportunity to achieve innovation in the delivered facility. They note that value is added because design-build brings [[value engineering]] into the design process at the onset of a project. Design–build allows the contractor, engineers and specialty trade contractors (subcontractors) to propose best-value solutions for various construction elements before the design is complete. Design–build brings all members of a project team together early in the process to identify and address issues of cost, schedule and constructability. Proponents suggest that as a result, design-build alleviates conflict between architects and contractors and reduces owner risk for design errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korteco.com/design-build|title=Design-Build: The Complete Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that once design is finalized and construction begins, the greatest opportunity to achieve cost savings has already been lost, and the potential for design errors is greater, leading to change orders that create cost growth and schedule delays. Proponents note that design–build allows owners to avoid being placed directly between the architect/engineer and the contractor. Under design–bid–build, the owner takes on significant risks because of that position. Design–build places the responsibility for design errors and omissions on the design–builder, relieving the owner of major legal and managerial responsibilities. The burden for these costs and associated risks are transferred to the design–build team.

The cost and schedule reduction and decreased litigation associated with design–build project delivery have been demonstrated repeatedly. Researches on ''Selecting Project Delivery Systems''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Victor Sanvido|author2=Mark Konchar|last-author-amp=yes|title=Project Delivery Systems: CM at Risk, Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build|journal=Construction Industry Institute Research Report|date=April 1998|pages=133–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Victor Sanvido and Mark Konchar of Pennsylvania State University found that design–build projects are delivered 33.5% faster than projects that are designed and built under separate contracts (design-bid-build). Sanvido and Konchar also showed that design–build projects are constructed 12% faster* and have a unit cost that is 6.1% lower than design-bid-build projects. Similar cost and time savings were found in a comparison study of design–build, and design-bid-build for the water/wastewater construction industry, a peer-reviewed paper authored by Smith Culp Consulting that will be published in July 2011 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/6/prweb8563707.htm|title=New Report Describes Time and Cost Savings From Design Build Project Delivery|date=13 June 2011|work=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; A benchmarking and claims study by Victor O. Schinnerer, one of the world's largest firms underwriting professional liability and specialty insurance programs, found that, from 1995–2004, only 1.3% of claims against A/E firms were made by design–build contractors. Advantages have been summarized as:

* Efficiency: Typically led by contractors, 'design–build' has evolved as an efficient way to deliver projects primarily where the building project goals are straightforward, either constrained by budget, or the outcome is prescribed by functional requirements (for example, a highway, sports facility, or brewery). Construction industry commentators have described design–build as a high performance 'construction project delivery system', a dynamic approach to making buildings that presents an alternative to the traditional design-bid-build approach.
* Single-source: Design–build is growing because of the advantages of single-source management: Unlike traditional design-bid-build, it allows for the owner to contract with just one party who acts as a single point of contact, is responsible for delivering the project and coordinates the rest of the team.  Depending on the phasing of the project, there may be multiple sequential contracts between the owner and the design–builder.  the owner benefits because if something turns out to be wrong with the project, there is a single entity that is responsible for fixing the problem, rather than a separate designer and constructor each blaming the other.

===Advantages for less-presciptive projects===
Architect-led design–build is suited primarily to less prescriptive architectural projects (private residences, non-profit institutions, museums), for the efficiencies it yields and the sophisticated design interpretation it affords, particularly:
* Where the primary project goals are design-driven or visionary rather than prescribed by budgetary constraint or functional requirements
* Where the project is specifically "Capital A"-artistically/creatively driven, in a way that traditionally yields the highest level of cost overruns.
* Where the efficiencies of design–build approach and an architect's interpretive skill are equally important

These less prescriptive projects need not be stuck with the "broken buildings and busted budgets"&lt;ref&gt;LePatner, Barry.  "Broken Buildings, Busted Budgets: How to Fix America's Trillion-Dollar Construction Industry". The University of Chicago Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; described by Barry Lepatner. Rather, the less prescriptive the project, the more the client needs an architect to steward an emergent design from vision to completion. So it follows that for the broadest range of building projects, the rigors of architect-led design–build is compelling and preferable where design is of paramount importance to the client.

===Recursive knowledge===
The process and the knowledge it produces is recursive: Since subcontractors are engaged early and often in an architect-led design build project, to assess efficiencies, opportunity costs, payback rates and quality options. Their input informs overall design decisions from the outset. Cost-benefit is also a constant consideration that informs design decisions from the outset. Building performance is measured early too, so that trade offs between budget, schedule, functionality and usability can inform specification and continuous refinement of the design.

Architects engaged in this dynamic process understand and keep up to date with the potential of contemporary technology&lt;ref&gt;''An Enthusiastic Sceptic'' by Nat Oppenheimer, Architectural Design (2009) Volume: 79, Issue: 2, Pages: 100–105, an assessment of Building Information Management (BIM) software&lt;/ref&gt; and materials available to building professionals, and translate what they learn into their design work. This knowledge is fed back, not just to the specific project but can be shared to other project teams, throughout a studio, or more broadly to the profession, and can become an active source of insight in and of itself.

==Growth of design–build method==
A 2011 study analyzing the design–build project delivery method in the United States shows design–build was used on about 40 percent of non-residential construction projects in 2010, a ten percent increase since 2005. The study was commissioned by the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) and was completed by RSMeans Reed Construction Data Market Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/resource-center/Pages/Report-by-RCD-RSMeans-Market-Intelligence.aspx|title=Report by Reed Construction Data/RSMeans Market Intelligence|work=dbia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from the US Department of Transportation claims that: "Design-build delivery has been steadily increasing in the U.S. public building sector for more than 10 years, but it is still termed experimental in transportation. To date, under Special Experimental Project 14 (SEP-14) the FHWA has approved the use of design–build in more than 150 projects, representing just over half of the States. The European countries visited have used design–build delivery for a longer time than the United States and provided the scan team with many valuable insights. The primary lessons learned on this scan tour relate to the types of projects utilizing design–build, the use of best-value selection, percentage of design in the solicitation, design and construction administration, third-party risks, the use of warranties, and the addition of maintenance and operation to design–build contracts."&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, International Programs, [http://international.fhwa.dot.gov/contractadmin/04.cfm Chapter 4 – Contract Administration: Technology and Practice in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of design–build==
During the design–build procedure, the contractor is deciding on design issues as well as issues related to cost, profits and time exigencies. Whilst the traditional method of construction procurement dissociates the designers from the contractors’ interests, design–build does not. On these grounds it is considered that the design–build procedure is poorly adapted to projects that require complex designs for technical, programmatic or aesthetic purposes.
If the designer/architect is 'kept' by the construction company, they probably will never push the envelope as to what might be possible.
A notable design–build project that received significant criticism, not only for excessive cost but for environmental issues, was the [[Belmont Learning Center]].  The scandal involved alleged contaminated soil that caused significant delays and massive cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SCANDAL+FIGURES+SAY+THEY+FOLLOWED+LAUSD+ORDERS-a083613230] Belmont scandal&lt;/ref&gt;  In Los Angeles, District Attorney Steve Cooley, who investigated the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]]’s Belmont project, produced a final investigative report, released March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://da.lacounty.gov/pdf/BLC_Final_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094735/http://da.lacounty.gov/pdf/BLC_Final_Report.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }} Los Angeles DA, Steve Cooley final Investigate report on Belmont&lt;/ref&gt;  This report concluded that the design–build process caused a number of issues relating to the Belmont scandal:

* Design–build does not make use of competitive bidding where prospective builders bid on the same design.
* Criteria to select contractor are subjective and difficult to evaluate and to justify later.
* The design and price selected arouses public suspicion, true or not.
* This can lead to loss of public confidence.
* The design brief is subject to different interpretations from both the client and contractor, creating a conflict of interest.

It concluded the “design–build” approach and “mixed-use concept” together caused controversy, uncertainty, and complexity of the Belmont project which helped increase the potential for project failure. While the Belmont investigation cleared the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] of any criminal wrongdoing, the task force recommends strict oversight, including written protocols, a vigorous Office of the Inspector General, and other recommendations if it decides to continue to use the design–build approach. During the period in question, the ex-Superintendent of LAUSD, [[Ramon C. Cortines]], working with the LAUSD Board of Education, whose president is Monica Garcia, actively tried to cut the Office of Inspector General by 75% (compromising on 25%) and subsequently removed the Inspector General Jerry Thornton after he produced critical audits that showed misuse of construction funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_12615104?IADID=Search-www.dailynews.com-www.dailynews.com] Daily News – LAUSD watchdog office to be cut by 25%&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that architect-led design–build still does:&lt;ref name="Dorwin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://designbuild.construction.com/features/archive/2005/0506_feature2.asp ''AIA Teaching Architects To Lead Design-Build Teams'' by Tom Nicholson, Design and Construction, May/June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schiffhardin.com/design-build/designer-led.html "Designer-led Design-Build" by Mark Friedlander, Schiff Hardin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028015012/http://www.schiffhardin.com/design-build/designer-led.html |date=October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Typical project management issues (establishing liability, writing contracts, scoping estimates and schedule) or
* Variation across different states' licensing laws or
* Conflict of interest and ethical issues

It also imposes:
* Greater business and financial risks associated with architect taking on general contractor responsibilities
* Changes to the way architects do business, so they
** Establish a construction company as a separate corporation that signs a separate construction contract, so they are able to insure and simplify liability insurance coverage
** Either they have, or are able to acquire, the skills of a design–builder
** Recognize the parties' different incentives
** Modify how they prepare Contract Documents, relying more on performance specifications than they do currently, to facilitate substitutions for the benefit of the constructor.

'''El Viñedo''' is a neighborhood in northern [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]], [[Venezuela]]. It is home to many of the city's best restaurants and nightclubs; this area is known as "''La calle de los cafés''" (Café Street). El Viñedo is home to many of Valencia's best hotels: the new [[Embassy Suites Hotels|Embassy Suites]] hotel is in El Viñedo and is widely regarded as one of Valencia's best; additionally the Ucaima Hotel is located in El Viñedo. Valencia's Avenida Bolivar borders El Viñedo and once the situation with the city's metro{{explain|reason=what situation?|date=October 2015}} is solved the area will become easier to access from other zones of Valencia.

[[Image:Fayum-35.jpg|thumb|upright|The single specimen of Gayet's mummy portraits from Antinoopolis for which information on its archaeological context is available. The heavily gilt portrait was found in winter 1905/06 and sold to [[Berlin]] in 1907. [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Berlin, Egyptian Museum.]]]]
'''Mummy portraits''' or '''Fayum mummy portraits''' (also '''Faiyum mummy portraits''') is the modern term given to a type of naturalistic painted [[portrait]] on wooden boards attached to [[Upper Class|Upper class]] [[mummy|mummies]] from [[Roman Egypt]]. They belong to the tradition of [[panel painting]], one of the most highly regarded forms of art in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical world]]. The Fayum portraits are the only large body of art from that tradition to have survived.

Mummy portraits have been found across [[Egypt]], but are most common in the [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum Basin]], particularly from [[Hawara]] in the Fayum Basin (hence the common name) and the [[Hadrian]]ic [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city [[Antinoopolis]]. "Faiyum Portraits" is generally used as a stylistic, rather than a geographic, description. While painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases date back to pharaonic times, the Faiyum mummy portraits were an innovation dating to the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. &lt;cite&gt;Arts of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt;. p.193. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. {{ISBN|0-87846-661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portraits date to the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman era]], from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century. They are among the largest groups among the very few survivors of the [[panel painting]] tradition of the classical world, which was continued into [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and Western traditions in the post-classical world, including the local tradition of [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] in Egypt.

The portraits covered the faces of bodies that were mummified for burial. Extant examples indicate that they were mounted into the bands of cloth that were used to wrap the bodies. Almost all have now been detached from the mummies.&lt;ref&gt;Examples still attached are in the [[Egyptian Museum]], [[Cairo]] and the British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[Ancient Roman art|artistic traditions]] than [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian ones]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Lorna. Gahlin, Lucia. &lt;cite&gt;Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Reference to the Myths, Religions, Pyramids and Temples of the Land of the Pharaohs&lt;/cite&gt;. p.236 Hermes House. 2002. {{ISBN|1-84477-008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two groups of portraits can be distinguished by technique: one of [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) paintings, the other in [[tempera]]. The former are usually of higher quality.

About 900 mummy portraits are known at present.&lt;ref&gt;Corpus of all known specimens: Klaus Parlasca: ''Ritratti di mummie'', Repertorio d'arte dell'Egitto greco-romano Vol. B, 1-4, Rome 1969-2003; a further specimen discovered since: Petrie Museum UC 79360, B. T. Trope, S. Quirke, P. Lacovara: ''Excavating Egypt'', Atlanta 2005, p. 101, {{ISBN|1-928917-06-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority were found in the [[necropolis|necropoleis]] of Faiyum. Due to the hot dry Egyptian climate, the paintings are frequently very well preserved, often retaining their brilliant colours seemingly unfaded by time.

== History of research ==
[[Image:Engraving of finding mummies in Sakkara by Pietro Della Valle.gif|thumb|upright|Fanciful but inauthentic depiction of the mummies' discovery by Pietro Della Valle]]

===Pre-19th century===
The Italian explorer [[Pietro della Valle]], on a visit to [[Saqqara]]-[[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in 1615, was the first European to discover and describe mummy portraits. He transported some mummies with portraits to Europe, which are now in the [[Albertinum]] ([[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden]]).&lt;ref name="Borg 10"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 10f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century collectors===
Although interest in Ancient Egypt steadily increased after that period, further finds of mummy portraits did not become known before the early 19th century. The provenance of these first new finds is unclear; they may come from [[Saqqara]] as well, or perhaps from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. In 1820, the Baron of Minotuli acquired several mummy portraits for a German collector, but they became part of a whole shipload of Egyptian artifacts lost in the [[North Sea]]. In 1827, Léon de Laborde brought two portraits, supposedly found in Memphis, to Europe, one of which can today be seen at the [[Louvre]], the other in the [[British Museum]]. [[Ippolito Rosellini]], a member of [[Jean-François Champollion]]'s 1828/29 expedition to Egypt, brought a further portrait back to [[Florence]]. It is so similar to de Laborde's specimens that it is thought to be from the same source.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt; During the 1820s, the British [[Consul General]] to Egypt, [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], sent several further portraits to [[Paris]] and [[London]]. Some of them were long considered portraits of the family of the Theban [[Archon]] Pollios Soter, a historical character known from written sources, but this has turned out to be incorrect.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt;

Once again, a long period elapsed before more mummy portraits came to light. In 1887, Daniel Marie Fouquet heard of the discovery of numerous portrait mummies in a cave. He set off to inspect them some days later, but arrived too late, as the finders had used the painted plaques for firewood during the three previous cold desert nights. Fouquet acquired the remaining two of what had originally been fifty portraits. While the exact location of this find is unclear, the likely source is from er-Rubayat.&lt;ref name="Borg 10"/&gt; At that location, not long after Fouquet's visit, the Viennese art trader Theodor Graf found several further images, which he tried to sell as profitably as possible. He engaged the famous [[Leipzig]]-based [[Egyptologist]] [[Georg Ebers]] to publish his finds. He produced presentation folders to advertise his individual finds throughout Europe. Although little was known about their archaeological find contexts, Graf went as far as to ascribe the portraits to known [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] pharaohs by analogy with other works of art, mainly coin portraits. None of these associations were particularly well argued or convincing, but they gained him much attention, not least because he gained the support of well-known scholars like [[Rudolf Virchow]]. As a result, mummy portraits became the centre of much attention.&lt;ref name="Barbara Borg 1998"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 13f., 34ff.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, their very specific aesthetic made them sought-after collection pieces, distributed by the global arts trade.

===Archaeological study: Flinders Petrie===
[[Image:Fayum-07.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of a portrait within its mummy wrappings, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1911.]]
In parallel, more scientific engagement with the portraits was beginning. In 1887, the British archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]] started [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at [[Hawara]]. He discovered a Roman [[necropolis]] which yielded 81 portrait mummies in the first year of excavation. At an exhibition in London, these portraits drew large crowds. In the following year, Petrie continued excavations at the same location but now suffered from the competition of a German and an Egyptian art dealer. Petrie returned in the winter of 1910/11 and excavated a further 70 portrait mummies, some of them quite badly preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie: ''Roman Portraits and Memphis IV'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; With very few exceptions, Petrie's studies still provide the only examples of mummy portraits so far found as the result of systematic excavation and published properly. Although the published studies are not entirely up to modern standards, they remain the most important source for the find contexts of portrait mummies.

===Late 19th and early 20th century collectors===
In 1892, the German archaeologist von Kaufmann discovered the so-called "[[Tomb of Aline]]", which held three mummy portraits; among the most famous today. Other important sources of such finds are at [[Antinopolis]] and [[Akhmim]]. The French archaeologist Albert Gayet worked at Antinoopolis and found much relevant material, but his work, like that of many of his contemporaries, does not satisfy modern standards. His documentation is incomplete, many of his finds remain without context.

===Museums===
Today, mummy portraits are represented in all important archaeological museums of the world. Many have fine examples on display, notably the [[British Museum]], the [[National Museum of Scotland]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Louvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"&gt;Nicola Hoesch: ''Mumienporträts'' in: ''[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]], Bd. 8 (2000), p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were mostly recovered through inappropriate and unprofessional means, virtually all are without archaeological context, a fact which consistently lowers the quality of archaeological and culture-historical information they provide. As a result, their overall significance as well as their specific interpretations remain controversial.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt;

== Materials and techniques ==
A majority of images show a formal portrait of a single figure, facing and looking toward the viewer, from an angle that is usually slightly turned from full face. The figures are presented as busts against a monochrome background which in some instances are decorated. The individuals are both male and female and range in age from childhood to old age.

===Painted surface===
[[File:Portrait of the Boy Eutyches - Metmuseum 18.9.2.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a boy, identified by inscription as Eutyches, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The majority of preserved mummy portraits were painted on boards or panels, made from different imported hardwoods, including [[oak]], [[Lime tree|lime]], [[sycamore]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]], [[ficus|fig]], and [[citrus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wrede, LÄ IV, 218&lt;/ref&gt; The wood was cut into thin rectangular panels and made smooth. The finished panels were set into layers of wrapping that enclosed the body and were surrounded by bands of cloth, giving the effect of a window-like opening through which the face of the deceased could be seen. Portraits were sometimes painted directly onto the canvas or rags of the mummy wrapping ([[cartonnage]] painting).

===Painting techniques===
The wooden surface was sometimes primed for painting with a layer of plaster. In some cases the primed layer reveals a preparatory drawing.
Two painting techniques were employed: [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] (wax) painting and animal glue [[tempera]].  The encaustic images are striking because of the  contrast between vivid and rich colours, and comparatively large brush-strokes, producing an "[[Impressionistic]]" effect. The tempera paintings have a finer gradation of tones and chalkier colours, giving a more restrained appearance.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; In some cases, [[gold leaf]] was used to depict jewellery and wreaths. There also are examples of hybrid techniques or of variations from the main techniques.

The Fayum portraits reveal a wide range of painterly expertise and skill in presenting a lifelike appearance. The naturalism of the portraits is often revealed in knowledge of anatomic structure and in skilled modelling of the form by the use of light and shade, which gives an appearance of three-dimensionality to most of the figures. The graded flesh tones are enhanced with shadows and highlights indicative of directional lighting.

==Subjects and social context of the paintings==

===People of Fayum===
Under Greco-Roman rule, Egypt hosted several [[Greeks|Greek]] settlements, mostly concentrated in [[Alexandria]], but also in a few other cities, where Greek settlers lived alongside some seven to ten million native [[Egyptians]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Winthrope L in Bugh, Glenn Richard. ed. "The Hellenistic Kingdoms". ''The Cambridge Companion to the Hellenistic World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2006, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Faiyum's earliest Greek inhabitants were soldier-veterans and ''cleruchs'' (elite military officials) who were settled by the Ptolemaic kings on reclaimed lands.&lt;ref&gt;Stanwick, Paul Edmund. ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings as Egyptian Pharaohs.'' Austin: University of Texas Press. 2003, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Native Egyptians also came to settle in Faiyum from all over the country, notably the [[Nile Delta]], [[Upper and Lower Egypt|Upper Egypt]], [[Oxyrhynchus]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], to undertake the labor involved in the land reclamation process, as attested by personal names, local cults and recovered [[papyrus|papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, R.S. in Susan Walker, ed. ''Ancient Faces : Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications). New York: Routledge, 2000, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the population of Faiyum was Greek during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, with the rest being native Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Bagnall, op cit."&gt;Bagnall, ''op cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; By the Roman period, much of the "Greek" population of Faiyum was made-up of either Hellenized Egyptians or people of mixed Egyptian-Greek origins.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the Roman Period, many veterans of the Roman army, who, initially at least, were not Egyptian but people from disparate cultural backgrounds, settled in the area after the completion of their service, and formed social relations and intermarried with local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alston|first1=R.|title=Soldier and Society in Roman Egypt: A Social History|date=1995|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Who were the ancient Egyptians? Dental affinities among Neolithic through postdynastic peoples.". ''Am J Phys Anthropol'' 129 (4): 529–543&lt;/ref&gt;

The portraits represent native Egyptians, some of whom had adopted Greek or Latin names, then seen as ‘status symbols’.&lt;ref&gt;Broux, Y. Double Names and Elite Strategy in Roman Egypt. Studia Hellenistica 54 (Peeters Publishers, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coussement, S. ‘Because I am Greek’: Polynymy as an Expression of Ethnicity in Ptolemaic Egypt. Studia Hellenistica 55 (Peeters Publishers, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riggs, C. The Beautiful Burial in Roman Egypt: Art, Identity, and Funerary Religion Oxford University Press (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz 184"&gt;Victor J. Katz (1998). ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', p. 184. Addison Wesley, {{ISBN|0-321-01618-1}}: "''But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that [[Ptolemy]] and [[Diophantus]], [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] and [[Hypatia]] were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''"&lt;/ref&gt; DNA studies show genetic continuity between the Pre-Ptolemaic, Ptolemaic and Roman populations, indicating that foreign rule impacted the town’s population only to a very limited degree at the genetic level.&lt;ref name=Verena/&gt;

===Age profile of those depicted===
[[Image:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|upright|Man with sword belt, [[British Museum]].]]
Most of the portraits depict the deceased at a relatively young age, and many show children. According to Walker, [[Computed tomography|C.A.T.]] scans  reveal a correspondence of age and sex between mummy and image. He concludes that the age distribution reflects the low life expectancy at the time. It was often believed that the wax portraits were completed during the life of the individual and displayed in their home, a custom that belonged to the traditions of [[Greek art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Of Ancient Greece'', Nigel Guy, Routledge Taylor and Francis group, p. 601&lt;/ref&gt; but this view is no longer widely held given the evidence suggested by the C.A.T. scans of the Faiyum mummies, as well as Roman census returns. In addition, some portraits were painted directly onto the coffin; for example, on a shroud or another part.

===Social status===
The patrons of the portraits apparently belonged to the affluent upper class of military personnel, civil servants and religious dignitaries. Not everyone could afford a mummy portrait; many mummies were found without one. Flinders Petrie states that only one or two per cent of the mummies he excavated were embellished with portraits.&lt;ref name="Borg 58"&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The rates for mummy portraits do not survive, but it can be assumed that the material caused higher costs than the labour, since in antiquity, painters were appreciated as craftsmen rather than as artists.&lt;ref name="Borg 58"/&gt; The situation from the "[[Tomb of Aline]]" is interesting in this regard. It contained four mummies: those of Aline, of two children and of her husband. Unlike his wife and children, the latter was not equipped with a portrait but with a gilt three-dimensional mask. Perhaps plaster masks were preferred if they could be afforded.

Based on literary, archaeological and genetic studies, it appears that those depicted were native Egyptians, who had adopted the dominant Greco-Roman culture.&lt;ref name=Verena&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of some of those portrayed are known from inscriptions, they are predominantly Greek. Hairstyles and clothing are always influenced by Roman fashion. Women and children are often depicted wearing valuable ornaments and fine garments, men often wearing specific and elaborate outfits. Greek inscriptions of names are relatively common, sometimes they include professions. It is not known whether such inscriptions always reflect reality, or whether they may state ideal conditions or aspirations rather than true conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Hoesch: "Mumienporträts'"in: ''[[Pauly-Wissowa|Der Neue Pauly]]'', Bd. 8 (2000), p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; One single inscription is known to definitely indicate the deceased's profession (a shipowner) correctly. The mummy of a woman named Hermione also included the term ''grammatike'' (γραμματική). For a long time, it was assumed that this indicated that she was a teacher by profession (for this reason, Flinders Petrie donated the portrait to [[Girton College]], [[Cambridge]], the first residential college for women in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), but today, it is assumed that the term indicates her level of education. Some portraits of men show sword-belts or even pommels, suggesting that they were members of the Roman military.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture-historical context ==

===Changes in burial habits===
The burial habits of [[Ptolemaic Dynasty|Ptolemaic]] Egyptians mostly followed ancient traditions. The bodies of members of the upper classes were [[mummy|mummified]], equipped with a decorated coffin and a mummy mask to cover the head. The [[Greeks]] who entered Egypt at that time mostly followed their own habits. There is evidence from [[Alexandria]] and other sites indicating that they practised the Greek tradition of [[cremation]]. This broadly reflects the general situation in [[Hellenistic]] Egypt, its rulers proclaiming themselves to be [[pharaoh]]s but otherwise living in an entirely Hellenistic world, incorporating only very few local elements. Conversely, the Egyptians only slowly developed an interest in the Greek-Hellenic culture that dominated the [[East Mediterranean]] since the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This situation changed substantially with the arrival of the Romans. Within a few generations, all Egyptian elements disappeared from everyday life. Cities like [[Karanis]] or [[Oxyrhynchus]] are largely Graeco-Roman places. There is clear evidence that this resulted from a mixing of different ethnicities in the ruling classes of Roman Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 40–56; Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious continuity===
Only in the sphere of religion is there evidence for a continuation of Egyptian traditions. Egyptian temples were erected as late as the 2nd century. In terms of burial habits, Egyptian and Hellenistic elements now mixed. Coffins became increasingly unpopular and went entirely out of use by the 2nd century. In contrast, mummification appears to have been practised by large parts of the population. The mummy mask, originally an Egyptian concept, grew more and more Graeco-Roman in style, Egyptian motifs became ever rarer. The adoption of Roman portrait painting into Egyptian burial cult belongs into this general context.&lt;ref&gt;summarised in: Judith A. Corbelli: ''The Art of Death in Graeco-Roman Egypt'', Princes Risborough 2006 {{ISBN|0-7478-0647-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Link with Roman funeral masks?===
Some authors suggest that the idea of such portraits may be related to the custom among the [[nobiles|Roman nobility]] of displaying ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|imagines]]'', images of their ancestors, in the [[domus|atrium of their house]]. In funeral processions, these wax masks were worn by professional mourners to emphasize the continuity of an illustrious family line, but originally perhaps to represent a deeper evocation of the presence of the dead. [[Roman festivals]] such as the [[Parentalia]] as well as [[Religion in ancient Rome#Domestic and private cult|everyday domestic rituals]] cultivated ancestral spirits (see also [[veneration of the dead]]). The development of mummy portraiture may represent a combination of Egyptian and [[Roman funerals and burial|Roman funerary tradition]], since it appears only after Egypt was established as a [[Roman province]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Salon paintings"?===
The images depict the heads or busts of men, women and children. They probably date from c. 30 BC to the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Hoesch: ''Mumienporträts'' in: ''Der Neue Pauly'', Vol. 8 (2000), p. 464; others scholars, e.g. Barbara Borg suggest that they start under [[Tiberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; To the modern eye, the portraits appear highly individualistic. Therefore, it has been assumed for a long time that they were produced during the lifetime of their subjects and displayed as "salon paintings" within their houses, to be added to their mummy wrapping after their death. Newer research rather suggests that they were only painted after death,&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; an idea perhaps contradicted by the multiple paintings on some specimens and the (suggested) change of specific details on others. The individualism of those depicted was actually created by variations in some specific details, within a largely unvaried general scheme.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; The habit of depicting the deceased was not a new one, but the painted images gradually replaced the earlier Egyptian masks, although the latter continued in use for some time, often occurring directly adjacent to portrait mummies, sometimes even in the same graves.

===Realism and convention===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Together with the painted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan tombs]], the [[Lucanians|Lucanian]] tombs and the [[Tomb of the Diver]] in [[Paestum]], the frescoes from [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and the [[Greek vase]]s, they are the best preserved paintings from ancient times and are renowned for their remarkable [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]]. It is, however, debatable whether the portraits depict the subjects as they really were. Analyses have shown that the painters depicted faces according to conventions in a repetitive and formulaic way, albeit with a variety of hairstyles and beards. They appear to have worked from a number of standard types without making detailed observations of the unique facial proportions of specific individuals which give each face its own personality.

===Style===

In the virtual absence of other panel paintings from the period in question, it is difficult to make firm statements about the stylistic context of the portraits. While it seems clear that they are not in continuity from Egyptian precedents, the same cannot be said for the northern shores of the Mediterranean, where such material is less likely to have survived, due to climatic conditions there. Evidence from frescoes, mosaics and other media suggests that stylistically, the mummy portraits broadly fit within the prevailing Graeco-Roman traditions then dominant around the Mediterranean.

==Coexistence with other burial habits==
The religious meaning of mummy portraits has not, so far, been fully explained, nor have associated grave rites. There is some indication that it developed from genuine Egyptian funerary rites, adapted by a multi-cultural ruling class.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt; The tradition of mummy portraits occurred from the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] to [[Nubia]], but it is striking that other funerary habits prevailed over portrait mummies at all sites except those in the Faiyum (and there especially Hawara and Achmim) and Antinoopolis. In most sites, different forms of burial coexisted. The choice of grave type may have been determined to a large extent by the financial means and status of the deceased, modified by local customs. Portrait mummies have been found both in rock-cut tombs and in freestanding built grave complexes, but also in shallow pits. It is striking that they are virtually never accompanied by any grave offerings, with the exception of occasional pots or sprays of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the mummy portrait tradition==
[[Image:Fayum-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a man]]
For a long time, it was assumed that the latest portraits belong to the end of the 4th century, but recent research has modified this view considerably, suggesting that the last wooden portraits belong to the middle, the last directly painted mummy wrappings to the second half of the 3rd century. It is commonly accepted that production reduced considerably since the beginning of the 3rd century. Several reasons for the decline of the mummy portrait have been suggested; no single reason should probably be isolated, rather, they should be seen as operating together.

*In the 3rd century the Roman Empire underwent a severe economic crisis, severely limiting the financial abilities of the upper classes. Although they continued to lavishly spend money on representation, they favoured public appearances, like games and festivals, over the production of portraits. However, other elements of sepulchral representation, like [[sarcophagi]], did continue.
*There is evidence of a religious crisis at the same time. This may not be as closely connected with the rise of Christianity as previously assumed. (The earlier suggestion of a 4th-century end to the portraits would coincide with the widespread distribution of Christianity in Egypt. Christianity also never banned mummification.) An increasing neglect of Egyptian temples is noticeable during the Roman imperial period, leading to a general drop in interest in all ancient religions.
*The [[Constitutio Antoniniana]], i.e. the granting of Roman citizenship to all free subjects changed the social structures of Egypt. For the first time, the individual cities gained a degree of self-administration. At the same time, the provincial upper classes changed in terms of both composition and inter-relations.
Thus, a combination of several factors appears to have led to changes of fashion and ritual. No clear causality can be asserted.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 88–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the limited nature of the current understanding of portrait mummies, it remains distinctly possible that future research will considerably modify the image presented here. For example, some scholars suspect that the centre of production of such finds, and thus the centre of the distinctive funerary tradition they represent, may have been located at Alexandria. New finds from [[Marina el-Alamein]] strongly support such a  view.&lt;ref name="Barbara Borg 1998"/&gt; In view of the near-total loss of Greek and Roman paintings, mummy portraits are today considered to be among the very rare examples of ancient art that can be seen to reflect "Great paintings" and especially Roman portrait painting.&lt;ref name="Hoesch"/&gt;

==Mummy portraits as sources on provincial Roman fashion==
[[Image:Fayum-13.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of a woman with curly hair, wearing a violet chiton and cloak and pendant earrings. [[British Museum]].]]

===Provincial fashions===
Mummy portraits depict a variety of different hairstyles. They are one of the main aids in dating the paintings. The majority of the deceased were depicted with hairstyles then in fashion. They are frequently similar to those depicted in [[sculpture]]. As part of Roman propaganda, such sculptures, especially those depicting the imperial family, were often displayed throughout the empire. Thus, they had a direct influence on the development of fashion. Nevertheless, the mummy portraits, as well as other finds, suggest that fashions lasted longer in the provinces than in the imperial court, or at least that diverse styles might coexist.

===Hairstyles===
Since Roman men tended to wear short-cropped hair, female hairstyles are a better source of evidence for changes in fashion. The female portraits suggest a coarse chronological scheme: Simple hairstyles with a central parting in the [[Tiberius|Tiberian]] period are followed by more complex ringlet hairstyles, nested plaits and [[toupee|curly toupées]] over the forehead in the late 1st century. Small oval nested plaits dominate the time of the [[Antonines]], simple central-parting hairstyles with a hairknot in the neck occur in the second half of the 2nd century. The time of [[Septimius Severus]] was characterised by [[toupée]]-like fluffy as well as strict, straight styles, followed by looped plaits on the crown of the head. The latter belong to the very final phase of mummy portraits, and have only been noted on a few mummy wrappings. It seems to be the case that curly hairstyles were especially popular in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 45–49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Egyptian - Female Portrait Mask - Walters 325.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The plaited hairstyle of this elite woman makes it possible to date this painting to the reign of [[Trajan]] (AD 98 – 117). [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

[[Image:Fayum-11.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction of a woman with a ringlet hairstyle, an orange chiton with black bands and rod-shaped earrings. [[Royal Museum of Scotland]].]]

===Clothing===
Like the hairstyles, the clothing depicted also follows the general fashions of the Roman Empire, as known from statues and busts. Both men and women tend to wear a thin [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] as an undergarment. Above it, both sexes tend to wear a cloak, laid across the shoulders or wound around the torso. The males wear virtually exclusively white, while female clothing is often red or pink, but can also be yellow, white, blue or purple. The chiton often bears a decorative line (''[[laticlave|clavus]]''), occasionally light red or light green, also sometimes gold, but normally in dark colours. Some painted mummy wrappings from Antinoopolis depict garments with long sleeves and very wide ''clavi''. So far, not a single portrait has been definitely shown to depict the [[toga]], a key symbol of Roman citizenship. It should, however, be kept in mind that Greek cloaks and togas are draped very similarly on depictions of the 1st and early 2nd centuries. In the late 2nd and 3rd centuries, togas should be distinguishable, but fail to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''"Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ...". Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewelry===
Apart from the gold [[wreath]]s worn by many men, with very few exceptions, only women are depicted with jewellery. This generally accords with the common jewellery types of the Graeco-Roman East. Especially the Antinoopolis portraits depict simple gold link chains and massive gold rings. There are also depictions of [[precious stone|precious]] or [[semi-precious stones]] like [[emerald]], [[carnelian]], [[garnet]], [[agate]] or [[amethyst]], rarely also of [[pearl]]s. The stones were normally ground into cylindrical or spherical beads. Some portraits depict elaborate [[collier (necklace)|colliers]], with precious stones set in gold.

The gold wreath was apparently rarely, if ever, worn in life, but a number have been found in graves from much earlier periods. Based on the plant wreaths given as prizes in contests, the idea was apparently to celebrate the achievements of the deceased in life.

There are three basic shapes of ear ornaments: Especially common in the 1st century are circular or drop-shaped pendants. Archaeological finds indicate that these were fully or semi-spherical. Later tastes favoured S-shaped hooks of gold wire, on which up to five beads of different colours and materials could be strung. The third shape are elaborate pendants with a horizontal bar from which two or three, occasionally four, vertical rods are suspended, usually each decorated with a white bead or pearl at the bottom. Other common ornaments include gold hairpins, often decorated with pearls, fine [[diadem (personal wear)|diadems]], and, especially at Antinoopolis, gold [[hairnet]]s. Many portraits also depict [[amulet]]s and [[pendant]]s, perhaps with magical functions.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Borg: ''„Der zierlichste Anblick der Welt ....“ Ägyptische Porträtmumien'', Mainz 1998, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art-historical significance ==
[[Image:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|Tondo with images of Septimius Severus and his family. [[Antikensammlung Berlin]].]]
The mummy portraits have immense art-historical importance. Ancient sources indicate that [[panel painting]] (rather than [[wall painting]]), i.e. painting on wood or other mobile surfaces was held in high regard. But very few ancient panel paintings
survive. One of the few examples besides the mummy portraits is the [[Severan Tondo]], also from Egypt (around 200), which, like the mummy portraits, is believed to represent a provincial version of contemporary style.&lt;ref&gt;other examples: a framed portrait from Hawara (Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 121–122, Nr. 117), the image of a man flanked by two deities from the same site (Walker, Bierbrier: ''Ancient Faces'', pp. 123–124, Nr. 119), or the 6th century BC panels from Pitsa in Greece [https://www.sikyon.com/sicyon/Painting/spainting_eg.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some aspects of the mummy portraits, especially their frontal perspective and their concentration on key facial features, strongly resemble later [[icon painting]]. A direct link has been suggested, but it should be kept in mind that the mummy portraits represent only a small part of a much wider Graeco-Roman tradition, the whole of which later bore an influence on [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] and [[Byzantine Art]].  A pair of panel "icons" of [[Serapis]] and [[Isis]] of comparable date (3rd century) and style are in the [[Getty Museum]] at [[Malibu, California|Malibu]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aisthesis.de/wbock/bilder/4-9si.gif image]&lt;/ref&gt; as with the cult of [[Mithras]], earlier examples of cult images were sculptures or pottery figurines, but from the 3rd century reliefs and then painted images are found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Weitzmann]] in The Icon, 1982, Evans Brothers Ltd, London, p. 3, (trans of Le Icone, Montadori 1981), {{ISBN|0-237-45645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20782">'''Feminist film theory''' is a [[film theory|theoretical]] [[film criticism]] derived from [[feminist]] politics and [[feminist theory]]. Feminists have many approaches to cinema analysis, regarding the film elements analyzed and their theoretical underpinnings.
{{Feminism sidebar}}
==History==
The development of feminist film theory was influenced by [[second wave feminism]] and [[women's studies]] in the 1960s and 1970s. Initially in the United States in the early 1970s feminist film theory was generally based on [[sociological theory]] and focused on the function of female characters in film [[narrative]]s or [[genre]]s. Feminist film theory, such as Marjorie Rosen’s ''Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream'' (1973) and [[Molly Haskell]]’s ''From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in Movies'' (1974) analyze the ways in which women are portrayed in film, and how this relates to a broader historical context. Additionally, feminist critiques also examine common [[stereotype]]s depicted in film, the extent to which the women were shown as active or passive, and the amount of screen time given to women.&lt;ref&gt;Smelik, Anneke.  "And The Mirror Cracked: Feminist Cinema and Film Theory."New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998. Page 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, film theoreticians in England concerned themselves with [[critical theory]], [[psychoanalytic theory|psychoanalysis]], [[semiotics]], and [[Marxism]]. Eventually, these ideas gained hold within the American scholarly community in the 1980's. Analysis generally focused on the meaning within a film's text and the way in which the text constructs a viewing subject. It also examined how the process of cinematic production affects how women are represented and reinforces sexism.&lt;ref&gt;Erens, Patricia. "Introduction", ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

British feminist film theorist, [[Laura Mulvey]], best known for her essay, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema", written in 1973 and published in 1975 in the influential British film theory journal, ''[[Screen (journal)|Screen]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.asu.edu/courses/fms504/total-readings/mulvey-visualpleasure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  was influenced by the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. "Visual Pleasure" is one of the first major essays that helped shift the orientation of [[film theory]] towards a [[Psychoanalytical film theory|psychoanalytic framework]]. Prior to Mulvey, film theorists such as Jean-Louis Baudry and [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] used [[psychoanalytic]] ideas in their theoretical accounts of cinema. Mulvey's contribution, however, initiated the intersection of [[film theory]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21118050|title=Issues in feminist film criticism|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|others=Erens, Patricia, 1938-|isbn=0253206103|location=Bloomington|oclc=21118050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key influences come from Metz's essay ''The Imaginary Signifier'', "Identification, Mirror," where he argues that viewing film is only possible through [[scopophilia]] (pleasure from looking, related to [[voyeurism]]), which is best exemplified in silent film.&lt;ref&gt;Braudy and Cohen, ''Film Theory and Criticism'', Sixth Edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, page 827&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Cynthia A. Freeland in "Feminist Frameworks for Horror Films," feminist studies of horror films have focused on psychodynamics where the chief interest is "on viewers' motives and interests in watching horror films".&lt;ref&gt;Braudy and Cohen, ''Film Theory and Criticism'', Sixth Edition, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early 1980s feminist film theory began to look at film through a more intersectional lens. The film journal ''Jump Cut'' published a special issue about titled "Lesbians and Film" in 1981 which examined the lack of lesbian identities in film. Jane Gaines's essay "White Privilege and Looking Relations: Race and Gender in Feminist Film Theory" examined the erasure of black women in cinema by white male filmmakers. While Lola Young argues that filmmakers of all races fail to break away from the use to tired stereotypes when depicting black women. Other theorists who wrote about feminist film theory and race include [[bell hooks]] and Michele Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;Smelik, Anneke.  "And The Mirror Cracked: Feminist Cinema and Film Theory."New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998. Page 20-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1990 onward the Matrixial theory of artist and  psychoanalyst [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; revolutionized feminist film theory.,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Chare, ''Sportswomen in Cinema: Film and the Frailty Myth''. Leeds: I.B.Tauris 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;James Batcho, ''Terrence Malick's Unseeing Cinema. Memory, Time and Audibility''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Her concept [[The Matrixial Gaze]],&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Gaze''. Published by Leeds University, 1995. Reprinted in: ''Drawing Papers'', nº 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; that has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of "coemergence", offering a critique of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s and [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''After-effects - After-images''. Manchester University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Humm, Feminism and Film''. Edinburgh University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; by female directors, like [[Chantal Akerman]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Nagib and Anne Jerslev (ends.), ''Impure Cinema''. London: I.B.Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by male directors, like [[Pedro Almodovar]]&lt;ref&gt;Julian Daniel Gutierrez-Arbilla, ''Aesthetics, Ethics and Trauma in the Cinema of [[Pedro Almodovar]]''. Edinburgh University Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger's notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Rutledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, scholars have expanded their work to include analysis of television and [[digital media]]. Additionally, they have begun to explore notions of difference, engaging in dialogue about the differences among women (part of movement away from [[essentialism]] in feminist work more generally), the various methodologies and perspectives contained under the umbrella of feminist film theory, and the multiplicity of methods and intended effects that influence the development of films. Scholars are also taking increasingly global perspectives, responding to [[postcolonialism|postcolonialist]] criticisms of perceived Anglo- and [[Eurocentrism]] in the academy more generally. Increased focus has been given to, "disparate feminisms, nationalisms, and media in various locations and across class, racial, and ethnic groups throughout the world".&lt;ref&gt;McHugh, Kathleen and Vivian Sobchack. “Introduction: Recent Approaches to Film Feminisms.” ''Signs'' 30(1):1205–1207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key themes==
===The gaze and the female spectator===

Considering the way that films are put together, many feminist film critics have pointed to what they argue is the "[[male gaze]]" that predominates [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classical Hollywood]] filmmaking. [[Budd Boetticher]] summarizes the view:
:"What counts is what the heroine provokes, or rather what she represents. She is the one, or rather the love or fear she inspires in the hero, or else the concern he feels for her, who makes him act the way he does. In herself, the woman has not the slightest importance."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Issues in Feminist Film Criticism|author=Erens, P.|date=1990|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253319647|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2U0wwTFVwgC|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}
[[Laura Mulvey]] expands on this conception to argue that in cinema, women are typically depicted in a passive role that provides visual pleasure through scopophilia,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{rp|30}} and identification with the on-screen male actor.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{rp|28}}  She asserts: "In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote ''to-be-looked-at-ness'',"&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{rp|28}} and as a result contends that in film a woman is the "bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{rp|28}} Mulvey argues that the psychoanalytic theory of [[Jacques Lacan]] is the key to understanding how film creates such a space for female sexual [[objectification]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] through the combination of the [[patriarchal]] order of society, and 'looking' in itself as a pleasurable act of scopophilia, as "the cinema satisfies a primordial wish for pleasurable looking."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

While Laura Mulvey's paper has a particular place in the feminist film theory, it is important to note that her ideas regarding ways of watching the cinema (from the voyeuristic element to the feelings of identification) are important to some feminist film theorists in terms of defining spectatorship from the psychoanalytical viewpoint.

Mulvey identifies three "looks" or perspectives that occur in film which, she argues, serve to sexually objectify women. The first is the perspective of the male character and how he perceives the female character. The second is the perspective of the spectator as they see the female character on screen. The third "look" joins the first two looks together: it is the male audience member's perspective of the male character in the film. This third perspective allows the male audience to take the female character as his own personal sex object because he can relate himself, through looking, to the male character in the film.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;{{rp|28}}

In the paper, Mulvey calls for a destruction of modern film structure as the only way to free women from their sexual objectification in film. She argues for a removal of the voyeurism encoded into film by creating distance between the male spectator and the female character. The only way to do so, Mulvey argues, is by destroying the element of voyeurism and "the invisible guest". Mulvey also asserts that the dominance men embody is only so because women exist, as without a woman for comparison, a man and his supremacy as the controller of visual pleasure are insignificant. For Mulvey, it is the presence of the female that defines the patriarchal order of society as well as the male psychology of thought.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;

Mulvey's argument is likely influenced by the time period in which she was writing. "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" was composed during the period of [[second-wave feminism]], which was concerned with achieving equality for women in the workplace, and with exploring the psychological implications of sexual stereotypes. Mulvey calls for an eradication of female sexual objectivity, aligning herself with second-wave feminism. She argues that in order for women to be equally represented in the workplace, women must be portrayed as men are: as lacking sexual objectification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mulvey proposes in her notes to the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD of [[Michael Powell]]'s controversial film, ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (a film about a homicidal voyeur who films the deaths of his victims), that the cinema spectator’s own voyeurism is made shockingly obvious and even more shockingly, the spectator identifies with the perverted protagonist. The inference is that she includes female spectators in that, identifying with the male observer rather than the female object of the gaze.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realism and counter cinema===

The early work of Marjorie Rosen and Molly Haskell on the representation of women in film was part of a movement to depict women more realistically, both in documentaries and narrative cinema. The growing female presence in the film industry was seen as a positive step toward realizing this goal, by drawing attention to feminist issues and putting forth an alternative, true-to-life view of women. However, Rosen and Haskell argue that these images are still mediated by the same factors as traditional film, such as the "moving camera, composition, editing, lighting, and all varieties of sound."  While acknowledging the value in inserting positive representations of women in film, some critics asserted that real change would only come about from reconsidering the role of film in society, often from a semiotic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Erens, Patricia. “Introduction” ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claire Johnston]] put forth the idea that [[women's cinema]] can function as "counter cinema." Through consciousness of the means of production and opposition of sexist ideologies, films made by women have the potential to posit an alternative to traditional Hollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Claire. "Women’s Cinema as Counter Cinema."  ''Sexual Stratagems: The World of Women in Film.'' Patricia Erens, ed. New York: Horizon Press, 1979, pp 133–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the attempt to show "real" women was praised, eventually critics such as Eileen McGarry claimed that the "real" women being shown on screen were still just contrived depictions.  In reaction to this article, many women filmmakers integrated "alternative forms and experimental techniques" to "encourage audiences to critique the seemingly transparent images on the screen and to question the manipulative techniques of filming and editing".&lt;ref&gt;Erens, Patricia. “Introduction” ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional theories ===
[[B. Ruby Rich]] argues that feminist film theory should shift to look at films in a broader sense. Rich's essay ''In the Name of Feminist Film Criticism'' claims that films by women often receive praise for certain elements, while feminist undertones are ignored. Rich goes on to say that because of this feminist theory needs to focus on how film by women are being received.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, B. Ruby. “In the Name of Feminist Film Criticism. ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990, pp. 268–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from a black feminist perspective, American scholar, Bell Hooks, put forth the notion of the “oppositional gaze,” encouraging black women not to accept stereotypical representations in film, but rather actively critique them. The “oppositional gaze” is a response to Mulvey's ''visual pleasure'' and states that just as women do not identify with female characters that are not "real," women of color should respond similarly to the one denominational caricatures of black women.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. “The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators.”  ''The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader.''  Amelia Jones, ed. London: Routledge, 2003, pp. 94–105.&lt;/ref&gt;
Janet Bergstrom’s article “Enunciation and Sexual Difference” (1979) uses Sigmund Freud’s ideas of bisexual responses, arguing that women are capable of identifying with male characters and men with women characters, either successively or simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Erens, Patricia 1990"&gt;Erens, Patricia. “Introduction” ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism.''  Patricia Erens, ed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990. pp. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Miriam Hansen, in "Pleasure, Ambivalence, Identification: Valentino and Female Spectatorship" (1984)  put forth the idea that women are also able to view male characters as erotic objects of desire.&lt;ref name="Erens, Patricia 1990"/&gt;  In "The Master's Dollhouse: Rear Window," Tania Modleski argues that Hitchcock's film, ''[[Rear Window]]'', is an example of the power of male gazer and the position of the female as a prisoner of the "master's dollhouse".&lt;ref&gt;Braudy and Cohen, ''Film Theory and Criticism'', Sixth Edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, page 861.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carol Clover]], in her popular and influential book, "[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws]]: Gender in the Modern Horror Film" (Princeton University Press, 1992), argues that young male viewers of the Horror Genre (young males being the primary demographic) are quite prepared to identify with the female-in-jeopardy, a key component of the horror narrative, and to identify on an unexpectedly profound level. Clover further argues that the "[[Final Girl]]" in the psychosexual subgenre of exploitation horror invariably triumphs through her own resourcefulness, and is not by any means a passive, or inevitable, victim. Laura Mulvey, in response to these and other criticisms, revisited the topic in "Afterthoughts on 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' inspired by ''Duel in the Sun''" (1981). In addressing the heterosexual female spectator, she revised her stance to argue that women can take two possible roles in relation to film: a masochistic identification with the female object of desire that is ultimately self-defeating or a transsexual identification with men as the active viewers of the text.&lt;ref name="Erens, Patricia 1990"/&gt; A new version of the gaze was offered in the early 1990s by [[Bracha Ettinger]], who proposed the notion of the "[[matrixial gaze]]".

'''Froissage''' is a method of [[collage]] developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] artist [[Ladislav Novák (artist)|Ladislav Novák]] in which the lines made by crumpling up a piece of paper are used to create a drawing. One major exponent of the art of froissage is [[Jiří Kolář]].

In his lifetime, Kolář acquired a reputation as one of the most inventive 20th-century [[Czech Republic|Czech]] artists. A member of [[Group 42]] and the first Czech Group of Experimental Poetry, he assisted in the development of the collage techniques of '''froissage''' and '''confrontage'''. During that time, writing poems and crumpling up pieces of paper were considered subversive activities and were discouraged by the then-powerful [[Communism|Communist]] regime. Kolář endured harassment and imprisonment, and eventually emigrated to [[France]], where he was finally able to attain international renown for his work. 

Froissage is a unique art in which the contours of a crumpled piece of paper are used to create a drawing. Currently on display in a small gallery at the [[French Institute]], Kolář’s froissages incorporate previously existing 17th-century French drawings to form more modern, abstract pictures. The results occasionally can be likened to early [[Cubism|Cubist]] efforts to capture multiple motions and images within a single frame.

'''''Hostage''''' is a 2005 American [[action film|action]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced by and starring [[Bruce Willis]] and directed by [[Florent Emilio Siri]]. The film was based on the [[Hostage (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Robert Crais]], and was adapted for the screen by [[Doug Richardson]].

The film earned mixed to negative reviews and was not a financial success on its original release, earning only slightly more than its production costs.

==Plot==
Former [[LAPD SWAT|L.A. SWAT]] officer Jeff Talley is a [[hostage negotiator]] in [[Los Angeles]]. One day, Talley negotiates with a man who has taken his wife and son hostage after learning his wife was cheating on him. Shortly after Talley denies a SWAT commander's request to give snipers the order to open fire, the despondent man kills his wife, son, and himself. Traumatized, Talley moves with his family and becomes police chief in Bristo Camino, a fictional suburban hamlet in nearby [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].

A year later, Talley finds himself in another hostage situation. Two troubled teenaged brothers, Dennis and Kevin Kelly, and a sociopathic accomplice, Marshall "Mars" Krupcheck, all very well-armed, take Walter Smith and his two children, Jennifer and Tommy, hostage in the Smith home after a failed robbery attempt. Dennis had told his younger brother to wait in the car, not anticipating the siege to come, but Kevin refused.

A female police officer, Carol Flores, responds after Tommy turns on the silent alarm. She is shot twice by Mars just before Talley arrives. She dies in front of him. Traumatized and unwilling to put himself through another tragedy, Talley hands authority over to the [[Ventura County Sheriff's Department|county sheriff]] and leaves.

Smith had been [[Money laundering|laundering money]] for a mysterious [[right-wing]] [[militia]] and criminal syndicate through offshore shell corporations. He was preparing to turn over a batch of important [[Encryption|encrypted]] files recorded on a [[DVD]] when he was taken hostage. To prevent the incriminating evidence from being discovered, the syndicate orders a ruthless operative, known as "the Watchman", to kidnap Talley's wife and daughter. Talley is instructed by "the Watchman", to return to the hostage scene, regain authority, and stall for time until the organization can launch its own attack against Smith's house. Otherwise, Talley's wife and daughter will be murdered.

Dennis forces Kevin and Mars to tie up the children, while he knocks out Smith and finds a small fortune in cash, money which the syndicate had paid Smith. In an attempt to end the standoff and secure the DVDs himself, Talley meets with Dennis and agrees to provide a helicopter in exchange for half of the money. 

When the helicopter arrives, Dennis and Kevin bring the money to Talley and prepare to leave, but Mars refuses to leave without Jennifer, with whom he has become infatuated. Talley says the helicopter will only carry three passengers and insists Jennifer stay behind, but the deal breaks down and the boys and Jennifer return to the house. Talley learns that Mars is a sociopath who could turn on the hostages and his own accomplices at any moment. Mars does, in fact, kill Kevin, just as Kevin is about to release the children. Mars then kills Dennis.

The syndicate sends fake [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents to recover the DVD and they storm the house; Talley is instructed to not go near the house. Jennifer manages to stab Mars, but not fatally, and locks herself and Tommy in the [[panic room]]. 

Hearing their screams, Talley breaches the house and is attacked by Mars, who then kills most of the fake agents using his pistol and multiple homemade [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Mars is then shot in the side by the only surviving agent. The agent tracks down Talley and the children, and demands the encrypted DVD. When Talley asks that the children be allowed to leave, the fake agent shoots Talley, but it is not a fatal wound. After Talley gives him the DVD, Mars reappears, carrying two homemade Molotov cocktails, distracting the agent long enough to be killed by Talley. Mars then prepares to throw his last Molotov, but collapses to his knees, weakened by his injuries. He makes eye contact with Jennifer, then drops the Molotov and [[Self-immolation|immolates himself]].

Talley escapes with the children by shooting the indoor glass waterfall, which extinguishes the fire caused by Mars' first Molotov. He and a recovered Smith then go to a rundown inn where Talley's wife and daughter are being held captive by the Watchman and his crew. 

Smith, feigning hatred for Talley, is freed in exchange for the family. While demanding that the Watchman kill Talley, Smith shoots the Watchman in the head. This allows Talley to kill the other gunmen in similar fashion and rescue his own family.

==Production==
The film's plot is roughly the same as Crais's novel. The main difference is that the novel's complicated subplot involving powerful [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] [[American Mafia|Mafia]] crime lord Sonny Benza was removed, with the film giving little explanation of Walter Smith's criminal associates. The film also makes the first group of hostage-takers somewhat younger in age than depicted in the novel.    In addition, the criminal syndicate in the film were portrayed as domestic [[right-wing extremists]] rather than a Mafia.

Filming took place in the [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] area (in western [[Los Angeles County]]). The exterior views of Smith's lavishly appointed house were filmed at a real house in the unincorporated [[Topanga Canyon]] area, between Malibu and Los Angeles; the interior scenes were done on sound stages in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].&lt;ref name=Locations/&gt;

The character Mars, played by Ben Foster, was modeled after [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] [[rap]] artist [[Mars (rapper)|Mars]] by Robert Crais after a friend Dennis Bsharah urged him to look into the [[horrorcore]] genre. In the movie adaptation, Foster strongly resembles the rapper.&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Foster - HOSTAGE Interview|url=http://www.tribute.ca/interviews/ben-foster-hostage/star/18312/|website=Tribute.ca|publisher=Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate=17 February 2015|date=March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jonathan Tucker]]'s name was later changed to Dennis.

The movie's opening scenes were filmed in the [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, California|Boyle Heights]] neighborhood of East Los Angeles, just east of downtown.&lt;ref name=Locations&gt;{{cite web|title=Hostage-Film Locations|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Hostage.shtml|website=Seeing Stars.com/Locations|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional city of Bristo Camino was possibly intended to be a representation of [[Ojai, California|Ojai]] or [[Moorpark, California|Moorpark]]. Bristo Bay is the name of Bristo Camino in the 2001 [[Robert Crais]] ''[[Hostage (novel)|novel]]''.&lt;ref name=PUNKS_NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=Not-Half-Bad Punks And a World-Weary Cop|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/20/books/books-of-the-times-not-half-bad-punks-and-a-world-weary-cop.html|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=BOOK OF THE TIMES|publisher=The New York Times|date=20 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivor Armstrong Richards''' (26 February 1893 – 7 September 1979), known as '''I. A. Richards''', was an English educator, [[literary critic]], and [[rhetoric]]ian whose work contributed to the foundations of the [[New Criticism]], a [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] movement in [[literary theory]], which emphasized the [[close reading]] of a literary text, especially [[poetry]], in an effort to discover how a work of literature functions as a self-contained, self-referential [[Aesthetics|æsthetic object]].

Richards' [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] contributions to the establishment of the literary methodology of the New Criticism are presented in the books ''[[The Meaning of Meaning|The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism]]'' (1923), by [[C. K. Ogden]] and I. A. Richards, ''Principles of Literary Criticism'' (1926), ''Practical Criticism'' (1929), and ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' (1936).

==Biography==

Richards was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where his intellectual talents were developed by the scholar Charles Hicksonn 'Cabby' Spence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bizzell |first=Patricia |first2=Bruce |last2=Herzberg |title=The Rhetorical Tradition: Reading From Classical Times to the Present |edition=2nd |location=New York, NY |publisher=Bedford/St. Matin's |year=2001 |page=1270 |isbn=0312148399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career without formal training in literature; he studied philosophy (the "moral sciences") at [[Cambridge University]], from which derived his assertions that, in the 20th century, literary study cannot and should not be undertaken as a specialisation, it is in itself, but studied alongside a cognate field, such as [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]].

His early teaching appointments were as adjunct faculty: at Cambridge University, [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]] would not pay a salary for Richards to teach the new, and untested, [[academic field]] of English literature. Instead, like an old-style instructor, he collected weekly tuition directly from the students, as they entered the classroom. In his private life, Richards married [[Dorothy Pilley Richards]] in 1926; they had met on a [[Alpinism|mountain climbing]] holiday in Wales.

In the 1929–30 biennium, as a visiting professor, Richards taught [[Basic English]] and Poetry at [[Tsinghua University]], Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/I-A-Richards Retrieved 6 April 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tai Huai-Ching,  ''On the Study of Words'' (1960).my World Publishing Co. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1936–38, triennium, Richards was the director of the [[Orthological Institute of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/I-A-Richards ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
===Collaborations with C. K. Ogden===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Charles Kay Ogden.jpg|thumb|right|350px| The inventor of [[Basic English]], C.K. Ogden (1889–1957), was the most fruitful collaborator of I. A. Richards.]] --&gt;

The life and intellectual influence of I. A. Richards approximately corresponds to his [[intellectualism|intellectual]] interests; many endeavours were in collaboration with the [[linguist]], philosopher, and writer [[C. K. Ogden|Charles Kay Ogden]] (C.K. Ogden), notably in four books:

I. ''Foundations of Aesthetics'' (1922) presents the principles of ''aesthetic reception'', the bases of the literary theory of “harmony”;  aesthetic understanding derives from the balance of competing psychological impulses. The structure of the ''Foundations of Aesthetics''—a survey of the competing definitions of the term ''æsthetic''—prefigures the multiple-definitions work in the books ''Basic Rules of Reason'' (1933), ''Mencius on the Mind: Experiments in Multiple Definition'' (1932), and  ''Coleridge on Imagination'' (1934)

II. ''[[The Meaning of Meaning|The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism]]'' (1923) presents the triadic theory of [[semiotics]] that depends upon psychological theory, and so anticipates the importance of psychology in the exercise of literary criticism. Semioticians, such as [[Umberto Eco]], acknowledged that the methodology of the triadic theory of semiotics improved upon the methodology of the dyadic theory of semiotics presented by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913).

III. ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930) and IV. the ''Times of India Guide to Basic English'' (1938) developed the [[Basic English]] program in effort to develop an international language, an [[International auxiliary language|interlanguage]] based upon a vocabulary of  850 English words.

Richards' travels, especially in China, effectively situated him as the advocate for an international program, such as Basic English. Moreover, at Harvard University, to his international pedagogy, the instructor I. A. Richards began to integrate the available new media for mass communications, especially [[television]].

===Aesthetics and literary criticism===
====Theory====
[[File:William Empson.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The poet and literary critic William Empson (1906–84), developed the methodology of New Criticism with the practice of [[close reading|closely reading]] of literary works, prose and poetry; his best-known work is ''Seven Types of Ambiguity'' (1930)]]

I. A. Richards' paternity of the [[New Criticism]] is in two books of [[critical theory]], ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'' (1924) and ''Practical Criticism'' (1929). The first book, ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'', discusses the subjects of  [[Substantial form|form]], [[Value (semiotics)|value]], [[rhythm]], coenesthesia (awareness of inhabiting one's body, caused by stimuli from various organs), literary infectiousness, [[allusion|allusiveness]], divergent readings, and [[belief]]. The second book, ''Practical Criticism'' (1929), is an [[empirical study]] of ''inferior response'' to a literary text.

As an instructor of English literature  at Cambridge University, Richards tested the critical-thinking abilities of his pupils; he removed [[author]]ial and contextual information from thirteen poems, one by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] (1807– 82), and assigned the literary interpretations to undergraduate students in order to ascertain the likely impediments to an ''adequate response'' to a literary text. That experiment in [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach — critical reading without contexts — demonstrated the variety and the depth of the possible textual misreadings that might be committed, by university student and layman reader alike.

The critical method derived from that pedagogical approach did not propose a new [[hermeneutics]], a new methodology of interpretation, but questioned the purposes and efficacy of the critical process of literary interpretation, by analysing the self-reported critical interpretations of university students. To that end, effective critical work required a closer [[aesthetic interpretation]] of the literary text as an object; which methodology produced the empirical-study work about the teaching of composition, e.g. “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing ” (1981), by [[Linda Flower]] and John R. Hayes (see: [[Writing process]]).

To substantiate interpretive criticism, Richards provided theories of [[metaphor]], [[value (ethics)|value]], and [[Tone (literature)|tone]], of stock response, incipient action, and pseudo-statement; and of [[ambiguity]]. This last subject, the theory of ''ambiguity'', was developed in ''[[Seven Types of Ambiguity]]'' (1930), by [[William Empson]], a former student of Richards'; moreover, additional to ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'' and ''Practical Criticism'', Empson's book on ambiguity became the third foundational document for the methodology of the [[New Criticism]].

To Richards, literary criticism was [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionistic]], too abstract to be readily grasped and understood, by most readers; and he proposed that literary criticism could be precise in communicating meanings, by way of denotation and connotation. To establish critical precision, Richards examined the [[Working memory|psychological processes]] of writing and of the [[Reading (process)|reading]] of poetry. That in reading poetry and making sense of it “in the degree in which we can order ourselves, we need nothing more”; the reader need not believe the poetry, because the literary importance of poetry is in provoking emotions in the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Glicksberg, Charles I. "I. A. Richards and the Science of Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 46.4 (1938). JSTOR. Web. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27535493&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New rhetoric====
As a rhetorician, I. A. Richards said that the old form of studying [[rhetoric]] (the art of [[discourse]]) was too concerned with the mechanics of formulating [[argument]]s and with conflict; instead, he proposed the New Rhetoric to study of the meaning of the parts of discourse, as “a study of misunderstanding and its remedies” to determine how language works. That [[ambiguity]] is expected, and that meanings (denotation and connotation) are not inherent to words, but are inherent to the perception of the reader, the listener, and the viewer. By their usages, compiled from experience, people decide and determine meaning by “how words are used in a sentence”, in spoken and written language.&lt;ref&gt;Hochmuth, Marie. "I. A Richards and the ‘New Rhetoric’ new royal”, ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 44.1 (1958): 1. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The semantic triangle =====
I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden created the [[semantic triangle]] to deliver improved understanding to how words come to mean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetoric of Western Thought|last=Golden, Berquist, Coleman, Sproule|first=|publisher=Kendall-Hunt|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=265–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semantic triangle has three parts, the symbol or word, the referent, and the thought or reference.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the bottom, right corner is the Referent, the thing, in reality,  Placed at the left corner is the symbol or word. At the top point, the convergence of the literal word and the object in reality; it is our intangible idea about the object. Ultimately,  the english meaning of the words is determined by an individual's unique experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Feedforward===
At the age of 75 years, I. A. Richards was approached by the ''Saturday Review'' to write a piece for their "What I Have Learned" series. Richards surprisingly took this opportunity to expound upon his lesser known concept of "feedforward".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/meanmean.pdf  |title=The Meaning of Meaning of I. A. RIchards,  |chapter=Five  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193836/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/meanmean.pdf  |archivedate=29 October 2013  |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, feedforward is the concept of anticipating the effect of one's words by acting as our own critic. It is thought to work in the opposite direction of feedback, though it works essentially towards the same goal: to clarify unclear concepts. Existing in all forms of communication,&lt;ref name="The Communication Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcbdevito.blogspot.com/2010/11/i-want-to-broaden-communication-blog-to.html |title= The Communication Blog, |section= Feedforward }}&lt;/ref&gt; feedforward acts as a pretest that any writer can use to anticipate the impact of their words on their audience. According to Richards, feedforward allows the writer to then engage with their text to make necessary changes to create a better effect. He believes that communicators who do not use feedforward will seem dogmatic. Richards wrote more in depth about the idea and importance of feedforward in communication in his book ''Speculative Instruments'' and has claimed that feedforward was his most important learned concept.&lt;ref name="The Communication Blog"/&gt;

===Influence===
Richards served as mentor and teacher to other prominent critics, most notably [[William Empson]] and [[F. R. Leavis]], though Leavis was contemporary with Richards, Empson much younger. Other critics primarily influenced by his writings also included [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Allen Tate]]. Later critics who refined the formalist approach to New Criticism by actively rejecting his psychological emphasis included, besides Brooks and Tate, [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[R. P. Blackmur]], and [[Murray Krieger]]. [[R. S. Crane]] of the Chicago school was both indebted to Richards's theory and critical of its psychological assumptions. They all admitted the value of his seminal ideas but sought to salvage what they considered his most useful assumptions from the theoretical excesses they felt he brought to bear in his criticism. Like Empson, Richards proved a difficult model for the New Critics, but his model of [[close reading]] provided the basis for their interpretive methodology.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records that I. A. Richards coined the term '''feedforward''', in 1951, at the 8th annual [[Macy Conferences]] on [[cybernetics]]. In the event, the term extended the intellectual and critical influence of Richards to cybernetics which makes liberal use of the term ''feedforward'', as in [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|Feedforward]]. Moreover, among Richards' students was [[Marshall McLuhan]], who also applied the term and the ideas of feedforward.

His hand brushed Sterling's bald head. Dr. R. told Tim, 'For a long time afterwards I was haunted with bad dreams, dreaming that Sterling was trying to come up and that my hand brushing across his head kept him from being able to.' Dr. R. told Dr. Leonard's grandson that he and Sterling had had a productive afternoon together and he believed if Dr. Leonard had survived, they (together) would have 'revolutionized English teaching.' Tim says Dr. R. seemed more concerned about him (Tim) than the past events and "he reassured me my grandfather was a very important person."

Exhibitions change monthly and feature both emerging and established artists; the exhibitions are solo, group or thematic in orientation. At Hillyer, work from artists living and working in the mid-Atlantic region, particularly the D.C. area, exists alongside the work of their international peers. By exhibiting this variety of international art adjacent to local works, Hillyer creates a dialogue of cultural exchange.
Some of Hillyer's past exhibitions include works by [[Joan Belmar]], [[Solomon Wondimu]], [[Yar Koporulin]] and [[Jessika Tarr]].

== Cultural Exchange Programs ==
IA&amp;A runs an internationally focused career training program. This [[U.S. Department of State]]-approved program allows international trainees to partake in professional training within arts and cultural-related organizations throughout the United States.

The '''Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy''' began in July 2007 with a series of [[drawing]]s by Swedish artist [[Lars Vilks]] that depicted the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]] (a form of [[street installation]] in Sweden). Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of the drawings on 18 August as part of an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=Rätten att förlöjliga en religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-18 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190721/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209627 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;br/&gt;English translation: {{cite news |first=Lars |last=Ströman |title=The right to ridicule a religion |url=http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 |publisher=[[Nerikes Allehanda]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830163657/http://www.na.se/artikel.asp?intId=1209676 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from Muslims in Sweden as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=iran&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran protests over Swedish Muhammad cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-08-27 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829141345/http://www.thelocal.se/8305/20070827/ |archivedate=2007-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref name=pakistan&gt;{{cite press release|title=PAKISTAN CONDEMNS THE PUBLICATION OF OFFENSIVE SKETCH IN SWEDEN |publisher=[[Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904154021/http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Press_Releases/2007/Aug/PR_234_07.htm |archivedate=2007-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=afghanistan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sayed |last=Salahuddin |title=Indignant Afghanistan slams Prophet Mohammad sketch |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/SouthAsiaNews/idINIndia-29281220070901 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=egypt&gt;{{cite news |first=Gwladys |last=Fouché |title=Egypt wades into Swedish cartoons row |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2161595,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jordan]],&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan condemns new Swedish Mohammed cartoon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070903/wl_mideast_afp/jordanswedenislam_070903124623 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-03 |accessdate=2007-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the inter-governmental [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC).&lt;ref name=oic&gt;{{cite press release|title=The Secretary General strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of Prophet Muhammad by Swedish artist |publisher=[[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] |date=2007-08-30 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012054243/http://oic-oci.org/press/English/2007/08/caricatur.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy occurred about a year and a half after the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark in early 2006.

== Background ==

[[Image:Lars Vilks 20050722.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lars Vilks]]]]
On 11 June 2007, Vilks was invited to participate in an art exhibition on the theme "The Dog in Art" ({{lang-sv|Hunden i konsten}}) that was to be held in the small town of [[Tällerud]] in [[Värmland]]. Vilks submitted three [[pen]] and [[ink]] [[drawing]]s on [[ISO 216|A4 paper]] depicting [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]]. At this time, Vilks was already participating with drawings of Muhammad in another exhibition in [[Vestfossen]], Norway, on the theme "Oh, My God". Vilks, who is a known proponent of [[institutional art]], has stated that his original intention with the drawings was to "examine the [[political correctness]] within the boundaries of the art community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Argument 6 september 2007 : Debatt om Yttrandefrihet |episodelink= |series=Argument |serieslink=Argument (television program) |credits= |network=[[Sveriges Television]] |station=[[SVT1]] |airdate=2007-09-06 |season=2 |number=1 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vilks, the art and culture communities in Sweden repeatedly criticize the United States and [[Israel]], whereas Muslim values are rarely even questioned.&lt;ref name=site&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamists push for boycott of Swedish firms |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8542/20070919/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028162633/http://www.thelocal.se/8542/20070919/ |archivedate=2007-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July, the day before the opening of the exhibition in Tällerud, the organizers decided to withdraw Vilks's drawings from the exhibition due to security concerns and fear of violence from [[Islamic extremism|Islamic extremists]] (''see [[Islam and blasphemy]] and [[Islam and animals]]''). Märta Wennerström, the exhibition's organizer, said that at first she "didn't realize the gravity of the situation" and that she made the decision to remove the drawings after consulting [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agencies]] and private persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammed som rondellhund stoppas |url=http://www.nwt.se/ArticlePages/200707/20/20070720205557_NWT845/20070720205557_NWT845.dbp.asp |publisher=[[Nya Wermlands-Tidningen]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-20 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823022045/http://www.nwt.se/ArticlePages/200707/20/20070720205557_NWT845/20070720205557_NWT845.dbp.asp |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bosse |last=Brink |title=Teckningar på Muhammed togs bort |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_16316985.asp |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the first refusal to publish the drawings, Vilks submitted his drawings to the [[Gerlesborg School of Fine Art]] in [[Bohuslän]] (where he is a frequent lecturer) for a special teachers' exhibition that was going to be opened on 18 August. On 13 August, however, the school announced that they also had decided to reject the drawings due to security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Johan |last=Sjöstrand |title=Stopp igen för Vilks Muhammed-bilder |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_16670977.asp |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second rejection started an intense debate in the Swedish media about [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of expression]].

On 18 August, the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'' published one of Vilks's drawings in an [[editorial]] on freedom of expression. The editorial defended "Muslims' right to freedom of religion" but also said it must be permitted to "ridicule Islam's most foremost symbols — just like all other religions' symbols."&lt;ref name=na/&gt; On the same day, the drawings were also published in several other Swedish newspapers including ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'', ''[[Expressen]]'' and ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]''.

== Reactions ==

=== International reactions ===
On 27 August, the Swedish ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' in [[Tehran]], Gunilla von Bahr, was summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry where she received a protest from the [[Government of Iran|Iranian government]] against the publication in ''Nerikes Allehanda''.&lt;ref name=iran/&gt; On 28 August the [[President of Iran]], [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], commented on the drawings during a press conference. He was quoted by the [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] as saying: "Religions call for friendship, equality, justice, peace and respect for divine prophets. The Zionists only pretend to believe in religion. They are telling lies. They are perpetrating oppression against the Europeans and putting at risk the prestige of Europe." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President castigates Swedish daily for publishing blasphemy |url=http://www2.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0708280953195316.htm |publisher=[[Islamic Republic News Agency]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091659/http://www2.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0708280953195316.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmadinejad claims 'Zionists' behind Swedish cartoon |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8319/20070828/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830131140/http://www.thelocal.se/8319/20070828/ |archivedate=2007-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August, the Swedish ''chargé d'affaires'' in [[Islamabad]], Lennart Holst, was summoned to the [[Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to receive a similar protest from the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James |last=Savage |title=Muhammad cartoon: Sweden 'sorry for hurt feelings' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8341/20070830/ |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902154003/http://www.thelocal.se/8341/20070830/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs later issued a statement where it condemned the publication "in the strongest terms".&lt;ref name=pakistan/&gt;

On the same day the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC), an inter-governmental organization which represents 57 Muslim countries, issued a statement where it strongly condemned the publishing of blasphemous caricatures of Muhammad by Swedish artist Lars Vilks in the ''Nerikes Allehanda'' newspaper. The secretary-general of OIC, [[Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu]], further called on the Swedish government to take "immediate punitive actions against the artist and the publishers of the cartoon and asked for their unqualified apology".&lt;ref name=oic/&gt;

On 31 August, supporters from Islamic parties in Pakistan burned the [[Flag of Sweden|Swedish flag]] in the city of [[Lahore]]. In [[Karachi]], others torched an effigy of the [[Swedish Prime Minister]] to protest the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslims Protest Swedish Newspaper's Cartoon of Prophet Muhammad |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,295431,00.html |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] newspaper ''[[Kabul Times]]'' published a statement by religious scholars, imams and the Afghan [[Ministry of Islamic Guidance]]. The statement said that "The sold-out enemies of Islam draw the cartoon of the respected Prophet of Islam once more. This has disturbed the Islamic world and aroused the indignation of all Muslims". The statement demanded those responsible be handed over to a court for prosecution and punishment.&lt;ref name=afghanistan/&gt;

On 3 September, the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments]] condemned the publication, saying that "such an irresponsible act is not conducive to friendly ties between the Islamic world and the west".&lt;ref name=egypt/&gt; On the same day, also the [[Government of Jordan|Jordanian government]] condemned the publication. A spokesperson for the government said that "The publication of this cartoon, which seeks to attack the character of the Prophet Mohammed, is unacceptable, rejected and condemned".&lt;ref name=jordan/&gt;

=== Domestic reactions ===
On 25 August, a group of about 60 Muslims held a demonstration outside ''Nerikes Allehanda'''s office in Örebro to protest against the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Hedtjärn |title=Demonstration mot Muhammedhundar |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=684516 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826215156/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=684516 |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August, [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Swedish Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] commented on the issue and said: "I think it's important to say two things. First, we are eager to ensure that Sweden remains a country in which Muslims and Christians, people who believe in God and people who don't believe in God, can live side by side in a spirit of mutual respect [...] We are also eager to stand up for freedom of expression, which is enshrined in the [[Constitution of Sweden|constitution]] and comes naturally to us, and which ensures that we do not make political decisions about what gets published in the newspapers. I want to make sure we keep things that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reinfeldt speaks out about Muhammad controversy |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8350/20070831/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902154105/http://www.thelocal.se/8350/20070831/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, around 300 demonstrators – led by the Islamic Cultural Centre in Örebro – assembled outside the offices of ''Nerikes Allehanda'' to protest against the newspaper's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Demonstrators in Muhammad picture protest |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8351/20070831/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902153815/http://www.thelocal.se/8351/20070831/ |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt met with ambassadors from 22 Muslim countries to discuss the issue. Reinfeldt said that he had "explained how Swedish society works and that we don't have elected representatives making editorial decisions", adding that "this is an open country, a tolerant country".&lt;ref name=meeting1&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim ambassadors 'made no demands' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8424/20070907/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]/[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910191024/http://www.thelocal.se/8424/20070907/ |archivedate=2007-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the meeting, Egyptian ambassador [[Mohamed Sotouhi]] said, according to the news agency [[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]], that he and a group of fellow ambassadors had agreed on a list of measures that Sweden needed to take and to present it to the Prime Minister. "We want to see action, not just nice words. We have to push for a change in the law", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim ambassadors: 'Sweden needs to change its laws' |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8412/20070906/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]/[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908151322/http://www.thelocal.se/8412/20070906/ |archivedate=2007-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the meeting however, Reinfeldt denied that any such list had been presented to him.&lt;ref name=meeting1/&gt; According to the [[Syrian Arab News Agency]], a statement had been delivered from the Swedish embassy in [[Damascus]] to Syria's [[Grand Mufti]] [[Ahmad Bader Hassoun]] in which Reinfeldt "expressed his regret of the incident which has offended and upset Muslims, calling against instigating or offending other religions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweden Apologizes for Newspapers Offending Muslims |url=http://www.sana.org/eng/22/2007/09/05/137784.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308164039/http://sana.org/eng/22/2007/09/05/137784.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-08 |publisher=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2007-09-12}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish government has not commented on this statement.

[[Image:Muh-hund-originallit.JPG|thumb|right|200px|One of Vilks's original three drawings, depicting [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]].]]
Also on 7 September, a group of about 550 Muslims gathered outside the offices of the newspaper ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]'' in [[Uppsala]], to protest against the newspaper's publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muhammad cartoons spark new protest |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8428/20070907/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910031849/http://www.thelocal.se/8428/20070907/ |archivedate=2007-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threats and attacks ==
Following the publication in ''Nerikes Allehanda'', the [[Swedish Police Authority|Swedish police]] raised the security level around the newspaper's headquarters and some of its employees have been forced to use bodyguards after receiving death threats. Vilks himself has also received several death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Scherlund |title=Lars Vilks hotad till livet |url=http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |publisher=[[TV4Nyheterna]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902105232/http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One Muslim woman in western Sweden has been arrested on charges of issuing a death threat ({{lang-sv|olaga hot}}) against Vilks in an e-mail. The woman confirmed in police interrogation that she had written the mail and said that she did not have any regrets about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kvinna delgiven för mordhot av Vilks |url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_17015499.asp?blogAbuseID=36649 |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]] |language=Swedish |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, one actual roundabout dog created by Vilks and local children was set alight as an apparent threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/8420/20070907/ The Local – Sculpture by controverial &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; artist set on fire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115075921/http://www.thelocal.se/8420/20070907/ |date=November 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September, it was reported that the group [[Islamic State of Iraq]] had placed a bounty of at least $100,000 on the head of Lars Vilks and 50,000 dollars on [[Ulf Johansson (editor)|Ulf Johansson]], editor-in-chief of ''Nerikes Allehanda''. The statement was found in an audio file on an Islamist website and was read by a person who identified himself as [[Abu Omar al-Baghdadi]], the purported head of the Islamic State of Iraq. "We announce a reward of $100,000 to anyone who kills this infidel criminal. This reward will be raised to $150,000 if he is slaughtered like a lamb," the statement said. The statement also threatened attacks on Swedish companies unless unspecified "crusaders" issued an apology. Vilks responded to the statement by saying: "I suppose this makes my art project a bit more serious. It's also good to know how much one is worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Al-Qaida: Bounty on Swedish cartoonist |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070915/ap_on_re_mi_ea/al_qaida_cartoonist_1 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Qaeda puts bounties on heads of Swedes |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8498/20070915/ |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918190204/http://www.thelocal.se/8498/20070915/ |archivedate=2007-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bounty set over Prophet cartoon |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6996553.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States-based [[SITE Institute]] has reported that websites run by militant Islamists have listed the names of over 100 Swedish companies with addresses, maps and logos. The websites called for their readers to boycott these firms and "take revenge" on Sweden for the publication of the drawings.&lt;ref name=site/&gt;

The [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]] (ECFR) and the [[Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe]] (FIOE) both condemned the death threats against Vilks and Johansson. ECFR also said it planned to issue a "counter [[fatwa]]" against the threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=European Muslims condemn death sentence |url=http://www.thelocal.se/8517/20070917/ |publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]] |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027165042/http://www.thelocal.se/8517/20070917/ |archivedate=2007-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Association of Newspapers]] (WAN), which represents over 18,000 newspapers around the world, issued a statement where it condemned the death threats and expressed support for ''Nerikes Allehanda'' in its right to publish the drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=WAN Backs Swedish Publishers in Freedom of Expression Dispute |publisher=[[World Association of Newspapers]] |date=2007-09-17 |url=http://www.wan-press.org/article15067.html |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">'''Liturgical [[dance]]''' is a type of dance movement sometimes incorporated into liturgies or worship services as an expression of [[worship]].

Some liturgical dance had been common in ancient times or non-western settings, with precedents in the Hebrew religion back to accounts of dancing in the [[Old Testament]]. An example is the episode when [[David|King David]] danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=david+danced&amp;qs_version=DRA 2 Sam 6:14]), but this dancing is often cited outside of [[Jewish]] norms and Rabbinic rituals prescribed at the time.

[[File:LlynCerrigBach.jpg|thumb|right|Llyn Cerrig Bach in 2007]]
'''Llyn Cerrig Bach''' is a small lake in the north-west of the island of [[Anglesey]], Wales. Its main claim to fame is the group of over 150 [[Iron Age]] metal objects discovered there in 1942, apparently placed in the lake as [[votive offering]]s. These finds are considered to be one of the most important collections of [[Celtic art|La Tène style metalwork]] discovered in the [[British Isles]], and the most important in Wales.  A recent re-assessment of the objects now sees them as a collection of different offerings deposited over a long period from about 300 BC to 100 AD, rather than a single group deposited together, as was previously thought.  Most of the items found at Llyn Cerrig Bach can usually be seen in the [[National Museum of Wales]] in [[Cardiff]], which holds all but four of the objects discovered,&lt;ref name="NationalMuseum"&gt;National Museum&lt;/ref&gt; although until November 2012 most have been loaned to the [[Oriel Ynys Môn]] museum in Anglesey.&lt;ref name="museumwales"&gt;Llyn Cerrig Bach treasures to be exhibited at Oriel Ynys Môn. Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum of Wales. [https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20120528000226/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/5/?article_id=750 Story] accessed 13 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Site==
[[File:NMW - Bronzemond.jpg|thumb|right|"Crescentic bronze plaque" in the shape of a [[gold lunula]], with [[triskele]]-like decoration]]

The discovery was made by William Owen Roberts, head groundsman of [[RAF Valley]], when ground was being cleared for a runway extension.&lt;ref name="museumwales" /&gt; This involved spreading [[peat]] over the sandy ground, and the items were discovered during the extraction of peat from the Cors yr Ynys bog on the southern margin of Llyn Cerrig Bach. The first object to be found was an iron gang chain, used for slaves. This was caught up in the teeth of a harrow and was not at first identified as being ancient. It was attached to a tractor and used to pull lorries out of the mud. Despite its age, the chain performed this function well. The slave chain is over 3 metres long, with five neck-rings to hold five captives, and weighs 6.66 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2369/ Gang Chain (Slave Chain)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608224711/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/2369/ |date=8 June 2010 }}, NOW&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the chain had been identified, a search of the area produced a large number of other objects, mainly of iron but some of [[bronze]] or copper alloy. A total of 181 artefacts are known to have been recovered, described by the National Museum as including: "seven swords, six spearheads, fragments of a shield, part of a bronze trumpet, [one further gang chain], fragments of iron wagon tyres and horse gear. In addition, blacksmith's tools, fragments of two cauldrons, iron bars for trading and animal bones were also found."&lt;ref name="NationalMuseum" /&gt; 
[[File:Llyn Cerrig Bach, view from the roadside.JPG|thumb|right|Llyn Cerrig Bach in 2010, view from the roadside]]

Many of these items had been deliberately broken and are thought to have been placed in the lake as votive offerings. Some of the items appear to have been of local manufacture, a few were manufactured in [[Ireland]], but many originate from southern England, suggesting that the fame of Llyn Cerrig Bach as a holy site may have spread well beyond the immediate area. However it is also possible that they were traded or plunder captured in warfare by the local tribes. No direct Roman influence can be seen on any of the objects found.

'''''M12,''''' aka M12 STUDIO, is an American [[artist collective]] and non-profit organization based in [[Byers, Colorado]] that features an evolving group of artist practitioners, curators, and designers.  Together they create artworks, research projects, and education programs that explore rural cultures and landscapes.  Initially formed as the ''municipalWORKSHOP'' in 2002 in [[York, Alabama]] by Richard Saxton when he was an artist-in-residence at the [[Rural Studio]], an architecture studio run by [[Auburn University]], the group evolved into M12 in 2007 when it became incorporated as a non-profit organization.  The core members have created over 20 projects since founding; their work was featured in the 2014 publication "A Decade of Country Hits: Art on the Rural Frontier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handwerker|first1=Margo|title=A decade of country hits.

==History==
'''municipalWORKSHOP (2002-2007)'''

The municipalWORKSHOP was created in 2002 by Richard Saxton based on an effort to bring a "rural renaissance" to the small town of York, Alabama.  This art laboratory aimed to work with municipalities and communities to develop more creative approaches to living in rural America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fluharty|first1=Matthew|title=Richard Saxton's Vernacular Landscapes|url=http://theruralsite.blogspot.com/2011/02/richard-saxtons-vernacular-landscapes.html?m=1|publisher=The Art Of The Rural|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's first project was called ''Utility Now!'', a series of pedal-powered street-sweepers and utility tricycles and bicycles for city crews to better maintain York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility NOW|url=http://www.ruralstudio.org/projects/utility-now|website=Rural Studio|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002-2007, the municipalWORKSHOP created public art projects with local communities throughout the United States. Projects range from a Music Integrated Kiosk Environment (M.I.K.E.) produced for the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M.I.K.E.

'''2007-present'''

M12 has exhibited at the 13th International Venice Architecture Biennale, The Kalmar Konstmuseum in Sweden, The Chicago Cultural Center, [[Franklin Street Works]], Wormfarm Institute, The 2011 Australian Biennial (SPACED), The 2010 Biennial of the Americas, The Center for Land Use Interpretation, The Ewing Gallery of Art and Architecture at the University of Tennessee, The John Michael Kohler Arts Center, The Contemporary Museum in Baltimore, Wall House #2 in the Netherlands, and The Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://m12studio.org|website=M12|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group now develops projects worldwide and operates out of a renovated feed store in Byers, Colorado and maintains a 40-acre site in Last Chance, Colorado.

==Projects==
* ''Campito'', which re-imagined the sheepherders wagon, initially commissioned by the Biennial of the Americas and subsequently featured in the Spontaneous Interventions exhibition in the U.S. Pavilion of the 13th International [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]].
* ''Prairie Modules'', an ongoing series of architectural sculptures that were first installed on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail. Subsequent modules are situated at the Wormfarm Institute in Reedsburg, Wisconsin and The Experiemental Site in Last Chance, Colorado.

The '''Madrid system''' (officially the '''Madrid system for the international registration of marks''') is the primary international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Its legal basis is the multilateral [[treaty]] ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'' of 1891, as well as the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'' (1989).

The Madrid system provides a centrally administered system of obtaining a bundle of trademark registrations in separate jurisdictions. Registration through the Madrid system does not create a unified registration, as in the case of the European Union trade mark&lt;ref&gt;Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark (Official Journal No. L78, 24.3.2009, p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; system; rather, it creates a bundle of national rights through an international registration able to be administered centrally.  Madrid provides a mechanism for obtaining trademark protection in many countries around the world which is more effective than seeking protection separately in each individual country or jurisdiction of interest.

The Madrid Protocol system provides for the international registration of trade marks by way of one application that can cover more than one country. The opportunity of having a single registration to cover a wide range of countries gives advantages, both in terms of portfolio management and cost savings, as opposed to a portfolio of independent national registrations.

Madrid now permits the filing, registration and maintenance of trade mark rights in more than one jurisdiction, provided that the target jurisdiction is a party to the system. The Madrid system is administered by the International Bureau of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. There are 90 countries part of the Madrid System.

== History and development ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system comprises two treaties; the ''Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks'',&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The full name of the Madrid Agreement is the "Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks of April 14, 1891 (as revised at [[Brussels]] on December 14, 1900, at [[Washington, DC|Washington]] on June 2, 1911, at [[The Hague]] on November 6, 1925, at [[London]] on June 2, 1934, at [[Nice]] on June 15, 1957, and at [[Stockholm]] on July 14, 1967, and as amended on September 28, 1979)".&lt;/ref&gt; which was concluded in 1891, and entered into force in 1892, and the ''Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement'', which came into operation on 1 April 1996. The Madrid Agreement and Madrid Protocol were adopted at diplomatic conferences held in [[Madrid, Spain]].

The Madrid Agreement was originally intended to provide for an international registration system, but did not achieve this for two significant reasons:

* The lack of international acceptance. Many non-member countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Central America]]n, [[South America]]n and [[Asia]]n countries, such as [[Japan]], were not adherents, which undermined recognition of the system as a truly "international" regime. Significantly, many of these countries represent the largest numbers of trademark filings and registrations in the world; and
* The mere forwarding by the International Bureau of a uniform application to member countries, rather than the registration of the applicable trademark in the national trademark registers, precludes an actual "registration" system.

Some of the large trading nations like the United States, Japan, and [[Canada]], which have a large number of filings at the national level, did not join the Madrid Agreement due to another perceived flaw in the system:  if the home registration upon which an international registration was based came under 'central attack', the international registration would be cancelled or limited to the same extent that the home registration was cancelled or limited.

During 1966 and 1967, attempts were made to address this issue by establishing a new treaty that would reflect the need of the times rather than the world of the 1890s when the agreement was adopted. This led to the drafting of the Trademark Registration Treaty (TRT) which was adopted in [[Vienna]] in 1973, and entered into effect in 1980, with five contracting states, namely, [[Burkina Faso]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Gabon]], [[Soviet Union]] and [[Togo]]. In the absence of more accessions to the TRT and the low number of registrations since its inception, it was clear that the TRT was unlikely to supplant the Madrid Agreement.

As the realization of the introduction of a multi-jurisdictional (or at least pan-European) European [[Community Trade Mark]] (CTM) approached, the relevancy of the Madrid system came under scrutiny. Pressure increased on [[WIPO]] to maintain its relevance and strengthen the agreement by increasing membership, possibly through amendments. This culminated in the introduction of the Madrid Protocol, pursuant to which a CTM registration could be a 'foundation' or 'home' registration upon which an international registration could then be established. This mechanism is referred to as a "linking provision." The Protocol, after considerable lobbying efforts by WIPO, was signed by many countries, including most of the present members of the Madrid Agreement, and some countries that are members of the European Union, but were not members of the Madrid Agreement.  The Protocol entered into force on December 1, 1995 and became operative on April 1, 1996.

Many countries have needed to modify or consider modifying their trademark laws in order to adhere to the Protocol, in addition to the modifications required by [[GATT]]-[[TRIPS]]/[[World Trade Organization|WTO]].

In Europe, resistance to the Protocol was brought by trademark attorneys who were afraid of losing business because a [[Community Trade Mark]] application could be filed directly through the Madrid Protocol process.&lt;ref name="inta042003"&gt;[http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Documents/INTAMadridProtocolUSImpact.pdf Report by the International Trademark Association, April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the proposal bogged down due to a trademark dispute between two businesses who were heavy campaign contributors to certain Congressmen, followed by a repeated reshuffling of the Senate due to elections and a subsequent defection of a Republican senator.&lt;ref name="inta042003"/&gt; The treaty was eventually ratified during the Presidency of [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf List of Members of the Madrid System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan revised its trademark law with the official acceptance of the [[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services|Nice Classification]] (an international trademark classification system for products and services), as well as applications covering service using [[service marks]]. The members of the [[European Community]] have amended their laws to conform to the [[European Community Harmonization Directive]]. In recent years trademark laws in several other countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]] have also been amended to accommodate the changes. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

== Members ==
[[File:Madrid Protocol 2018.svg|thumb|right|400px|Madrid Union members]]

{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Adherence to the convention or the protocol includes membership of the "Madrid Union." As of April 2016 there are 97 members. The original treaty has 55 members, all of which are also party to the protocol (when Algeria joined the Madrid Protocol on October 31, 2015, all of the members of the Madrid Agreement were also members of the Madrid Protocol and many of the aspects of the Madrid Agreement ceased to have practical effect).  The term 'Madrid Union' can be used to describe those jurisdictions party to either the Agreement or the Protocol (or both).&lt;ref name="wipo"&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf WIPO.int]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary reason the protocol—which has been in operation since 1996 and has 100 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/members/]&lt;/ref&gt; — is more popular than the agreement — which has been in operation for more than 110 years and has 55 members&lt;ref name="wipo" /&gt;—is that the protocol introduced a number of changes to the Madrid system which significantly enhanced its usefulness to trademark owners.

For example, under the protocol it is possible to obtain an international registration based on a pending trade mark application, so that a trade mark owner can effectively apply for international registration concurrently, or immediately after, filing an application in a member jurisdiction. By comparison, the agreement requires that the trade mark owner already holds an existing registration in a member jurisdiction, which may often take many months and sometimes years to obtain in the first place. In addition, the agreement does not provide the option to 'convert' international registrations which have been 'centrally attacked.'

== Advantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
The Madrid system provides a mechanism whereby a trademark owner who has an existing trademark application or registration (known as the 'basic application' or 'basic registration') in a member jurisdiction may obtain an 'international registration' for their trademark from the WIPO.  The trademark owner may then extend the protection afforded to the international registration to one or more member jurisdictions, a process known as 'designation'. A useful feature of the Madrid system is that this protection may generally be extended to additional jurisdictions at any time, such that international trade mark protection can be extended to new jurisdictions which subsequently join Madrid, or to such other jurisdictions as the trade mark owner may choose.

In basic terms, the primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in any or all member states by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process.

== Disadvantages ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
One disadvantage of the Madrid system is that any refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the basic application or basic registration within five years of the registration date of the international registration will lead to the refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the international registration to the same extent. For example, if a basic application covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the basic application (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by the international registration in each designated member jurisdiction will extend only to 'clothing and footwear.' If the basic application is rejected as a whole, the international registration would also be totally refused.

The process of attacking the basic application or basic registration for this purpose is generally known as 'central attack.' Under the Madrid Protocol, the effects of a successful central attack can be mitigated by transforming the international registration into a series of applications in each jurisdiction designated by the international registration, a process known as 'transformation.' Although transformation is an expensive option of last resort, the resulting applications will receive the registration date of the international registration as their filing date.

In 1997, less than half of a percent of international registrations were canceled as a result of central attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en World Intellectual Property Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost savings which usually result from using the Madrid system may be negated by the requirement to use local agents in the applicable jurisdiction if any problems arise.

== Developments since 2000 ==
{{one source|section|date=December 2016}}
Two significant recent developments in international trademark law were the accession of the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] to the Madrid Protocol on November 2, 2003, and October 1, 2004, respectively. With the addition of these jurisdictions to the protocol, most major trading jurisdictions have joined the Madrid system.

On 31 July 2015, [[Algeria]] deposited its instrument of accession and will accede to the Madrid Protocol on 31 October 2015. As Algeria was the last member of the Madrid system to adhere to the protocol, the protocol is now effective across the entire Madrid system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/news/2015/news_0016.html Algeria Joins the Madrid Protocol], ''WIPO'', 7 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahmoud Hammad''' (born 1923 in [[Jarabulus]], [[Syria]]) is a Syrian [[Painting|painter]] and pioneer of modern Syrian art

==Life and career==
He studied art at the [[Accademia di belle arti di Roma]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiabelleartiroma.it/|title=Accademia Di Belle Arti Di Roma}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1953 and 1957. He focused on the art of engraving and especially the art medals. After completing his studies he returned to [[Damascus]] in 1960 and taught as professor at the Fine Arts Faculty of Damascus since its creation. From 1970 until 1980, he became dean at the Fine Arts Faculty of Damascus.&lt;ref name="Sothebys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahmoud Hammad 'DAD' (LETTER D)|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.51.html/2015/contemporary-art-doha-do1501|website=Sothebys|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he started exhibiting his work throughout most Arab countries, Europe and the United States. In 1948, he received first prize in Arts in Damascus Exhibition, in 1957, first prize at the competition of the city of Naples, and in 1959, first prize at the competition of Ministry of Culture in United Arab Republic. In his work, Hammad uses the geometry of elementary forms to express the dynamic spirit of the Arabic letter. Among circles, squares, rectangles, determined by the color, the letter appears with liberty to end a profound silence.

His work has been shown in exhibitions at museums such as the [[Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2003/modern_art_from_the_arab_world|title=Modern Art from the Arab World  |last=Ali|first=Wijdan|date=December 2003|publisher=Nafas art magazine|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to [[Derrie Fakhoury]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Work==
Hammad uses Arabic phrases in abstract compositions. He interweaves the letters to create a mass of geometric forms.  He tries to use forms that are familiar in  Islamic culture.  This use of Arabic calligraphy as a graphic form places him within the ''Hurufiyah Art Movement.'' &lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian, [[Wijdan Ali]] describes his style of painting as 'Abstract Calligraphy' within the Hurufiyya movement. &lt;ref&gt; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Daisy Arnold''' (ca. 1873–1955) was a botanical artist who worked for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] for over thirty-five years, painting watercolors of a wide variety of fruits. She is one of the three most prolific artists whose work is now preserved in the USDA's [[Pomological Watercolor Collection]].&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt;

==Biography==
Arnold studied art in New York and began her long career with USDA in 1904, becoming part of a part of a select cadre of illustrators that included [[Deborah Griscom Passmore]], [[Amanda Newton (illustrator)|Amanda Newton]], [[Elsie Lower Pomeroy|Elsie Lower]], [[Royal Charles Steadman]], and [[J. Marion Shull]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Very little else is known about Arnold. With respect to her USDA career, this may be due partly to the fact that records of the National Personnel Record Center in St. Louis dating from before 1921 have been destroyed.&lt;ref name=jwen/&gt;

The 1060 watercolors that Arnold painted for USDA date from between 1908 and 1940.&lt;ref name=pomo/&gt; Arnold's subjects included many varieties of apples, strawberries, stone fruit, and citrus, as well as other fruits like figs, papayas, and persimmons. She also did some related work such as mounting and coloring [[lantern slides]].&lt;ref name=hd/&gt;

Arnold lived in the Washington, D.C., area. Outside of her USDA job, she painted landscapes in oil.

'''Max Rössler''' (born 1940) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[investor]] and [[Patronage|patron]].

== Life ==
Rössler attended the Kantonsschule at Burggraben in St. Gallen, where he finished his [[Matura|matriculation]]. He then studied mathematics at [[ETH Zurich]], where he co-authored a dissertation on railway computations in the field of [[Celestial mechanics|space mechanics]] in 1966 with [[Eduard Stiefel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/133750 |title=Analytische Störungstheorie im Dreikörperproblem mit Hilfe von regularisierenden Variablen |author=Max Rössler |date=1966 |publisher=ETH Zürich |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent time at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for a [[NASA]] research project to calculate space travel. Subsequently, he was a lecturer for applied mathematics and [[operations research]] at ETH [[Zürich|Zurich]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/main/news/eth-tag/dokumente/2013/131116_Laudatio_Ehrenraete_Braginsky_Haefner_Roessler.pdf |title=Laudatio für die Ehrenräte René Braginsky, Martin Haefner und Dr. Max Rössler |date=16 November 2013 |publisher=ETH Zürich |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Rössler changed to finances. He was responsible for the analysis department of fixed interest investments and the management of investment funds of CHF 12 billion at the [[Credit Suisse|Schweizerische Kreditanstalt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rsb-securities.ch/ |title=Personen Max Rössler |publisher=RSB Securities |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was responsible for financial investments of the [[Suva (insurer)|Swiss Accident Insurance Institution]] (SUVA). He successfully used his knowledge in the financial sector for his own investments, to which a considerable amount of his assets includes investments in several Swiss companies. He is the main shareholder of the Parmino Holding AG which includes the construction company [[Implenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzz.ch/der_implenia-goenner-1.4055650 |title=Der Implenia-Gönner |date=24 November 2009 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.implenia.com/de-ch/investoren/die-aktie.html |title=Kotiert an der SIX Swiss Exchange |date=6 March 2006 |publisher=Implenia |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his influence on the occupation of the Implenia management team, Rössler became well known to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/unternehmen-und-konjunktur/Weitere-Ruecktritte-bei-Implenia/story/12757256 |title=Weitere Rücktritte bei Implenia |author=Benita Vogel |date=18 February 2016 |publisher=Tages Anzeiger |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handelszeitung.ch/unternehmen/machtkampf-bei-implenia-sorgt-fuer-kritik-994450 |title=Machtkampf bei Implenia sorgt für Kritik |author=Bernhard Fischer, Marcel Speiser |date=17 February 2016 |publisher=Handelszeitung |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Rössler holds a major stake in the machine tool business Starrag Group and is a board member of other companies such as RSB Securities AG, Global Care and SunVesta Holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunvesta.com/index.php?id=39 |title=Dr. Max Rössler |publisher=SunVesta Holding |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an advisor to Swiss private banks. Rössler is a member of the Board of Trustees at the Rütli Foundation, which is affiliated to the private bank [[Reichmuth &amp; Co]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ruetli-stiftung.ch/kontakt.html |title=Stiftungsräte |publisher=Rütli-Stiftung |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Max-Rössler-Prize ==
His private wealth enabled him to [[Donation|donate]] largely. In 2009, Rössler funded the annual Max-Rössler-Prize for the support of outstanding young professors at the ETH Zurich. The prize money amounted to CHF 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethz.ch/de/forschung/wissenschaftspreise-und-veranstaltungen/roessler-preis.html |title=Rössler Preis |publisher=ETH Zürich |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major donation, together with the [[Walter Haefner]] Foundation, enabled the founding of the new Institute for Theoretical Studies at ETH Zurich 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/hochschule-eth-zuerich-gruendet-institut-fuer-theoretische-studien-id2304357.html |title=ETH Zürich gründet Institut für Theoretische Studien |date=15 May 2013 |publisher=Blick |access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''mono.kultur''''' is a quarterly magazine publishing interviews with creatives in the arts and culture in a wider sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mono.kultur Website|url=http://mono-kultur.com/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each issue features a single in-depth interview and dedicates the entire issue to the interviewee. With this radical focus on only one feature the editorial design adapts to the theme of the interview, the only constant being an unconventional [[DIN A5|DIN A5-Format]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Track Mind - Interview with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://www.imaginepub.com/one-track-mind-an-interview-with-kai-von-rabenau-of-mono.kultur-magazine|website=Imaginepub|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://hugohoppmann.com/blog/interview-with-kai-von-rabenau-mono-kultur/|website=Hugohoppmann|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avant/garde Diaries|url=https://vimeo.com/35686721|title=Frank Leder &amp; Kai von Rabenau - Ultimate Fanzine|website=Vimeo|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''mono.kultur'' was founded in 2005 in Berlin. The magazine is published in English and distributed worldwide. Founder and publisher is Kai von Rabenau. The editorial team consists of 10 independent editors and 6 more contributing editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mono.kultur Colophon|url=http://mono-kultur.com/colophon/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://hugohoppmann.com/blog/interview-with-kai-von-rabenau-mono-kultur/|website=Hugohoppmann|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Work with Kai von Rabenau|url=http://magculture.com/at-work-with-kai-von-rabenau-mono-kultur/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klanten, Mollard, and Hübner described mono.kultur in their 2011 book on Self-Publishing Culture: "Incidentally, many of mono.kultur's chosen protagonists are surprised and delighted by the scope and space of the chosen format. For once, they are encouraged to speak out about topics, interest and ideas usually glossed over in targeted lifestyle features, half-hour promo interviews, or narrow specialist publications. Complementing this rich content, the small, beautifully compact magazine is designed by a changing rosting of invitees who spice up the thematic mono.kultur with their own aesthetic interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Klanten | first1 = R. | last2 = Mollard | first2 = A. | last3 = Hübner | first3 = M. | title = [[Behind the Zines: Zines and their role as a catalyst in the evolution of media and graphic design today]] | place = Berlin | publisher = [[Gestalten Verlag]] |pages = 170–171 | date = March 2011 | isbn = 978-3-89955-336-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editorial Design==

It is a colour [[lithograph]] from 1891, probably printed in about 3,000 copies, advertising the famous dancers [[La Goulue]] and [[Valentin le désossé|"No-Bones" Valentin]], and the new [[Paris]] dance hall [[Moulin Rouge]].&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although most examples were pasted as advertising posters and lost, surviving examples are in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and many other institutions.

==Description==
''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue'' is a bold, four-color lithograph depicting the famous [[cancan]] dancer La Goulue and her flexible partner Valentine le désossé made to advertise the popular French club, Moulin Rouge. Their audience is reduced to silhouettes in order to focus attention on the performers and evoke the Japanese art then in vogue. The triple repetition of the club's name draws the focus down to the central figure of the poster, La Goulue herself.&lt;ref name="NGA"/&gt; The stark white of her petticoats, depicted with just a few lines on the white paper, epitomizes Toulouse-Lautrec's boldly simplistic style, a sharp break from the text-heavy posters of the day.&lt;ref name="IMA"/&gt;

==Historical information==
The Moulin Rouge had opened two years earlier, in 1889, and instantly established itself as a [[Montmartre]] landmark. It was renowned for the elasticity of its young dancers, both physically and morally; police officers made periodic checks to ensure that they were all wearing underwear. However, the poster by [[Jules Chéret]] advertising the club's delights, was relatively subdued, so the director [[Charles Zidler]] hired the young (only 27 years old) Toulouse-Lautrec to create a more vibrant poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toulouse-Lautrec PL. 122 Moulin Rouge - La Goulue|publisher=Yaneff International Gallery|url=http://www.yaneff.com/html/plates/pl122.html|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Moulin Rouge: La Goulue'' was Toulouse-Lautrec's first attempt at lithography, such was his grasp of the medium's possibilities that it was an immediate sensation. 3000 copies spread around Paris captivated the public with their eye-catching design, bold colors, and innovative, Japanese-inspired use of silhouettes. Cannily focusing on the dancer La Goulue, whose energetic kicks and insatiable appetites had made her famous, gave the poster an additional boost in popularity. However, it was Toulouse-Lautrec's own artistic skill that made him a star overnight.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matheny|first=Lynn Kellmanson|title=Cafés, Cabarets, and Dance Halls|publisher=[[National Gallery of Art]]|year=2005|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2005/toulouse/cafes.shtm|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native American fashion''' (also known as '''Indigenous American fashion''') encompasses the [[Fashion design|design]] and creation of high-fashion [[clothing]] and [[fashion accessories]] by the Native peoples of the [[Americas]]. Indigenous designers frequently incorporate [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] and customary materials into their wearable artworks, providing a basis for creating items for the ''[[haute couture]]'' and international fashion markets. Their designs may result from techniques such as [[beadwork]], [[quillwork]], [[leather crafting|leather]], and [[Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas|textile arts]], such as weaving, twining, and tufting. In some cases, however, they choose not to include any materials associated with indigenous cultures.

In the United States, in accordance with the [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]], in order to qualify as Native American designers, artists must be enrolled in a [[State recognized tribes in the United States|state]] or [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized tribe]] or be certified by a specified tribal council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html|title=Indian Arts and Crafts Board: The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990|date=2006-09-25|access-date=2018-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020543/http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html|archivedate=2006-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, there are no specific laws to protect [[First Nations]] iconography and traditional arts, though two [[trademark]]s, "igloo tag"  and "Genuine Cowichan Approved" have been registered to protect [[Inuit]] peoples and clothing designs for the [[Cowichan Tribes]]. In [[Latin America]] legislation is sparse, but some countries or individual states within countries with high indigenous populations have passed laws to protect indigenous heritage and design.

When Native American designers first broke into the modern fashion industry in the 1950s, they adopted a [[pan-Indian]] approach. By selecting motifs and iconography easily identified as part of indigenous culture, they were able to gain acceptance and develop a [[market share]] with mainstream buyers. As the field of Native designers in high fashion expanded, individual designers moved away from pan-Indianism, expressing their individual identity, whether or not it was based on their traditional tribal heritage. Many have taken traditional themes and incorporated them into their works, while others have taken specific garments and updated them to contemporary aesthetics by changing necklines, sleeve lengths, hemlines and other features.

Controversy has emerged over the misappropriation or inappropriate use of cultural heritage by non-Native designers. Respectful use of imagery by mainstream designers who are not indigenous can help expand appreciation of Native cultures, but plagiarism of design or  malapropos use reinforces negative stereotypes and spurs controversy. Similarly, utilizing artisan craftwork can expand awareness if designers are fairly compensated for their work and given credit for their contributions. Contemporary controversies have spurred both crowd-sourced and legislative action to protect the designs and cultural heritage of indigenous designers.

==History==
Historical clothing of Native American peoples has been collected and displayed by curators of major museums, such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], with a focus on pre-20th century attire. For the most part, these collections failed to take into consideration the shift in clothing trends among indigenous peoples brought about by [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation policies]] or by access to tailoring training and industrially produced textiles.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=66–67}}

While Native peoples have always produced clothing, until the twentieth century the garments they made were for personal or ceremonial use.{{sfn|Lieber|2016}} In 1942, the American [[anthropologist]] [[Frederic H. Douglas]], sought to highlight the beauty of Native American fashion by presenting a [[fashion show]] featuring garments made by Native Americans between 1830 and 1950.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=66–68}} During the same decade, [[Lloyd Kiva New]], a [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] who had graduated from the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] began touring throughout Europe and the United States with clothing and [[Fashion accessory|accessory]] lines he had designed, using hand-[[Weaving|woven]] and [[Dyeing|dyed]] fabrics and [[Leather crafting|leather crafts]]. In 1945, New opened a studio in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], with financial backing from Douglas,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=69}} which initially focused on belts, hats and purses. Influenced by [[Navajo]] [[medicine bag]]s, his purses, decorated with [[Jewellery|hand-worked metals]] became a specialty.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=80–81}} Recognizing the need to reduce labor costs, he began combining machine work with handcrafting and instituted an [[apprenticeship]] program to meet increasing production demands while gearing his designs for the up-scale market.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=82}}

Gaining coverage from national magazines like ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'', New began selling his bags at the [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.|Elizabeth Arden Salon]] and [[Neiman Marcus]].{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=84}} Expanding into clothing with a focus on classic cuts and simple designs using quality materials, New incorporated woven Cherokee fabrics, [[beadwork|bead-]] and [[Native American jewelry|silver-work]] into a line of coats and dresses for women and men's suits,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=85-86}} capitalizing on the luxury clothing market which emerged after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=87}} "Southwestern chic" became a national trend in the early 1950s.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=89}} In 1951, New was the only Native American designer who participated in the Atlantic City International Fashion Show, winning national recognition.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=91}} He began to consult with artists and incorporated [[silk screen]]ed fabrics using native motifs, such as [[Pima people|Pima]] [[basket weaving]] designs, [[Hopi]] [[Puebloans#Pottery|pottery]] patterns, [[Navajo]] and [[Zuni]] [[Yeii|yei elements]], drawing from a variety of tribal aesthetics. As with designers who followed him, his sacred symbols and [[iconography]] were modified to become secularized.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=37, 96–97}}

To encourage other indigenous artists to enter fashion design and safeguard cultural traditions which he feared might be lost,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=102}} in 1959 New turned his attention to education, sponsoring a summer design project, known as the Southwest Indian Arts Project. The experimental project eventually resulted in the founding by New and other artists of the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]] (IAIA) in 1962.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=108, 113}} The purpose of the school was to provide an education which fostered pride in students' indigenous heritage and featured the development of skills designed to improve their economic opportunities.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=132–133}} New taught a printed textiles course focused on dying techniques, and [[Azalea Thorpe]] (Cherokee) taught weaving.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=133}} [[Josephine Myers-Wapp]] ([[Comanche]]) was hired to instruct students in the traditional techniques used to make garments and accessories, laying the groundwork for the aesthetic appreciation of tribal traditions.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=136}} She taught students to use traditional materials like feathers, leather and shells, and methods including beadwork, [[ribbonwork]] and weaving to create garments.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=155–156}} By 1965, IAIA was hosting local fashion shows and within three years, the students had begun showing their works in other venues in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and New York.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=139–140}} Within ten years, the reputation of the textile design programs at the school had gained international acclaim.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=147}}
[[File:Gilberto_Ortiz.jpg|alt=Gilberto Ortiz in 2015.|left|thumb|Gilberto Ortiz in 2015.]]

In Mexico, before 1950 many indigenous communities were isolated and produced their own traditional clothing. As roads improved and people began moving from the countryside to cities, many put aside their traditional clothing, to blend in with their new cosmopolitan neighbors.{{sfn|Gómez|2011}} In 1965, [[Gilberto Ortiz]] ([[Mixtec]]) moved from [[San Andrés Lagunas]], Oaxaca, to [[Mexico City]] and began training as a tailor under German businessman, José Schroeder. Acquiring traditional European styling, his first major client was movie icon, [[María Félix]]. In 1978, Ortiz left Schroeder and partnered with the Italian businessman, Edmundo Calanchini. He designed mainly for businessmen and politicians until 1997, when he opened his own shop aimed specifically at the haute couture market. In 2006, at the suggestion of his client [[Juan Gabriel]], Ortiz launched his own label, ''Gioros'', an acronym using the first two letters of each of his names, Gilberto Ortiz Osorio. In 2012, he was named one of the top three tailors in the world by the textile firm [[Scabal]]. Typically Ortiz produces classically-styled garments using high-end fabrics, but his latest offering in 2017 featured men's and women's jeans.{{sfn|Martínez|2014}}{{sfn|Kemchs|2017}}{{sfn|''El Diario de Chihuahua''|2017}}

In the 1960s, [[Frankie Welch]] (self-identified [[List of people of self-identified Cherokee ancestry|Eastern Cherokee]] descent) began working as a fashion consultant to Washington's elite. After purchasing goods others made for her clients, she decided to capitalize on the rapport she had built and opened a store in 1963 at 305 Cameron St. in [[Old Town Alexandria|Old Town]]. Most noted for scarves, such as her [[Cherokee syllabary]] design, she supplied [[List of First Ladies of the United States|First Ladies]] [[Pat Nixon]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Rosalynn Carter]], and [[Nancy Reagan]] with accessories. Welch also created dresses for the First Ladies, including a 1974 brocade gown for Betty Ford which was part of the 2016 ''Native Fashion Now'' tour. The green silk gown, which she also designed for Ford, is on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s First Ladies' Hall in the [[National Museum of American History]].{{sfn|Mansfield|1990}}{{sfn|Metcalfe|2012a}}{{sfn|Indursky|2017}}

During the 1970s, other Native American designers began to make a name for themselves during the [[1970s in Western fashion|Indian and Natural movements]], such as Jewel Gilham ([[Blackfeet]]) and Remonia Jacobsen ([[Otoe]]-[[Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma|Iowa]]).{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=199}} Gilham catered to working women, designing [[pantsuit]]s and long dresses made of polyester fabrics with felt insets depicting geometric figures and native motifs.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=199}}{{sfn|''The Missoulian''|1973|p=5}}{{sfn|''The Daily Inter Lake''|1977|p=14}} Jacobsen's work featured loose-fitting dresses featuring decorative techniques, such as embroidered [[ribbonwork]] in the Otoe and Iowa style, [[appliqué]] drawing on [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma|Seminole]] traditions, [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] [[leggings]] patterned on Kiowa designs, as well as influences from Pueblo and Sioux decorative silhouettes.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=214}} Fueled by the [[American Indian Movement|American Indian]] and [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Counterculture|countercultural consumers]] found appeal in Gilham and Jacobsen's work. Furthermore, their fashion fostered a [[Pan-Indianism|pan-Indian]] unity in the quest for political power through self-expression.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=216}}

==1975 to 1990==
When Josephine Wapp retired in 1975, [[Sandy Fife Wilson]] ([[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Muscogee]]) took over instruction of her traditional techniques course and offered "Traditional and Contemporary Fashion Design" to include current fashion trends.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=151}}{{sfn|Brown|2016}} Fife's students formed the Full Moon Fashions group and began targeting non-native women as prospective buyers for their products.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=152}} In 1982, when [[Wendy Ponca]] ([[Osage Nation|Osage]]){{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=86}} took over the fashion design courses at the IAIA, she renamed them [[fiber art]]s in accordance with other accredited university curricula, offering three levels of instruction.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=159}} She founded the Waves of the Earth Fashion Group and required her students to participate in the fashion shows of the IAIA, giving them an opportunity to show their creations and discover how to market their works.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=161–162}} Ponca changed the direction of Native American fashion{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=159}} by allowing the designers to determine whether their works would include traditional influences and media.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=160}} She taught them garment design, structural integrity, and color theory, but allowed students to interpret how they used the lessons.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=160-161}} Ponca's approach was to ignore demands to make designs fit stereotypical definitions of indigenous identity. Instead she encouraged creativity{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=165}} and innovation, like utilizing [[mylar]], a space-age material to create designs which reflected the Osage connection with the sky.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=169}}

The fashion show of the [[Santa Fe Indian Market]], hosted for nearly two decades by fashion expert, [[Jeri Ah-be-hill]] ([[Kiowa]]), quickly became another venue to showcase the students' work,{{sfn|Haywood|2015}}{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=165}} using the body as a venue to display designs, rather than galleries.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=165}} ''Native Uprising'', initially called ''Native Influx'' was founded in the 1980s as a collaborative association of indigenous artists, designers, and models, who were alumni of IAIA, with the express purpose of building a contemporary, Native fashion design movement and allowing members to profit from their fashion shows.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=177–179}} With New as an advisor and Ponca as the coordinator, the group included many members who made a name for themselves in fashion, for example [[Marcus Amerman]] ([[Choctaw]]), who acted as the stage director{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=180, 258}} and [[RoseMary Diaz]] ([[Santa Clara Pueblo]]), who majored in fashion design and creative writing, before turning to writing about fashion.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=163}}

In 1981, [[Margaret Wood (fashion designer)|Margaret Wood]] ([[Navajo Nation|Navajo]]/[[Seminole]]) of Arizona, known for fashion design as well as for her [[quilt]]s,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2016|pp=126–128}} published ''Native American Fashion: Modern Adaptations of Traditional Designs''.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=217}} The book was the first treatment of contemporary Native American fashion and remains the sole in-depth treatment of the subject.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=218}} Also in the 1980s, indigenous designers like Luanne Belcourt ([[Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation|Chippewa-Cree]]) and Myrtle Raining Bird (Chippewa-Cree) operated their company ''Sitting Eagles'', marketing custom-made garments on their reservation to high-end buyers.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=228–229}} [[Jeanette Ferrara]] ([[Isleta Pueblo]]) opened a design studio known for coats and vests incorporating cotton, wool, and velvet, and [[Ardina Moore]] ([[Quapaw]]-[[Osage Nation|Osage]]) founded ''Buffalo Sun'' in Oklahoma in 1983.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=228}} [[Geraldine M. Sherman|Geraldine Sherman]] ([[Rosebud Indian Reservation|Lakota]]) designed for non-native marketer and anthropologist [[Helene Hagan]] to produce garments featuring Native American iconography. Hagan marketed them, stressing their spiritual and symbolic meaning.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=228}}{{sfn|Leighty|1986}}

[[File:Jeri_Ah-be-Hill_at_the_Santa_Fe_Indian_Market_2014.jpg|thumb|[[Jeri Ah-be-hill]] at the Santa Fe Indian Market 2014. Demonstration of the difference in dance regalia and experimental fashion.]]
Healthcare professional and fashion designer, [[Marjorie Bear Don't Walk]] ([[Chippewa]]-[[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Salish]]) designed high-end couture for working women and displayed her fashions featuring appliqué techniques at conferences. Shed ran a [[mail order]] business, allowing customers to provide her with their preferred materials which she then worked into her designs.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=233}} In 1984, [[Selina Curley]] ([[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|Apache]]-Navajo) founded a design firm, Traditions by Selina, aimed at preserving the traditions of her heritage. Her typical designs are based on the Apache camp dress with a full, ankle-length skirt and long sleeves.{{sfn|Silversmith|2013}}{{sfn|Walker|2013}}

The [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]], located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, hosted ''Talking Threads: Contemporary Native American Fashions'' in 1986. The exhibit featured designs by [[Joyce Begay-Foss]] (Navajo), Loretta Tah-Martin ([[Plains Apache|Apache]]-[[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca]]) and [[Michelle Tsosie Naranjo]] (Santa Clara-Navajo-[[Laguna Pueblo]]-Mission), among others.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=230}} The following year, the [[Red Earth Festival]] was established in [[Oklahoma City]], showcasing creations by non-native designer [[Michael Kors]], along with [[Phyllis Fife]] (Muscogee), to demonstrate that Native clothing was part of mainstream fashion. Fife was part of a group of native designers known as the ''Fashion Drums of Red Earth'', who have made the fashion show of the Red Earth Festival an annual event, demonstrating that native clothing is wearable for every day and not simply as ceremonial costuming.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=231–232}} Also in 1987, [[Patta Joest]] (Choctaw) established her firm Patta LT with the label ''Dancing Rabbit'', to create high-fashion, producing contemporary garments with design elements from [[Southeastern Woodland]] tribal heritage. They included Cherokee tear dresses and [[Seminole patchwork]] vests, incorporating features such as [[Plains Tribes]]-style beadwork. Her line also included innovative bras and [[lingerie]] as well as [[broomstick skirt]]s.{{sfn|Baca|1999|pp=52–53}}

The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]]. It specified that for artists to market their works as Native American, they must be enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe or be certified by a tribal council as a member and must disclose their affiliated tribe.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=16}} The law aimed to curtail the misappropriation of Native American designs by non-Natives wishing to capitalize on the indigenous market. For indigenous Americans, their symbols, such as the [[War bonnet|headdress]] have ceremonial and sacred properties. Inappropriate use of such objects, like the 2014 ''[[Next Top Model]]'' use of the headdress for non-Native models and its use in Dallas by [[Chanel]] for their ''Métiers d'Art'' show, were all too frequent occurrences. Though the law made it illegal to sell items by those not affiliated as a tribe member, little could be done when designs, symbols, or names were usurped. The law, written to protect the tribes and their cultures as a whole, does not cover individuals, with the result that there is no protection for the works of fashion designers. As part of their tribal tradition, symbols of various tribes are not typically [[trademarked]], but one exception is the name "Navajo", which was legally trademarked in 1943.{{sfn|Lieber|2016}}

Soon after the change to US law, public debate in Canada over protection of intellectual property rights became a media topic. There are no Canadian laws which specifically protect against cultural appropriation. The government utilizes international agreements to uphold their fiduciary responsibility to First Nations. As in the US, laws cover communities as a whole and not individual copyright and it is difficult for indigenous peoples to prevent misappropriation of their names and symbols. Most protections that exist are to protect economic rather than heritage rights. In two cases, trademarks have been obtained to protect Native artists. Since 1959, the "igloo tag" may be used only by [[Inuit]] people to protect their works. The [[Cowichan Tribes|Cowichan Band Council]] has registered "Genuine Cowichan Approved" as a mark specifically for clothing designs.{{sfn|Udy|2015}}

==1991–2010==
The 1990s saw a split in the Native American fashion design styles, with one group pursuing simple silhouettes with defined, smooth transitions between fabric lines, while the other group focused on [[avant-garde]] indigenous couture. Among those who favored classic, clean-lines were [[Betty David]] ([[Spokane Tribe|Spokane]]),{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}} known for her [[shearling coat]]s;{{sfn|Phinney|2005}} [[Dorothy Grant]] ([[Haida people|Haida]]),{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}} who trained at [[Vancouver]]'s Helen Lefeaux School of Fashion Design and whose work includes images of flora and fauna of the [[Pacific Northwest]], [[formline art]] and basketry designs;{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Deerchild|2016}} and [[Penny Singer]] (Navajo),{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}} who added photographic images on fabric to her traditional men's and women's shirts and accessories decorated with beads and ribbon work.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z043}}{{sfn|López|2007|p=Z074}} [[Virgil Ortiz]] ([[Cochiti Pueblo]]) and Grant were the first Native American fashion designers to exhibit at an event in Manhattan. They held a show together at the Mercedes-Benz [[New York Fashion Week]] in 2009,{{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=84}} though Ortiz's work generally is known as more cutting-edge and noted for incorporating colors, shapes, and symbols from pottery in his fashion design.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z043}} [[Angela DeMontigny]] (Chippewa-Cree-[[Métis]]) of southwestern [[Ontario]], a Canadian First Nation designer, also followed the classic traditional lines, with edgy elements based initially on leather and suede garments before branching into jewelry and accessories.{{sfn|Falcon|2009}}{{sfn|''West of the City Magazine''|2016}}

In 1991, [[D’Arcy J. Moses]] ([[Pehdzeh Ki First Nation|Pehdzeh Ki]]), whose bold colors and designs featuring beaver and other furs were carried in high-end retail stores like [[Holt Renfrew]], Neiman Marcus and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], signed a contract with the Fur Council of Canada to help them improve their image, drawing anger from [[anti-fur]] activists. While the contract provided a steady income, the controversy created a distraction from his work.{{sfn|Busch|2015}}{{sfn|Nadeau|2005|p=186}} Other indigenous designers from the era included the master weaver [[Margaret Roach Wheeler]] ([[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma|Choctaw]]-[[Chickasaw Nation|Chickasaw]]), who earned a master's degree in art at [[Pittsburg State University]] in Kansas, under the tutelage of [[Marjorie Schick]];{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Monks|2016|pp=72–73}} [[Sean McCormick]] (Métis), who began designing [[footwear]] in the early 1990s and in 2008, launched ''Manitobah Mukluks'';{{sfn|Falcon|2009}}{{sfn|Sinopoli|2015}} and [[Virginia Yazzie Ballenger]] (Navajo), New Mexican designer,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2013|p=Z042}}{{sfn|Hardin-Burrola|Sarath|Rosebrough|2017|p=122}} most noted for her "fluted broomstick skirt and matching velveteen blouse".{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=237}} Aresta LaRusso founded ''Deerwater Design'' in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in 1994 featuring items made of traditional silk or wool fabrics and deer or elk skin. To update her contemporary patterning, she used zebra and impala hide, decorated with beadwork, fringe and silver.{{sfn|Reid|1999|pp=31,35}}{{sfn|''The Arizona Republic''|2002|p=78}}

Wendy Ponca, one of the leaders of the avant-garde group, left IAIA in 1993. After she was replaced by [[Pearl Sunrise]] (Navajo), a noted weaver, the fashion curricula at IAIA was eliminated in 1995,{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|pp=188, 242}} though momentum for high fashion works produced by native designers was rising.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=190}} Among Ponca's students at IAIA in the 1990s were the designers [[Pilar Agoyo]] ([[Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo]]-[[Cochiti Pueblo]]-[[Kewa Pueblo]]), who worked on costuming for several films, including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008) and [[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]] (2012),{{sfn|Avila|2015}} and [[Patricia Michaels]] ([[Taos Pueblo]]), who went on to take second place in season 11 of ''[[Project Runway]]''.{{sfn|Livingston|2013}} Her women's jacket titled "Weathered Text: No Trespassing by the Taos War Chief." won the Best of Class award in the textiles category at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2010.{{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=86}}  Another of Ponca's students, Brenda Wahnee ([[Comanche]]), developed her own line ''Com-N-Acha'', featuring fashion forward designs. Her works were featured in 2003 at the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] Fest party.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=242}}{{sfn|Begley|2003}} Tazbah Gaussoin 
([[Picuris Pueblo]]-Navajo), Consuelo Pascual (Navajo-[[Maya peoples|Maya]]), and Rose Bean Simpson (Santa Clara Pueblo) were other Ponca students who began making a name in fashion circles in the 1990s.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=246}}

Since 1995, the [[Canadian Aboriginal Festival]] (CANAB) has hosted a fashion show of [[First Nations]] designers. Dave Jones ([[Garden River First Nation|Garden River Ojibwe]]), began producing an annual fashion show for the Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards (CAMA) in 2001.{{sfn|Willmott|2016|p=187}}{{sfn|Durnan|2013}} By 2008, the CANAB Festival featured six fashion shows, as well as booths for designers to exhibit their wares.{{sfn|Willmott|2016|p=188}} In 1998, the [[Denver Art Museum]] hosted a fashion show, ''Indian Chic'' featuring the works of Dorothy Grant, Wendy Ponca and Margaret Roach Wheeler. It was the first time a major museum had shown works in their collection of indigenous garments, labeling them as "fashion".{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=243}} Other Native designers of the 2000s include [[Orlando Dugi]] (Navajo), [[Dallin Maybee]] ([[Northern Arapaho]]-[[Seneca Nation of Indians|Seneca]]), [[Connie Gaussoin]] (Navajo-[[Picuris Pueblo]]), the street style of [[Douglas Miles]] of Apache Skateboards ([[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos Apache]]-[[Akimel O'odham]]) and the custom shoes of [[Louie Gong]] ([[Nooksack people|Nooksack]]-[[Squamish Nation|Squamish]]).{{Sfn|Metcalfe|2012b|p=85}} Dugi is self-taught in fashion, learning to sew, measure and create patterns from online resources.{{Sfn|Bennett-Begaye|2015|p=95}} [[Jamie Okuma]] ([[Luiseño]]-[[Fort Hall Indian Reservation|Shoshone-Bannock]]), another self-taught artist, became the youngest person to earn the Best of Show ribbon at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2000.{{sfn|Grinberg|2013}}{{sfn|Indyke|2001}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/arts-entertainment/native-american-fashions-best-of-the-best-hit-the-runway-in-santa-fe-30-photos/|title=Native American Fashion's Best of the Best Hit the Runway in Santa Fe [30 Photos] – Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the turn of the 21st century, there has been a resurgence in [[Latin America]] for indigenous designs. The trend has been to partner with indigenous communities of [[artisans]] to create fabrics for non-native designers.{{sfn|Aconcha|2014}}{{sfn|Resnik|2016}}{{sfn|Castellanos Usigli|2016}}{{sfn|Campos L.|2016}}{{sfn|Contacto Hoy|2017}} In many countries, the indigenous heritage is seen as part of the national identity and there was little recognition that the design elements non-Native designers used and modified were part of the intellectual property of indigenous communities. Designers often used remnants of textiles or cut out embroidery on one garment to use on another. Imitations of indigenous designs were ordered from labor markets in Asia. After 2010, the trend began to change with slow recognition that original indigenous designs and designers should be respected.{{sfn|Gómez|2011}} One innovator in this period was Franklin Janeta ([[Puruhá]]), of [[Riobamba]], Ecuador, who began working as an [[embroidery]] artisan as a child, and in 2000 opened Vispu, a store to market his designs. Modifying traditional clothing styles, he altered components like [[necklines]] and sleeve length to create more contemporary fashions.{{sfn|''El Telégrafo''|2017}} Around the same time, [[Eliana Paco Paredes]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]) of Bolivia began to design fashions based on the traditional costumes of the ''[[Cholo#Bolivia|cholitas]]'', using wool or [[Aguayo (cloth)|aguayo]] fabrics, but fusing them with lace or silk and decorating them with rhinestones and sequins. In 2016, after showing her work at Bolivian Fashion Week, she was invited to participate in New York Fashion Week.{{sfn|''Prensa Libre''|2016}}

In 2005, the IAIA with support from the [[W. K. Kellogg Foundation]], sponsored ''Tribal Fusions'', as a cross-cultural fashion endeavor, uniting designers from Africa with Marcus Amerman, Dorothy Grant, Patricia Michaels and Virginia Yazzie Ballenger for the annual fashion show at the Santa Fe Indian Market. It was a unique opportunity for designers from diverse indigenous populations to share designs and methods of economic empowerment.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=258}} In 2009, [[Jessica Metcalfe]] ([[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians|Chippewa]]), a scholar who earned her doctorate from the University of Arizona, created a fashion [[blog]] called "Beyond Buckskin".{{sfn|Ross|2017}} Metcalfe used the blog to promote Native American designers, to talk about how they fit into popular culture and also to hold companies accountable when they attempted to appropriate Native culture.{{sfn|Grinberg|2013}} The following year, Patricia Michaels formed ''UNRESERVED Alliance'', in an attempt to ensure that Native American fashion designers were represented at [[New York Fashion Week]].{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=263}} Similarly to Native Uprising founded two decades previously, the collective of designers aimed through collaboration to improve inclusion of indigenous artists.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=339}}

As Native American designers recognized that marketing to indigenous peoples alone limited their business sustainability, they increasingly created clothing which is derived from their cultural heritage but has been adapted to appeal to a larger aesthetic. Early designers tended to approach fashion from a pan-Indian perspective, but contemporary indigenous designers often "stay within the realm of their own traditional tribal or regional clothing techniques".{{sfn|Metcalfe|2010|p=354}} In 2012, Kelly Holmes ([[Cheyenne River Lakota]]), a former model, founded ''[[Native Max]]'', "the first Native American fashion magazine".{{sfn|Lieber|2016}} Jessica Metcalf ([[Turtle Mountain Chippewa]]), who wrote the "Beyond Buckskin" blog opened a fashion boutique in [[Gardena, North Dakota]], that same year.{{sfn|Ross|2017}} Metcalfe, along with photographer Anthony Thosh Collins and designer [[Bethany Yellowtail]] ([[Northern Cheyenne]]-[[Crow Nation|Crow]]) created a compilation of fashion called ''Beyond Buckskin Lookbook'' which she says is the "first compilation of modern Native fashion produced exclusively by Natives".{{sfn|Grinberg|2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-bethany-yellowtail-los-angeles-designer-20170609-htmlstory.html|title=Meet Bethany Yellowtail, a Native American fashion designer who's inspiring a whole generation of women|last=Paniogue|first=Tara|work=latimes.com|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ecuador]], [[Lucía Guillín]] ([[Puruhá]]) launched ''Churandy'' featuring the dress styles of indigenous Andes communities with contemporary modifications in 2012. Her clothing lines have expanded to include blouses, jackets and shorts featuring embroidery patterns and colors typical to the region.{{sfn|Alvarado|2015}} The same year, Sisa Morocho (Puruhá) also launched her design company ''Sumak Churay'' in [[Quito]], after studying fashion at the Ana MacAulife Institute. Her father's death had prompted her to leave the family hat business and branch out on her own. Using motifs from the Puruhá culture and adorning them with beads, embroidery and sequins on brightly colored fabrics, she first sold blouses and then became known for dresses. In 2015, Morocho was able to open a second store featuring her designs in Riobamba.{{sfn|Márquez|2017}}{{sfn|Mendieta T.|2017}} In 2013, [[Victoria Kakuktinniq]] (Inuit) founded ''Victoria's Arctic Fashion'' to market her designs. She creates fur and leather winterwear goods including headbands, jackets, [[gloves]] and [[parkas]], using sealskin and decorated with fox cuffs and embroidery.{{sfn|''Indian Country Today''|2017}}{{sfn|Tamoto|2013}} In 2015 Kakuktinniq won the Business of the Year award from the Nunavut annual trade show.{{sfn|Zerehi|2016}}

The Italian designing firm, [[Ermenegildo Zegna]], opened a fashion institute in 2016, in the [[Azcapotzalco]] neighborhood of [[Mexico City]] with the goal of teaching the techniques of design to indigenous women. Students enrolled were members of the [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Otomi people|Otomí]], [[Purépecha]], [[Trique people|Triqui]] and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] ethnic groups. The training the women received focused on [[tailoring]] techniques rather than on native design elements in an effort to allow the women to move from craftwork into the high fashion market.{{sfn|Hernández|2016}} That same year, Nala Peter (Inuit) began making sealskin bras and [[panties]] at the suggestion of her partner, marketing them on line and was invited to participate in the ''Floe Edge: Contemporary Art and Collaborations'' exhibition in [[Nunavut]]. Another exhibitor at the show was Nicole Camphaug (Inuit), who designs footwear with sealskin and fur heals and vamps.{{sfn|McCue|2016}}{{sfn|''Indian Country Today''|2017}}
 
In 2016, a major traveling exhibit, "Native Fashion Now," which traveled to venues from the [[Peabody Essex Museum]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], to [[Philbrook Museum of Art]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], to the [[Portland Art Museum]] in Oregon to the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[George Gustav Heye Center|National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Manhattan]], put the spotlight on contemporary Native American fashion. Featuring designs from 75 fashion designers from throughout Canada and the United States, the exhibit presented a range of styles and designs from diverse cultures, such as Alano Edzerza ([[Tahltan Nation]]), [[Maya Stewart]] (Chickasaw-Muscogee-Choctaw) and Bethany Yellowtail (Northern Cheyenne-Crow), among others.{{sfn|Lieber|2016}}{{Sfn|Lefevre|2016|p=20}} Becki Bitternose (George Gordon), who designs jackets and coats from Pendleton blankets, was featured at the 2016 New York Fashion Week.{{sfn|Latimer|2016}} [[File:Santa_Fe_Indian_Market_fashion_show_2015.jpg|alt=Contemporary Native American Fashion Show at the 2015 Santa Fe Indian Market.|left|thumb|Contemporary Native American Fashion Show at the 2015 Santa Fe Indian Market.]]

[[Vancouver]] hosted its first Indigenous Fashion Week in 2017 with designs from numerous First Nations designers, including [[Sho Sho Esquiro]] &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ([[Kaska Dena]]-Cree), known for elaborately decorated gowns, enhanced with fur, beaver tail, salmon skin, feathers and shells combined with gold trim; Evan Ducharme (Métis), whose work focuses on sustainable and Eco-friendly design{{sfn|Collie|2017}} and incorporates Métis elements like knotted belts based on fishing net techniques;{{sfn|Narang|2017}} [[Jeneen Frei Njootli]] ([[Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation|Vuntut Gwitchin]]), who presented a collection using innovative design incorporating fur and hides; [[Autum Jules]] ([[Teslin Tlingit Council|Tlingit]]), noted for her use of textures and color to reflect the connection between people and the earth; [[Tyler-Alan Jacobs]], ([[Squamish Nation|Squamish]]) whose designs reflect his identity as a [[two-spirit]] artist; and Alano Edzerza ([[Tahltan First Nation|Tahltan]]), known as a multi-media artist whose work incorporates silk-screened images of Native iconography on his garments.{{sfn|Collie|2017}} Jill Setah ([[Yunesit'in]]) participated in the Vancouver event, after having showcased her works at both Oxford Fashion Week and [[Paris Fashion Week]].{{sfn|Narang|2017}} [[Tishynah Buffalo]] ([[Gordon First Nation|George Gordon]]), who lives in [[Alberta]], Canada, was invited to participate in [[London Fashion Week]] in 2017, to showcase her innovative designs which often use [[Hudson's Bay point blanket|Pendleton blanket]]s and are decorated with beadwork and Cree floral patterns.{{sfn|Bell|2017}} [[Helen Oro]], ([[Pelican Lake First Nation|Pelican Lake]]), who designs fashion accessories, also participated in the event.

Non-Native companies and individuals have attempted to use Native American motifs and names in their clothing designs.{{sfn|Gilger|2011}} As early as the 1940s, Anglo designers in the United States had developed a type of one and two-piece dresses called "[[squaw dress]]es."{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=374-375}} These outfits were based on Mexican and Navajo skirts and Western Apache camp dresses.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=375}} The dresses, also known as Fiesta, Kachina, Tohono or Patio Dresses "represented both idealized femininity and Americanness because of their Native American origins."{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=375}} These dresses, knowingly appropriating Indigenous styles, were considered a "fashion sensation" of the time, according to the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16626059/arizona_daily_star/|title=Even Ike's Mamie Wears Squaw Dresses From Dolores' Shop|last=Roth|first=Bernie|date=1954-10-17|work=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-17|pages=20|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navajo style that influenced the creation of Squaw Dresses was itself an adaptation of European styles by Navajo women.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=384}} The bodice of a Squaw Dress drew from Western Apache and Tohono O'odham styles.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=385}} Squaw dresses were popular in the United States for around 20 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arizonasonoranewsservice.com/the-squaw-dress-tucsons-controversial-but-unique-fashion-history/|title=The squaw dress: Tucson’s controversial but unique fashion history|last=Driver|first=Maggie|date=21 April 2016|website=Arizona Sonora News|language=en-US|archive-url=http://arizonasonoranewsservice.com/the-squaw-dress-tucsons-controversial-but-unique-fashion-history/|archive-date=8 January 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original "designer" of the Squaw Dress was [[Dolores Gonzales]] of Tucson, Arizona.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gonzales herself said of her dresses, "I didn't design them; I lifted them.

[[Urban Outfitters]] created a collection in 2011 called "Navajo," featuring underwear, hats and other items with art based on traditional [[Navajo weaving|Navajo rugs]]. The [[Navajo Nation]] responded by issuing a cease and desist on their use of the word "Navajo".{{sfn|Gilger|2011}} Pop band [[No Doubt]] released a 2012 video featuring stereotypical images of the [[American frontier]] and ended up pulling the video and issuing an apology.{{sfn|Grinberg|2014}}{{sfn|Sinha-Roy|2012}} [[Victoria's Secret]] clothed a model in a "Native-inspired" bikini and giant war headdress at their fashion show that same year.{{sfn|Bhasin|2015}} Victoria's Secret was again accused of cultural appropriation in their 2017 fashion show, which featured outfits inspired by traditional Native fashion.{{sfn|Matera|2017}}

In 2015, the [[Congress of Oaxaca]] passed legislation to "award Cultural and Intangible Heritage status to the designs, costumes, and handicrafts, as well as the languages spoken by the Indigenous peoples in the state", after a French firm ''Antiquite Vatic'' attempted to claim a copyright on the designs of artisans from the [[Mixe]] community of [[Santa María Tlahuitoltepec]].{{sfn|''Telesur''|2016a}} The following year, indigenous designers from [[Panama]], who were part of the [[Guna people|Ipeti Guna community]], backed by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Trade sought legal action against textile companies who were misappropriating their [[Mola (art form)|molas]], which have governmental protection for the Guna designers as the only "genuine producers" of the cloth.{{sfn|''Telesur''|2016b}} Another action in 2016, found designers in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico, circulating a petition via [[Change.org]] to demand that fashion designers stop plagiarizing their work. The designs from [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] designers from [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]] were misappropriated by the Argentine fashion house ''Rapsodia''.{{sfn|''Telesur''|2016a}}

In 2017, Parisian designer [[Christian Louboutin]] drew criticism for paying [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatec]] [[Maya peoples|Maya]] artisans only 238 pesos (around $13 US) each for bags he sold for around $28,000 pesos (equivalent to $1,550 US). The controversy was sparked when activists called out Louboutin for exploiting the artisans. He paid for all of their materials and paid the workers 478 pesos per day for 6 hours of work, which compares to the average Mexican salary in the region of 80 pesos for 8 hours of work per day. The artisans were thankful for the work and the monies they received, but Louboutin's firm pulled the page advertising the bags from his website.{{sfn|Escobar|Rodríguez|2017}}{{sfn|Fregoso|2017}} That same year, the Peruvian textile company Kuna withdrew a collection after complaints that the company had misappropriated ''kené'' designs from the [[Shipibo-Conibo people]]. The controversy motivated [[Peruvian congress|Congresswoman]] [[Tania Pariona]] to introduce legislation to protect the cultural heritage and symbols of indigenous communities in Peru.{{sfn|''La Vanguardia''|2017}}

Another issue in regard to Native American fashion is the [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] representation of Indigenous peoples' clothing in mass media depictions.{{Sfn|Leavitt|Covarrubias|Perez|Fryberg|2015|p=40}} Native Americans are portrayed most often in historical contexts wearing traditional clothing.{{Sfn|Leavitt|Covarrubias|Perez|Fryberg|2015|p=40}}

'''''Parade de cirque''''' (English: '''''Circus Sideshow''''') is a 1887-88 [[Neo-Impressionist]] painting by [[Georges Seurat]]. It was first exhibited at the 1888 [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon de la Société des Artistes Indépendants]] (titled ''Parade de cirque'', cat. no. 614) in Paris, where it became one of Seurat's least admired works. ''Parade de cirque'' represents the sideshow (or parade) of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, and was his first depiction of a nocturnal scene,&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Kahn. ''Seurat''. L'art moderne 11 (April 5, 1891), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; and first painting of popular entertainment. Seurat worked on the theme for nearly six years before completing the final painting.

Art historian Alfred H. Barr Jr. described ''Parade de cirque'' as one of Seurat's most important paintings, its 'formality' and 'symmetry' as highly innovative, and placed it as "the most geometric in design as well as the most mysterious in sentiment" of Seurat's major canvases.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Alfred H. Barr Jr., ''First Loan Exhibition: Cézanne, Gauguin, Seurat, van Gogh''. Exhibition catalogue, Museum of Modern Art. New York, 1929, pp. 25–26, 43, no. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

''Circus Sideshow'' influenced the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Cubism|Cubists]], [[Futurism|Futurists]] and [[Orphism (art)|Orphists]]. It is located at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York (Bequest of Stephen C. Clark, 1960, accession number: 61.101.17, Gallery 826).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/437654 Georges Seurat, ''Circus Sideshow (Parade de cirque)'', Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Circus Sideshow'' is a large oil painting on canvas measuring {{convert|99.7|xx|149.9|cm}}. Painted in the [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style, the work employs [[Pointillism|pointillist]] dots of color (primarily violet-gray, blue-gray, orange, and green) and a play of lines governed by rules whose laws Seurat had studied.&lt;ref name="Rewald, 1943"&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1265747W/Georges_Seurat Rewald, John, ''Georges Seurat'', Wittenborn and Company, New York, 1943]&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts immobile figures outdoors under artificial lighting at the sideshow of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, a working-class quarter in eastern Paris.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/GeorgesSeurat18591891 Robert L. Herbert, ''Georges Seurat, 1859-1891'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1991], pp. 340-345, archive.org (full text online)&lt;/ref&gt; A row of cornet and trombone players in solemn formation are seen under the unreal evening lights of a ''parade''. The work is dominated by a monotony of horizontal and vertical lines, suggesting the rhythms of Egyptian reliefs and frescoes.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;Michael F. Zimmermann. ''Seurat and the Art Theory of His Time''. Antwerp, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Though rather than indicating distance as Egyptian art (by changing scale), or classically (by foreshortening), Seurat establishes the position of his subjects through lighting. Those in the foreground are unlit, painted in dark blue, while those behind the gas jets are brilliantly lit.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

[[File:Georges Seurat, Parade de cirque, with golden mean overlay.jpg|thumb|250px|''Parade de cirque'' with [[Golden ratio|golden mean]] overlay, showing a close approximation to the divine proportion]]
Seurat's view of this scene is so radically flattened that it is difficult to identify the composition's multiple levels.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt; The [[Golden ratio|golden section]] appears to govern its geometric structure,&lt;ref name="Zimmermann" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;André Lhote, Encyclopédie française. Vol. 16, part 1, ''Arts et littératures dans la société contemporaine''. Paris, 1935, p. 16.30-7, ill. pp. 16.30-6, 16.31-7&lt;/ref&gt; though modern consensus among art historians is that Seurat never used this ''divine proportion'' in his work.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Herz-Fischler. ''An Examination of Claims Concerning Seurat and The Golden Number''. Gazette des beaux-arts, 6th ser., 101 (March 1983), pp. 109–12 n. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Neveux. ''Construction et proportion: apports germaniques dans une theorie de la peinture franchise de 1850 a 1950''. Université de Paris (Ph.D. diss.), 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The final study of ''Parade'', executed prior to the oil on canvas, is divided horizontally into fourths and vertically into sixths. The 4 : 6 ratio corresponds to the dimensions of the canvas, which is one and one-half times wider than its vertical dimension. An additional vertical axes was drawn by Seurat, which neither corresponds to the location of the figures, nor to the architectural construction of the work; neither do these axes correspond precisely to the golden section, 1 : 1.6, as might have been expected. Rather, they correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section), as noted by Seurat with citations from Charles Henry.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

The entrance of the circus tent consists of ticket window and doors at the center of a platform atop six steps. On both sides of the doors (here painted green), musicians and acrobats perform a sideshow on the balustraded platform to entice passersby. Those interested in purchasing tickets from the ticket seller—the man and woman toward the bottom right of the painting—climb the central stairs. Ticket holders queue parallel to the sideshow stage. The diagonal line behind the trombonist is the handrail for the subsidiary stairs. A woman with a young girl is buying a ticket on the platform to the right of the ringmaster. Just as the musicians toward the left, they are immersed in the orange glow of nine gas jets (each possessing a perceptible blue-violet aura) that illuminate the platform. Five yellow-white globes of interior lamps are visible through the ticket windows. The conspicuous tree to the left bares the presence of a human figure.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

A boy with a ruffled collar stands performing in front of the platform at the top of the central stairs. Despite appearances, the door behind him is on a different plane from the ticket window. The rectangular structure behind the trombonist (to the right), defines the edge of the platform and shows the admission price. Above the poster is the gas pipe support beam. The trombonist stands shadowed on a pedestal (left of the central stairs) several meters in front of the platform, illuminated from the rear. While the tuba player is faceless, the red faces of the clarinetist and cornet players show that they stand on the gaslit platform.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

A 1990 examination of ''Circus Sideshow'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art laboratory under light similar in color to that given off by gas lamps, revealed an "extraordinary transformation", writes art historian Robert Herbert: "Under the colored light the faces of the figures on the platform no longer appeared unnaturally orange but flesh color, the shadows on the trombonist and on the spectators were no longer bright ultramarine blue but black, and the entire painting glowed as if it were lit from behind, which, of course, is precisely the effect of contre-lumiere on which Seurat predicated the picture."&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

==Background and reception==
[[File:Georges Seurat - Les Poseuses.jpg|thumb|250px|Georges Seurat, 1884-86, ''[[Models (painting)|Models]]'' (''Les Poseuses''), oil on canvas, 207.6 × 308 cm, [[Barnes Foundation]], Philadelphia]]
Itinerant fairs housed in temporary structures such as the Circus Corvi  made seasonal appearances along the boulevards of Paris. Seurat's interest in these fairs produced several studies in anticipation of ''Parade de cirque'', including a series of cafe-concert performances, performing saltimbanques or acrobats.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt; The name Fernand Corvi appears on Seurat's small sketch for the ticket window.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

Gustave Kahn characterized ''Parade de cirque'' as "so willfully pallid and sad". The painting was overshadowed by the much larger ''[[Models (painting)|Models]]'' (''Les Poseuses'') when first exhibited at the 1888 Salon des Indépendants. Subsequently neglected by Seurat himself, ''Parade'' was not included among the large canvases listed in his "ésthetique" of 1890.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

Robert Herbert writes of ''Parade'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Falling uneasily between the huge, early plein-air paintings ''[[Bathers at Asnières|Baignade]]'' and ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte|La Grande Jatte]]'' and the late indoor scenes ''[[Le Chahut|Chahut]]'' and ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque]]'', ''Parade'' has neither the grandeur of the former nor the posterlike memorability of the latter. Yet it nonetheless demands a central role in Seurat's concise oeuvre. Not only is it his first painting of a nocturnal scene and therefore an important stage in the development of the artist's new "[[Divisionism|chrono-luminarist]]" style, it is also his first painting to depict the performance of a popular entertainment, a genre—already developed in drawings—that would dominate the artist's large projects for the remainder of his brief career. Apart from issues of chronological priority, however, ''Parade'' also distinguishes itself as Seurat's most mysterious painting, a brooding masterpiece that reveals its meaning reluctantly, a disarmingly simple geometrical schema that conceals a complex spatial arrangement... The evocative depiction of ethereal, penumbral light is unquestionably the key feature of Seurat's Parade.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Georges Seurat, Parade de cirque, detail of central figure.jpg|thumb|''Parade de cirque'', detail of the central figure]]
With respect to the peculiar mood and appearance of ''Parade'', art historian John Russell has proposed a literary inspiration, as opposed to a political or scientific basis; citing [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s poem a ''La parade'', published in the Symbolist review La vogue, 13 May 1886.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;John Russell. ''Seurat'. New York, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; It had long been believed that [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]]'s theories on the emotional and symbolic expression of lines, shapes and colors were at the root of ''Parade''. Though, it wasn't until the 1890 exhibition of ''[[Le Chahut]]'' (two year after the completion of ''Parade'') that critics remarked on a connection between the work of Seurat and the theories of Henry.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

"No amount of geometry", write's Russell, "can hide the fact that this picture offers a criticism of society. But the criticism is a poet's not a politician's."&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; If this were the case, Herbert points out, "it is unclear what the artist's message was." The subjects appear to be ordinary middle and working class spectator's and performers, without caricature of the type produced by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] or 19th century satirists such as [[Paul Gavarni]] or [[Honoré Daumier]].&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

Mirroring Seurat's work, Rimbaud writes of the circus sideshow as a reflection of contemporary life: "their bantering or their terror lasts one minute, or whole months."&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Robert Herbert suggested an alternative poem that more closely parallels the mood of ''Parade'', [[Jules Laforgue]]'s ''Soir de carnaval'': "Oh, life is too sad, incurably sad / At festivals here and there I have always sobbed: / 'Vanity, vanity, all is only vanity!' /—Then I think: where are the ashes of the psalmist?" Seurat almost certainly knew both poems, writes Herbert, "and either—or both—could have inspired him."&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

Art historian [[Roger Fry]], commenting on the unforeseen mystery of ''Parade'', compared it to the paintings of Lautrec:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Toulouse-Lautrec would have seized at once on all that was significant of the moral atmosphere, would have seized most of all on what satisfied his slightly morbid relish of depravity... But Seurat, one feels, saw it almost as one might suppose some visitant from another planet would have done. He saw it with this penetrating exactness of a gaze vacant of all direct understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion for geometricizing never deserts him—enclosed so completely, so shut off in its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and unforeseen implications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[André Salmon]] included this painting among other works by Seurat that were misunderstood by his contemporaries and which demonstrated "profound intention".&lt;ref&gt;André Salmon. ''Georges Seurat''. Burlington Magazine 37 (September 1920), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Though ''Parade de cirque'' was eclipsed by ''Les Poseuses'' at the 1888 [[Salon des Indépendants]], several critics did mention the arduous and innovative lighting effects employed by Seurat. [[Félix Fénéon]] pointed out that it was only "interesting insofar as it applies to a nocturne a method pointillism, that has been mainly used for daylight effects."&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Félix Fénéon. ''Le néo-impressionnisme à la IVe exposition des artistes indépendants''. L'art moderne 8 (April 15, 1888), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georges Seurat, 1891, Le Cirque (The Circus), oil on canvas, 185 x 152 cm, Musée d'Orsay.jpg|thumb|[[Georges Seurat]], 1891, ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Le Cirque (The Circus)]]'', oil on canvas, 185 x 152 cm, [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]
Jules Christophe referred to ''Parade'' as a "curious essay in nocturnal effects." Gustave Geffroy, following his commentary on Seurat's other entries at the Indépendants, wrote, "Parade de cirque, on the contrary, has little allure, a poverty of silhouette, a pallid appearance with awkward contrasts."&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

[[Gustave Kahn]] sympathetically stated, "In this research, new to him, into the effects of gas [lighting], M. Seurat perhaps may not arrive at the harmonious and seductive impression of Poseuses, but the effort was difficult and the qualities of the painter rest there." Kahn's commentary on the work was similar following its 1892 exhibition in Brussels: "Parade de cirque is conceived in a note of hazy fairground light. The sideshow performers are blurred in a kind of mist through which the gaslights attempt to burn. A clown, in the middle of the picture, is silhouetted against a noisy stand. This painting is not as decisive as ''[[The Circus (Seurat painting)|Cirque]]''... which is incidentally the most beautiful painting in the exhibition."&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Kahn. ''Peinture: Exposition des Indépendants''. Revue indépendante de littérature et d'art 7 (1888), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Meyer Schapiro wrote of ''Parade'''s "marvelous delicacy of tone, the uncountable variations within a narrow range, the vibrancy and soft luster, which make his canvases ... a joy to contemplate."&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer Schapiro. ''New Light on Seurat''. Art News 57 (April 1958), pp. 22, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
By 1904 Neo-Impressionism had evolved considerably, in a move away from nature, away from imitation, toward the distillation of essential geometric shapes and harmonious movements. These forms were considered superior to nature because they contained ''idea'', representing the dominance of the artist over nature. [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Paul Signac]], along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[André Derain]] (of the younger generation) began to paint with large brushstrokes that could never blend in the eye of the observer, with pure bold colors (reds, blues, yellows, greens and magentas) "making them as free of the trammels of nature", writes Herbert, "as any painting then being done in Europe."&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968"&gt;Robert Herbert, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968, Library of Congress Card Catalogue Number: 68-16803&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Paul Cézanne]] had been greatly influential during the expressionistic phase of [[proto-Cubism]] (between 1908 and 1910), while the work of Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures captured the attention of the [[Cubism|Cubists]] from 1911.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://cubism-coldcreation.blogspot.com/ Alex Mittelmann, ''State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time'', 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Seurat had been the founder of Neo-Impressionism, its most innovative and fervent protagonist, and proved to be one of the most influential in the eyes of the emerging [[avant-garde]]; many of whom—such as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Piet Mondrian]]—transited through a Neo-Impressionist phase, prior to their [[Fauvism|Fauve]], [[Cubism|Cubist]] or [[Futurism|Futurist]] endeavors.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred H. Barr Jr., ''Cubism and Abstract Art''. Exh. cat., Museum of Modern Art. New York, 1936, pp. 22, 223&lt;/ref&gt;

: "With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910–1911," writes Herbert, "questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. As a result of several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists.&lt;ref name="Herbert, 1968" /&gt;

Pierre Courthion mentions ''Parade'' as "perhaps the sole work of 19th-century painting that unequivocally anticipates Cubism (and even Purism)".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Courthion. ''Georges Seurat''. 1st ed. New York, 1968, pp. 11, 32, 40, 44, 46–48, 138, 140–41&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Schjeldahl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|l|d|ɑː|l|}}; born 1942) is an [[United States|American]] [[art critic]], [[poet]], and [[educator]].

==Early life==
Schjeldahl was born in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]]. He grew up in small towns throughout [[Minnesota]], and attended [[Carleton College]] and [[The New School]]. He began his professional writing career as a [[reporter]] in Minnesota, [[Iowa]] and [[New Jersey]].

==Art critic==
In 1964 he traveled to [[Paris]] for a year before settling in New York City in 1965. Since coming to New York he has worked as an art critic for ''[[ARTnews]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'' (1990 to 1998),&lt;ref name="ny-bio"/&gt; and 7 Days ([[The Cooper Union]]). In 1998 he joined ''[[The New Yorker]]'' where he is currently the head art critic.&lt;ref name="ny-bio"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Contributors: Peter Schjeldahl |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/peter_schjeldahl/search?contributorName=peter%20schjeldahl|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=|accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings have also appeared in [[Artforum]], [[Art in America]], ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;ref name="ny-bio"/&gt; During his career Schjeldahl has written several books of [[poetry]] as well as art criticism. He taught at [[Harvard University]] in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies for four years as well.

==Poet==
Schjeldahl’s [[poetry]] falls in line with many of the characteristic themes and styles of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].  As a contemporary [[postmodern]] poet, Schjeldahl believed that poetry should be enjoyed and understood by all readers.  In an interview with the Virginia Commonwealth University’s ''[[Blackbird (journal)|Blackbird]]'' Schjeldahl commented on how ''"there are no rewards in being obscure or abstruse or overbearing"''
&lt;ref name=Blackbird2004&gt;{{cite interview |last=Schjeldahl  |first=Peter |interviewer1=Howard Risatti|interviewer2=[[Susan Glasser]]|interviewer3=Mary Flinn |title=Interview with Peter Schjeldahl |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v3n1/gallery/schjeldahl_p/index.htm |date=Spring 2004 |volume=3 |number=1 |journal=[[Blackbird (journal)|Blackbird]] |accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His poetry succeeds without a great deal of complexity in language usage or style while maintaining seriousness and poignancy.  Schjeldahl’s poetry often addresses common experiences or familiar events. In his poem “My Generation” he opens: "Vietnam/ Drugs/ Civil Rights/ Rock/ Watergate/ (in that order?)/ Are the blows of history/ That have left my generation/ Its peculiar battered silhouette."  Schjeldahl fuels his poetry with historical and biographical context, allowing audiences to relate more intimately to his subject.
 
In an interview with ''Blackbird'', Schjeldahl stated, "''writing things that people want to read is my bread and butter".''&lt;ref name=Blackbird2004 /&gt;

==Awards==
Schjeldahl was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] fellowship in 1995.&lt;ref name="ga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/13026-peter-schjeldahl|title=Peter Schjeldahl|publisher=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 he received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism by the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast |title=Awards - Frank Jewett Mather Award |publisher=The College Art Association |accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute named Peter Schjeldahl the winner of the 2008 Clark Prize for Excellence in Arts Writing. The prize was established in 2006 to recognize writers who advance public appreciation of [[visual art]] in a way that "is grounded in scholarship yet appeals to a broad range of audiences." It comes with a $25,000 honorarium and an award designed by architect [[Tadao Ando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title= Peter Schjeldahl Wins Clark Prize for Arts Writing | publisher=ARTINFO  | date= April 25, 2008| url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27456/peter-schjeldahl-wins-clark-prize-for-arts-writing/ | accessdate=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carleton College bestowed an honorary degree, a Doctor of Humane Letters, ''honoris causa'', to Schjeldahl as part of their commencement exercises on June 13, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Carleton to hold 141st Commencement ceremony; bestow honorary degree to The New Yorker's Peter Schjeldahl |url=http://apps.carleton.edu/media_relations/press_releases/?story_id=1283794 |publisher=Carleton College |date=3 June 2015 |access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Schjeldahl currently resides in New York. He is married to Donnie Brooke Alderson, a former actress. They have one child, Ada Calhoun Schjeldahl, who writes under the name [[Ada Calhoun]].

'''Popular prints''' is a term for [[printing|printed]] images of generally low artistic quality which were sold cheaply in Europe and later the New World from the 15th to 18th centuries, often with text as well as images. They were some of the earliest examples of [[mass media]]. After about 1800, the types and quantity of images greatly increased, but other terms are usually used to categorise them.

[[File:Zehen eygenschaft des altters der menschen BM 1872 0608 351.jpg|thumb|left|''The Seven Ages of Man'', German, 1482, [[British Museum]]]]
From about 1400, there began a "visual revolution that inundated Europe with images during the fifteenth century" (Field) as the [[woodcut]] technique was applied to [[paper]], which was now manufactured in Christian Europe, instead of being imported from Islamic Spain. In the 15th century, the great majority of these images were religious, if [[playing card]]s are excluded. They were sold at churches, fairs and places of pilgrimage. Most were coloured, usually crudely, by hand or later by [[stencil]].  One political [[cartoon]] relating to events in 1468-70 has survived in several different versions (many from years later).  [[Old master print]] is a term that at this period includes popular prints, but later is restricted to more expensive and purely artistic prints. 

Although early information as to prices is almost non-existent, it is clear from a number of sources that small [[woodcut]]s were affordable by at least the urban working-class, and much of the [[peasant]] class as well.

During the middle of the century, the quality of the images became typically very low, but there was an improvement towards the end, partly because it was necessary to keep pace with the quality of images in [[engraving]]s. [[Engraving]]s were always much more expensive to create, as they needed greater skill to create the plate, which would last for far fewer impressions than a [[woodcut]]. They did not come into the popular prints category until the 19th century, when different techniques made them much cheaper.

== 16th century ==
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Von einem schrecklichen und wunderbarlichen Cometen so sich den Dienstag nach Martini dieses lauffenden M D LXXViJ Jahrs am Himmel erzeiget hat - 000003593.jpg|thumb|[[Great Comet of 1577|Der Große Komet]] über [[Prague|Prag]], 12. November 1577, [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]]]]

Broadsheets, also known as broadsides, were a common format. They were usually single sheets of paper of various sizes, typically sold by street-vendors. Another format was the [[chapbook]], usually a single sheet cut or folded to make a small pamphlet or book. In Spain there were ''[[pliego]]''s, in Portugal the ''[[papel volante]]'', and in other countries other names. These covered a great variety of material, including pictures, popular history, political comment or [[satire]], news, [[almanac]]s (from c.   1470), poems and songs.  They could be very influential politically, and were often subsidized by political factions for propaganda purposes.  See [[Broadside (music)]] for their musical use.  The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] hugely increased the market for satirical and polemical prints in all counties affected. In [[France]] the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], and in England the [[English Civil War]] and the political convulsions after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] all produced huge quantities of propaganda and polemic, in images as well as text.

Despite being often issued in large numbers, their survival rate was extremely low, and they are now very rare, with most having not survived at all.  This has been demonstrated by analysis of the records of the [[London]] Stationers Company from 1550 onwards; some blocks were in print for over a century with no copies now surviving.  They were very commonly pasted to the walls of rooms.  Paper was still sufficiently expensive that all available spare pieces tended to be used in the toilet. One of the biggest surviving collections with 439 prints is [[Wickiana]] at the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]].

== After 1600 ==
[[Image:Caricature gillray plumpudding.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Gillray]]'s ''[[The Plumb-pudding in danger]]'' (1805),  which caricatured [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]], was voted the most famous of all UK political cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Br J Rev |year=2006 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=59–64 |author= Preston O |title= Cartoons... at last a big draw |doi=10.1177/0956474806064768}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library of Congress]]]]

Newspapers began in the early 17th century, as an upmarket and expensive form of broadsheet (still a [[broadsheet|term]] for a large-format newspaper).  The first in English came in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/britnews.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003170056/http://www.bl.uk/collections/britnews.html |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this century [[book]]s also became much cheaper, and began to replace some types of popular print.  These trends continued during the next century, and although most of the traditional types of popular print lived on until the 19th century or beyond, they were by then part of a much wider print culture, and the term is generally not used of them. One type of publication continuing into the 20th century is the [[Brazil]]ian ''[[cordel literature]]'' ("string literature" - it is hung on strings by the sellers) that continue to use woodcuts, and is part of a continuous tradition going back to the Portuguese ''[[papel volante]]'' of the 17th century. [[Lubok]] prints in [[Russia]] were another local variant.

Political [[caricature]] prints for sale as single sheets are found as early as the 15th century, but reached the peak of their popularity in much of Europe in the 18th and early 19th century, before the form migrated into newspapers and magazines. Above all they were popular in England, where a high degree of [[freedom of the press]] meant that dedicated print-shops, often also acting as the publishers, could openly sell and display scathing images of the Royal Family and government politicians, a business that had to remain "under the counter" in much of Europe.

'''Raindance Foundation''' (RainDance Corporation) was founded in October 1969 by [[Frank Gillette]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69486182|title=A history of video art : the development of form and function|last=Chris|first=Meigh-Andrews|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781845202194|location=Oxford / New York|pages=62|oclc=69486182|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radicalsoftware.org/e/history.html|title=Radical Software|website=www.radicalsoftware.org|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ryan (video artist)|Paul Ryan, ]] [[Michael Shamberg]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Louis Jaffe,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Marco Vassi.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Raindance was a self-described "alternate culture think-tank" that embraced video as an alternative form of cultural communication.

The name "RainDance Corporation" was an ironic reference to the mainstream organization Rand Corporation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Influenced by the communications theories of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Buckminster Fuller]], the collective produced a data bank of tapes and writings that explored the relation of [[cybernetics]], [[Media (communication)|media]], and [[ecology]]. From 1970 to 1974, Raindance published the seminal video journal ''[[Radical Software]]'' (initially edited by [[Beryl Korot]] and [[Phyllis Gershuny]]), which provided a network of communications for the emerging alternative video movement with a circulation of 5,000. In 1971, Dean and Dudley Evenson joined the Raindance Foundation and taught video workshops through the Metropolitan Museum of Art under a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts.  [[Dean Evenson]] was instrumental in hooking up the first half inch video transmission through New York City's Sterling Manhattan Cable, thus paving the way for Public Access Television. Dudley Evenson co-edited Issue #5 of Radical Software with Michael Shamberg. In 1971, Shamberg wrote ''Guerrilla Television'', a summary of the group's principles and a blueprint for the decentralization of television.&lt;ref name="Greenwald, Dara"&gt;[Dara Greenwald: The Process is in the Streets. Challenging Media America. S. 168-179. In: MacPhee and Reuland (eds.).Realizing the Impossible. Art Against Authority. Oakland, Edinburgh 2007.].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Raindance members [[Ira Schneider]] and [[Beryl Korot]] edited ''Video Art: An Anthology'', one of the first readers on [[video art]]. The original Raindance collective dispersed in the mid-1970s.

The nonprofit Raindance Foundation continued and in the 1980s produced the first comprehensive TV series on video art called "Night Light TV" which showcased video works by [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]], [[Ira Schneider]], [[Russ Johnson]] (of [[Taly and Russ Johnson]]), [[Joan Jonas]], [[Juan Downey]], John Sturgeon, and Willoughby Sharp. Raindance also administered [[The Standby Program]] at Matrix, bringing video editing to artists in the 1980s and 1990s.

Abstract.
&lt;/ref&gt;
An exhibition of women artists who worked at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop included [[Laura Pharis]], Mary Holland, [[Willie Anne Wright]], and [[Barbara Tisserat]].&lt;ref&gt;http://museums.richmond.edu/_KP4_assets/actions/get/calendar/print.php&lt;/ref&gt;
When the Richmond Printmaking Workshop dissolved in 1991, a collection of 253 prints by fifty-seven RPW artists was presented to the [[Hand Workshop]] (now the [[Visual Arts Center]]) in Richmond. In 2001, the Hand Workshop transferred the collection to the Joel and Lila Harnett Print Study Center at the [[University of Richmond |University of Richmond Museum]]. After the dissolution of the RPW, its artists who formed the group [[One/Off Printmakers|ONE/OFF Printmakers]]  continued to produce print portfolios and to exhibit their group shows both nationally and internationally until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One/Off Printmakers: 25th Anniversary Show|url= https://rvanews.com/etc/oneoff-printmakers-25th-anniversary-show/3447}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A result of moving the RPW to the Hand Workshop, was the increase of printmaking instructors, classes, and workshops at the [[Hand Workshop]] (now [[VisArts]]). The RPW began collaborative exchange portfolios of members' prints, a tradition which later continued with [[One/Off Printmakers|ONE/OFF Printmakers]] and Studio Two Three, both also based in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONE/OFF Printmakers: Recent Works|url=http://lindenrowinn.com/services-amenities/art-exhibition|website=Linden Row Inn|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 One/Off Printmakers held an open house at the [[Hand Workshop]] printmaking studio. The artists giving printmaking demonstrations were [[Jack Glover (artist)|Jack Glover]], Ann Chenoweth, and Mitzi Humphrey. Other artists from One/Off discussed and showed examples of various other printmaking processes. Concurrently with the demonstrations, an exhibition from Pyramid Atlantic was on display in the [[Hand Workshop]] gallery.

==Partners==
The RPW partnered with [[Richmond City Public Schools]] in offering printmaking workshops and sponsoring scholarships for talented teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neely|first1=Paula|last2=Clenger|first2=David|title=Insiders' Guide to Greater Richmond|url=https://books.google.com/books?|website=books.google.com|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|accessdate=14 April 2016|location=Richmond, Virginia|pages=|date=July 1, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1983 the workshop produced the first color cover for the Richmond Independent Press and published several covers that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brumfield|first1=Dale M.|title=Richmond Independent Press: A History of the Underground Zine Scene|date=July 30, 2013|publisher=The History Press|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the artists who were instructors at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop were Master Printer David Adamson from England (at the invitation of [[Laura Pharis]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wells|first1=Brent|title=SBC professor Laura Pharis projects self image with exhibit . . .|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/the_burg/features/focus_on/sbc-professor-laura-pharis-projects-self-image-with-exhibit-at/article_72843886-38ea-11e4-afa7-001a4bcf6878.html|website=Lynchburg News and Advance|accessdate=12 April 2016|location=Lynchburg, Virginia|quote=[B]efore returning to Virginia for a managerial position at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop and receiving her master's from the Central School in London (now called Central Saint Martins) . . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt; woodcut artist and ''Paint Pot Alley'' host of children's television Jack Glover, and book artists Bruce Schnabel, John Field, and [[Carol Barton]].

==Funding==
Funding for the RPW after achieving its [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization 501-C3]] status came from other artists in the community, private donors, studio rental, and workshop tuition. The workshop drew participation from Virginia museums and galleries as well as collaboration from both the [[University of Richmond]] and [[Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts|Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King |first1=Jeff|last2=Rackley |first2=Ed|title=Studios offer realistic views of art|agency=The University of Richmond|issue=Vol. 74, No. 24|publisher=The Richmond Collegian|date=21 April 1988|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=21|quote=The Richmond Printmaking Workshop is primarily oriented toward two-dimensional works on paper--etchings, linoleum, and woodcuts, calligraphy and monotypes, classes are offered in everything from papermaking to bookbinding, and studio.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riva Lehrer''' (born in 1958 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]) is an American painter, writer, teacher, and speaker. Lehrer was born with [[spina bifida]] and has undergone numerous surgeries throughout her life. Her work focuses on issues of physical identity and the socially challenged body, especially in explorations of cultural depictions of disability. Lehrer is well known as both an artist and an activist in the field of Disability Culture.

==Early life==
Her early education took place at Condon School for Handicapped Children, which was one of the first schools in the [[United States]] to offer a standardized education to disabled children. She had many surgeries in her early life to render her body more [http://nyamcenterforhistory.org/2014/07/16/guest-curator-riva-lehrer-on-vesalius-500/ "normal"]. Living a huge part of her childhood in the hospital, she got an intimate view of medicine and this has helped her in her career as an educator and an artist. In 1980, she moved to [[Chicago]], where she has lived and exhibited ever since.

==Career==
Her work focuses on people's physical identity as well as political themes, especially in regards to disability.  After moving to Chicago, she encountered the works of other artists, joined a disabled artist group, and began one of her best known series the Circle Stories. Currently Lehrer is the Curator for Cultural Programs at Access Living of Chicago and an auxiliary professor at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]. Her interest in anatomy originally led her to consider a career in medicine but due to the lack of accommodations she soon felt this goal was unrealistic.

Instead she decided on an art career where she had more control over things like her schedule, but where she could still “prove her interests in biology and medicine”.&lt;ref&gt;(Davis, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Her works on a whole are meant to reject the idea of pity and inspire a new way of thinking about the beauty of disabilities. The complexity of her works represents the complexity of the lives of her disabled subjects. They are not tragic images of suffering but rather images of life and living. She uses realism and detail to draw the subjects the way they are; no exaggerations and no cover-ups. She simply shows the body as it is and allows the beauty to speak for itself.

=== Circle Stories ===
Riva Lehrer began the Circle Stories series in 1997 and continued expanding it until 2004. The title to this group of portraits comes from the methods of their creation, including multiple interviews and collaborations between Lehrer and the subjects, to create an accurate representation of their life. This collection shows the achievements and spirit of the subjects while paying homage to the original group of disabled artists that Lehrer joined. The subjects of these portraits are seen in a setting of their choice whether it is realistic or not. The professions and disabilities of these subjects vary greatly and are not all directly shown in some of the works. Many of these portraits fall under the category of [[Magic Realism]]. This type of art is where “Improbable and fantastical elements are combined with realistic elements, deeply embedding the two opposite and contradictory forces”.&lt;ref&gt;(Thodos, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Lehrer, like may artists before her, uses this style of art to comment on social inequalities and prejudices she sees. Lehrer also uses this style to express a particular mood sometimes of pain and darkness and other times of healing or release. Every portrait is unique in its message and in its tone, but each work together to tell a story about disabilities and disability culture as a whole while honoring the “community of disabled innovators who provide support and context for the work of redefinition of disability in the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;(Lehrer, Circle stories)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Series ===
Lehrer's '''''If Body''''' series stems from the fact that people tend to visualize what they are going to look like at an older age and how that image can change over time. The pieces themselves represent her personal ideals about her body and how those ideals have changed over time. “The self-portraits of If Body series chart this schism between the imaginary “normal” body I imagine I “should” have had, and my relationship to my subjective “actual” body”.&lt;ref&gt;(Lehrer, If body)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Family''''' series breaks the stereotype or myth that disabled people are loners and shows that people, disabled or not, form links, connections, and relationships with others. Lehrer explains “The Family drawings are an ongoing document of my own community of belonging. Some are blood relations, others are people who I consider part of my survival. They are a testament to the power that human beings have to transform each others lives”.&lt;ref&gt;(Lehrer, Family)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Totems and Familiars''''' series is about people's objects of power (totems) and animal alter ego(familiars). These images show the subject's, both disabled and non-disabled, internal source of strength and how this strength can relate to their external character.

'''Slanguage''' is an exhibition space and [[artist collective]] in [[Wilmington, Los Angeles]], [[California]] founded by Mario Ybarra and Karla Diaz in 2002. Slanguage works with community artists, [[curator]]s and [[historian]]s on projects and workshops. Slanguage describes its art-making practice as a "three pronged approach" including "education, community-building, and interactive exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slanguagestudio.com/about/|title=About »  Slanguage Studio|website=slanguagestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slanguage divides its space between experiments with media and ideas, and public performances and exhibitions. ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited Slanguage as an example of an "ever more important" type of exhibition space that provides a forum for work "uncongenial to an increasingly conservative art establishment" and for the work of students graduating from art schools "in numbers the commercial gallery system cannot begin to absorb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/arts/art-architecture-doing-their-own-thing-making-art-together.html|title=ART/ARCHITECTURE; Doing Their Own Thing, Making Art Together|first=Holland|last=Cotter|date=7 June 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September through November, 2009, Slanguage was the resident artist group with [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], as part of MOCA's Engagement Party program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130818033130/http://sites.moca.org/party/2013/01/09/slanguage/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/slanguage-at-engagement-party/|title=SLANGUAGE at Engagement Party - Announcements - e-flux|website=www.e-flux.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Slanguage projects include Sweeney Tate, a 2007 art installation at [[Tate Modern]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/tateshots-sweeney-tate|title=TateShots: Sweeney Tate - Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Peacock Doesn’t See Its Own Ass/Let’s Twitch Again: Operation Bird Watching in London, for the [[Serpentine Gallery]]'s Uncertain States of America exhibition in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2006/08/uncertain_states_of_america_9.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904001948/http://www.serpentinegallery.org/2006/08/uncertain_states_of_america_9.html |archive-date=2013-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slanguagestudio.com/projects/|title=Projects Slanguage Studio|website=slanguagestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
In [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[linguistics]], '''structuralism''' is the methodology that implies elements of human culture must be understood by way of their relationship to a broader, overarching system or structure. It works to uncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel. Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], structuralism is "the belief of alien life that is not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture".&lt;ref name="Blackburn"&gt;Blackburn, Simon (2008). ''Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy'', second edition revised. Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954143-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralism in Europe developed in the early 1900s, in the [[structural linguistics]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the subsequent [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]],&lt;ref name=d170&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]]&lt;ref name="d170" /&gt; and [[The Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen]] schools of linguistics. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when structural linguistics was facing serious challenges from the likes of [[Noam Chomsky]] and thus fading in importance, an array of scholars in the [[humanities]] borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study. French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] was arguably the first such scholar, sparking a widespread interest in structuralism.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;

The structuralist mode of reasoning has been applied in a diverse range of fields, including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[literary criticism]], [[structuralist economics|economics]] and [[structuralism (architecture)|architecture]]. The most prominent thinkers associated with structuralism include [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], linguist [[Roman Jakobson]], and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]]. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed to be the heir apparent to [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://literariness.wordpress.com/2016/03/20/structuralism/|title=Structuralism|last=Mambrol|first=Nasrullah|date=2016-03-20|website=Literary Theory and Criticism Notes|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly French intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], the [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]], and the literary critic [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="d170"/&gt; Though elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as [[post-structuralists]]. In the 1970s, structuralism was criticized for its rigidity and [[ahistoricism]]. Despite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Lacan, continue to assert an influence on [[continental philosophy]] and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;John Sturrock (1979), ''Structuralism and since: from Lévi Strauss to Derrida'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The term "structuralism" is a related term that describes a particular philosophical/literary movement or moment. The term appeared in the works of [[French people|French]] [[anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and gave rise in [[France]] to the "structuralist movement," which influenced the thinking of other writers such as [[Louis Althusser]], the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Nicos Poulantzas]], most of whom disavowed themselves as being a part of this movement.
 
The origins of structuralism connect with the work of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] on [[linguistics]], along with the linguistics of the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague]] and [[Moscow linguistic circle|Moscow]] schools. In brief, Saussure's structural linguistics propounded three related concepts.&lt;ref name="Blackburn"/&gt;
 
# Saussure argued for a distinction between ''langue'' (an idealized abstraction of language) and ''parole'' (language as actually used in daily life). He argued that the "sign" was composed of both a ''signified'', an abstract concept or idea, and a "signifier", the perceived sound/visual image.
# Because different languages have different words to describe the same objects or concepts, there is no intrinsic reason why a specific sign is used to express a given signifier. It is thus "arbitrary".
# Signs thus gain their meaning from their relationships and contrasts with other signs. As he wrote, "in language, there are only differences 'without positive terms.'"&lt;ref&gt;F. de Saussure, ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de linguistique generale]]'', published by [[Charles Bally|C. Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye|A. Sechehaye]] (Paris: Payot, 1916); English translation by Wade Baskin, Course in General Linguistics (New York: Philosophical Library, 1959), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of structuralism would argue that a specific domain of culture may be understood by means of a structure—modelled on language—that is distinct both from the organizations of reality and those of ideas or the imagination—the "third order".&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170–192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}: p. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacan's [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, the structural order of "[[the Symbolic]]" is distinguished both from "[[the Real]]" and "[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]]"; similarly, in Althusser's [[Structural Marxism|Marxist]] theory, the structural order of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is distinct both from the actual, real agents involved in its relations and from the [[Ideology|ideological]] forms in which those relations are understood.

Blending Freud and Saussure, the French (post)structuralist [[Jacques Lacan]] applied structuralism to [[psychoanalysis]] and, in a different way, [[Jean Piaget]] applied structuralism to the study of [[psychology]]. But Jean Piaget, who would better define himself as [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]], considers structuralism as "a method and not a doctrine" because for him "there exists no structure without a construction, abstract or genetic".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Piaget, ''Le structuralisme'', ed. PUF, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the French theorist [[Louis Althusser]] is often associated with a brand of structural [[Social theory|social analysis]] which helped give rise to "[[structural Marxism]]", such association was contested by Althusser himself in the Italian foreword to the second edition of ''[[Reading Capital]]''. In this foreword Althusser states the following:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite the precautions we took to distinguish ourselves from the 'structuralist' ideology ..., despite the decisive intervention of categories foreign to 'structuralism' ..., the terminology we employed was too close in many respects to the 'structuralist' terminology not to give rise to an ambiguity. With a very few exceptions ... our interpretation of Marx has generally been recognized and judged, in homage to the current fashion, as 'structuralist'... We believe that despite the terminological ambiguity, the profound tendency of our texts was not attached to the 'structuralist' ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Althusser and [[Étienne Balibar]]. ''Reading Capital'' trans. Ben Brewster. London: NLB, 1970. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a later development, [[Feminist theory|feminist theorist]] [[Alison Assiter]] enumerated four ideas that she says are common to the various forms of structuralism. First, that a structure determines the position of each element of a whole. Second, that every system has a structure. Third, structural laws deal with co-existence rather than change. Fourth, structures are the "real things" that lie beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Assiter | first = Alison | title = Althusser and structuralism | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 272–296 | date = June 1984  | url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/BJS/pastVolumes/vol35/index284.aspx | ref = harv | doi = 10.2307/590235| jstor = 590235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In linguistics== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Charles F. Hockett]] --&gt;
{{See also|Structural linguistics}}

In ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' the analysis focuses not on the ''use'' of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|parole]]''", or speech), but rather on the underlying [[system]] of language (called "''[[Langue and parole|langue]]''"). This approach examines how the elements of language relate to each other in the present, [[synchronic analysis|synchronically]] rather than [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Saussure argued that [[Sign (linguistics)|linguistic signs]] were composed of two parts:

# a "signifier" (the "sound pattern" of a word, either in mental projection—as when one silently recites lines from signage, a poem to one's self—or in actual, any kind of text, physical realization as part of a [[speech act]])
# a "signified" (the concept or meaning of the word)

This was quite different from previous approaches that focused on the relationship between words and the things in the world that they designate.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Suryo and Talbot Roosevelt, ''Landmarks in Linguistic Thought'', 1st ed. [1989], pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key notions in structural linguistics include [[paradigm]], syntagm, and value (though these notions were not fully developed in Saussure's thought). A structural "idealism" is a class of linguistic units ([[lexemes]], [[morphemes]] or even [[Pattern language|constructions]]) that are possible in a certain position in a given linguistic environment (such as a given sentence), which is called the "syntagm". The different functional role of each of these members of the paradigm is called "value" (''{{lang|fr|valeur}}'' in [[French language|French]]).

Saussure's ''Course'' influenced many linguists between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the United States, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] developed his own version of structural linguistics, as did [[Louis Hjelmslev]] in Denmark and [[Alf Sommerfelt]] in Norway. In France [[Antoine Meillet]] and [[Émile Benveniste]] continued Saussure's project, and members of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]] of linguistics such as [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] conducted research that would be greatly influential. However, by the 1950s Saussure's linguistic concepts were under heavy criticism and were soon largely abandoned by practicing linguists: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to [[Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The clearest and most important example of Prague school structuralism lies in [[phonemics]]. Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur in a language, the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed in terms of a series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct [[phonemes]] because there are cases ([[minimal pair]]s) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of [[Contrastive distribution|contrastive features]] also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in [[English language|English]] is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. [[Phonology]] would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism in a number of different fields.

==In anthropology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Social anthropology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Structural anthropology}}

According to structural theory in anthropology and social anthropology, [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] is produced and reproduced within a culture through various practices, phenomena and activities that serve as systems of signification. A structuralist approach may study activities as diverse as food-preparation and serving rituals, religious rites, games, literary and non-literary texts, and other forms of entertainment to discover the deep structures by which meaning is produced and reproduced within the culture. For example, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] analysed in the 1950s cultural phenomena including mythology, kinship (the [[alliance theory]] and the [[incest taboo]]), and food preparation. In addition to these studies, he produced more linguistically focused writings in which he applied Saussure's distinction between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his search for the fundamental structures of the human mind, arguing that the structures that form the "deep grammar" of society originate in the mind and operate in people unconsciously. Lévi-Strauss took inspiration from [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UoXZ8aIeZpgC&amp;dq= ''History of Structuralism: Volume 1: The Rising Sign, 1945-1966''], University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concept used in structural anthropology came from the [[Prague Linguistic Circle|Prague school of linguistics]], where [[Roman Jakobson]] and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features (such as voiceless vs. voiced). Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the universal structures of the mind, which he held to operate based on pairs of [[binary opposition]]s such as hot-cold, male-female, culture-nature, cooked-raw, or marriageable vs. tabooed women.

A third influence came from [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), who had written on gift-exchange systems. Based on Mauss, for instance, Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship systems are based on the exchange of women between groups (a position known as 'alliance theory') as opposed to the 'descent'-based theory described by [[Edward Evans-Pritchard]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]. While replacing Marcel Mauss at his ''[[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]]'' chair, Lévi-Strauss' writing became widely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and gave rise to the term "structuralism" itself.

In Britain, authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] were highly influenced by structuralism. Authors such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Emmanuel Terray]] combined [[Marxism]] with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[James Boon]] built on structuralism to provide their own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as [[Eric Wolf]] argued that [[political economy]] and [[colonialism]] should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by [[Pierre Bourdieu]] led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which [[Sherry Ortner]] has referred to as '[[practice theory]]'.

Some anthropological theorists, however, while finding considerable fault with Lévi-Strauss's version of structuralism, did not turn away from a fundamental structural basis for human culture. The [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] group for instance argued that some kind of structural foundation for culture must exist because all humans inherit the same system of brain structures. They proposed a kind of [[neuroanthropology]] which would lay the foundations for a more complete scientific account of cultural similarity and variation by requiring an integration of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[neuroscience]]—a program that theorists such as [[Victor Turner]] also embraced.

== In literary theory and criticism ==
{{Main|Semiotic literary criticism}}
In [[literary theory]], structuralist criticism relates literary texts to a larger structure, which may be a particular [[genre]], a range of [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] connections, a model of a universal [[narrative structure]], or a system of recurrent patterns or motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P. (2002), 'Structuralism', Beginning theory: an introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester, pp. 39–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evgeny Slavutin, [[Vladimir Pimonov]]: ‘Plot Structure’. Flinta - Nauka, Moscow 2018&lt;/ref&gt;Structuralism argues that there must be a structure in every text, which explains why it is easier for experienced readers than for non-experienced readers to interpret a text. Hence, everything that is written seems to be governed by specific rules, or a "grammar of literature", that one learns in educational institutions and that are to be unmasked.&lt;ref&gt;Selden, Raman / Widdowson, Peter / Brooker, Peter: ''A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Literary Theory'' Fifth Edition. Harlow: 2005. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential problem of structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive, as scholar [[Catherine Belsey]] puts it: "the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference."&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey|Belsey, Catherine]]. "Literature, History, Politics". Literature and History 9 (1983): 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' did not write anything "really" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a "formula" with a symbolic operator between them would be "Boy '''+''' Girl") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other ("Boy's Group '''-''' Girl's Group" or "Opposing forces") and conflict is resolved by their death. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two ''friendly'' families ("Boy's Family '''+''' Girl's Family") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other ("Boy '''-''' Girl") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed.

Structuralistic literary criticism argues that the "literary banter of a text" can lie only in new structure, rather than in the specifics of character development and voice in which that structure is expressed. Literary structuralism often follows the lead of [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] in seeking out basic deep elements in stories, [[Mythology|myths]], and more recently, anecdotes, which are combined in various ways to produce the many versions of the ur-story or ur-myth.

There is considerable similarity between structural literary theory and [[Northrop Frye]]'s archetypal criticism, which is also indebted to the anthropological study of myths. Some critics have also tried to apply the theory to individual works, but the effort to find unique structures in individual literary works runs counter to the structuralist program and has an affinity with [[New Criticism]].

== History and background ==
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, [[existentialism]], such as that propounded by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], was the dominant European intellectual movement. Structuralism rose to prominence in France in the wake of existentialism, particularly in the 1960s. The initial popularity of structuralism in France led to its spread across the globe.

Structuralism rejected the concept of human freedom and choice and focused instead on the way that human experience and thus, behaviour, is determined by various structures. The most important initial work on this score was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s 1949 volume ''The Elementary Structures of Kinship''. Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the [[The New School|New School]] in [[New York City|New York]] during [[World War II|WWII]] and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism as well as the American [[anthropology|anthropological]] tradition. In ''Elementary Structures'' he examined [[kinship]] systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of a few basic kinship structures. In the late 1950s he published ''[[Structural Anthropology]]'', a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.

By the early 1960s structuralism as a movement was coming into its own and some believed that it offered a single unified approach to human life that would embrace all disciplines. [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] focused on how structuralism could be applied to [[literature]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

The so-called "Gang of Four" of structuralism was Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, Barthes, and Foucault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthumref.libguides.com/content.php?pid=111224&amp;sid=837742 Post-Structuralism – LibGuides]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=March 2011}}

== Interpretations and general criticisms ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Philip Pettit]], [[Paul Ricœur]] and [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] --&gt;
Structuralism is less popular today than other approaches, such as [[post-structuralism]] and [[deconstruction]]. Structuralism has often been criticized for being ahistorical and for favouring deterministic structural forces over the ability of people to act. As the political turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s (and particularly the student uprisings of May 1968) began affecting academia, issues of power and political struggle moved to the center of people's attention.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Marshall (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwDR3oSoWWAC&amp;dq= ''Poststructuralism, Philosophy, Pedagogy''], Springer, 2004, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[deconstruction]]—and its emphasis on the fundamental ambiguity of language rather than its crystalline logical structure—became popular. By the end of the century structuralism was seen as an historically important school of thought, but the movements that it spawned, rather than structuralism itself, commanded attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Finlayson]] and Jeremy Valentine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQMQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''Politics and post-structuralism: an introduction''], Edinburgh University Press, 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several social thinkers and academics have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it ''in toto''. The French [[hermeneutic]] philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]] (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for constantly overstepping the limits of validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as "a [[Kantianism]] without a [[transcendental subject]]".&lt;ref&gt;P. Ricœur. (2004), ''The Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics'' (originally published in French in 1969 as ''Le conflit des interprétations: Essais d’herméneutique''). Continuum, pp. 49, 78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Adam Kuper]] (1973) argued that "'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement and some of its adherents felt that they formed a [[secret society]] of the seeing in a world of the blind. Conversion was not just a matter of accepting a new paradigm. It was, almost, a question of salvation."&lt;ref&gt;Kuper, Adam (1973), ''Anthropologists and Anthropology: The British School 1922–72'', Penguin, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Noel Pettit]] (1975) called for an abandoning of "the [[Positivism|positivist]] dream which Lévi-Strauss dreamed for [[semiology]]" arguing that semiology is not to be placed among the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, Philip (1975), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ5n3czwdZQC&amp;dq= ''The Concept of Structuralism: A Critical Analysis''], University of California Press, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] (1975) criticized structuralism as failing to explain [[Symbolic system|symbolic mediation]] in the social world;&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1987), ''The Imaginary Institution of Society'' (originally published in French in 1975 as ''L'institution imaginaire de la société''). Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; he viewed structuralism as a variation on the "[[Rationalism|logicist]]"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; theme, and he argued that, contrary to what structuralists advocate, language—and symbolic systems in general—cannot be reduced to logical organizations on the basis of the [[Two-valued logic|binary logic]] of [[Square of opposition|oppositions]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Castoriadis (1997), ''The Imaginary: Creation in the Social-Historical Domain''. In: ''World in Fragments''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critical theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] (1985) accused structuralists, such as Foucault, of being positivists; he remarked that while Foucault is not an ordinary positivist, he nevertheless paradoxically uses the tools of science to criticize science&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1990), ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (originally published in German in 1985 as ''Der Philosophische Diskurs der Moderne''), MIT Press, 1990, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Performative contradiction#Usage in philosophy|Performative contradiction]]'' and ''[[Foucault–Habermas debate]]''). Sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1993) is another notable critic; while Giddens draws on a range of structuralist themes in his theorizing, he dismisses the structuralist view that the reproduction of [[social system]]s is merely "a mechanical outcome".&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1993), ''New rules of sociological method: A positive critique of interpretative sociologies.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sue Sylvester''' is a [[fictional character]] of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy-drama]] series, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. The character is portrayed by actress [[Jane Lynch]], and appears in ''Glee'' from its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on May 19, 2009, through the show's [[Dreams Come True (Glee)|final episode]], first broadcast on March 25, 2015. Sue was developed by ''Glee'' creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]], and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]]. For the show's first four seasons, Sue is the track-suit wearing coach of the William McKinley High School [[Cheerleader|cheerleading squad]], and a ruthless bully to both students and faculty members alike. Because her cheerleading squad competes with the [[glee club]] for the school's limited funding, she is often at odds with the club and more particularly its director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]). Sue is the main antagonist throughout the series' run. In the show's [[Glee (season 5)|fifth season]], Sue is made the school's new principal, though she is ultimately fired late in the show's [[Glee (season 6)|sixth and final season]].

Due to Lynch's initial limited availability, Sue was originally set to be a recurring character while Lynch was working on a [[Damon Wayans]] [[pilot episode|pilot]] for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). When that pilot fell through, Sue became a starring role. The character has been acclaimed by critics. Mary McNamara for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has written that "Lynch alone makes ''Glee'' worth watching", while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Ken Tucker has called Sue "the greatest [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-musical villain to ever co-star in a TV series". In recognition of her portrayal of Sue, Lynch won an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]].

==Storylines==
===Season 1===
[[File:Jane Lynch, 2008 appearance (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|Jane Lynch (''pictured'') plays Sue]]

Throughout the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] of ''Glee'', Sue makes numerous attempts at sabotaging the William McKinley High School [[glee club]], New Directions. She enlists members of her cheerleading squad, the Cheerios, to bring the club down from the inside,&lt;ref name="Showmance"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Showmance |episodelink=Showmance |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director, writer), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer), Ian Brennan (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 9, 2009 |season=1 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conspires to lure away its star member, [[Rachel Berry (Glee)|Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]).&lt;ref name="Preggers"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Preggers |episodelink=Preggers |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 23, 2009 |season=1 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue is appointed co-director of the club by [[Principal Figgins]] ([[Iqbal Theba]]),&lt;ref name="Vitamin D"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Vitamin D |episodelink=Vitamin D (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 7, 2009 |season=1 |number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon scales back her involvement when her attempts to turn the club members against director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) fail.&lt;ref name="Throwdown"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Throwdown |episodelink=Throwdown (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 14, 2009 |season=1 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to ruin the club's chances of winning at the [[show choir]] Sectionals competition, Sue gives New Directions' [[setlist]] to the directors of their rival glee clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hairography |episodelink=Hairography (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Bill D'Elia]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 25, 2010 |season=1 |number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having to devise a new setlist at the last moment, New Directions win by unanimous decision and Sue is suspended by Figgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Sectionals |episodelink=Sectionals|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=December 9, 2009 |season=1 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She blackmails him into allowing her back,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hell-O|episodelink=Hell-O (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=April 13, 2010 |season=1 |number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is selected as a judge for the show choir Regionals competition. Sue is ridiculed by the other judges for her lack of fame and underdog status, allowing her to empathize with the glee club members. She votes for New Directions to win, and although they place last, she blackmails Figgins into allowing them another year to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Journey|episodelink=Journey (Glee)|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=June 8, 2010 |season=1 |number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sue's personal life is also explored over the course of the season. She has a commentary feature on the local television news, "Sue's Corner", which she uses to editorialize on issues such as littering and support for [[caning]].&lt;ref name="Preggers"/&gt; She falls in love with news anchor [[Characters of Glee#Rod Remington|Rod Remington]] (Bill A. Jones), but their burgeoning relationship comes to an abrupt end when she discovers he is sleeping with his co-anchor, Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mash-Up |episodelink=Mash-Up (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 21, 2009 |season=1 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Wheels (Glee)|Wheels]]", Sue allows [[Becky Jackson]] (Lauren Potter), a [[Tenth grade#United States|sophomore]] with [[Down syndrome]], to join the Cheerios. Will is suspicious of her motives, increasingly so when Sue donates money to the school to fund three new ramps for students with disabilities. It is revealed that Sue's older sister Jean (Robin Trocki) also has Down syndrome, and lives in a residential care facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Wheels |episodelink=Wheels (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Paris Barclay]] (director) [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 11, 2009 |season=1 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue becomes a minor celebrity when [[Olivia Newton-John]] invites her to remake the video to "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]", after a [[viral video]] of Sue [[Jazzercise|Jazzercising]] to the track achieves internet notoriety.

===Season 2===
At the onset of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]], Sue has formed a truce with Will, and together they conspire against the school's new football coach, [[Shannon Beiste]] ([[Dot Jones]]). When Will comes to regret his actions and apologizes, Sue renews their enmity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Audition|episodelink=Audition (Glee)|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 21, 2010 |season=2 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is appointed acting principal after having Figgins infected with the flu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Substitute|episodelink=The Substitute (Glee)|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 16, 2010 |season=2 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but although the school board is so impressed with her performance they make her position permanent, she resigns when they refuse to uphold her expulsion of [[Dave Karofsky]] ([[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]]), a bully who had threatened to kill glee club member [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]).&lt;ref name="Furt"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Furt|episodelink=Furt|series=Glee |series-link=Glee (TV series) |credits=Carol Banker (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 23, 2010 |season=2 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sue learns that Rod and Andrea have become engaged, she announces her intention to marry herself. Her estranged mother Doris ([[Carol Burnett]]), a recently retired [[Nazi hunter]], visits in an attempt to make amends for her absentee parenting, but is continuously critical of her daughter, to the point that Sue disinvites her during her wedding ceremony. Doris leaves, and Sue and Jean comfort each other.&lt;ref name="Furt"/&gt;

Sue grows disillusioned with cheerleading, and in an effort to recapture her love for it, plans to fire cheerleader [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]) from a cannon during the team's next competitive routine. Brittany and her friends [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) and [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) ultimately quit the squad, which loses at Regionals after having won the national title for six straight years. Sue is named Loser of the Year in a televised interview with [[Katie Couric]], and has her budget slashed. Depressed, Sue stages a fake suicide, and as she hoped would happen, is convinced to temporarily join the glee club to lift her spirits, though she really wants to bring down the club from within. When her attempts to do so fail, Sue decides to become the coach of Aural Intensity, one of New Directions' Regionals competitors, and deliberately injures their director in order to get the job. Sue is furious when her club loses to New Directions, and punches the announcer in the face.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/glee-recap-new-directions-head-to-regionals-in-original-song-20110316|title='Glee' Recap: New Directions Head to Regionals in 'Original Song'|last=Futterman|first=Erica|date=March 16, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More intent than ever on destroying the glee club, Sue forms a "League of Doom", which consists of former glee club director [[Sandy Ryerson]] ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]), the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, [[Dustin Goolsby]] ([[Cheyenne Jackson]]), and Will's ex-wife [[Terri Schuester]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]). Their first mission, to ruin a New Directions benefit, fails when Sandy is won over by a performance from [[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]) and donates the full amount needed. Devastated by Jean's death from pneumonia, Sue turns to Terri, who has the glee club's plane tickets for Nationals changed from New York to [[Tripoli]]. She also removes Becky from the Cheerios, because she reminds her of her sister. Kurt and his stepbrother [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]) help Sue to clean out Jean's things, and she accepts their offer to have New Directions perform at the funeral, as she is afraid no one else will come. At the well-attended funeral service, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her [[eulogy]] after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. Touched by his support, Sue tells Will he is a good friend and she will no longer go after the glee club. She will instead be running for the [[United States House of Representatives]] on a platform of lowering health care costs, as her sister had faced significantly higher bills in her last few years. She then apologizes to Becky, reinstates her as a member of the Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad next year. As a final act of reconciliation, Sue asks for and receives a hug from Becky.

===Season 3===
At the start of the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]], Sue's campaign for Congress is not going well. She decides to pledge to get rid of all arts programs in schools, music and theater especially, until all students are reading at or above grade level. Will's attempt to embarrass Sue and highlight the value of the arts by [[glitter bombing]] her backfires, and Sue's poll numbers rise. She also goes back on her promise to leave the glee club alone by having her new cheerleading co-captains, Becky and Santana, sabotage the club's recruitment drive. She rails against the school musical, and succeeds in having its funding rescinded. This angers Kurt's father, [[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]), who arranges for local businesses to sponsor the musical, and he enters the congressional race as a write-in candidate to defeat her. Sue runs a negative campaign, airing political ads containing false statements about Burt's personal life through her political ads. One of the other candidates in the race discovers that Santana is a lesbian, and uses this to attack Sue on the issue of "family values" for appointing her a cheerleading captain, and to imply that Sue herself is a lesbian. Santana is devastated, as she has not yet come out as a lesbian. Sue attempts to combat the implications by starting a relationship with one of her former bed partners, Ohio State football recruiter Cooter Menkins, who had recently been dating Coach Beiste. Being seen in public with Cooter does not help her in the voting, however; she comes in third, and Burt wins.

In the episode "[[On My Way (Glee)|On My Way]]", Sue reveals she is pregnant, shocking everyone. Her child is revealed by doctors to be a girl, but they mention that there were abnormalities on the scan. Sue mentions to Becky that she will have a child just like her, hinting that the baby may have Down's Syndrome. She shows unusual compassion, telling Will she will help him win nationals, letting Quinn rejoin the Cheerios, and is visibly upset at Karofsky's suicide attempt.

===Season 4===
In the first episode of the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]], "[[The New Rachel]]", Sue, now a mother, introduces her newborn child named Robin to [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]]. Sue then calls Kitty, a new cheerleader into her office to take Robin from her. Sue has a storyline with [[Alex Newell]]'s character, [[Wade Adams|Wade "Unique" Adams]], when she doesn't want him to audition for the role of Rizzo on the school's musical, ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''. Also, when [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] insults Robin, calling her "retarded", they start a strong rivalry. Sue "proposes" to Finn that if New Directions lose sectionals, the glee club would end. They lose and Sue uses the choir room for the Cheerios practices when the weather is cold. When New Directions discover that they won because the other club cheated, Sue gives them back the choir room.
 
Sue is fired from the William McKinley High School in "[[Shooting Star (Glee)|Shooting Star]]", when Becky's gun is shot by accident, causing everyone to think that there's a school shooting. Sue says it was her gun and she misfired it while checking it, to protect Becky. Coach Roz replaces Sue as the cheerleader squad coach and takes her office. Sue later starts working as a personal trainer, and [[Blaine Anderson|Blaine]] tries to get her back on McKinley's faculty, but she denies his offer by saying that getting fired was the best thing that could have ever happened to her, because now, as a trainer, people respect her, and also admits that she does not miss the Cheerios at all.

===Season 5===
In the episode "[[Love Love Love (Glee)|Love Love Love]]," Sue has come back to McKinley High after Becky confessed to the shooting. Upon her return, Sue gets Principal Figgins fired by faking incriminating details about him. He is demoted to janitor, while she takes his job as principal, where she constantly torments Figgins, and tells Will and Roz that she will keep the Cheerios and New Directions going if they win in their upcoming competitions.

Following Finn's death in the episode "[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]," Sue orders the memorial in the school to be taken down, which angers Santana to the point where she confronts her and pushes her into a filing cabinet. She later reveals, after Santana apologizes to her, she is heartbroken Finn died believing she hated him, while she actually respected him and looked forward to having him as a colleague. In "[[Puppet Master (Glee)|Puppet Master]]" She experiences a hallucination in the choir room, later to be a gas leak. After fixing the pipe herself, she then becomes the school's permanent principal. In "[[City of Angels (Glee)|City Of Angels]]", after New Directions comes in second in their Nationals competition, Sue fires Will and disbands the club, although she gets Will a job at Carmel High School as the new Coach for Vocal Adrenaline.

===Season 6===
In "[[A Wedding (Glee)|A Wedding]]", Sue tries to attend Brittany and Santana's wedding only to be flatly refused for her treatment of everyone. Showing a softer side, Sue visits Santana's grandmother who doesn't believe in two women marrying and uses "some reverse Suecology" to get the woman to see that no matter what she believes, family is most important. Sue is then allowed to attend the wedding and helps convince [[Kurt Hummel]] and [[Blaine Anderson]] to marry alongside Brittany and Santana, providing the rings for them when they don't have any. Sue later provides the two couples with their dream honeymoons, telling them that despite how she's treated them over the years, she's come to see them like her own kids. She is fired as principal in "[[The Rise and Fall of Sue Sylvester]]".

By 2020, Sue is the Republican [[Vice President of the United States]] to President [[Jeb Bush]]. She is planning on running for President in 2024. She rededicates the McKinley High auditorium to be named in honor of Finn Hudson while apologizing for her previous poor perception of the glee club. McKinley High has now become a model of excellence and other schools are copying its format. New Directions members from years past and present unite for one last massive group song, with Sue and Becky (now working as Sue's bodyguard) joining the entire cast for one final bow.

===Casting and creation===
Sue is played by Jane Lynch. The character did not exist when the script for the ''Glee'' pilot was first submitted to Fox. In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Ryan Murphy said that Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly was responsible for her creation. {{" '}}On our first call, Kevin said, "You need a villain,{{" '}} Murphy remembered. 'And I said, "You know, you're right." I knew exactly who she is. I said, "Her name is Sue Sylvester. And she is the cheerleading coach. And she may be on horse estrogen.{{" ' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20386845,00.html |title={{-'}}Glee': The show heard round the world|last=Stack|first=Tim|date=May 21, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casting notice described Sue as "the anal, tightly wound, and ruthlessly ambitious leader of the Harrison High cheer leading squad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7825 |title=Development Update: Thursday, October 30|author=The Futon Critic Staff|date=October 30, 2008|work=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she was cast as Sue, Lynch was already committed to do a [[Damon Wayans]] [[pilot episode|pilot]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The ''Glee'' role initially had her as a guest star, in the hope that she could become a regular in the future.

===Characterization===
Sue is initially presented as the glee club's "arch-nemesis".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Following the [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], Lynch said she is "pure evil and doesn't hide it",&lt;ref name="NYPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_sbUrfetlC9ck0hU9lqw0eM;jsessionidpi=9918A97B8F5FD78BFB117297FD0F4B98|title=Meet The Cast of 'Glee,' I Did!|last=Wieselman|first=Jarett|date=May 19, 2009|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that she was created as a product of Murphy, Brennan and Falchuk's "inner mean girl".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Lynch feels that Sue has the ability to be both "horrible and really delightful at the same time",&lt;ref name="Lynch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/09/qa-jane-lynch-might-just-slip-you-a-mickey.html|title=Q&amp;A: Jane Lynch Might Just Slip You a Mickey|last=Spitznagel|first=Eric|date=September 4, 2009|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|accessdate=September 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907120405/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/09/qa-jane-lynch-might-just-slip-you-a-mickey.html|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; assessing that she continually speaks her mind as she enjoys appalling people with the things she says.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt; She encapsulates Sue's world view as being about "power and winning", stating that she will do anything to win.&lt;ref name="Lynch"/&gt; Sue's softer side manifests following the revelation that her sister has Down syndrome.

Sue lobbies against the performance of spiritual songs in school, engaging in a philosophical argument on the matter with school guidance counselor [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]), which Murphy describes as the scene he is "most proud to have been involved with in [his] entire career."&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; On the fifth-season episode "[[Puppet Master (Glee)|Puppet Master]]", the reason behind Sue's track suit outfit was revealed. It was because she felt that she never received the respect she deserved as a teacher and even the then [[Principal Figgins]] "insulted" her and said that she was a cheerleading coach so she needed to "try some pants" because she was wearing an office skirt and that she had long hair. She said that the moment she put the track suit on, "the world bowed before her" and that she "had one made in every color".

'''''Symphony No. 6''''', also known as the '''''Plutonian Ode Symphony''''',  is a symphony composed by [[Philip Glass]]. It is based on the [[poem]] ''[[Plutonian Ode]]'' by [[Allen Ginsberg]]; parts of which are sung by the [[soprano]] soloist in the work. The symphony was commissioned by [[Carnegie Hall]] in honor of Glass' 65th birthday and as a vehicle for the talents of soprano [[Lauren Flanigan]]. The symphony premiered on February 2, 2002 at Carnegie Hall with [[Dennis Russell Davies]] conducting the [[American Composers Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/06/arts/music-review-happy-happy-happy-birthday.html?scp=1&amp;sq=plutonian+ode+glass&amp;st=nyt|title=MUSIC REVIEW; Happy, Happy, Happy Birthday|author=Allan Kozinn|date=February 6, 2002|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony is in three movements, based on the three parts of the poem itself.

[[File:Tauberbruecke Rothenburg.JPG|thumb|The Tauber Bridge from the valley]]

The ''' Tauber Bridge''' at '''Rothenburg ob der Tauber''' is an historic road bridge that spans the [[Tauber]] Valley west of the town centre of the [[Middle Franconian]] town of [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] in [[Bavaria]]. The structure carries a local link road to Leuzenbronn and the Tauber Valley Way and has a 4.0&amp;nbsp;metre wide roadway and a 1.0&amp;nbsp;metre wide footpath.

== History ==

The double bridge with its two rows of arches, one on top of the other, was probably built around 1330. It lies at the foot of the southwestern valley side below Rothenburg ob der Tauber and was part of a trade route from [[Augsburg]] to [[Würzburg]]. In terms of building activity, it is known that it was renovated in 1791, after the four upper arches had collapsed the year before. In 1925, the eastern approach to the bridge was widened and, twenty years later, the structure was blown up by German troops. Rebuilding took a good year and it was reopened on 10 November 1956. 
&lt;!--
== Bauwerk ==

Die [[Bogenbrücke|Natursteinbogenbrücke]] weist ein [[Muschelkalk]]mauerwerk auf, die 45&amp;nbsp;cm dicken Brüstungen sind 123&amp;nbsp;m lang. Seit dem Wiederaufbau 1956 ist Brücke 6,4&amp;nbsp;m breit, zuvor waren es 5,4&amp;nbsp;m. In Richtung Westen weist das Bauwerk ein Längsgefälle auf. Daher ist am westlichen Ende auch nur ein Bogen, der den Mühlenbach der Herrenmühle überspannt, mit 12,5&amp;nbsp;m lichter Weite angeordnet. Nach einem 5,0&amp;nbsp;m breiten [[Pfeiler]] folgt in Richtung Osten der doppelstöckige Brückenabschnitt, dessen oberen neun Bögen ohne Regel auf den unteren sechs Bögen stehen. Die oberen Bögen besitzen eine Kreisform und lichte Weiten zwischen 5,8&amp;nbsp;m und 6,2&amp;nbsp;m bei einer mit der Straßengradiente wachsenden [[Pfeilhöhe]] von 2,3&amp;nbsp;m auf 3,0&amp;nbsp;m. Unten ist ein Bogen mit 11,5&amp;nbsp;m lichter Weite im östlichen Vorland angeordnet, dem über die Tauber zwei weitere mit 12,2&amp;nbsp;m und 11,4&amp;nbsp;m lichter Weite und 5,66&amp;nbsp;m lichter Höhe folgen. Die dazwischen liegenden zwei Flusspfeiler sind 4,5&amp;nbsp;m breit. Im östlichen Vorland schließt ein 1,75&amp;nbsp;m breiter Pfeiler und 8,5&amp;nbsp;m weiter Bogen, der einen Gehweg überspannt, an. Zwei weitere Bögen mit 6,3&amp;nbsp;m und 5,6&amp;nbsp;m lichter Weite schließen die untere Bogenreihe ab.

'''''The Old Musician''''' is an 1862 oil painting on canvas by [[France|French]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Édouard Manet]], produced during the period when the artist was influenced by Spanish art. The painting also betrays the influence of [[Gustave Courbet]]. This work is one of Manet's largest paintings and is now conserved at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection  - The Old Musician|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.46637.html|website=nga.cov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is composed of seven characters in a landscape. The old musician in the center who is preparing to play the [[violin]] is Jean Lagrène, the leader of a local gypsy band.&lt;ref name="manet.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old Musician, 1862 by Edouard Manet|url=http://www.manet.org/the-old-musician.jsp|website=manet.org|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the left is a young girl standing with a baby in her arms, as well as two young boys. In the background, the man in the top hat is the [[rag picker]] and [[ironmonger]] Colardet.&lt;ref name="manet.org" /&gt; At the right, the Oriental man (partly shown) with a [[turban]] and a long robe, represents Guéroult, a "[[wandering Jew]]".&lt;ref name="manet.org" /&gt; Attitudes and clothes of the characters seem to be inspired by [[Diego Velázquez]] or [[Louis Le Nain]].&lt;ref name="manet.org" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Édouard Manet, les premières œuvres |url=http://www.van-gogh.fr/edouard-manet-premieres-oeuvres-page-2.php |publisher=Van Gogh |language=French |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Édouard Manet  (artist), French, 1832 - 1883, ''The Old Musician'', 1862 |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg90/gg90-46637.html |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting contains a series of allusions: the man in the top hat is the same character as ''[[The Absinthe Drinker (Manet painting)|The Absinthe Drinker]]'', painted by Manet some years earlier and who reappears in this painting without any particular reason. The young boy in straw hat, meanwhile, is explicitly inspired by [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''Pierrot''.

[[File:Détail du tombeau de Philippe Pot (17863220888).jpg|340px|thumb|Detail of the pleurants]] 
The '''Tomb of Philippe Pot''' is a 15th-century [[Funerary art|funerary monument]] commissioned by [[Philippe Pot]] (d. 1493), royal steward of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] under [[Louis XI]], between c. 1477–80 for his burial at the chapel of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in [[Cîteaux Abbey]], south of [[Dijon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, xi&lt;/ref&gt; 

It consists of eight life-sized [[pleurants]], represented as solemn and hooded [[pallbearer]]s carrying Philippe's recumbent [[effigy]] towards its final resting place.&lt;ref name = "Sadler22"&gt;Sadler, 22&lt;/ref&gt; Made of polychromed [[limestone]], paint, gold and lead, it measures 181 (width) x 260 (height) x 167 (depth) cm. No definitive attributions have been made as to the artists and craftsmen who created the work, but [[Antoine Le Moiturier]] is often suggested to have produced the mourners. 

The tomb was plundered during the French revolution, and in the 19th century positioned in private gardens in hotels in Dijon. It has been in the collection of the [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] since 1899, where it is on permanent display.

==Description==
[[Philip the Bold]] (1363–1404) commissioned the first of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] tombs in the latter part of the 14th century, hiring [[Claus Sluter]] as sculptor, whose distinctive style in which many small pleurants are positioned surrounding the effigy, was copied for the next century. Philippe Pot (1428–1493), royal stewart and seneschal to the Dukes of Burgundy, was raised at the Burgundian court, where he was educated. His tomb follows the tradition of the earliest ducal tombs, with Sluter's influence evident in the presence of mourners – or pleurants. As art historian Donna Sadler writes, a century after Sluter's work, in Pot's tomb "the ''pleurants'' have taken steroids and become life-sized, bearing the effigy upon their shoulders".&lt;ref name = "Sadler22"/&gt;

Philippe Pot reposes on a limestone plate or slab, and is dressed in a [[Knight|Knightly]] helmet and armor with a [[Gilding|gilded]] breastplate. His head rests on a cushion, his eyes are open and his hands are clasped in prayer. A sword lies to his side while a lion rests at his feet. The mourners, whose carved forms seem influenced by the Dutch sculptor Claus Sluter,&lt;ref&gt;Hourihane, 357&lt;/ref&gt; are carved in black stone, and dressed full length black hooded [[Religious habit|habit]]s. Each bows their head in grief, and each bears an individually designed gilded heraldic shield, which may refer to Philippe's lineage, making the monument of the "Kinship tomb" type.&lt;ref&gt;McGee Morganstern, 8&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb is in good condition, but has been restored in places; a 19th century engraving shows Philippe's hands broken apart.&lt;ref name="ss158"&gt;Sterling &amp; Salinger, 158&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:GD-FR-Paris-Louvre-Sculptures034.JPG|thumb|320px|View]]

Its style and scale became influential, because the sculptor transformed the size and placement of''pleurants'', which had been relatively small figures standing in niches around the sarcophagus. Its influence is evidenced by the similar tombs of Louis de Savoisy (d. 1515) and Jacques de Mâlain (d. 1527).&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
The monument was commissioned to stand over Philippe's grave in the north arm of the chapel's [[transept]].  The artists and craftsmen involved in its production have not been identified, although the French sculptor Antoine Le Moiturier is often suggested as likely to have created the pleurants, based on the facial types and according to art historian Colum Hourihane the "unusually rigid drapery".&lt;ref&gt;Hourihane, 40&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume Chandelier has also been suggested as involved, but there is little concrete evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstatter, 137, 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoF"&gt;"[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=M5037011289 Tomb of Philip Pot, Grand Seneschal of Burgundy]". Portal of the collections 
of the Museums of France. Retrieved 8 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The tomb was seized by the state during the [[French Revolution]], and sold in 1791 to the Duleu Society and Dardelin of Dijon.&lt;ref name="MoF" /&gt; It was acquired in 1808 by Charles Richard de Vesvrotte, lord of [[Ruffey-lès-Beaune]], following a legal case against the state. De Vesvrotte placed the tomb in the garden of his [[hôtel particulier]] (mansion) in Dijon, the [[Hôtel Petit de Ruffey]].  He then temporarily moved it to a castle grounds in his possession, and then relocated to another of his mansion's gardens. It passed to the French National Collections in 1899.&lt;ref name="ss158" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Yōga'''''|洋画||literally "Western-style painting"}} is a style of [[painting]]s by Japanese artists, made in accordance with Western (European) traditional conventions, techniques and materials. The term was coined in the [[Meiji period]], to distinguish such works from indigenous traditional [[Japanese painting]]s, or {{nihongo|''[[Nihonga]]''|日本画}}.

== History ==
European painting was introduced to Japan during the late [[Muromachi period]] along with [[Christian missionaries]]. Early religious works by Japanese artists in imitation of works brought by the missionaries can be considered some of the earliest forms of ''Yōga''. However, the [[sakoku|policy of national seclusion]] introduced by the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] in the [[Edo period]] effectively ended the influence of western art on Japanese painting, with the exception of the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], which was discovered by Japanese artists in sketches found in European medical and scientific texts imported from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] via [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].

In 1855, the Tokugawa ''bakufu'' established the ''[[Bansho Shirabesho]],'' a translation and research institute for western studies, including a section to investigate western art. This section was headed by [[Kawakami Togai]], whose assistant [[Takahashi Yuichi]] was a student of English artist [[Charles Wirgman]]. Takahashi is regarded by many as the first true Yōga painter.

In 1876, the ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' ([[Tokyo Institute of Technology|Technical Art School]]) was established by the Meiji government as Japan's first dedicated ''Yōga'' art school. [[o-yatoi gaikokujin|Foreign advisors]], such as the Italian artist [[Antonio Fontanesi]], were hired by the government to teach Japanese artists, such as [[Asai Chu]] in the latest western techniques.

In the 1880s, the general reaction against Westernization and the growth in popularity and strength of the ''[[Nihonga]]'' movement caused the temporary decline of ''Yōga''. The ''Kobu Bijutsu Gakko'' was forced to close in 1883, and when the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'' (the forerunner of the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]]) was established in 1887, only ''Nihonga'' subjects were taught.

However, in 1889, the ''Meiji Bijutsukai'' (Meiji Fine Arts Society) was established by ''Yōga'' artists, and in 1893, the return of [[Kuroda Seiki]] from his studies in Europe gave fresh impetus to the ''Yōga'' genre. From 1896, a Yōga department was added to the curriculum of the ''Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko'', and from that point onwards, ''Yōga'' has been an accepted component of Japanese painting.

Since that time, ''Yōga'' and ''Nihonga'' have been the two main divisions of modern Japanese painting. This division is reflected in education, the mounting of exhibitions, and the identification of artists. However, in many cases ''Nihonga'' artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although ''Nihonga'' forms a distinct category within the Japanese annual ''[[Japan Art Academy|Nitten]]'' exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between ''Nihonga'' and ''Yōga''.

== Materials ==
''Yōga'' in its broadest sense encompasses [[oil painting]], [[watercolor]]s, [[pastels]], [[pen-and-ink drawing|ink sketches]], [[lithography]], [[etching]] and other techniques developed in western culture. However, in a more limited sense, ''Yōga'' is sometimes used specifically to refer to oil painting.
