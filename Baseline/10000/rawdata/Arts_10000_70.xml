During the '''1820s''' in European and European-influenced countries, fashionable women's clothing styles transitioned away from the classically influenced "Empire"/"Regency" styles of c. [[1795–1820 in fashion|1795–1820]] (with their relatively unconfining [[empire silhouette]]) and re-adopted elements that had been characteristic of most of the 18th century (and were to be characteristic of the remainder of the 19th century), such as full skirts and clearly visible [[corset]]ing of the natural waist.

The silhouette of men's fashion changed in similar ways: by the mid-1820s [[coat (clothing)|coats]] featured broad shoulders with puffed sleeves, a narrow waist, and full skirts. [[Trousers]] were worn for smart day wear, while [[breeches]] continued in use at court and in the country.

==Women's fashions==

===Overview===
[[File:Stieler - Amalie Auguste of Bavaria - Galerie Neue Meister.jpg|right|thumb|Evening dress of 1823 features short puffed sleeves and is worn with a patterned shawl]]
[[File:Frothingham Brooks.jpg|right|thumb|Ruffled collar and sheer linen cap, 1823]]
During the first half of the 1820s, there were slight gradual modifications of Regency styles, with the position of the waistline trending successively lower than the high waistline of the Regency (just below the breasts), and also further development of the trends of the late 1810s towards giving skirts a somewhat conical silhouette (as opposed to earlier more clinging and free-flowing styles), and in having various types of [[Trim (sewing)|decoration]] (sometimes large and ornate) applied horizontally around the dress near the hem. Sleeves also began increasing in size, foreshadowing the styles of the 1830s. However, there was still no radical break with the Empire/Regency aesthetic. Skirts became even wider at the bottom during the 1820s, with more ornamentation and definition toward the bottom of the skirt such as tucks, pleats, ruffles, or loops of silk or fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas A.|title=Costume History and Style|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-181214-9|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 1820s, this neoclassical aesthetic was decisively repudiated, preparing the way for the main fashion features of the next ten to fifteen years (large sleeves, somewhat strict corseting of the natural waist, full skirts, elaborate large-circumference hats, and visual emphasis on wide sloping shoulders).  Rich colors such as [[chrome yellow]] and [[rubia|Turkey red]] became popular, and fabrics with large bold checkerboard or plaid patterns became fashionable,&lt;ref&gt;Tozer and Levitt (1983), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takeda and Spilker (2010), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; (another contrast with the previous fashion period, which had favored small delicate pastel prints). A [[bustle]] was sometimes also worn.  Belts accentuated the new defined waist.

Dresses were often worn with a round ruffled linen collar similar to a soft [[ruff (clothing)|Elizabethan ruff]].

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Early in the decade, hair was parted in the center front and styled into tight curls over the temples.  As the decade progressed, these curls became more elaborate and expansive. The bun on the back became a looped knot worn high on top of the head.  Wide-brimmed hats and hat-like bonnets with masses of feathers and ribbon trims were worn by mid-decade.

Conservative married or older women wore indoor caps of fine [[linen]] descended from the earlier [[mob cap]]; these had a pleated or gathered caul on the back to cover the hair, and a narrow brim at the front that widened to cover the ears and often tied under the chin.  These caps were worn under bonnets for street-wear.

Women also began to wear caps known as a cornette around 1816. These caps were tied under the chin and worn indoors. They also tended to be greatly adorned with plumes, ribbons, flowers, and jewels. Another alternative to the cornette was the turban, also often bejeweled and adorned, which shows the great interest in exotic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Geoffrey|title=Fashion Accessories Since 1500|year=1987|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outerwear===

[[Shawl]]s remained popular.  [[Cloak]]s and full-length [[coat (clothing)|coats]] were worn in cold or wet weather.

===Shoes===

The fashionable shoe was a flat slipper. In the late 1820s, the first high shoe appeared and became vogue for both men and women. The shoe typically consisted of a three-inch high cloth top that laced on the inner side and a leather vamp that supported a long, narrow, and squared toe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Turner R.|title=The Mode in Costume|year=1958|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York, NY|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
By the mid-1820s, men's fashion plates show a shapely ideal silhouette with broad shoulders emphasized with puffs at the sleevehead, a narrow waist, and very curvy hips.

A [[corset]] was required to achieve the tiny waistline shown in fashion plates. Already de rigueur in the wardrobes of military officers, men of all middle and upper classes began wearing them, out of the necessity to fit in with the fashionable gentry.  Usually referred to as "girdles", "belts" or "vests" (as "corsets" and "stays" were considered feminine terms) they were used to cinch the waist to sometimes tiny proportions, although sometimes they were simply whalebone-stiffened waistcoats with lacing in the back.  Many contemporary cartoonists of the time poked fun at the repressed nature of the tightlaced gentlemen, although the style grew in popularity nonetheless. This was the case especially amidst middle-class men, who often used their wardrobe to promote themselves, at least  in their minds, to a higher class — hence the [[dandy]] was born.

The emergence of wool as a primary fabric choice for men's outer garments led to a revolution in tailoring that allowed fit and finish to be of the utmost importance as opposed to ornamentation. This revolution allowed for an idealized classical silhouette to be materialized in men's fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollander|first=Anne|title=Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress|year=1995|publisher=Kodansha|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shirts and cravats===
[[Shirt]]s of linen or cotton featured tall standing [[collar (clothing)|collars]] and were worn with wide [[necktie|cravats]] tied in a soft bow.

===Coats and waistcoats===
Around 1820, coats began to be made in an entirely new way. The tails and lapels were cut separately and subsequently attached to the coat. This ensured a better fit, a greater following of the body's contours, and more consistent positioning, even when the coat was unbuttoned. The tails themselves were narrow, pointed, and fell just below the knee. The shoulders were broad and the coat stood of the chest, yet was snug at the waist. Coats also were padded at the chest and waist. The collars and lapels were also padded in order to stiffen them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Carl|title=A History of Costume|year=1963|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, NY|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The collars were high and shawl-like in order to frame the face. Coats were cut straight across the waist. Waistcoats were buttoned high on the chest.  Cutaway coats were worn as in the [[1795–1820 in fashion|previous period]] for formal daywear, but the skirts might almost meet at the front waist.

[[Frock coat]]s had the same nipped-in waist and full skirts. Very fashionable sleeves were gathered or pleated into a slightly puffed "leg of mutton" shape.  Coats could be made of [[wool]] or [[velvet]], and jewel colors like bottle green and midnight blue were high style.  [[Double-breasted]] coats were very much in fashion throughout the decade.

===Trousers and breeches===
Trousers underwent a notable change in the 1820s. The new fit was a product of the French Revolution as it was considered uncouth to wear attire that looked wealthy. The length of the pant changed from below the knee to below the ankle and the fit of the pant loosened slightly from the first decade of the 19th century. The pants featured a small waistline and flared out slightly at the hip with small pleats, creating the image of fullness in the hip region. The introduction of straps that went under the foot, known as [[stirrup pants]], also changed the shape and fit of these trousers.&lt;ref&gt;B. Payne, "Men's Wear in the Nineteenth Century", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-length light-colored trousers were worn for day; these were cut full through the hips and thighs, tapering to the ankles.  They were held smoothly in place by straps fastened under the square-toed shoes.  Dark trousers were worn for evening wear, and breeches were worn for formal functions at the [[United Kingdom|British]] court (as they would be throughout the century).  Breeches were also worn for [[horseback riding]] and other country pursuits, especially in Britain, with tall fitted boots.

===Hats and hairstyles===
Tall, silk hats again came into style. They were seen as a comfortable and light way to protect against sun and rain and were adequate for travelling and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Carl|title=A History of Costume|year=1963|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, NY|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowns of tall [[hat]]s also became curvy in keeping with the new style, and began to flare from the headband to the top.  Curled [[hair]] and [[sideburn]]s were fashionable.

===Shoes===
Rubber was introduced to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, as though they were held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, Rachel H: "Costume", 1992, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Nehamas''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Νεχαμάς}}; born 22 March 1946) is a Greek-born American philosopher. He is Professor of [[Philosophy]] and [[Edmund N. Carpenter, II]] Class of 1943 Professor in the Humanities at [[Princeton University]], where he has taught since 1990, and a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences]]. He works on [[Greek philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[literary theory]].

== Biography ==

Nehamas was born in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] in 1946. In 1964, he enrolled to [[Swarthmore College]]. He graduated in 1967 and completed his doctorate (titled ''Predication and the Theory of Forms in the 'Phaedo''') under the direction of [[Gregory Vlastos]] at [[Princeton University]] in 1971. He taught at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] before joining the Princeton faculty in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.princeton.edu/sites/philosophy/files/person/cv/nehamas_cv.pdf CV]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical work ==

His early work was on [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]] as well as the philosophy of [[Socrates]], but he gained a wider audience with his 1985 book ''Nietzsche: Life as Literature'' (Harvard University Press), in which he argued that Nietzsche thought of life and the world on the model of a literary text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/books/the-world-as-a-work-of-art.html|title=The World as a Work of Art|last=Harries|first=Karsten|date=1986-01-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehamas has said, "The virtues of life are comparable to the virtues of good writing—style, connectedness, grace, elegance—and also, we must not forget, sometimes getting it right."&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, David. [http://bombsite.com/issues/65/articles/2190 "Alexander Nehamas"], [[BOMB Magazine]] No. 65 (Fall, 1998). Retrieved 2012-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has become well known for his view that philosophy should provide a form of life, as well as for his endorsement of the artistic value of [[television]]. This view also becomes evident in his book ''Only a Promise of Happiness''. The title itself is later in this work used as one definition of [[beauty]] with reference to [[Stendhal]]. In that sense, beauty can be found in all media; as Nehamas claims in the same work: "Aesthetic features are everywhere, but that has nothing to do with where the arts can be found. Works of art can be beautiful because everything can be beautiful, but that doesn't mean that anything can be a work of art."&lt;ref name="OPH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nehamas|first1=Alexander|title=Only a Promise of Happiness: The Place of Beauty in a World of Art|date=2010|publisher=Princeton Univ Pr|isbn=9780691148656|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Nehamas published a book, ''On Friendship'', based on his 2008 Gifford Lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/lecturers/alexander-nehamas|title=Alexander Nehamas|website=The Gifford Lectures|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he argues, contra Aristotle, that friendship is an aesthetic, but not always moral, good.  And—like in his earlier work, ''Only a Promise of Happiness''—he compares friends to artworks. “Like metaphors and works of art, the people who matter to us are all, so far as we are concerned, inexhaustible. They always remain a step beyond the furthest point our knowledge of them has reached—though only if, and as long as, they still matter to us.”&lt;ref name="OF"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nehamas|first1=Alexander|title=On Friendship|date=2016|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465082926|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first national interior designers association was called the''' American Institute of Decorators (AID), '''founded in 1931.  It was later named the''' American Institute of Interior Designers (AID). ''' It is the oldest professional association for [[interior design]]ers.  In 1975 (AID) and the''' National Society of Interior Designers (NSID)''' merged to become the '''American Society of Interior Designers (ASID)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asid.org/|title=American Society of Interior Designers {{!}} ASID|website=www.asid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''.''' Its more than 40,000 members engage in a variety of professional programs and activities through a network of 48 chapters throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

== History ==
Founded in [[1975]] with the consolidation of the American Institute of Decorators (AID) and the National Society of Interior Designers (NSID), the American Society of Interior Designers is the largest [[professional organization]] for interior designers. Of the Society's 20,000 practicing interior designers, 6,500 practice primarily in the [[commerce|commercial]] field with 4,000 practicing primarily as residential designers. The remaining 9,500 work in both commercial and residential design. ASID Industry Partners include more than 2,500 member [[firm]]s with more than 6,000 individual representatives, uniting the professional designer with manufacturers of design-related products and services.

The Society's membership also includes more than 12,000 students of [[interior design]]. ASID has Student chapters at [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] and [[design school]]s with 2-year and 4-year programs throughout the U.S. and "virtual" chapters, such as Rhodec International.

Members are qualified by [[education]], [[experience]] and examination, and adhere to a strict [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] and [[professional conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asid.org/resources/about/ethics|title=American Society of Interior Designers {{!}} ASID|website=www.asid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through educational programs, research and conferences, ASID members receive the most current information on developments in design, as well as appropriate materials, [[technology]], [[building code]]s, [[Regulation|government regulations]], flammability standards, sustainable and [[green design]], product performance, [[design psychology]], occupant populations, and more. ASID also supports legislative and advocacy efforts to protect interior designers’ right to practice.

== Legislative Policy ==
[[ASID]] revised their legislative policy in January 2009.  The policy was revised to best serve the societies membership and goals. The legislative policy of the organization is as follows:

:1. ASID supports the pursuit of legal recognition of the profession of interior design. In doing so, ASID believes accomplishing legal recognition is best achieved through the enactment of legislation that:
::a. Does not limit, restrict or prevent the practice of interior design;
::b. Does not limit, restrict or prevent anyone from using the title “interior design” or “interior designer;”
::c. Allows state-qualified interior designers to (a) use the title “registered,” “certified” or “licensed” interior designer and (b) perform such additional services related to the practice of interior design as applicable governing jurisdictions deem appropriate for statequalified interior designers to perform. (amended 1/09)
:2. ASID supports the National Council for Interior Design Qualifications (NCIDQ) as the body whose professional exam tests minimum competency for state qualified interior designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asid.org/NR/rdonlyres/81D9C044-3010-4FE2-9519-4E9A438A272F0/LegPositiononletterhead.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725021115/http://www.asid.org/NR/rdonlyres/81D9C044-3010-4FE2-9519-4E9A438A272F0/LegPositiononletterhead.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amphitrite, the wave and the sea birds''''' ({{lang-no| Amfitrite, bølgen og havfuglene}}) is a {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[stainless steel]] sculpture by [[Jørleif Uthaug]] located in [[Porsgrunn]], Norway.  The work consists of a nude female figure (representing [[Amphitrite]], the wife of [[Neptune]]) and two [[seabird]]s gliding over a large [[Geometric abstraction|geometric]] wave.  It is one of Uthaug's most recognizable and celebrated works.&lt;ref name="uthaug"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uthaug.net/jorleif/hovedverk01.php |title=Bølgen, Amfitrite og sjøfuglene |work=Uthaug |accessdate=8 March 2013 |language=Norwegian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222113710/http://www.uthaug.net/jorleif/hovedverk01.php |archive-date=22 December 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Jørleif Uthaug |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Svein |last=Aamold |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/J%C3%B8rleif_Uthaug/utdypning |date=13 February 2009 |language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece, which was unveiled in May 1985, is one of only a few Uthaug sculptures to include [[Figurative art|figurative]] elements, but it also displays many features typical of Uthaug's work, including [[Modern sculpture|modern style]], [[Sculpture#Metal|metal construction]], and themes of [[sailing|seafaring]] and the ocean.&lt;ref name="uthaug"/&gt; The sculpture was initially located in Nordentorget, a [[town square]] on Storgata in central Porsgrunn.  In spring of 1999, it was moved behind the then-[[Aetat]] building on ''Strandpromenaden'', a [[Foreshoreway|riverwalk]] along the eastern bank of [[Skiensvassdraget|Porsgrunn River]], where it still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bølgen har funnet hjem |author=Kyrre Jansen |url=http://www.pd.no/lokale_nyheter/article5596777.ece |newspaper=[[Porsgrunns Dagblad]] |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
[[File:Jørleif uthaug amfitrite 2.jpg|thumb|250px|The sculpture as seen from another angle.]]
In 1977, the city of Porsgrunn held a competition to determine who would create a new sculpture in Nordentorget square.  Uthaug was at that point an established sculptor in the Norwegian art world, having studied at the [[Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry]] under the likes of [[Axel Revold]], [[Per Krohg]], and [[Jean Heiberg]], and he was well known for his public artworks such as the [[relief]] ''[[Tromsøveggen|People on a beach]]'' (1961) in [[Troms]] County Hall and the steel sculpture ''Expansion'' (1977) for [[Mandal, Norway|Mandal]] City Hall.  He prepared drawings for the sculpture and submitted them to the competition.&lt;ref name="nbl"/&gt;

The next year, the competition jury selected Jørleif Uthaug's proposed artwork out of a very competitive pool of applicants, including one proposal by noted sculptor [[Fritz Røed]].  The jury said of the work, "The sculpture's symbolism is good and the jury would find it well suited to a city like Porsgrunn with its maritime historical background.  The daring and fanciful solution seems original ... and the contrast between the large curved plane and the figures is resolved in a successful way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parmann |first=Øistein |authorlink=Øistein Parmann |title=Jørleif Uthaug: robust, praktglad, primitiv, raffinert |year=1981 |publisher=Dreyer |location= |isbn=82-09-01919-8 |pages=74–75 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2011 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Porsgrunn finalized their contract with Jørleif Uthaug in 1981.  However, in January 1981 Uthaug was involved in a traffic collision which left him partially [[paralysis|paralyzed]].  Despite several attempts to work on the sculpture with the help of assistants, his temporary paralysis led to the work being postponed for several years.&lt;ref name="uthaug"/&gt;

The steel wave form was made to Uthaug's specifications at Hamy Sveis AS in [[Oslo]] under the leadership of engineer Einar Aurskog.  The figures were created and welded to the wave by Uthaug himself once he was in good health.  The sculpture was unveiled on 11 May 1985 by [[Lars Roar Langslet]], the Norwegian [[Minister of Culture (Norway)|Minister of Cultural and Scientific Affairs]].  Langslet said of the unveiling, "I remember how happy Jørleif Uthaug seemed when this magnificent monument was finally in place.  Perhaps he saw it as a sign that he was finally back on track as a creative artist, with the steel wave's power and the seabirds' flight in his mind's eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Skulptur, maleri, grafikk |accessdate=8 March 2013 |date=19 November 1990 |publisher=Galleri Erik Steen |location=Oslo}} Catalog to the Jørleif Uthaug exhibition in Galleri Steen from 30 Aug to 28 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Architectural model condo highrise.jpg|right|thumb|An architectural model promoting a highrise condominium]]

An '''architectural model''' is a type of [[scale model]] - a physical representation of a structure - built to study aspects of an [[Architecture|architectural design]] or to communicate design ideas.

Depending on the purpose, models can be made from a variety of materials, including blocks, paper, and wood, and at a variety of scales.

==Purpose==

[[File:Pn-ushomirsky-1986-1.jpg|thumb|right|Project managers discuss the plant development using an architectural model]]

Architectural models are used by architects for a range of purposes:
* [[Ad hoc]] models, or sketch models, are sometimes made to study the interaction of volumes, different viewpoints, or concepts during the design process. They may also be useful in explaining a complicated or unusual design to builders, or as a focus for discussion between designers and consultants such as architects, engineers and town planners.
* Presentation models can be used to exhibit, visualise or sell a final design. A model are also used as show pieces, for instance as a feature in the reception of a building, or as part of a museum exhibition such as scale replicas of historical buildings.

Types of models include:
* Exterior models are models of buildings which usually include some landscaping or civic spaces around the building.
* Interior models are models showing interior space planning, finishes, colors, furniture and beautification.
* Landscaping design models are models of landscape design and development representing features such as walkways, small bridges, pergolas, vegetation patterns and beautification. Landscaping design models usually represent public spaces and may, in some cases, include buildings as well.
* Urban models are models typically built at a much smaller scale (starting from 1:500 and less, 1:700, 1:1000, 1:1200, 1:2000, 1:20 000), representing several city blocks, even a whole town or village, large resort, campus, industrial facility, military base and so on. Urban models are a vital tool for town/city planning and development. Urban models of large urban areas are displayed at museums such as the [[Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center]], [[Queens Museum]] in New York, the [[Beijing Planning Exhibition Hall]], and the [[Singapore City Gallery]].
* Engineering and construction models show isolated building/structure elements and components and their interaction.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Virtual modeling==
Buildings are increasingly designed in software with CAD ([[computer-aided design]]) systems. Early virtual modelling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space, mainly to produce technical drawings. Modern packages include advanced features such as databases of components, automated engineering calculations, visual fly-throughs, dynamic reflections, and accurate textures and colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.MoHinh.VN/ |title=What is Architectural Visualisation? |website=Flying 3D |access-date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.MoHinh.VN |title=What is Accurate Visual Representation? |website=Flying 3D |access-date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an extension to CAD ([[computer-aided design]]) and BIM ([[building information modeling |building information modelling]]), virtual reality architectural sessions are also being adopted at increasingly faster rates. As this technology enables participants to be immersed in a 1:1 scale model, essentially experiencing the building before it is even being built.

==Materials==
Rough study models can be made quickly using cardboard, wooden blocks, polystyrene, foam, foam boards and other materials. Such models are an efficient [[design tool]] for three-dimensional understanding of a structure, space or form, used by architects, interior designers and exhibit designers.

Common materials used for centuries in architectural model building were card stock, [[balsa wood]], [[basswood]] and other woods. Modern professional architectural model builders are taking advantage of twenty-first century materials, such as [[Taskboard]] (a flexible and lightweight wood/fiber board), plastics, wooden and wooden-plastic composites, foams, [[foamcore|foam board]] and urethane compounds.
 
A number of companies produce ready-made pieces for structural components (e.g. girders, beams), siding, furniture, figures (people), vehicles, trees, bushes and other features which are found in the models. Features such as vehicles, people figurines, trees, street lights and other are called "scenery elements" and serve not only to beautify the model, but also to help the observer to obtain a correct feel of scale and proportions represented by the model.

Increasingly, [[rapid prototyping]] techniques such as [[3D printing]] and [[CNC router|CNC routing]] are used to automatically construct models straight from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ian Gibson, Thomas Kvan, Ling Wai Ming | date = 2002 | title = Rapid prototyping for architectural models |  journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–95 | doi = 10.1108/13552540210420961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Scales==

Architectural models are being constructed at much smaller [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] than their 1:1 counterpart.

The scales and their architectural use is broadly as follows:
*1:1	Full (or real) size for	details
*1:2	Details
*1:5	Details
*1:10	Interior spaces/furniture
*1:20	Interior spaces/furniture
*1:50	[https://www.rjmodels.com.hk/interior-model Interior spaces]/detailed floor plans/different floor levels
*1:100	Building plans/layouts
*1:200	Building plans/layouts
*1:500	Building layouts/site plans
*1:1000	Urban scale for site or location plans
*1:1250	Site plans
*1:2500	Site plans/city maps
*1:5000	City maps/Island 

Sometimes model railroad scales such as [[1:160 scale|1:160]] and [[1:87 scale|1:87]] are used due to ready availability of commercial figures, vehicles and trees in those scales, and models of large buildings are most often built in approximately that range of scales due to size considerations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11665">The '''Art Workers' Coalition''' (AWC) was an open coalition of artists, filmmakers, writers, critics, and museum staff that formed in [[New York, New York|New York City]] in January 1969. Its principal aim was to pressure the city's museums – notably the [[MoMA|Museum of Modern Art]] – into implementing economic and political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://artsandlabor.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Lippard_AWC.pdf|title = The Art Workers Coalition: Not a History|last = Lippard|first = Lucy|date = November 1970|journal = Studio International|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included a more open and less exclusive exhibition policy concerning the artists they exhibited and promoted: the absence of women artists and artists of color was a principal issue of contention, which led to the formation of [[Women Artists in Revolution]] (WAR) in 1969. The coalition successfully pressured the MoMA and other museums into implementing a free admission day that still exists in certain museums to this day. It also pressured and picketed museums into taking a moral stance on the [[Vietnam War]] which resulted in its famous [[My Lai]] poster ''[[And babies]]'', one of the most important works of political art of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Workers, Radical Practice in the Vietnam War Era|last = Bryan-Wilson|first = Julia|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Berkeley|pages = |url = http://www.darkmatterarchives.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Bryan-Wilson-Art-Workers-excerpt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poster was displayed during demonstrations in front of [[Pablo Picasso]]′s [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] at the MoMA in 1970.

==Origins==

The AWC grew out of an incident at MoMA during the exhibition curated by [[Pontus Hulten]], ''The Machine at the End of the Mechanical Age'': on January 3, 1969, Greek [[Kinetic art|kinetic sculptor]] [[Takis]], with the support of friends, physically removed his work from the exhibition. Although the work, ''Tele-sculpture'' (1960), had been purchased by the MoMA in 1963 and thus belonged to its permanent collection, Takis was unhappy with the museum's lack of consultation in choosing a work for exhibition which he considered no longer adequately represented his current artistic practice. The artist took his work into the museum's sculpture garden and remained there until he received confirmation from museum officials that his work would be withdrawn from the exhibition. The incident led to a series of meetings held at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] in which the group that had supported Takis's action discussed issues relating to the political and social responsibility of the art community.  The group included Takis, [[United States|American]] kinetic sculptor [[Wen-Ying Tsai]], [[Germany|German]] [[conceptual artist]] [[Hans Haacke]], American writer and independent curator [[Willoughby Sharp]], co-founder of ''Avalanche'' [[Liza Bear]], American artist and ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' [[art critic]] [[John Perreault]], and American [[Minimalism|minimalist]] artist [[Carl Andre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

# A section of the Museum, under the direction of black artists, should be devoted to showing the accomplishments of Black artists. 
# The Museum's activities should be extended into the Black, Spanish and other communities. It should also encourage exhibits with which these groups can identify. 
# A committee of artists with curatorial responsibilities should be set up annually to arrange exhibits. 
# The Museum should be open on two evenings until midnight and admission should be free at all times. 
# Artists should be paid a rental fee for the exhibition of their works. 
# The Museum should recognize an artist's right to refuse showing a work owned by the Museum in any exhibition other than one of the Museum's permanent collection. 
# The Museum should declare its position on copyright legislation and the proposed arts proceeds act. It should also take active steps to inform artists of their legal rights. 
# A registry of artists should be instituted at the Museum. Artists who wish to be registered should supply the Museum with documentation of their work, in the form of photographs, news clippings, etc., and this material should be added to the existing artists' files. 
# The Museum should exhibit experimental works requiring unique environmental conditions at locations outside the Museum. 
# A section of the Museum should be permanently devoted to showing the works of artists without galleries. 
# The Museum should include among its staff persons qualified to handle the installation and maintenance of technological works. The Museum should appoint a responsible person to handle any grievances arising from its dealings with artists. 
==Subsequent Activities==

Upon receiving AWC's 13 Demands, MoMA met and held a dialogue with artist representatives from AWC that was publicly acknowledged. Lowry and MoMA, however, refused to meet all of the specific demands of the AWC, such as the demand to hold a public hearing on the topic "The Museum's Relationship to Artists and to Society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/art-workers-coalition-demonstrates-artists-rights-1969|title=Art Workers’ Coalition demonstrates for artists’ rights, 1969 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After organizing a number of demonstrations in front of the museum, the group held an open hearing at the New York [[School of Visual Arts]] on 10 April 1969. The event was retitled "What Should Be the Program of The Art Workers Regarding Museum Reform, and to Establish the Program of the Art Workers' Coalition." Some three hundred artists and members of the New York art community attended the hearing. The initial demands that had been made to the MoMA were debated within the larger group that formed during the open hearing, and later refined and addressed to all New York Museums. Artists and critics subsequently debated various subjects of contention including artists' rights, museum policy and broader political issues including the [[Vietnam War]]. On 15 October 1969, the AWC organized a successful "[[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] of Art to End the [[War in Vietnam]]." The MoMA, the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] and a large number of commercial [[art gallery|art galleries]] closed for the day. The [[Metropolitan Museum]] and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] did not comply, although, under pressure from the AWC, the Metropolitan did postpone the opening of its American painting and sculpture show scheduled for that day, while the Guggenheim was picketed. The coalition's activities eventually led to changes in how museums interact with artists, a contribution to the art world that is considered lasting in spite of the coalition's short three-year existence. The AWC ceased its activities at the end of 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Arts administration''' (alternatively '''arts management''') is the field that concerns [[business operations]] around an [[arts]] organization.  Arts administrators are responsible for facilitating the day-to-day operations of the [[organization]] and fulfilling its mission. Arts organizations include professional non-profit entities (e.g. theaters, museums, symphonies, jazz organizations, opera houses, and ballet companies) and many smaller professional and non-professional for-profit arts-related organizations (e.g. auction houses, art galleries, music companies, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of an arts administrator can include [[staff management]], marketing, budget management, public relations, fundraising, program development and evaluation, and board relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/artsadministrator.aspx|title = Job profiles: Arts administrator|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = National Careers Service|publisher = Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, UK|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/careers/management-arts-administrators|title = Career: Arts Administrators|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = Big Future|publisher = College Board|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts administrators==
Art administrators (alternatively '''arts managers''') work for arts and cultural organizations such as theatres, symphonies, "...art [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museums]], arts festivals, arts centers, arts councils, regional arts boards, [[dance]] companies, community arts organizations, disability arts organizations, and local authorities."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;idno=61&amp;pageno=1 Arts administrator: Job description and activities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An arts administrator in a small organization may do [[marketing]], event booking, and handle financial issues. An arts administrator for a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), other administrative staff, [[public relations]], marketing, and writing reports.

A senior-level arts administrator may advise the [[board of directors]] or other senior managers on "strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal [[public policy]] as it relates to [[human resources]], [[health insurance]], [[labor laws]] and volunteer risk management."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"/&gt;

There are several notable professionals in the field. [[Philippe de Montebello]] was curator of New York City's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1977-2008. On his retirement, he was both the longest-serving director in the institution's history and the longest-serving director of any major art museum in the world. [[Michael Maddox]] co-founded the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow, home to [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and [[Bolshoi Opera]], which are amongst the oldest and grandest ballet and opera companies in the world.  Another notable figure in arts administration is John Lane of John Lane's Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine.  Lane acquired the playhouse in 1950 and successfully ran the organization, still considered to be "America's foremost summer theatre," until his retirement in 1994.

==Issues in arts administration==
Like any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.

Although a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times.

==Academic programs==
Arts administration programs are available at a number of universities and colleges in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;!-- No others? --&gt;   In the United States, these programs began in the 1970s at several schools after meetings with the National Endowment for the Arts on how the next generations of arts leaders would be educated.  Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.

Arts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.

At some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts Management Degree Programs &amp; Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|url = http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|website = www.american.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|url = https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|url = http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|website = theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while it's undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.

Though curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent "in the field", applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual &amp; Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual &amp; performing arts centers.

Most programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency. The [http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program University of Kentucky] and [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] offer fully online degrees in arts administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online M.A. Program {{!}} College of Fine Arts|url = http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program|website = finearts.uky.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts administration|url = https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/arts-administration|accessdate = 2015-04-06|website = SCAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accommodate full-time employment, provide strong networking opportunities, and many teamwork opportunities, programs such as [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University] have adopted a cohort model and offer classes on evenings and weekends.

Some programs offer dual degrees.  For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.

Other programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.

Some programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs.

Several universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management. New York University's MA in Arts Administration program allows students to choose a visual arts or a performing arts focus.

Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues.  As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.

Arts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.  &lt;ref&gt;Gates, Leslie. “Professional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago.” Vol. 52, no. 1, 2010, pp. 6–17., {{jstor|25746078}} Accessed 16 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
The '''''Arzhang''''' (''Aržang'', a [[Parthian language|Parthian]] word meaning "Worthy"; also known as '''''Book of Pictures''''') was one of the holy books of [[Manichaeism]]. It was written and illustrated by its prophet, [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. It was unique as a sacred text in that it contained numerous pictures designed to portray the events in the Manichaean description of the creation and history of the world, which were regarded as integral to the text.  In Islamic tradition Mani was regarded as an artist by profession.

The book has been lost and its content is unknown. However, it is known that its illustrations were of appreciable quality, and copies were preserved in the Middle East as late as 1092 AD, when it is recorded that the library of [[Ghazni]] held a copy.

In addition, ''[[Arzhang Div|Arzhang]]'' is the name of the [[daeva]] (demon) in [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]] who takes [[Kay Kāvus]] to [[Mazanderan]], and whom [[Rostam]] defeats in his sixth trial.

The '''Council for the Historic Environment''' was a non government body established in 1977 in [[Victoria, Australia]], to investigate, record and advice on heritage and building conservation. It was formed by a group of heritage professionals. academics and government bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21789212?selectedversion=NBD3014960 Council for the Historic Environment, 1978, ''Constitution'', Council for the Historic Environment (Vic.) http://books.google.com.au/books/about/Constitution.html?id=wyWEmgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt; this was perhaps the first such group in Australia, which aimed to codify and raise the standard of professional practice amongst archaeologists, architects, engineers, historians, planners, etc.

John Murphy was the first President of the Council in 1977, with the inaugural meeting taking place in Phyllis and John's Hawthorn home. [[David Beauchamp]] is thought to have been the first Chairman with [[Neil Clerehan]] Chairman 1977-80 and President subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unimelb.edu.au/unisec/calendar/honcausa/citation/clerehan.pdf CITATION FOR HONORARY DOCTORATE OF ARCHITECTURE, MR NEIL CLEREHAN, BArch Melb FRMIT LFRAIA]&lt;/ref&gt; Graeme Butler was the founding Secretary and later Editor of the Council Journal, Historic Environment, which launched in 1980. Other office bearers included Miles Lewis (President),  Helen Weston (Chair, Secretary, editor of Chen Chen, the Council newsletter), Ray Tonkin, Craig Wilson and Chris Smith  (Secretary), Robert Knott and Wendy Jacobs (Treasurer).

Formed as a break-away group from the National Trust of Victoria, the Council was made up of expert panels with each member with recognised expertise assigned to an appropriate panel, as follows:&lt;br&gt;
Architectural History, 20th Century Architecture;&lt;br&gt;
Architectural, Restoration, Preservation Technology;&lt;br&gt;
Conservation Planning, Urban History and Geography;&lt;br&gt;
Interior Design; and&lt;br&gt;
Landscape Planning.

The Panel member list from 1979 reads as a Who's Who of heritage practice in the 1970s-90s:

Although always focussing on process, the Council was active in early heritage battles such as the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in Melbourne, which was proposed for demolition at the time, as well as the fight to preserve [[Carlton, Victoria]]. It also published a journal, ''[[Historic Environment]]'', which was the first peer reviewed heritage focussed publication in Australia, and remains the primary outlet for discussion and debate on heritage matters in Australia. With the growth of [[Australia ICOMOS]], state heritage bodies such as the [[Historic Buildings Council]], later becoming [[Heritage Victoria]], the Council for the Historic Environment merged with Australia ICOMOS. The Council successfully promoted the formation of an architectural drawing collection at the State Library of Victoria with a pilot survey of selected architectural practices in 1985-6. An architectural guidebook to the Melbourne region was also commenced but never reached finality.

Following is a list of annual general meetings 1978-1984, speakers and the meeting venues as an indication of the variety and thrust of the organisation:
* 1978 Hon Robert Maclellan, MLC Minister for Labour and Industry at the Former Rechabite Hall, Clarence Street, Prahran
* 1979 John Mitchell, Melbourne City Councillor at Boojums Restaurant Rathdowne Street, North Carlton
* 1980 Andrew Lemmon, Local historian, King Solomon's Restaurant, Nicholson Street, North Fitzroy
* 1981 Peter Staughton, Restoration architect, Comedy Cafe Brunswick. Street, Fitzroy
* 1982 Graham Ihlein MP (filling in for Hon Evan Walker,Minister for Planning) at Young and Jacksons, Melbourne
* 1983 Professor Graeme Davidson Historian, Monash University at the newly renovated Heidelberg Town Hall Ivanhoe
* 1984 Dimity Reed Deputy Manager, Ministry for Housing, Nettleton House Restaurant at the Alma Complex Abbotsford

The Council also conducted a number of tours across Victoria focussing on the various panels expertise such as industrial archaeology, architecture, heritage interiors and landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5608">The '''Cresson Traveling Scholarship''', also known as the '''William Emlen Cresson Memorial Traveling Scholarship''', is a two-year scholarship for foreign travel and/or study awarded annually to art students at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Awarded for excellence, the prize was funded by Emlen and Priscilla Cresson in memory of their son William Emlen Cresson, an Academy alumnus who died in 1868 at the age of 23.  He had been a child prodigy painter who began exhibiting at the Academy at the age of 11.&lt;ref&gt;James-Gadzinski, Susan and Mary Mullen Cunningham, ‘’American Sculpture in the Museum of American Art of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts’’, Museum of American Art of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, 1997 p. 65 - 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Cresson Traveling Scholarships were awarded in 1902. Initially, they were $1,000 one-year scholarships, renewable for a second year, and sometimes beyond. Multiple awards were given in painting, along with one in sculpture and one in architecture. Awards in illustration were added later.

Cresson European Scholarships of $5000 for summer travel, were also awarded annually. These were not as prestigious as the two-year scholarships, with which they are often confused. 

[[Laura Wheeler Waring]], the first African-American woman to win a Cresson Traveling Scholarship, was studying in Paris in 1914 when [[World War I]] broke out. Subsequent winners were allowed to postpone their travel until the conflict was over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rd0T303qF90C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=winners+%22Cresson+Traveling+Scholarship%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kOV98S13_a&amp;sig=5D1uMx0no6CYXqaOMCoiVQApHyU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gc9oUfDBHea-2AXchIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=winners%20%22Cresson%20Traveling%20Scholarship%22&amp;f=false Pennsylvania impressionism - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vikrambhai and amma .jpg|thumb|Founder of Darpana Academy Dr. Vikram Sarabhai and Mrinalini Sarabhai]]

The Darpana Academy of Performing Arts was founded in Ahmedabad, [[Gujarat]], [[India]] by [[Vikram Sarabhai]] and his wife [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darpana Academy Official Blog|url=http://darpanaacademy.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = In conversation with danseuse Mallika Sarabhai |work= The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/dance/in-conversation-with-danseuse-mallika-sarabhai/article7814196.ece |first=G.

The work in using arts foe social change began at Darpana in the 1960s. Darpana’s puppeteers started working with the central ministry of rural development in teaching village women the use of smokeless stove. The theatre department then run by [[Kailash Pandya]] created a play called Ma to rally people to the war effort. [[Mrinalini Sarabhai]], in a radical departure from the spiritual core of the classical [[Bharat Natyam]] used the style to talk of the horror of dowry violence. Over the years two departments were established to focus the work of using the arts for change. Darpana for Dvelopment in 1980, today run by actor activist [[Jignesh Patel]], and Darpana Communication in 2001 run by film maker [[Yadavan Chandran]]. In addition, in 2009 CRANTI(Citizens Resource and Action Initiative)was formed to give practical guidance to citizen to use the laws and tools available to them to fight their own battles, and to train people in the use of the Right To Information Act to solve daily problems of access and justice, run by Bharatsinh Jhala. 
During the last three decades, these departments have worked on over 51 projects all over India, reaching out to over 12.5 million people. The work has been in areas ranging from [[public health]], [[women’s empowerment]], [[gender issues and education to the environment]], [[human rights]], [[communal harmony]], [[good governance]], citizen’s participation in democracy, race, [[gender and disability]]. Through the use of television and film, theatrical and [[street performances]], [[quizzes]] and [[debates]], [[puppets]] and [[board games]]. They have been able to effectively talk about a range of sensitive issues from [[women and violence]], to [[religious intolerance]], the [[Natural environment|environment]], [[human rights]], [[corruption]] and [[justice]].

The academy received [[UNESCO]] sponsorship to offer Artist Residency programs in 1999-2000 and 2005-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapport Du Directeur General Sur Les Activites Du Fonds International Pour La Promotion De La Culture (1998-1999)|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001170/117026f.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|page=9|language=French|date=27 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bursaries for Artists Program UNESCO-Aschberg 2005-2006|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001376/137683m.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = India - Darpana Academy of Performing Arts|work= UNESCO| url = http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7211&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | accessdate = 2016-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201932/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7211&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-date=3 March 2016

==Activities==
[[File:Darpana Academy .jpg|thumb|dance academy]]
The academy offers courses in Indian classical dance [[Bharatanatyam]], Indian Classical Vocal, [[Mridangam]], Violin and Flute, puppetry and martial art [[ Kalaripayattu]]. Its departments range from performance and teaching of the arts, to the use of performance and arts as development communication, through face-to-face impact and software production.

The Drama Section, under acting duo [[Kailash Pandya]] and [[Damini Mehta]], is responsible for more than 100 productions of a wide variety. 

Darpana attracted young writers and staged their first scripts, making them an integral part of production efforts. Some of the names can be mentioned as [[Madhu Rye]], [[Labhshankar Thakar]], [[Shrikant Shah]], [[Subhash Shah]], [[Chinu Modi]], and [[Hasmukh Baradi]]. It also conducted theatre-training courses for over two decades.

Its research wing, Janvak, published monographs like Goverdhan Panchal's on [[Bhavai]]. Darpana has also built an experimental thrust auditorium, Natrani, reminiscent of Greek amphitheatres, on the banks of the river Sabarmati.

'''Depiction''' is reference conveyed through pictures. Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a [[picture plane]] and may be constructed according to [[descriptive geometry]] where they are usually divided between ''projections'' (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and ''perspectives'' (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Robert Hopkins (1998), "Picture, Image, Experience" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. 
 
Objects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane – a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern.

But just ''how'' pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below.

== Resemblance ==

Traditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a [[mimesis|mimetic]] element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough.

Theories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x).&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Hopkins (1998), Christopher Peacocke (1987) 'Depiction', in Philosophical Review 96(3):383-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.&lt;ref&gt;John Hyman (2012), 'Depiction', in Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 71:129-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms "[[realism (arts)|realism]]", [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]]", or "[[illusionism]]".

== Illusion ==

The most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960) ''Art and Illusion'' (Oxford: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1963) Meditations on a Hobbyhorse (Oxford, Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. ''The Image and the Eye'' (Oxford and New York: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in [[visual perception]] are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960): pp 80-98, (1982): pp 278–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference.

But whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from [[James J. Gibson]], R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also [[perspective (graphical)]]. Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best.

Gombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art,&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1995), The Story Of Art 16th ed. (London: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Willats, John, (1997), ''Art and Representation: New Principles In The Analysis Of Pictures'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (1995), pp. 133, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual invariants ==

A more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist [[James J. Gibson]],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J., 'The Ecological approach to Visual Perception in Pictures' Leonardo, 1978, 11, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment.

Gibson's view of depiction concerns the re-presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance

== Seeing-in ==

A similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art [[Richard Wollheim]]. He calls it 'twofoldness'.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard (1987), ''Painting as an Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson) pp 46-7, 72-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of [[Dominic Lopes]]&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Dominic (2005), Sight and Sensibility: Evaluating Pictures (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Bence Nanay]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanay, Bence (2005), 'Is Twofoldness Necessary for Representational Seeing?', British Journal of Aesthetics 45(3): 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply ''is'' the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation.

Wollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim (1987), pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur.

Wollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains.

== Other psychological resources ==

The appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Robert (1998), Picture, Image, and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Schier&lt;ref&gt;Schier, Flint (1986), Deeper Into Pictures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall (1990), Mimesis as Make-believe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference.

For example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that – books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stephanie (1971), 'Caricature', The Monist 58: pp 285-93.&lt;/ref&gt; So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles.

Schier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model.

== Notation ==
Reversing orthodoxy, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson (1968), Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notation&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson and Elgin, Catherine Z, (1988) Reconceptions in Philosophy (London and New York: Routledge) p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation without notation lacks sense.

Nevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John Kulvicki&lt;ref&gt;Kulvicki, John (2006), On Images: Their structure and content (Oxford: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by art historian James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation.

== Pictorial semiotics ==

Pictorial [[semiotics]] aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles Sanders - (1931-58), Collected Papers I-VIII. Hartshorne, C, Weiss, P, &amp; Burks, A, (eds.) (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; 1931–58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as [[Roland Barthes]]&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general [[iconography]].

A later adherent, Göran Sonesson,&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (1989), Pictorial Concepts: Inquiries into the semiotic heritage and its relevance for the analysis of the visual world. (Lund: Aris/Lund University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (2001), 'Iconicity strikes back: the third generation – or why Eco is still wrong'. VISIO 9: 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John M. (1974) The Psychology of Picture Perception (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass).&lt;/ref&gt; N. H. Freeman&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H. and Cox, M. V. (eds.) (1985), Visual Order: The Nature and Development of Pictorial Representation (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H., Evans, D., and Willats, J. (1988) Symposium overview: the computational approach to projection drawing-systems. (Budapest, Paper given at Third European Conference on Developmental Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt; and David Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1977), 'Analysis of occluding outline', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 197 441-475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marr, David (1978), 'Representing visual information: a computational approach.' in Computer Vision, A. R. Hanson and E. M. Riseman (eds.) Academic Press, New York and London, pp. 61-80.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to detect underlying structure. Sonesson accepts 'seeing-in',&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (Revised August 2006), 'Current issues in pictorial semiotics. Lecture three: From the Critique of the Iconicity Critique to Pictorality' . Third conference of a series published online at the Semiotics Institute Online. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although prefers Edmund Husserl's version.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1928), Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins. Halle. (Republished in Husserliana X, The Hague: Nijhoff, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1980), Phantasie, Bildbewusstsein, Erinnerung, Husserliana XXIII. (The Hague: Nijhoff).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth.

==Deixis==
The art historian [[Norman Bryson]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaz, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, '[[deixis]]'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The [[Gaze]]' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium-specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#Icon, index, symbol|signs introduced by Peirce]].

Deixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance.

==Iconography==
Lastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent.

The distinguished art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin (1955) Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar [[W. J. T. Mitchell]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1980), The Language of Images (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1986), Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1994), Picture Theory (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation.

Iconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental.

==Other issues==
Dozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T. J.|last2=Greenwood|first2=Keith|date=2016-03-08|title=Beyond Framing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator’s intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management.

Other debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], how understanding novel depictions is possible, the [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] value of depiction and the nature of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in pictorial [[art]].

[[File:Franz Marc-The fate of the animals-1913.jpg|thumb|right|325px| Franz Marc, ''Fate of the Animals'', 1913.
Oil on Canvas, 1950 × 2680&amp;nbsp;mm (6&amp;nbsp;ft {{frac|4|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;in × 8&amp;nbsp;ft {{frac|9|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in) Kunstmuseum, Basel.]]
'''''Fate of the Animals''''' is a painting by [[Franz Marc]] created in 1913. It is oil on canvas. This work contrasts most of Marc's other works by presenting animals in a brutal way rather than depicting them in a peaceful manner. Marc's strong ties with animals as his subjects remains uncertain, but it is predicted to stem from his childhood dog.&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;Wolf, Marion. “Biblia omnii: Timeliness and Timelessness in the Work of Franz Marc.” ''Art Journal'' 33, no.3 (1974): 226-30.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|226}} ''Fate of the Animals'' remains one of Marc's most famous pieces and displays [[Der Blaue Reiter]] style that he co-founded with [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. The painting currently resides in the Kunstmuseum in Basel, Switzerland.

The last third of the painting was damaged in a warehouse fire in 1916 after Marc's death and was later restored by one of his close friends, [[Paul Klee]].&lt;ref&gt;“Animal Destinies (the trees show their rings, the animals their veins),” Kunstmuseum, accessed September 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Klee restored the painting using old photographs. He added a brownish tint to the paint creating an obvious variation from the rest of the painting. Scholars have yet to figure out his decision to paint with a brown tint. Many opinions on the subject have been given, although none have been proven.

==Title and subject==
The title of the work is known as ''Fate of the Animals'' in English. This stems from the German name ''Tierschicksale'' which figuratively translates to animal destinies. [[Paul Klee]] is also known for suggesting an alternate title: ''The trees show their rings, the animals their veins.'' This is from the evident tree rings present as well as the green horse on the right whose veins are visible on its body. On the back of the canvas is believed to be the subtitle of the painting, which translates to "And all being is flaming suffering."

''Fate of the Animals'''s title derives from the chaotic scene depicted. There are animals scattered throughout the canvas in what is referred to as a post apocalyptic setting. The scene depicts a forest that is being destroyed by the flames that are evident all around. The painting consists of a blue deer in the middle of the canvas, two boars on the left side, two horses above the boars, and four unidentified figures on the right. The four unidentified animals are believed to be either deer, foxes, or wolves. Most scholars believe that the animals are deer based on Marc's older works where he depicts them with the same colors and physical attributes.&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;Levine, Frederick S. “Iconography of Franz Marc's Fate of the Animals.” ''Art Bulletin'' 58, no.6 (1976): 269-77.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}}

It is a premonition to [[World War I]] that Marc experienced living in Germany. The brutality of the animals lives at the depicted moment reflected what the oncoming war would be doing to the people of the world. The destruction, the chaos, and the sadness that the viewer sees sums up the evident outcome the future war would bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MCZVPim3SA&amp;t=8m35s |2= |date=July 20, 2014 |author=Millennial Woes |title=Our Animal Destinies: The Art of Franz Marc (Part 1) (Millennial Woes, aged 15) |publisher=[[YouTube]] }}{{Additional citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
The painting contains only diagonal lines. The lack of horizontal and vertical lines throughout the painting along with the deep colors, create tension. This tension further highlights the chaos and violence of the animals lives. These diagonals are emphasized in three primary ways: composition order, diagonal posture of the animals, and “the animal’s position in conformity with the diagonals."&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;{{rp|226}} The diagonals also help with the narration by acting as fire sparks scattering across the canvas.

Marc's paintings had a reoccurring theme of colors that represented certain things.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred, and Christin Mamiya. Gardner's Art Through the Ages. Cengage Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|969}} Blue would represent males and the severity and spirituality that they held. Yellow would depict females and their sensual and gentle side. Red would represent matter and the heaviness and brutality it held. Franz Marc makes use of these colors in ''Fate of the Animals'' to further his ongoing theme of colors. The blue deer in the middle is a male that holds a lot of spirituality. Some scholars believe that the blue deer is seen as a sacrifice, whose color and up-looking posture further prove.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;{{rp|270}}

==Narration==
A forest fire is shown with many animals in the chaos. The scene starts at the top left corner where there are three main sparks present. These sparks of fire are coming from an unknown source and will begin to ignite more of the fire and most of the animals. Under the horse there are many diagonals painted red. This is the first of the sparks to ignite the ground under the horses. The horse on the left has a face of agony and is crying out. The horse on the right is more accepting of his fate of oncoming death and looks away from the fire.

The next spark to hit is the tan line that is right across the blue deers neck. It misses the blue deer and heads towards the boars in the bottom left of the painting. The boars are accepting their evident death from the flame. The boars are turned away from the flame coming straight towards them and they both have a sad face.

The last main spark to hit is the larger red diagonal that is behind the blue deer. Again this spark misses the deer and lands to ignite the ground behind him. The main large diagonals going across the canvas from the top middle to the bottom right is a tree. This tree is falling on the deer and his dramatic posture with his head up. It is another acceptance of fate for the animals.

The four animals on the right are the only animals that are completely safe from any harm. There are no sparks heading towards them and no trees about to fall on them. There is no certainty as to why these animals were chosen as the only beings safe from the harm of the destructive forest.&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;{{rp|271}}

==Marc's depiction of animals==
Along with Marc's reoccurring themes of colors, he would also depict animals in the same manners. Deer were sacred animals to Marc. He usually painted them, like most of his animals, in a very peaceful manner. His works such as ''Grazing Horses IV (The Red Horses)'', ''The Yellow Cow'', and ''Dog Lying in Snow'' depict animals in a peaceful setting. ''Fate of the Animals'' provides a contrast to his normal depiction of animals, in which he puts his beloved animals in a scene of destruction.

The only animal to not remain consistent throughout Marc's works was horses. They ranged anywhere from sacred, aspiring, to human-like and everywhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Mark. Franz Marc. New York: Prestel, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} This could explain why the only animal that shows its veins is one of the horses.

{{other uses|ID (disambiguation)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}

'''''idem.''''' is a [[Latin]] term meaning "the same".  It is commonly [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] as '''''id.''''',
which is particularly used in legal citations to denote the previously cited source (compare ''[[ibid.]]''). It is also used in academic citations to replace the name of a repeated author. 

''Id.'' is employed extensively in [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Law of Canada|legislation]] and in [[United states legislative branch|legal documents of the United States]] to apply a short description to a section with the same focus as the previous.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. 9th circuit appeals court|title=9th circuit appeals court - opinion of judges (9 Feb 2017) - State of Washington v. Donald J.Trump|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf|website=www.cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Id'' is masculine and neuter;  '''''ead.''''' (feminine), is the abbreviation for '''''eadem''''', which also translates to "the same". 

As an abbreviation, ''Id.'' always takes a period (or full stop) in both British and American usage (see [[Full stop#Abbreviations and personal titles of address|usage of the full stop in abbreviations]]). Its first known use dates back to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of ''Idem'' |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/idem |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |location=[[Springfield, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary}}

==Use==
===Legal===
*''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte'', 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976).
*''Id.'' at 547.

Here, the first citation refers to the case of ''United States v. Martinez-Fuerte.'' The volume number cited is 428 and the page on which the case begins is 543, and the page number cited to is 545.  The "U.S." between the numerical portions of the citation refers to the ''[[United States Reports]]''. 1976 refers to the year that the case was published.  The second citation references the first citation and automatically incorporates the same reporter and volume number; however, the page number cited is now 547. ''Id.'' refers to the immediately preceding citation, so if the previous citation includes more than one reference, or it is unclear which reference ''Id.'' refers to, its usage is inappropriate.

* ''"...the Executive Order declares that “the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.” Id. It asserts, “Deteriorating..."'' (from page 2 of [http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/02/09/17-35105.pdf State of Washington v. Donald J. Trump])

Here, Id. refers to the Executive Order that was mentioned in the previous sentence.&lt;ref name="trump" /&gt;

===Academic===
*Macgillivray, J. A. ''Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth''. New York: [[Hill &amp; Wang]], 2000.
*''Id.'' ''Astral Labyrinth: Archaeology of the Greek Sky''. Sutton Pub, 2003.

In this example, ''Id'' in the second citation indicates that the author is identical to that of the previous citation. That is, the author of the second citation is also Macgillivray, J. A.

'''Ivor Davies''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} is a Welsh-speaking, Welsh artist born in [[Treharris]], in November 1935. He currently lives and works in [[Penarth]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/ivor-davies/index.shtml |title=Wales – Arts – Ivor Davies – Ivor Davies |publisher=BBC |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy Davies went to [[Penarth]] County School. He studied at [[Cardiff College of Art]] and [[Swansea College of Art]] between 1952 and 1957 and then from 1959 to 1961 he studied at the [[University of Lausanne]] in Switzerland. He then began teaching at the [[University of Wales]] before moving on to the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he also completed a PhD on the Russian avant-garde. Davies finally retired from teaching at the Gwent College of Higher Education in 1988.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcaconwy.org/ivor_davies-84.aspx |title=The Royal Cambrian Academy – Ivor Davies |publisher=Rcaconwy.org |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s4c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s4c.co.uk/bydoliw_archive/e_ifordavies.shtml |title=Byd o Liw |publisher=S4C |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected Vice-President of the [[Royal Cambrian Academy of Art]] in 1995&lt;ref name="rcaconwy1"/&gt; and is a member of [[The Welsh Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewelshgroup-art.com/#!ivor-davies/c23td |title=Ivor Davies |year=2016 |accessdate=10 March 2016 |work=[[The Welsh Group]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made an [[MBE]] in the 2007 [[New Year Honours]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/30_12_06_hons_main.pdf|publisher=BBC News|date=28 December 2006|title=Knights Bachelor|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2002 [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] he won the [[Gold Medal (National Eisteddfod of Wales)|Gold Medal for Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/content.php?nID=431&amp;newsID=599 |title=Ivor Davies to open Y Lle Celf at the Vale of Glamorgan Eisteddfod &amp;#124; The National Eisteddfod of Wales |publisher=Eisteddfod.org.uk |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2172213.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Eisteddfod art turns political |publisher=BBC News |date=4 August 2002 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="welshgroup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewelshgroup-art.com/#!ivor-davies/c23td |title=The Welsh Group – Ivor Davies |publisher=thewelshgroup-art.com |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Davies is passionate about the [[Welsh culture|culture]], [[Welsh language|language]] and [[Politics of Wales|politics]] of Wales, which inspire his artwork. For a number of years he has sponsored the ''Ivor Davies Award'' at ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' (''Art Space'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]], for an artwork "that conveys the spirit of activism in the struggle for language, culture and politics in Wales".&lt;ref name="eisteddfod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/uploads/publications/336.pdf|date=15 October 2009|title=Visual Arts Exhibition, Y Lle Celf at Blaenau Gwent|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davies' early works in the 1960s used explosives as an expression of society's destructive nature. Davies took part in the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] in London in 1966.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcaconwy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="s4c"/&gt; More recent work has included painting, installations; he has also designed and installed a [[mosaic]] of [[Saint David]] at [[Westminster Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Germaine Greer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/19/germaine-greer-catholic-art-papal-visit |title=Catholic art was once the domain of Titian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">A '''juried competition''' is a [[competition]] in which participants' work is judged by a person or panel of persons convened specifically to judge the participants' efforts, either by the competition's stated [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] or by a subjective set of criteria dependent upon the nature of the competition or the judges themselves. For example, in a juried competition where participants compete against each other for a monetary prize, for inclusion in a show or publication, or for representation by a gallery, the work presented is judged by one or more persons, often experts, for such prize, inclusion, or representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juried "''juried''", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[Pastel Society of America]]'s description of its [http://pastelsocietyofamerica.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=31 Annual Exhibition.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the description of the [http://www.poetrycenter.org/node/30 Juried Reading] competition by The Poetry Center of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[Image:AaronCopland.JPG|right|thumb|[[Aaron Copland]], [[Guggenheim Fellow]], 1925]]
The phrase 'juried competition' is usually used to describe creative contests: artistic and literary competitions rather than sports tournaments or academic and scholarship competitions, although such competitions have similarities. Generally, juried competitions are contests that individuals actively enter to compete for prizes, rather than events in which the competitors are passively nominated by others, such as the [[Academy Awards]] or the [[Turner Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;See the Turner Prize's [http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain/turner-prize/what-it-is What is the Turner Prize?] page describing its process.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] is an example of an award which straddles the line between a scholarship contest and a juried art competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aaron Copland]] is an example of a 1925 [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim fellow]] who won for musical composition.&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase 'juried competition' is also applied to non-fine-arts contests which yet encompass distinctively creative endeavors: a [[cook-off]] is one such contest. Juried competitions also include contests in film and television, as well as [[new media]].&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;For an example of a [[new media]] competition, see: Jennifer Lee, The New York Times, November 4, 2008, ''[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/hfo-disposable-film-fest/ Art Films From Cellphones and Web Cams]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Britain's Got Talent]] and [[American Idol]] are both juried competitions, as is the [[Disposable Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

==History==
In very early juried competitions in [[Greece]], under [[Aeschylus]] and his successors, theatrical contests "advanced to a high degree of importance" and were "placed under the superintendence of" (juried by) "the magistracy".&lt;ref&gt;Buckham, Philip Wentworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IjAZAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Theatre%20of%20the%20Greeks&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Theatre of the Greeks], 1827, Chapter 3, Section 1, ''Dramatic Contests'',, p. 99 and note 3. &lt;blockquote&gt;"... a regular contest had been established before the time when Phrynichus is first mentioned ...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek god [[Agôn]] personifies solemn contests.&lt;ref&gt;See Theoi Greek Mythology, [http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Agon.html Agon.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]] in 1441, a public poetry competition called the [[Certame Coronario]] was held in [[Florence]] with the intention of proving that the spoken Italian language was not inferior to Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/103632/Certame-Coronario Certame Coronario], Encyclopædia Britannica, retrieved September 19, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, but before the advent of the [[Internet]], national and international juried competitions were (and still are) advertised in [[Trade journal|trade publications]], with jurists selected from among the artistic or literary elite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Art in America]], for example, lists a ''Call for Artists + Competitions'' section in the back of each magazine issue, (see &lt;u&gt;Art in America&lt;/u&gt;, Art Services section, ''Annual Guide 2006'', No. 7, August 2006, p.378), as does [[ARTnews]] (see &lt;u&gt;ARTnews&lt;/u&gt; Classifieds, Volume 105 Number 7, Summer 2006, p. 205.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The World Wide Photography Gala Awards website describes its jurors' credentials: [http://www.thegalaawards.com/jury.html Jurors.]&lt;/ref&gt; Before digitized images became widely available, competitions of visual works accepted primarily photographic [[Photographic slide|slides]] from competitors to represent the work entered because of the cost-prohibitive nature of sending and receiving whole artworks. After judging, only the selected works were sent on for public viewing if the competition included such a venue for the selected works. Written works such as poetry and prose, being less bulky, were entered in competitions via post and received in their original format.

Since the advent of  the Internet, many competitions for visual works began accepting entries in digital form as well as slide form, while literary competitions began to accept works submitted online as well as by post. The growth of the Internet also saw service firms appear offering organizational tools for juried competitions allowing for such conveniences as online storage and access of digital images.&lt;ref&gt;The 2010 [[Smithsonian]] Craft Show, for example, makes use of such a service firm for handling submitted work for the competition as detailed in the [http://www.smithsoniancraftshow.org/CFE2010/SCSApplicationInformationAndForm2010.pdf show application information process.]&lt;/ref&gt; Juried competitions also benefit from the immediacy of the Internet in that competitions listings are aggregated by some sites&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.the-art-list.com/ the-art-list.com]&lt;/ref&gt; making such listings more widely accessible than when they were enumerated primarily in trade publications. Some juried competitions in art and literature exist entirely online, or both online and in print.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.abstractexposure.com/ Abstract EXPOsure], [http://www.art-interview.com/ The Art Interview - 18th International Online Artist Competition], [[New Scientist]]'s [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17779-new-scientist-flash-fiction-competition-2009.html Flash fiction competition], and the [http://www.unaoc.org/pluralplus/ PLURAL+ Video Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''logo''' (abbreviation of '''logotype''',&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionaries"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/logo | title = logo: definition of logo in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English) | accessdate = 2014-03-05 | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-el|λόγος|translit=logos|lit=word|italic=yes}} and {{lang-el|τύπος|translit=typos|lit=imprint|italic=yes|link=no}}) is a [[graphic]] mark, [[emblem]], or [[symbol]] used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name it represents as in a [[wordmark]].

In the days of [[hot metal typesetting]], a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e.g. "The" in ATF [[Garamond]]), as opposed to a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]], which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word.&lt;ref&gt;Fyffe, Charles. ''Basic Copyfitting'', Studio Vista, London, 1969, SBN 289797055, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged [[typeface]] or [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. At the level of [[mass communication]] and in common usage, a company's logo is today often synonymous with its [[trademark]] or [[brand]].&lt;ref name="wheeler_dbi_pg4"&gt;Wheeler, Alina. ''Designing Brand Identity'' © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (page 4) {{ISBN|978-0-471-74684-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Numerous inventions and techniques have contributed to the contemporary logo, including [[cylinder seal]]s (c. 2300 BCE), [[coin]]s (c. 600 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', I, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Ramage, "Golden Sardis," King Croesus' Gold: Excavations at Sardis and the History of Gold Refining, edited by A. Ramage and P. Craddock, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[trans-cultural diffusion]] of [[logograph]]ic languages, [[coat of arms|coats of arms]],&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great
Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Wagner, Anthony, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'' (Penguin, 1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt; [[watermark]]s,{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=58}} [[silver hallmarks]], and the development of [[history of printing|printing technology]].

As the [[industrial revolution]] converted western societies from [[Agriculture|agrarian]] to industrial in the 18th and 19th centuries, photography and lithography contributed to the boom of an advertising industry that integrated [[typography]] and imagery together on the page.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=138–159}} Simultaneously, typography itself was undergoing a revolution of form and expression that expanded beyond the modest, serif typefaces used in books, to bold, ornamental typefaces used on broadsheet [[poster]]s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=126–134}}

The arts were expanding in purpose—from expression and decoration of an artistic, storytelling nature, to a differentiation of brands and products that the growing middle classes were consuming. Consultancies and trades-groups in the commercial arts were growing and organizing; by 1890, the US had 700 lithographic printing firms employing more than 8,000 people.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Artistic credit tended to be assigned to the lithographic company, as opposed to the individual artists who usually performed less important jobs.
[[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|A coin from early 6th century BC [[Lydia]] bearing the head of a roaring lion with sun rays]]

Innovators in the visual arts and lithographic process—such as French printing firm Rouchon in the 1840s, Joseph Morse of New York in the 1850s, Frederick Walker of England in the 1870s, and Jules Chéret of France in the 1870s—developed an illustrative style that went beyond tonal, representational art to figurative imagery with sections of bright, flat colors.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=148–155}} Playful children’s books, authoritative newspapers, and conversational periodicals developed their own visual and editorial styles for unique, expanding audiences. As printing costs decreased, literacy rates increased, and visual styles changed, the [[Victorian decorative arts]] led to an expansion of typographic styles and methods of representing businesses.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=159–161}}

[[File:Bass logo.svg|thumb|upright|The first logo to be trademarked was the [[Bass Brewery|Bass]] red triangle in 1876]]

The [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] of late-19th century, partially in response to the excesses of Victorian typography, aimed to restore an honest sense of craftsmanship to the mass-produced goods of the era.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=162–167}} A renewal of interest in craftsmanship and quality also provided the artists and companies with a greater interest in credit, leading to the creation of unique logos and marks.

By the 1950s, [[Modernism]] had shed its roots as an avant-garde artistic movement in Europe to become an international, commercialized movement with adherents in the United States and elsewhere. The visual simplicity and conceptual clarity that were the hallmarks of [[Modernism]] as an artistic movement formed a powerful toolset for a new generation of graphic designers whose logos embodied [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]’s dictum, "Less is more." Modernist-inspired logos proved successful in the era of mass visual communication ushered in by television, improvements in printing technology, and digital innovations.

==Contemporary logos==
[[File:Croixrouge logos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Red Cross (symbol)|Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent (symbol)|Red Crescent]] emblems]]

The current era of logo design began in the 1870s{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} with the first abstract logo, the Bass red triangle. {{As of | 2014}}, many corporations, products, brands, services, agencies, and other entities use an ideogram (sign, icon) or an emblem (symbol) or a combination of sign and emblem as a logo. As a result, only a few of the thousands of ideograms in circulation are recognizable without a name. An effective logo may consist of both an ideogram and the company name (logotype) to emphasize the name over the graphic, and employ a unique design via the use of letters, colors, and additional graphic elements.

[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The Coca-Cola logo is identifiable in other writing-systems, here written in [[Cyrillic]].]]

Ideograms and symbols may be more effective than written names (logotypes), especially for logos translated into many [[alphabet]]s in increasingly globalized markets. For instance, a name written in [[Arabic script]] might have little resonance in most European markets. By contrast, ideograms  keep the general proprietary nature of a product in both markets. In non-profit areas, the [[Red Cross]] (varied as the [[Red Crescent]] in Muslim countries and as the [[Magen David Adom|Red Star of David]] in Israel) exemplifies a well-known emblem that does not need an accompanying name. The red cross and red crescent are among the best-recognized symbols in the world. National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross include these symbols in their logos.

[[Brand]]ing can aim to facilitate cross-language marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TICoRD'13: Global Product Development|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9788132210498e|website=Springer|publisher=Springers|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers and potential consumers can identify the [[Coca-Cola]] name written in different alphabets because of the standard color and "ribbon wave" design of its logo. The text was written in [[Spencerian Script]], which was a popular writing style when the [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola Logo]] was being designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coca-Cola logo story|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/stories/history/advertising/the-logo-story/|website=Coca Cola Official Website|publisher=The Coca Cola Company|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo design==

Since a logo is the visual entity signifying an organization, logo design is an important area of [[graphic design]]. A logo is the central element of a complex identification system that must be functionally extended to all communications of an organization. Therefore, the design of logos and their incorporation in a visual identity system is one of the most difficult and important areas of graphic design. Logos fall into three classifications (which can be combined). Ideographs, such as Chase Bank, are completely abstract forms; pictographs are iconic, representational designs; logotypes (or wordmarks) depict the name or company initials. Because logos are meant to represent companies' brands or corporate identities and foster their immediate customer recognition, it is counterproductive to frequently redesign logos.

The logo design profession has substantially increased in numbers over the years since the rise of the [[Modernist movement]] in the [[United States]] in the 1950s.{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=363}} Three designers are widely{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=369–374}} considered the pioneers of that movement and of logo and [[corporate identity]] design: The first is [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|pp=373–374}} which is the firm responsible for a large number of iconic logos, such as [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] Bank (1964), [[Mobil Oil]] (1965), [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] (1984), [[NBC]] (1986), [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] (2003), and others. Due to the simplicity and boldness of their designs, many of their earlier logos are still in use today. The firm recently designed logos for the [[Library of Congress]] and the fashion brand [[Armani Exchange]]. Another pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Paul Rand]],{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=369}} who was one of the originators of the Swiss Style of [[graphic design]]. He designed many posters and corporate identities, including the famous logos for [[IBM]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The third pioneer of corporate identity design is [[Saul Bass]].{{sfn|Meggs|1998|p=375}} Bass was responsible for several recognizable logos in North America, including both the Bell Telephone logo (1969) and successor [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] globe (1983). Other well-known designs were [[Continental Airlines]] (1968), Dixie (1969), and [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1972). Later, he would produce logos for a number of Japanese companies as well.
An important development in the documentation of logo design is the study of French trademarks by historian Edith Amiot and philosopher Jean Louis Azizollah.&lt;ref&gt;Les Marques Francaises 1824–1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo color==
Color is a key element in logo design and plays an important role in brand differentiation. The importance of color in this context is due to the mechanics of human visual perception wherein color and contrast play critical roles in visual detail detection.  In addition, we tend to acquire various color connotations and color associations through social and cultural conditioning, and these play a role in how we decipher and evaluate logo color. While color is considered important to brand recognition and logo design, it shouldn't conflict with logo functionality, and it needs to be remembered that color connotations and associations are not consistent across all social and cultural groups. For example, in the United States, red, white, and blue are often used in logos for companies that want to project patriotic feelings but other countries will have different sets of colors that evoke national pride. 

Choosing an organisation's logo's color is an important decision because of its long term implications and its role in creating differentiation among competitors' logos. A methodology for identifying potential logo colors within an industry sector is color mapping, whereby existing logo colors are systematically identified, mapped, and evaluated (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zena O'Connor|title=Logo Colour and Differentiation: A New Application of Environmental Colour Mapping |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.20594/abstract |journal=Color Research and Application |volume=36 |number=1 |pages=55–60 |doi=10.1002/col.20594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo design process===
Designing a good logo often requires involvement from a marketing team teaming with the graphic design studio. Before a logo is designed, there must be a clear definition of the concept and values of the brand as well as understanding of the consumer or target group. Broad steps in the logo design process include research, conceptualization, investigation of alternative candidates, refinement of a chosen design, testing across products, and finally adoption and production of the chosen mark.

===Dynamic logos===

}}

In 1898, the French tire manufacturer [[Michelin]] introduced the [[Michelin Man]], a cartoon figure presented in many different contexts, such as eating, drinking, and playing sports. By the early 21st century, large corporations such as [[MTV]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Google]], [[Morton Salt]], and [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] had adopted ''dynamic logos'' that change over time from setting to setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|publisher=International Herald Tribune
|first=Alice
|last=Rawsthorn
|accessdate=2008-05-21
|date=2007-02-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet-compatible logos===
A company that uses logotypes (wordmarks) may desire a logo that matches the firm's Internet address. For short logotypes consisting of two or three characters, multiple companies are found to employ the same letters. A "CA" logo, for example, is used by the French bank [[Credit Agricole]], the Dutch clothing retailer [[C&amp;A]], and the US software corporation [[CA Technologies]], but only one can have the Internet domain name CA.com.

In today's digital interface adaptive world, a logo will be formatted and re-formatted from large monitors to small handheld devices. With the constant size change and re-formatting, logo designers are shifting to a more bold and simple approach, with heavy lines and shapes, and solid colors. This reduces the confusion when mingled with other logos in tight spaces and when scaled between media. Social networks like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], and [[Google+]] use such logos.

==Design protection==
Logos and their design may be protected by copyright, via various [[Intellectual Property|intellectual property]] organisations worldwide which make available application procedures to register a design to give it protection at law. For example, in the UK, the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm.htm|publisher =UK Patent Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; govern registered designs, patents, and trademarks. Ordinarily, the trademark registration will not 'make claim' to colors used, meaning it is the visual design that will be protected, even if it is reproduced in a variety of other colors or backgrounds.

==Sports==
For many teams, a logo or "[[crest (sports)|crest]]" is an important way to recognize a team's history and can intimidate opponents.
For certain teams, the logo and color scheme are synonymous with the team's players. For example, [[Manchester United]], the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], or [[New York Yankees]] all have a recognizable logo that can be identified by any fan of the respective sport.

'''Mary Elizabeth Banning''' (1822-1903) was an American [[Mycology|mycologist]] (fungi biologist) and [[botanical illustrator]] from [[Maryland]].

She formally described 23 previously unknown species of fungi, publishing their [[Species description|type descriptions]] in the ''Botanical Gazette'' and [[Charles Horton Peck|Charles Peck's]] "Annual Report of the New York State Botanist".&lt;ref name=Haines&gt;{{cite web|last=Haines|first=John|title=Women's history: Mary Banning|url=http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/womenshistory/banning.html|publisher=New York State Museum|accessdate=2 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225053533/http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/womenshistory/banning.html|archivedate=25 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Banning is best known as the author of ''The Fungi of Maryland'', an unpublished manuscript containing scientific descriptions, mycological anecdotes, and 174 13" by 15" watercolor paintings of fungal species.&lt;ref name=Haines /&gt;  The [[New York State Museum]] describes these paintings as "extraordinary...a blend of science and folk art, scientifically accurate and lovely to look at."&lt;ref name=NYSM&gt;{{cite web|last=New York State Museum|title=Fungi: Mary Banning|url=http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/treasures/collection.cfm?coll=29|accessdate=4 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111000451/http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/treasures/collection.cfm?coll=29|archivedate=11 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Banning's manuscript took twenty years to complete (1868-1888).  Although the Maryland State Archives,&lt;ref name=Steedman&gt;{{cite web|last=Steedman|first=Emily J|title=Mary Elizabeth Banning (1822-1903)|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013591/html/13591bio.html#13|work=Archives of Maryland (Biographical series)|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing Stegman,&lt;ref name="Women of Achievement"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stegman|first=Carol B|title=Mary Elizabeth Banning|journal=Women of Achievement in Maryland History (ed. Suzanne Nida Seibert)|year=2002|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that "At this point in time, no one had written a book on American fungi," and Haines&lt;ref name=Haines /&gt; states, "In 1868 there were no books from which to learn about American fungi," neither assertion is technically correct: [[Lewis David de Schweinitz|Schweinitz's]] ''Synopsis Fungorum Carolinæ Superioris'' was published in 1822.  Nevertheless, had Banning's opus been published, it would certainly have been the first illustrated and popularly accessible fungal flora of the southern United States.

She was inducted into the [[Maryland Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="hall of fame"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maryland State Archives (2001)|title=Maryland Women's Hall of Fame: Mary Elizabeth Banning|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/educ/exhibits/womenshall/html/banning.html|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges as a female mycologist ===
Mary eventually became the "leading mycologist in her region".&lt;ref name=Haines /&gt; Despite this, she was a woman, and she had no formal higher education. Consequently, with the exception of her mentor Peck, she found herself largely ostracized by the educated male scientific establishment of the day.&lt;ref name=Steedman /&gt; Her private letters reveal her deep dissatisfaction with this state of affairs.&lt;ref name="hall of fame" /&gt;  Unable to obtain funding and having to care for her invalid mother and sister, Banning "incurred increasing financial problems."&lt;ref name="hall of fame" /&gt;

Conversely, her mycological pursuits led to several awkward encounters with fungus-fearing locals, many of which she recounts as asides in her scientific publications.  On one occasion, she rode six miles in a crowded "public conveyance" holding a basket of ''[[Phallus duplicatus]]'' — a particularly foul-smelling fungus with the common name "netted stinkhorn." By the end of the ride, Banning states that "the smell had increased to such an extent that the flies nearly devoured me, in their eagerness to get at the fungus".&lt;ref name="Banning 1880 5–10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banning|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Notes on Fungi|journal=Botanical Gazette|date=January 1880|pages=5–10|url=https://archive.org/details/botanicalgazette56hano | doi = 10.1086/325320|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other passengers maintained a stony silence for the duration of the trip.  On another occasion, a man approached her, asking if she had found any "frog stools" that day.  When she replied that she had not, he answered, "And it's a blessed thing you can't find 'em!...Pison [sic] things...Better let frog stools alone!  That's my advice to everyone."  The man then walked away, muttering about Banning: "Poor thing.  Crazy, certain sure.  Clean gone mad!"&lt;ref name="Banning 1880 5–10"/&gt; On yet another occasion, Banning had employed three young boys to collect mushrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banning|first=Mary E.|date=1881-01-01|title=Maryland Fungi. II|jstor=2993430|journal=Botanical Gazette|volume=6|issue=5|pages=210–215|doi=10.1086/325473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When they brought their finds to the hotel where she was staying and asked where they might find the 'frog stool lady,' the waiter replied,  "Off with you! Have you gone crazy? Who ever heard tell of a frog-stool lady?"&lt;ref name=Steedman /&gt;

In the preface to her unpublished manuscript, Banning discusses the origin of her project in terms recalling then-prevalent [[natural theology]]:
:::"My first idea of drawing and painting the Fungi of Maryland had for its object educational training in a mission school.... I confess to a smile at my choice of a subject, feeling that for once I had stepped from the sublime to the ridiculous. :::Yet I feel satisfied with my undertaking, believing that the study of Natural Science in any of its departments has a refining influence—that when used in its truest highest sense it is the Divinely appointed means of teaching faith as well as cultivating the minds and morals."&lt;ref name=heist /&gt;

The outlook she here elucidates might explain some of her persistence in the face of manifold challenges.

== Family life ==
Banning was born in 1822 in [[Talbot County, Maryland|Talbot County]] on Maryland's eastern shore.&lt;ref&gt;"Mary Elizabeth Banning - Overview," Ancestry.com, http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/10084269/person/-700507514 (Accessed July 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the daughter of Robert Banning and Mary Macky, and was the youngest of her father's eight children (six from a previous marriage).  The Bannings were a well-established Maryland family: Mary Elizabeth's grandfather was a representative at Maryland's ratification of the federal [[Constitution of the United States|constitution]], and her father was a military captain, Collector of the Port of Oxford, and Member of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]].&lt;ref&gt;"Banning Family," In Notable Southern Families Volume I, compiled by Zella Armstrong, 25, Chattanooga, TN: The Lookout Publishing Company, c.1918 https://archive.org/stream/notablesouthern00frengoog#page/n32/mode/2up (accessed Aug. 2 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, when Banning was 23, her father died. In 1855, Banning, her mother, and her sisters moved to Baltimore.&lt;ref name="Steedman" /&gt;   By 1860, her mother and a sister had become chronically ill, and Banning became their caretaker.&lt;ref name="heist"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heist|first=Annette|title=Joyous Mushrooms|journal=Natural history|date=Sep 1999|volume=48|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA55698603&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=21260_lclcp&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout, she maintained an interest in natural history, finally gravitating to the study of fungi.  With her own money, she bought a microscope and started to amass a scientific library and private herbarium.&lt;ref name="Women of Achievement" /&gt; She also initiated a correspondence with [[Charles Horton Peck]], A New York State Museum scientist who, by then, was well on his way to becoming "the dean of American mycologists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Nancy Smith|title=A field Guide to Southern Mushrooms|year=1985|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472856154|page=17|author2=Alexander H. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years and legacy ==
By the end of the 1880s, Mary's immediate family had died, and she found herself nearly penniless, with fading eyesight and growing [[rheumatism]].  She moved into a boarding-home in [[Winchester, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Steedman /&gt; In 1889, she ended work on her manuscript, dedicating it to Peck, with whom she had corresponded for 30 years but never met.&lt;ref name=heist /&gt;   In 1890, she shipped the manuscript to Peck at the New York State Museum, writing, "In parting from it I feel like taking leave of a beloved friend with whom I have spent many pleasant hours. Circumstances impel me to put it in a safe place."&lt;ref name=heist /&gt; Peck placed the manuscript in a drawer, where it would remain for the next 91 years. Banning died 13 years later, in 1903.&lt;ref name=Steedman /&gt; She left her remaining money to the St. John's Orphanage for Boys.&lt;ref name=Haines /&gt;

In 1981, John Haines, a mycologist attached to the New York State museum as Associate Scientist, discovered Banning's manuscript.&lt;ref name=heist /&gt; The Museum organized the watercolors into the exhibit "Each a Glory Bright", which has been loaned to museums around the United States.&lt;ref name=Haines /&gt;  Plates from the work can be viewed at the [http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/treasures/explore.cfm?coll=29 New York State Museum's page for this collection].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13694">'''[[Metaphor]]''', the description of one thing as something else, has become of interest in recent decades to both [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]], but for different reasons.

== Metaphor in analytic philosophy ==
In the Anglo-American tradition of [[analytic philosophy]] (in particular, in the [[philosophy of language]]), [[metaphor]] has attracted interest because it does not conform to accepted [[truth-conditional semantics]], the conditions which determine whether or not a statement is true. Taken literally, the statement "Juliet is the sun" (from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'') is false, if not nonsensical, yet, taken metaphorically, it is meaningful and may be true, but in a sense which is far from clear. The comparison theory of metaphor asserts that one can express the [[truth value]] of a metaphor by listing all the respects in which the two terms are alike or similar; for example: Juliet is ''like'' the sun because she shares with it qualities such as radiance, brilliance, the fact that she makes the day and that she gets up every morning. However, this results in re-casting metaphor as [[simile]]. Because it can only explain the truth of metaphor by in effect losing metaphor, the comparison theory is rarely defended.

In contrast, two leading theorists emphasize the fact that [[truth conditions]] cannot be specified for a metaphor. [[Max Black]] maintains that metaphors are too open-ended to be able to function as [[referring expression]]s, and so cannot be expressions which have truth conditions {{Harv |Black|1962}}.  If metaphors are used in contexts where precise terminology is expected (for example, in a scientific theory), then their role, Black argues, is purely [[heuristic]], that is, they are means to an end or ways of assisting understanding, rather than being terms which can be tested for truth or falsity {{Harv |Black|1962| p= 37}}.  [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] also thinks it a mistake to look for the truth conditions of a metaphor, since, in his words, "much of what we are caused to notice [in a metaphor] is not propositional in character", that is to say, metaphor is a prompt to thought which cannot be reduced to or contained by a series of [[truth conditions]] {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  What metaphor does, Davidson maintains, is make us see one thing as something else by "making [a] literal statement that inspires or prompts the insight" {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  Seeing one thing as something else is not the recognition of some truth or fact, and so "the attempt to give literal expression to the content of the metaphor is simply misguided".{{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}

Max Black develops the idea that metaphor actually creates insight or new meaning {{Harv |Black|1979}}. His interactionist theory asserts that at the heart of a metaphor is the interaction between its two subject terms, where the interaction provides the condition for a meaning which neither of the subject terms possesses independently of the metaphorical context. The primary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in a metaphor, he claims, is coloured by a set of "associated implications" normally predicated of the secondary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] {{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}.    From the number of possible meanings which could result, the primary subject sieves the qualities predicable of the secondary subject, letting through only those that fit. The interaction, as a process, brings into being what Black terms an "[[Logical implication|implication]]-complex", a system of associated implications shared by the linguistic community as well as an impulse of free meaning, free in that it is meaning which was unavailable prior to the metaphor's introduction.{{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}

In a different, naturalist, approach, some English-speaking philosophers close to [[cognitive science]], such as [[George Lakoff | Lakoff]], have made metaphor the central aspect of human rationality.

== Metaphor in continental philosophy ==
Whereas analytic philosophy examines metaphor within the philosophy of language, [[continental philosophy]] assigns much wider significance to metaphor. This is because the climate within continental thought has been more favourable to the propagation of new branches of enquiry from nineteenth century German philosophy. Although [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]] sit quite happily on both analytic and continental curricula, it is only the latter which has seriously addressed the need to rethink how the world appears to us and how it is made manifest to us in the light of their [[metaphysics]]. Metaphor has proven to be extremely important for this rethinking because it is the process of conceptual borrowing or reassignment which revises our perception of the world.

The major shift which occurs in [[Kantian]] continental philosophy, according to Cazeaux, is the departure 'from dualistic thought, i.e. thinking which remains within the boundaries created by oppositions, such as mind—body and subjective—objective' {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007| p=4}}.  The turn away from dualistic thought is made by Kant on account of his representing experience as the subjective determination of an objective world, thereby placing in a relationship terms which normally stand as opposites in a dualism. As a result of this shift, without conventional dualisms to fall back upon, the process of conceptual borrowing and cross-referral presented by metaphor becomes central as the means by which the textures and complexities of experience can be articulated. Theses to this effect, but with significant differences, can be found in [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Merleau-Ponty]], [[Bachelard]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], and [[Derrida]].

To give two examples. According to [[Nietzsche]], we are in metaphor or we are metaphor: our being is not derived from a [[Platonism|Platonic]], eternal [[essence]] or from a [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking substance but (in as much as there is a way of being we can call ours) is emergent from tensional interactions between competing drives or perspectives {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000}}. We customarily hold truth to be a relation of correspondence between knowledge and reality but, Nietzsche declares, it is in fact ‘a movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms’ due to the fundamentally metaphorical nature of concept-formation, a series of creative leaps from nerve [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to retinal image (first metaphor) to sound as signifier (second metaphor) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=55}}.  Our categories, and the judgments we form with them, can never correspond to things in themselves because they are formed through a series of transformations which ensures that ‘there is no [[causality]], no correctness, and no expression’ connecting the first stage (the stimulus) with the last (the concept) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=58}}.

For [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], metaphor is also ‘living’ – hence the title of his book, ''La Métaphore vive'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1975}} (translated into English as ''The Rule of Metaphor'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977}}) – but in a different sense from Nietzsche .  Metaphor is living, Ricoeur claims, in that it is the principle which revives our [[perception]] of the world and through which we become aware of our creative capacity for seeing the world anew. This process, he thinks, is both paradoxical and Kantian in nature: paradoxical in that the creative combination of terms in a metaphor nevertheless produces meaning which has the character of a discovery (how can something be both a creation and a discovery?), and Kantian because the paradox mirrors Kant’s theory of experience in which the subjective application of concepts nevertheless yields perception of an objective world.  The tension between the subjective, creative and the objective, discovery aspects of a metaphor, Ricoeur argues, proceeds ‘from the very structures of the mind, which it is the task of [Kant’s] transcendental philosophy to articulate’ {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977| p=300}}.  Unfortunately, the part of Kant’s philosophy which Ricoeur appeals to is highly problematic: the [[Schema (Kant)|schema]] or schematism,  the operation which Kant dismisses as ‘an art concealed in the depths of the human soul' {{Harv |Kant|1929| p=183, A141, B180-81}}.  Ricoeur’s Kantianism is considered at length by Cazeaux {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007}} and Stellardi {{Harv |Stellardi|2000}}, with the former providing an account of how the schematism might afford a coherent explanation of metaphor.

Another reason for the attention paid by continental philosophy to metaphor is the questioning of boundaries – between subject areas and between the wider concepts of [[ethics]], [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]] – which has occurred within [[postmodernism]]. Principal concerns in these debates are the status of knowledge and the way in which the concepts of [[truth]] and objectivity are understood. Philosophy has been under attack on this score with its history of ‘universal truths’, e.g. [[Descartes]]’s cogito, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s table of categories, and [[Hegel]]’s Absolute Consciousness. The main arguments against this universalism invoke metaphor on two related accounts: (1) the fact that key epistemological concepts have metaphors at their root, for example, “mirroring”, “[[Communication|correspondence]]”, “[[sense data]]”, is taken as evidence of the contingent, communal, subjective basis of knowledge, and (2) because metaphor (as a form of dislocated or dislocating predication) works by testing the appropriate with the inappropriate, it is seen as a means of challenging the boundaries whereby one subject defines itself in relation to another.

[[File:Motecuzoma Xocoyotzin.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|A portrayal of [[Moctezuma II]], with a slightly different headdress]]
'''Moctezuma's headdress''' is a [[featherwork]] [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] ({{lang-nah|quetzalāpanecayōtl}} {{IPA-nah|ketsalaːpaneˈkajoːtɬ|}}) which tradition holds belonged to [[Moctezuma II]], the Aztec [[tlatoani|emperor]] at the time of the [[Spanish Conquest]]. However, its provenance is uncertain,&lt;ref name="La Jornada1"&gt;González de Alba, Luis. "El penacho de un pobre diablo", en el periódico La Jornada, [http://www.jornada.unam.mx/1996/08/05/cica0508.html versión electrónica.]&lt;/ref&gt; and even its identity as a headdress has been questioned.&lt;ref name="La Jornada3"&gt;Rodríguez, Ana Mónica. "El penacho de Moctezuma es una capa de sacerdote, afirma un investigador", La Jornada, [http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/06/13/a08n1cul.php versión electrónica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608231651/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/06/13/a08n1cul.php |date=2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of [[quetzal]] and other feathers with sewn-on gold detailing. It is now in the [[Museum of Ethnology, Vienna]], and is a source of dispute between [[Austria]] and [[Mexico]], as no similar pieces remain in Mexico. Restoration efforts reignited this dispute in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prehist.org/news/104/Mexico+and+Austria+in+dispute+over+Aztec+headdress/|publisher=prehist.org|title=Mexico and Austria in dispute over Aztec headdress|date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The feathers of the piece have deteriorated over the centuries. It is {{convert|116|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|175|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and has the form of concentric layers of different colored feathers arranged in a semicircle. The smallest is made from blue feathers of the ''[[Cotinga amabilis]] (xiuhtōtōtl)'' with small plates of gold in the shapes of half moons. Behind this is a layer of Roseate spoonbill ''(tlāuhquechōlli)'' feathers, then small quetzal feathers, then a layer of white-tipped red-brown feathers of the squirrel cuckoo, ''[[Piaya cayana]],'' with three bands of small gold plates, and finally two of 400 closely spaced quetzal tail feathers, some {{convert|55|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The quetzal feathers in the center of the headdress are raised relative to the sides. Leather straps attach the crown to the head of the wearer.

==History==
Although attributed to Moctezuma and the Spanish conquest, the provenance of the piece is unattested, and it does not match Aztec illustrations of the headdress of their nobility. It became an object of interest to European researchers such as [[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]] and [[Eduard Seler]] at the end of the 19th century, and its identification as a ''quetzalapanecayotl'' is attributed to American anthropologist [[Zelia Nuttall]].&lt;ref&gt;Zelia Nuttall:''Sur le quetzal-apanecaiotl ou coiffure Mexicaine en plumes conservée à Vienne''. En: ''Congrès International des Américanistes, Paris 1890''. Paris 1892. S. 453-459&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored in 1878, while still thought to be a [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]] rather than a headdress. It is attested since 1575 in the collections of [[Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in Ambras near [[Innsbruck]], Austria. At the beginning of the 19th century it was deposited in the Museum of Ethnology (inventory number 10402''VO'') in Vienna along with other liturgical artifacts of [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin|Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Ehecatl]].

In [[literature]], '''mood''' is the atmosphere of the narrative.  Mood is created by means of [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] (locale and surroundings in which the [[narrative]] takes place), [[Tone (literature)|attitude]] (of the narrator and of the [[Character (arts)|characters]] in the narrative), and [[description]]s.  Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree.  Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story.  It is to [[fiction]] what the sensory level is to [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative.

==Elements==
Mood is generally created through several different things.
Setting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently, and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a [[cowboy]] story, and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations.
The attitude of the [[narrator]] is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is [[diction]], that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it.

==Difference from tone== 
[[Tone (literature)|Tone]] and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader.  Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, [[Writer's voice|voice]] and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in [[first-person narrative]]s. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/reader-response.php |title=The Author, the Text, and the Reader  |last=Lee Ai Ling |first=Clarissa |publisher=London School of Journalism |date=October 2002|website=English Literature |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.

[[File:Praha, Vítkov, památník.JPG|thumb|300px|The National Monument at Vítkov Hill]]
The '''National Monument''' on top of Vítkov hill in [[Prague]]'s [[Žižkov]] district is one of the most important buildings related to the development of [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]]/[[Czech Republic|Czech]] statehood. 

It includes the third largest equestrian statue in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earch.cz/clanek/1098-zizka-nikdy-nevyhral-ted-je-nejlepe-treti.aspx About Žižka's and other bronze horse statues] (In Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jan Žižka]], who defeated catholic forces led by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] in 1420 in the [[Battle of Vítkov Hill]]. The Monument also includes the Ceremonial Hall, an exhibition entitled ''Crossroads of Czech and Czechoslovak Statehood'', the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] and other exhibition halls.

The Monument was built from 1928–1938 in honor of the World War I [[Czechoslovak legion]]aries. After 1948, it was used to promote the Communist regime. Between 1954-1962 it housed the mausoleum of [[Klement Gottwald]]. In 2000, the monument was acquired by the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum]], which conducted a major restoration work. After over two years of reconstruction, the Memorial was opened to the public on 29 October 2009.

== The History of Vitkov Hill ==
[[File:Praha Vitkov.jpg|thumbnail|Vitkov Hill in [[Žižkov]]]]
Vítkov has played a role in several important events in Czech history. The first written mention of Vítkov is from the 14th century, during the reign of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], who had vineyards planted on the hills around Prague. The vineyards stretched from the foot of Vítkov through [[Vinohrady]] to Karlov. As well as grapes, Vítkov hill was also used for the cultivation of hops.

Vítkov played a major role in the [[Hussite wars]]. In April and May 1420, [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]] led a Pope-sanctioned crusade army against the [[Hussite movement]]. As Sigismund proceeded towards Prague, the representatives of the city decided to stand against Sigismund and asked [[Tábor]] and other Hussite-controlled boroughs for help. Sigismund seized [[Hradčany]] and [[Vyšehrad]] while the Hussite forces controlled Vítkov. The decisive [[Battle of Vítkov Hill]] took place on 14 July 1420, when the Hussite forces defeated the crusader army.

In the second half of the 19th century, [[Czech nationalism]] was displayed in historical places, among them [[Žižkov]] and Vítkov Hill. In 1877, the town of Kralovske Vinohrady I was renamed as Žižkov, as Jan Žižka of [[Trocnov]], leader of the radical Hussites, was perceived as a symbol of the fight for Czech interests. In 1881 Žižkov was promoted to the status of a town. Vítkov was seen as a symbol of the Czechs and the ancient glory of the Czech nation, which led to the idea of building a monument to Žižka there. The initiative for building the monument is attributed to Karel Hartig, the first mayor of Žižkov.

In 1882, the Association for the Construction of the Žižka Monument in Žižkov was established in the hall of the U Deklarace pub. The Association held national celebrations in Žižkov (for instance in 1884) and in 1910 a memorial tablet was unveiled at the top of the hill. The Association's most high-profile act was the announcement of the tender for the Žižka Monument in 1912. No first prize was awarded. The Association's activities were abandoned during [[World War I]].

== Establishment of the monument ==
[[File:Žižovský památník.JPG|thumbnail|View from the Monument]]
In 1918 an independent Czechoslovak state was declared. The state consistently supported activities aimed at maintaining and developing the tradition of foreign legions. The Resistance Monument was established within the Ministry of National Defence in May 1919 as an institution whose role it was to collect written and material [[memorabilia]] relating to the resistance. In 1920 the Monument became a separate military institute, with colonel [[Rudolf Medek]] as commander. The objective of the Resistance Monument as an institution was to build a structure which would inspire celebration and reverence as well as historical research activities, such as including an archive, library and museum. At that time the Resistance Monument was already cooperating with the Association for the Construction of Žižka's Monument in Žižkov. The two institutions merged in 1926, establishing the Union for the Construction of the Liberation Monument and the Monument to Jan Žižka of Trocnov.

Two art contests were held for the design, the more significant being the second one in 1925, which assumed separate buildings for the Monument. The first building, located on Vítkov hill, was to be a [[necropolis]] for prominent representatives of the First Resistance, and the second building at the foot of the hill, now used by the Institute of Military History, was to house the administration and museum. The architect Jan Zazvorka won first prize in the contest.

The construction of the museum at the foot of the hill was launched in 1927 and completed two years later. The construction of the National Liberation Monument commenced in 1928 when the corner stone was laid on the top of Vítkov Hill in the presence of President [[T. G. Masaryk]] to mark the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The shell was completed in 1933 and interior works continued, involving many leading artists.

==The monument during World War II==
[[File:Pamatnik Zizkov.JPG|thumbnail|Monument interior]]
In 1938 the Monument was prepared to officially become state property, but this was precluded by the events following the [[Munich Conference]]. Thus the Monument remained property of the Union and the artwork decorations were not fully completed.

When [[World War II]] began, the lower buildings of the museum, now the Institute of Military History, were seized by the Germans. The Monument's building escaped the [[Wehrmacht]]'s attention until November 1942. The administration of the Monument took advantage of this period to secretly remove everything valuable, such as metals for casting [[sculpture]]s, and works of art. From November 1942 the Monument was occupied by the German administration and until the end of the war the [[Wehrmacht]] used it for storage.

== The Equestrian Statue of Jan Žižka of Trocnov ==
[[File:Jan Zizka Vitkov Prague CZ 007.jpg|thumb|upright|Equestrian statue of [[Jan Žižka]]]]
After the [[World War I|First World War]], the activities of the Association for the Construction of [[Jan Žižka]]'s Monument in [[Žižkov]] were renewed. As early as June 1920 the cornerstone was laid in the presence of President T. G. Masaryk. Art tenders were held in 1923, 1925 and 1928, with no satisfactory results. 

The monument was eventually commissioned in 1931 from sculptor [[Bohumil Kafka]], a professor at Prague's Academy of Visual Arts, outside the tender. The sculpture was intended to be monumental and realistic. It took Kafka ten years to complete the sculpture, and an advisory board of nine people was established to supervise his work, consisting of specialists, historians and [[Hippology|hippologists]]. For this job, Bohumil Kafka had a new studio built in Ořechovka, Prague, 27m high and 18m wide. Firstly he began work on model of a horse without the rider. Several men then modelled for the rider part, conceiving the rider's position, body and head. Experts in historical armament provided information not only on the rider's clothing style, but also many other details, such as the design of the foot frame. Kafka made a [[plaster]] model of Žižka's statue in November 1941 and died shortly afterwards.

The sculpture was cast after the liberation of the country at the end of World War II. It was unveiled on 14 July 1950, to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Vítkov. It is tethered to [[reinforced concrete]] plugs anchored in the structure of the Monument. The sculpture is {{convert|9|m}} high, {{convert|9.6|m}} long, and weighs {{convert|16.5|t}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nm.cz/download/npv_pro_navstevniky.pdf Stručné dějiny Památníku]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tomb of the Unknown Soldier ==
[[File:Praha, Vítkov, památník VI.JPG|thumbnail|Detail of doors at the Monument]]
The [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] is located underneath the Equestrian Statue. The Czechoslovak Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was originally established in the [[Old Town Hall (Prague)|Old Town Hall]] in 1922 as a temporary place of piety and contained the remains of an unknown soldier from the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]]. At the beginning of the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] in 1939, the Tomb became a place where people expressed their symbolic resistance against [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] rule. It was demolished by the Nazis in 1941.

After [[World War II]], consideration was given to renewing the tomb and moving it to Vítkov. As part of the 30th anniversary of the [[Battle of Zborov (1917)|Battle of Zborov]], the Headquarters of the Czechoslovak Army decided to establish the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the National Monument in Vítkov, which would contain the remains from Zborov, but Soviet embassy officials denied the transfer of those remains. In June 1949 restoration work was underway in the military graveyard near [[Dukla]], and during exhumation work on 14 July 1949 the remains of one of the unknown soldiers were unearthed in the graveyard in [[Vyšný Komárnik]]. They were transported to Prague and temporarily lodged with the National Museum. On Sunday 9 October 1949, when celebrations of the 5th anniversary of the [[Battle of the Dukla Pass]] were at their peak, the remains were moved to the Liberation Monument.

On 8 May 2010 other remains of an unknown soldier from Zborov were put in the Tomb next to the unknown soldier from Dukla, thus fulfilling the original idea of the Monument. The remains are lodged in one of the coffins. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is today perceived as an expression of thanksgiving to the Czechs and Slovaks who fell in the struggle to liberate the Czech and Czechoslovak states. In 2006 [[Alois Eliáš|General Alois Eliáš]] and his wife were also buried here.

== The Klement Gottwald Mausoleum ==

After World War II the renewal of the Monument commenced. Works also began on the new building, to be used as a tribute to the resistance against Nazism. However, the events of February 1948 led to the monument being used in new ways. Vigorous oppression of the [[Czechoslovak legion|legionary tradition]] commenced in 1950, and following a decision of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], the Monument of Liberation was converted into a proletariat pantheon, thus changing its ideological function. In 1953 the Central Committee decided to establish the [[Klement Gottwald]] Mausoleum in the Monument, which remained there until 1962.

The original layout placed a [[sarcophagus]] in the Main Hall, as the place where President T. G. Masaryk was to be buried. He eventually rejected the plan, and so did his family after his death. From 1953 to 1962 this area was rebuilt into the Klement Gottwald Mausoleum. The Minister of National Defence and Gottwald's son-in-law [[Alexej Čepička]] was in charge of preparatory works for the conversion. The examples came from [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum]] in [[Sofia]]. The Mausoleum included technical facilities. The construction work also involved the son of the Monument's key architect, Jan Zazvorka Jr., a film architect.

Klement Gottwald's body was exhibited in the centre of the Mausoleum in a glazed sarcophagus. The lid had built-in lights with small mirrors. The body was moved in and out of the underground laboratory by a vibration-free telescopic device. The embalmed body was dressed in the blue general's uniform of the Head Commander of Czechoslovak armies. In 1958 it was changed to civilian attire.

The technical facilities for the Klement Gottwald Mausoleum were built in the underground premises of the Monument. The construction of the underground premises was completed in October 1953 and its original design lasted until Klement Gottwald's [[cremation]] in 1962 when the equipment was removed. The only elements of the original design to have been preserved are the control room and the ground plan for the laboratory.

The '''National Symphony Orchestra''' ('''NSO'''), founded in 1931, is an American [[Orchestra|symphony orchestra]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]].  Its principal performing venue is the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. 

==History==
For the first period of its history, the NSO performed in [[Constitution Hall]].  During the tenure of the first music director, [[Hans Kindler]], the musicians received a salary of $40.00 per week, for three rehearsals and one concert, for five months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200542_pf.html | title=The NSO: 75 and Counting Its Blessings | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page |date=2005-09-04 | accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first female member of the NSO was a harpist, [[Sylvia Meyer]], who joined in 1933.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|date=March 30, 2005|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/03/29/AR2005032901247.html|title=Esteemed NSO Harpist Sylvia Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kindler and the NSO made several 78-rpm recordings for [[RCA Victor]], including the two Roumanian Rhapsodies by [[George Enescu]]; much later, in 1960, the NSO would perform the first of these works under the baton of the visiting Romanian conductor [[George Georgescu]], a close associate and favored exponent of the composer.&lt;ref name=Programme&gt;Programme for National Symphony Orchestra performances of December 13–15, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the more unusual RCA recordings with the orchestra was of the complete ballet music from the opera ''King Henry VIII'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], one of the very few recordings conducted by [[Walter Damrosch]].  Years later, [[Howard Mitchell]] made a series of [[stereophonic]] recordings with the orchestra for RCA.  [[Antal Doráti]] recorded with the orchestra for [[Decca Records]].  [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] made recordings for [[Telefunken|Teldec]], [[Sony Records]], and [[Erato Records|Erato]].  The orchestra returned to RCA Victor under [[Leonard Slatkin]], until RCA abandoned new [[classical music|classical]] recordings.

In 1986, the NSO became the artistic affiliate of the [[Kennedy Center]], where it has presented a concert season annually since the Center opened in 1971.

==Activities==
The NSO regularly participates in events of national and international importance, including performances for ceremonial state affairs, presidential inaugurations and official holiday celebrations, including concerts for [[Memorial Day]] and the regular ''[[A Capitol Fourth]]'' concerts on 4 July.

The NSO itself numbers 100 musicians, presenting a 52-week season of approximately 175 concerts each year. These include classical subscription series, [[Traditional pop music|pops]] concerts, and educational programs.   In addition to these activities, small groups of NSO members develop education programs designed at age levels from pre-kindergarten through high school.  Collectively, these ensembles present as many as 100 additional performances a year during the [[#AR|American Residencies]] and at the Kennedy Center.

Through the John and June Hechinger Commissioning Fund for New Orchestral Works, the NSO has commissioned more than 50 works, including cycles of fanfares and encores.  During his tenure, Slatkin founded the National Conducting Institute in 2000.  

Also of note is the National Symphony Orchestra Summer Music Institute.  For more than a decade, [[scholarships]] provided by the National Trustees of the National Symphony Orchestra have enabled top-level students from across the country and from many nations to come to the nation’s capital for several weeks of study with NSO musicians.  These participants, selected from a competitive pool of applicants, come from a variety of backgrounds, some currently enrolled in music conservatories such as [[Juilliard]] and others still completing high school.

{{Anchor|AR}}Another important project is the National Symphony Orchestra American Residencies for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This venture encompasses sharing all elements of classical symphonic music with a specific region of the United States, exploring the diversity of musical influences, and giving the region a musical voice in the nation’s center for the performing arts through exchanges, training programs, and commissions. Established in 1992, the project has taken the NSO to fifteen states.

In November 2004, the orchestra announced the conclusion of Slatkin's NSO directorship in 2008.  One report spoke of tensions between the conductor and the orchestra, and mentioned criticisms of Slatkin's programming and rehearsal styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57371-2004Nov17.html?sub=AR |title=Slatkin, NSO to Part in 2008 | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page | date=2004-11-18 | accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the 2006–2007 season, [[Iván Fischer]] became the principal guest conductor of the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/features/article/5442.html | title=Q&amp;A: Iván Fischer | work=Playbill Arts | author= |date=2006-10-19 | accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/11/AR2007021101509.html | title=Ivan Fischer: Plays Well With Children | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page | date=2007-02-12  |accessdate=2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 April 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of Fischer as the orchestra's principal conductor as of the 2008–2009 season, for two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/12/AR2007041201612.html?hpid=moreheadlines | title=NSO Picks Fischer as Interim Maestro | work=Washington Post | author=Tim Page | date=2007-04-12 | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/6310.html | title=Iván Fischer Appointed Principal Conductor of DC's National Symphony Orchestra | work=Playbill Arts | date=2007-04-12 | accessdate=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 25, 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of [[Christoph Eschenbach]] as the orchestra's sixth music director, effective with the 2010–2011 season, for an initial contract of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504161.html?hpid=topnews | title=Christoph Eschenbach to Lead National Symphony | work=Washington Post| author=Anne Midgette | date=2008-09-25 | accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, the orchestra extended Eschenbach's contract through the 2014–2015 season, and in March 2014, his contract was extended through the 2016–2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/kennedy-center-extends-eschenbachs-contract-new-organ-in-works/2011/09/25/gIQAswnQxK_story.html | title=Kennedy Center extends Eschenbach's contract; new organ in works | work=Washington Post | author=Anne Midgette | date=2011-09-25 | accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://web.kennedy-center.org/~/media/Files/KC/Press%20Releases/press%20release%20NSO%20and%20Kennedy%20Center%20Extend%20Christoph%20Eschenbachs%20contract%20through%20August%202017.pdf | title=Christoph Eschenbach Extends Contract as Music Director of the National Symphony Orchestra and Kennedy Center Through the 2016-2017 Season | work=Kennedy Center Press Release | date=2014-03-24 | accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2015, the NSO announced the scheduled conclusion of Eschenbach's tenure as NSO music director at the end of the 2016-2017 season, at which time he is scheduled to become the NSO's conductor laureate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2015/02/18/eschenbachs-nso-contract-to-end-in-2017-will-become-conductor-laureate/ | title=Eschenbach’s NSO contract to end in 2017; will become conductor laureate | work=Washington Post | author=Anne Midgette | date=2015-02-18 | accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Gianandrea Noseda]] first guest-conducted the NSO, and returned in November 2015 for an additional guest engagement.  In January 2016, the NSO announced the appointment Noseda as its next music director, effective with the 2017–2018 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anne Midgette | title=National Symphony Orchestra names rising star Gianandrea Noseda as music director | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-symphony-orchestra-names-rising-star-gianandrea-noseda-as-music-director/2016/01/04/e3f055c8-b2b9-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html | work=The Washington Post | date=2016-01-04 | accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is to serve as music director-designate in the 2016-2017 season, and his initial contract as music director is for 4 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://web.kennedy-center.org/~/media/Files/KC/Press%20Releases/January%202016%20Releases/GIANANDREANOSEDANAMEDNATIONALSYMPHONYORCHESTRAMUSICDIRECTOR?_ga=1.156840187.1975559029.1452359132 | title=Gianandrea Noseda Named Music Director of the National Symphony Orchestra | work=Kennedy Center Press Release | date=2016-01-04 | accessdate=2016-01-09 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127025035/http://web.kennedy-center.org/~/media/Files/KC/Press%20Releases/January%202016%20Releases/GIANANDREANOSEDANAMEDNATIONALSYMPHONYORCHESTRAMUSICDIRECTOR?_ga=1.156840187.1975559029.1452359132 | archivedate=2016-01-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2018, the NSO announced the extension of Noseda's contract through the 2024-2025 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anne Midgette | title=Noseda extends NSO contract; will stay through 2024-2025 season | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/noseda-extends-nso-contract-will-stay-through-2024-2025-season/2018/09/22/3c6f0a5e-bddf-11e8-be70-52bd11fe18af_story.html | work=The Washington Post | date=2018-09-23 | accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Vision and Colors''''' ({{lang-de|Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; das Sehn und die Farben}}) is a treatise&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Robert Mandelkow]], Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;3: Briefe der Jahre 1805-1821 (''Letters of the years 1805-1821''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;639. "Entsprechend hat Goethe dann auch seiner Abhandlung 'Über das Sehn und die Farben' nur bedingt zugestimmt." (''"Accordingly, Goethe then also only conditionally agreed to his treatise 'On Vision and Colors'."'')&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] that was published in May 1816 when the author was 28 years old. Schopenhauer had extensive discussions with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] about the poet's ''[[Theory of Colours]]'' of 1810, in the months around the turn of the years 1813 and 1814, and initially shared Goethe's views.&lt;ref name=Mandelkow&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow, Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;3: Briefe der Jahre 1805-1821 (''Letters of the years 1805-1821''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;639. "Vom November 1813 bis zum Mai 1814 sind sie in Weimar sehr häufig zusammengewesen. (...) In den Mittelpunkt der Diskussionen rückte schließlich die Goethesche ''Farbenlehre''. Schopenhauer teilte prinzipiell die Ansichten des Dichters, wich jedoch in gewissen Einzelheiten von ihnen ab." (''"From November 1813 till May 1814, they were together very often in Weimar. [...] Goethe's ''Theory of Colours'' finally became the central subject of the discussions. Schopenhauer basically shared the views of the poet, but deviated from them in certain details."'')&lt;/ref&gt;  Their growing theoretical disagreements and Schopenahauer's criticisms made Goethe distance himself from his young collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). ''Schopenhauer: a Biography''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 247–265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Schopenhauer considered his own theory superior, he would still continue to praise Goethe’s work as an important introduction to his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). ''Schopenhauer: a Biography''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 252 and 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer tried to demonstrate [[Physiology|physiologically]] that color is "specially modified activity of the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;''On Vision and Colors'', § 1&lt;/ref&gt;" The initial basis for Schopenhauer's color theory comes from Goethe's chapter on physiological colors, which discusses three principal pairs of contrasting colors: red/green, orange/blue, and yellow/violet. This is in contrast to the customary emphasis on [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] seven colors of the Newtonian [[spectrum]]. In accordance with [[Aristotle]], Schopenhauer considered that colors arise by the mixture of shadowy, cloudy darkness with light. With white and black at each extreme of the scale, colors are arranged in a series according to the mathematical ratio between the proportions of light and darkness. Schopenhauer agreed with Goethe's claim that the eye tends toward a sum total that consists of a color plus its spectrum or [[afterimage]]. Schopenhauer arranged the colors so that the sum of any color and its complementary afterimage always equals unity. The complete activity of the retina produces white. When the activity of the retina is divided, the part of the retinal activity that is inactive and not stimulated into color can be seen as the ghostly complementary afterimage, which he and Goethe call a (physiological) spectrum.

==History==
Schopenhauer met Goethe in 1808 at his [[Johanna Schopenhauer|mother's]] parties in Weimar but Goethe then mostly ignored the young and unknown student. In November 1813, Goethe congratulated Schopenhauer on his doctoral dissertation ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'' which he received as a gift. Both men shared the opinion that visual representations yielded more knowledge than did concepts. In the winter of 1813/1814, Goethe personally demonstrated his color experiments to Schopenhauer and they discussed color theory. Goethe encouraged Schopenhauer to write ''On Vision and Colors''. Schopenhauer wrote it in a few weeks while living in [[Dresden]] in 1815. After it was published, in July 1815, Goethe rejected several of Schopenhauer's conclusions, especially as to whether white is a mixture of colors. He was also disappointed that Schopenhauer considered the whole topic of color to be a minor issue. Schopenhauer wrote as though Goethe had merely gathered data while Schopenhauer provided the actual theory. A major difference between the two men was that Goethe considered color to be an objective property of light and darkness.&lt;ref&gt;"...Goethe...was so completely a ''realist'' that he absolutely could not get it into his head that the ''objects'' as such exist only to the extent that they are ''projected'' by the perceiving subject." Schopenhauer's comment as quoted in Safranski's ''Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy'', Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[transcendental idealism]] was opposed to Goethe's [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"It is precisely the astonishing ''objectivity'' of his mind, everywhere stamping his [Goethe's] works with the mark of genius, which stood in his way where it was of value and prevented him from going back to the ''subject'', in this case the perceiving eye itself, in order to seize here the final threads on which hangs the whole phenomenon of the world of colour. On the other hand, coming from Kant's school, I was prepared and trained for satisfying this demand in the best way." Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Chapter VII, § 103.&lt;/ref&gt; For Schopenhauer, color was subjective in that it exists totally in the spectator's [[retina]]. As such, it can be excited in various ways by external stimuli or internal bodily conditions. Light is only one kind of color stimulus.

In 1830, Schopenhauer published a revision of his color theory. The title was ''Theoria colorum Physiologica, eademque primaria'' (''Fundamental physiological theory of color''). It appeared in Justus Radius's ''Scriptores ophthalmologici minores'' (''Minor ophthalmological writings''). "This is no mere translation of the first edition," he wrote, "but differs noticeably from it in form and presentation and is also amply enriched in subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;''On Vision and Colors'', "Preface to the Second Edition,"&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was written in [[Latin]], he believed that foreign readers would be able to appreciate its value.

An improved second edition of ''On Vision and Colors'' was published in 1854. In 1870, a third edition was published, edited by [[Julius Frauenstädt]]. In 1942, an English translation by Lt. Col. E. F. J. Payne was published in [[Karachi]], India. This translation was republished in 1994 by Berg Publishers, Inc., edited by Professor David E. Cartwright.

==Content==

===Preface to the second edition (the first addition had no Preface)===
Although this work is mainly concerned with physiology,&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer claimed that [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] "discovered the phenomenon of physiological colours on which the whole of my theory is based...." The theory was based on Buffon's physiological phenomena and Goethe's data. Schopenhauer, ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Chapter VII, § 104.&lt;/ref&gt; it is of philosophical value. In gaining knowledge of the subjective nature of color, the reader will have a more profound understanding of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] doctrine of the ''a priori'', subjective, intellectual forms of all knowledge. This is in opposition to contemporary [[Philosophical realism|realism]] which simply takes objective experience as positively given. Realism doesn't consider that it is through the subjective that the objective exists. The observer's brain stands like a wall between the observing subject and the real nature of things.

===Introduction===
Goethe performed two services: (1) he freed color theory from its reliance on [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and (2) he provided a systematic presentation of data for a theory of color.

Before discussing color, there are some preliminary remarks to be made regarding vision. In § 1, it is shown that the perception of externally perceived objects in space is a product of the intellect's understanding after it has been stimulated by sensation from the sense organs. These remarks are necessary in order for the reader to be convinced that colors are entirely in the eye alone and are thoroughly subjective&lt;ref&gt;This was also taught by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] (''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', ''Dioptric'', Ch. 1), [[John Locke|Locke]],(''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Book II, Chapter VIII, § 10), [[Sextus Empiricus]], (''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Book II, Chapter VII, .
§§ 72–75)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 1—On Vision===

====§ 1====
&lt;ref&gt;In the Preface to the 1st Edition of his main work, Schopenhauer wrote that he omitted "all that is to be found in the first chapter of my essay ''On Vision and Colors'', which otherwise would have found a place here, word for word."&lt;/ref&gt;
Intuitive perception, or knowledge of an object, is intellectual, not merely sensual. The intellect's understanding regards every sense impression in the observer's body as coming from an external cause. This transition from effect to cause is knowledge of the pure understanding, not a rational conclusion or combination of concepts and judgments according to logical laws. Knowledge of an object never results from mere impression, but always from the application of the law of causality, and consequently of the understanding. The law of causality is the sole form of the understanding and the precondition of the possibility of any objective perception.

Illusion occurs when the understanding is given uncommon sensations. If the sensations become commonplace, the illusion may disappear.&lt;ref&gt;As, for example, when a person becomes [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] due to a blow on the head and sees double. After a time, the person will see normal single images again, while the eyes remain crossed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual understanding, or knowing the objective cause of a subjective sensation, distinguishes animals from plants. All animals are able to intuitively perceive objects.

Color is usually attributed to external bodies. However, color is actually the activity of the eye's retina. It is a sensation. The external body is perceived as the cause of the sensation of color. We say, "The body is red." In reality, though, color exists only in the retina of the eye. It is separate from the external object. Color is a mere sensation in the sense organ. The external object is perceived by the intellect's understanding as being the cause of sensations.

===Chapter 2—On Colors===

====§ 2====
Newton, Goethe, and all other color theorists began by investigating light and colored bodies in order to find the cause of color. They should have started with an investigation of the effect, the given phenomenon, the changes in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Johannes Itten|Itten, Johannes]], ''The Elements of Color'', p. 16, "The light waves are not in themselves colored. Color arises in the human eye and brain."&lt;/ref&gt; we can afterward investigate the external physical and chemical causes of those sensations.

The eye's reaction to external stimulus is an activity, not a passive response. It is the activity of the retina. When the eye's retina receives a full impression of light, or when whiteness appears, it is fully active. When light is absent, or when blackness appears, the retina is inactive.

====§ 3====
There are gradations to the intensity or strength of the retina's activity, or reaction to external stimulus. The undivided activity of the retina is divided into stronger or weaker degrees when stimulated by pure light or whiteness. When influenced by light, the degrees are: Light — Half Shade — Darkness. When influenced by whiteness, the degrees are: White — Gray — Black. In this way, grays are seen. The intensity or energy of the retina's activity increases as more light or whiteness stimulates the eye. These gradations are made possible by the quantitative intensive divisibility of the retina's activity.

====§ 4====
The activity of the retina also has a quantitative extensive divisibility. The whole extent of the retina is divided into countless small juxtaposed spots or points.&lt;ref&gt;"There are about 125,000,000 receptors in each human eye [retina]." ''Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia'', "Vision and the Eye.,"&lt;/ref&gt; Each point is individually stimulated by light or whiteness and reacts separately. The eye can receive many impressions at one time, and therefore side by side.

====§ 5====
The qualitative division of the activity is completely different from the two quantitative divisions. It occurs when color is presented to the eye. Schopenhauer described the way in which various points or places on the retina become fatigued from being overstimulated. After staring at a black figure on a white background, the overactive and excited retinal points become exhausted and do not react to stimulation when the eye finally looks away. A ghostly appearance of a black background is seen with a light-colored figure. The retinal positions that were exhausted by the whiteness become completely inactive. The retinal positions that had been rested are now easily stimulated. This explains [[afterimage]] (physiological spectra). Both Goethe and Schopenhauer use the word "spectrum" [Spektrum], from the Latin word "spectrum" meaning "appearance" or "apparition," to designate an afterimage.

If, instead of white, we stare at yellow, then the afterimage, or physiological color spectrum, is violet. Yellow, unlike white, does not fully stimulate and exhaust the retina's activity. Yellow partially stimulates points on the retina and leaves those points partially unstimulated. The retina's activity has been qualitatively divided and separated into two parts. The unstimulated part results in a violet afterimage. Yellow and violet are the complement of each other because together they add up to full retinal activity. Yellow is closer to white, so it activates the retina more than violet, which is closer to black.

An orange color is not as close to white. It doesn't activate the retina as much as yellow. Orange's complement is blue, which is that much closer to white than was violet. A red color is halfway between white and black. Red's complement is green which is also halfway between white and black. With red and green, the retina's qualitatively divided activity consists of two equal halves.

Red and green are two completely equal qualitative halves of the retina's activity. Orange is 2/3 of this activity, and its complement, blue, is only 1/3. Yellow is ¾ of the full activity, and its complement, violet, is only ¼.

The range of all colors contains a continuous series of innumerable shades that blend into each other. Why are red, green, orange, blue, yellow, and violet given names and considered to be the most important? Because they represent the retina's activity in the simplest fractions or ratios. The same is true of the [[solfège|seven keynotes]] in the musical [[diatonic scale]]: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. Color is the qualitatively divided activity of the retina. The retina has a natural tendency to display its activity entirely. After the retina has been partly stimulated, its remaining complement is active as the physiological spectrum or afterimage. In this way, the retina is fully and wholly active.

Knowledge of these six colors is inborn in the mind. They are ideal and are never found pure in nature, in the same way that regular geometrical figures are innate. We have them ''a priori'' in our minds as standards to which we compare actual colors. These three pairs of colors are pure, subjective [[Epicurus|Epicurean]] anticipations because they are expressed in simple, rational, arithmetical ratios similar to the seven tones of the musical scale and their rational vibration numbers.

Black and white are not colors because they are not fractions and represent no qualitative division of the retina's activity. Colors appear in pairs as the union of a color and its complement. Newton's division into seven colors is absurd because the sum of all basic colors cannot be an odd number.

====§ 6====
The qualitatively divided activity of the retina is a polarity, like electricity and magnetism. The retina's polarity is successive, in time, whereas the polarity of the others is simultaneous, in space. The retina's activity, like [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]], is split into two parts which condition each other and seek to reunite. Red, orange, and yellow could be conventionally designated by a plus sign. Green, blue, and violet could be the negative poles.

====§ 7====
According to Goethe, color is like shade or gray in that it is darker than white and brighter than black. The difference between grays and colors, though, is as follows. Light is activity of the retina. Darkness is retinal inactivity. Grays appear when the intensity or strength of the retina's activity is lessened. Colors appear when the whole activity of the retina is divided into partial complementary poles according to ratios. With the merely quantitative, intensive division of the retina's activity, there is only a gradual (by degrees) diminution of the intensity or strength of the retina's full activity. No fractional division of activity in ratios occurs. This lessening of strength by small degrees results in gray shades. However, with the qualitative fractional division of the activity of the retina, the activity of the part that appears as color is necessarily conditioned by the inactivity of the complementary fractional part. The polar contrast between the active and inactive parts results in color. The vivid partial activity of the stimulated retinal spot is supported by that same spot's partial inactivity. Every color's darkness appears as its afterimage, or spectrum. Conversely, when looking at an [[afterimage]], or physiological spectrum, the previously existing color is the darkening factor.

====§ 8====
Newton recognized that color is darker than white or light. He erroneously investigated light instead of the eye, the objective instead of the subjective. In so doing, he asserted that light rays are composed of seven colored rays. These seven were like the seven intervals of the musical scale. Schopenhauer claimed that there are only four prismatic colors: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. The rays described by Newton are supposed to be variously colored according to laws that have nothing to do with the eye. Instead of Newton's division of sunshine into seven rays, Schopenhauer claimed that color was a division of the eye's retina into two complementary parts. Like the [[Oracle|Delphic Oracle]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Schopenhauer concentrated on the subjective rather than the objective, on the observer's experience rather than the observed object. In general, he believed, the subjective viewpoint leads to correct results.

Colors are not in light. Colors are nothing more than the eye's activity, appearing in polar contrasts. Philosophers have always surmised that color belongs to the eye rather than to things. [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, claimed that color was at the head of his list of secondary qualities.

Newton's theory has color as an occult quality. Schopenhauer's theory claims to be more explanatory. He said that each color is a definite + or − side of the division of the retina's activity, expressed as a fraction that reflects the color's sensation.

====§ 9====
When the entire activity of the eye is completely qualitatively partitioned, the color and its spectrum (afterimage) appear with maximum energy as being vivid, bright, dazzling, and brilliant. If the division is not total, however, part of the retina can remain undivided. A union of the quantitative intensive division with the qualitative division of the retina occurs. If the remainder is active, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they fade into white. If the remainder is inactive, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they darken into black. If the remainder is only partially inactive, then the color loses its energy by mixing with gray.

====§ 10====
If the activity of the retina is divided without a remainder, or if the remainder is active, then a color and its spectrum (afterimage) are bright or pale. When such a color and its spectrum are united, then the eye sees pure light or white. For example, the mixture of bright or pale red and green on the same retinal spot results in the impression there of light or white. White cannot be produced by mixing colored pigments. With colors from a prism, however, the production of white can be demonstrated by using a mixture of colored light from each of the three main pairs of complementary colors: red – green, orange – blue, or yellow – violet. White can be produced from two complementary opposite colors when both of the external causes of the colors excite the same retinal place at the same time. Newton claimed that white could be produced by the aggregation of his seven prismatic colors. He erroneously considered color to be in light instead of in the eye. White is the result of the combination of two opposite colors because their inactivity, or darkness, is removed when the two active parts of the retina combine.

According to Newton, refracted light must appear colored. With the [[Achromatic lens|achromatic refractor]], however, this is not the case. Newtonians explain this by saying that the achromatic refractor's [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] and [[flint glass]] refract light as a whole with equal intensity but [[Dispersion (optics)|disperse]] individual colors differently. According to Schopenhauer, achromatism results when refraction occurs in one direction in the concave lens and in another direction in the convex lens. A blue band then overlaps an orange band while a violet edge covers the yellow. The qualitatively divided retina (color) is thus reunited in full activity, resulting in achromatism (the absence of color).

If an observer looks through a prism at a white disk on a black background, two subsidiary images are seen. This is due to double refraction as the light bends twice, when entering and leaving the prism. With this double refraction, the two subsidiary images appear as one above and one below the main image. The distance of the two subsidiary images from the main image corresponds to the Newtonians' dispersion. The wideness or narrowness of the colored bands are, however, nonessential properties that differ according to the type of light-refracting substance that is used. The top of the upper image is violet. Below the violet is blue. The bottom of the lower image is orange. Above the orange is yellow. In this way, along with the white disk and the black background, four prismatic colors appear: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. This is in disagreement with Newton's claim that there are seven prismatic colors. As the upper image overlaps black, it is seen as violet. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as blue. As the lower image overlaps black, it is seen as orange. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as yellow. This shows how colors are produced when the image mixes with either lightness or darkness, in accordance with Goethe's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;"[L]ight and its absence, are necessary to the production of colour." "[C]olours throughout are to be considered as half-lights, as half-shadows...." ''Theory of Colours'', Introduction. "Colour itself is a degree of darkness...." ''Ibid.'', § 69. Color appears in semi-transparent media when dark passes over light or ''vice versâ''. ''Ibid.'', § 239.when&lt;/ref&gt;

====§ 11====
In the operation of a healthy eye, three kinds of division of retinal activity often occur at once. (1) The quantitative intensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in a loss of color energy and a deviation toward paleness or darkness; (2) After being excited by an external stimulant, the quantitative extensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in the retina being covered by many various juxtaposed spots of color sensation; (3) When the stimulation ceases, an [[afterimage]] (physiological spectrum) appears on each retinal spot.

====§ 12====
Afterimages (spectra) appear after a mechanical shock to the eye. The eye's activity is convulsively divided. Transitory pathological spectra appear from glare or dazzle. The retina's activity is disorganized from over-stimulation. A dazzled eye sees red when looking at brightness and green when looking into darkness. The retina's activity is forcefully divided by the powerful stimulation. When the eye strains to see in dim light, the retina is voluntarily activated and intensively divided. Blue eyeglasses counter the effect of orange candlelight and produce the effect of daylight. An additional proof of the subjective nature of color, namely that it is a function of the eye itself and is only secondarily related to external objects, is given by the [[Daguerrotype|daguerreotype]]. It objectively shows that color is not essential to the appearance of an object. Also, people who are [[Color blindness|color blind]] would see color if it was in the object and not in the eye.

====§ 13====
Colors and the laws by which they appear reside within the eye. The external cause of color is a stimulus which excites the retina and separates its polarity. Goethe had organized color into three classes: physiological, physical, and chemical. He proposed that the external causes of color are physical colors and chemical colors.&lt;ref&gt;"...we considered colours, as far as they may be said to belong to the eye itself, and to depend on an action and reaction of the organ; next they attracted our attention as perceived in, or by means of, colourless mediums; and lastly, where we could consider them as belonging to particular substances. We have denominated the first, physiological, the second, physical, the third, chemical colours. The first are fleeting and not to be arrested; the next are passing, but still for a while enduring; the last may be made permanent for any length of time." Goethe, ''Theory of Colours'', Introduction. The physiological colors are subjective and literally exist in the eye of the beholder. The physical colors are seen through cloudy or turbid media, like a glass or water prism. The chemical colors are objective and exist in the external object.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The investigations of Newton started with chemical (objective) colors as given and, from them, explained physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored physiological (subjective) colors. Goethe also started with chemical (objective) colors. From them, he explained physical (seen through prism) colors and physiological (subjective) colors. Schopenhauer, on the contrary, started with physiological (subjective) colors as given. He then used them to explain physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored chemical (objective) colors.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Physical colors=====
Physical colors are temporary. They exist when light combines with cloudy transparent or translucent media, such as smoke, fog, or a glass prism. They are comprehensible because we know that they result from part of the qualitative division of retinal activity. Light is the external physical stimulus of the retina's activity. The more that we know about the effect (color as physiological fact), the more we can know ''a priori'' about its external cause. (1) The external stimulus can only excite color, which is the retina's polar division. (2) There are no individual colors. Colors come in pairs because each color is the qualitative part of the retina's full activity. The remaining part is the color's complementary color. (3) There are an infinite number of colors. Three pairs are distinguished by names of their own, however, because the retina's activity is bipartitioned in a rational proportion that consists of simple numbers. (4) A color's external cause, acting as a stimulus, must be capable of being changed and infinitely modified as much as the retina's activity can be infinitely divided qualitatively. (5) In the eye, color is a cloudy shade of white. This shadiness is the retina's resting part while the other retinal part is active. Newton's theory asserts that each prismatic color is 1/7 of the whole of light. If an infinite number, instead of seven, of light rays is assumed, then each color would be an infinitely small fraction of the whole of light. Schopenhauer's theory, however, claims that yellow is ¾ as bright as white. Orange is 2/3, red is ½, green is ½, blue is 1/3, and violet is ¼ as bright as white. The external cause of color is a diminished light that imparts just as much light to the color as it imparts darkness to the color's complement. Unlike Goethe, for Schopenhauer the primary phenomenon, or limit of explanation, is not an external cause, but the "organic capacity of the retina to let its nervous activity appear in two qualitatively opposite halves, sometimes equal, sometimes unequal...."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''On Vision and Colors'', § 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The accepted conjecture regarding the retina's organic capacities was later published in the [[Young-Helmholtz theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chemical colors=====
Chemical colors are more durable properties of an external object, such as the red color of an apple. A chemical color is incomprehensible because we don't know its cause. Its appearance is only known from experience and it is not an essential part of the object. Chemical colors result from changes in an object's surface. A slight change in the surface may result in a different color. Color, therefore, is not an essential property of an object. This confirms the subjective nature of color.

====§ 14====
Schopenhauer said that he didn't have to worry about his discoveries being attributed to previous thinkers. "For, prior to 1816, never at any time did it occur to anyone to regard color ... as the halved activity of the retina, and accordingly to assign to each individual color its ''definite numerical fraction'' — a fraction that, with another color, goes to make up unity, this unity representing white or the full activity of the retina." Schopenhauer criticized scientists for thinking that color exists in external objects, instead of in the spectator's eye. Color as vibrations of an [[Luminiferous aether|ether]] was rejected by him. [[Fraunhofer lines]], according to Schopenhauer, do not exist in light itself. They result from the edges of the slit that light passes through.

==Letter to Eastlake==
In 1841, Schopenhauer wrote a letter in English to [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] whose English translation of Goethe's book on colors had recently been reviewed in several journals. Schopenhauer included a copy of his ''On Vision and Colors'' with the letter. He briefly communicated the main point of his book as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...if, bearing in mind the numerical fractions, (of the activity of the Retina) by which I express the 6 chief colours, You contemplate these colours singly, then You will find that only by this, and by no other theory on earth, You will come to understand the peculiar sensation, which every colour produces in your eye, and thereby get an insight into the very essence of every colour, and of colour in general. Likewise my theory alone gives the true sense in which the notion of complementary colours is to be taken, viz: as having no reference to light, but to the Retina, and not being a redintegration [restoration] of white light, but of the full action of the Retina, which by every colour undergoes a bipartition either in '''yellow (3/4) and violet (1/4)''' or in '''orange (2/3) and blue (1/3)''' or in '''red (1/2) and green (1/2)'''. This is in short the great mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here he explained that color results from the way that the retina reacts to sensation. The cause may be light or other pressure on the retina. The fractions of two complementary colors sum to unity. White is undivided, whole retinal activity.

==Reception==
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's works and both seriously investigated [[color theory]]. [[Philipp Mainländer]] considered the work to be among the most important things ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Philosophie der Erlösung|last=Mainländer|first=Philipp|publisher=|year=1876|isbn=|location=|pages=420|quote=Es ist hier der richtige Ort, ein Verdienst Schopenhauer’s hervorzuheben, nämlich die ''wahre Theorie der Farbe'' geliefert zu haben. Er that es in seiner vortrefflichen Schrift: »Ueber das Sehn und die Farben«, die ich zu dem Bedeutendsten zähle, was je geschrieben worden ist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Itten]] based his work on Schopenhauer's theory of color. 

The mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer]] wrote: "Newton's theory of color analyzed light rays in their medium, but Goethe and Schopenhauer, more sensitive to the truth, considered color to be the polar splitting by the human eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brouwer|first=L.E.J.|date=|title=Life, Art, and Mysticism|url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1039886518|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume=Volume 37, Number 3, Summer 1996|pages=413|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist [[Ernst Mach]] praised that "men such as Goethe, Schopenhauer" had started to "investigate the sensations ''themselves''" on the first page of his work ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/dieanalysederemp1902mach#page/n17/mode/2up|title=Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen|last=E. Mach|first=|publisher=Gustav Fischer|year=1902|isbn=|location=Jena|pages=20|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rudolf Arnheim]], Schopenhauer’s "&amp;hellip;basic conception of complementary pairs in retinal functioning strikingly anticipates the color theory of [[Ewald Hering]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Arnheim, ''Art and Visual Perception'', Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted that the [[Bohemia]]n physiologist, [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak|Professor Czermak]], acknowledged Schopenhauer’s relation to the [[Young-Helmholtz theory]] of color.&lt;ref&gt;"I recently found in the reports of the Vienna Academy of Sciences an article by Professor Czermak on Schopenhauer's theory of colors. [Johann Nepomuk Czermak, ''Über Schopenhauers Theorie der Farbe: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Farbenlehre'' (''Regarding Schopenhauer's theory of color: a contribution to the history of color theory''), Vienna, 1870].  This confirms that Schopenhauer discovered independently and originally what is now known as the ''[[Young–Helmholtz theory]]'' of colors: the latter and the Schopenhauerian theory correspond in a most marvelous way, down to the very infinitesimals. It is claimed that the whole point of departure, color as primarily a physiological product of the eye, was first established by Schopenhauer." (''Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche'', Edited and Translated by [[Christopher Middleton (poet)|Christopher Middleton]], [[Hackett Publishing Company]], Inc. Indianapolis/ Cambridge, Letter to Carl von Gersdorff,  Basel, December 12, 1870)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bosanquet]] claimed that Schopenhauer’s color theory was in accord with scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;"Schopenhauer's ingenious modification and defence of Goethe's colour theory appears to be in harmony with modern [1892] physiological ideas. He interprets Goethe's account of colour as light mixed with darkness, to mean that colour involves a partial activity of the retina (light), and a partial inactivity (dark), and lays down the principle that the retina always tends to a complete activity, the parts of which, if not simultaneous, as in white light, are successive, as in complementary images." (''A History of Aesthetic,'' [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], page 366, note 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orchestre des Champs-Élysées''' is an orchestra that specializes in the performance of music from the period from roughly 1750 to the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt; That is, it covers the period from the flourishing of [[Haydn]] to that of [[Mahler]].&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt; It performs each work on instruments from the period of the composer's lifetime.&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt;

It was established in 1991.

==Venues==
As of 2010, the Orchestra has been in residence at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Elysées]] in Paris, and at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Palais des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels, for several years.&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt; It has performed in such venues as the [[Concertgebouw]] (Amsterdam), the [[Musikverein]] (Vienna), the [[Barbican Centre]] (London), [[Alte Oper]] (Frankfurt), the Philharmonic Halls in [[Berliner Philharmonie|Berlin]] and [[Gasteig|Munich]], the [[Gewandhaus]] (Leipzig), the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] (New York), [[Parco della Musica]] (Rome) and the Auditoriums of Dijon and [[Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre|Lucerne]].&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt;

==Conductors==
As of 2010, the Artistic Director and principal conductor is [[Philippe Herreweghe]].&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lfws" /&gt;

Guest conductors have included [[Daniel Harding]], [[Louis Langrée]], [[Christian Zacharias]], [[Heinz Holliger]], [[Christophe Coin]] and [[René Jacobs]].&lt;ref name="odce-bios" /&gt;

==Critical reaction==
Writing for Music Web International, Margarida Mota-Bull wrote: "for the first time, I felt differently towards this Symphony and this is entirely due to Herreweghe's, and the Orchestre des Champs-Élysées's credit....there was a light at the end of the tunnel, a triumph over adversity, which I believe was an interpretation very close to the composer’s intentions....this interpretation of the "Scottish" by Philippe Herreweghe and the Orchestre des Champs-Élysées was truly wonderful and arguably, one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing."&lt;ref name="mwi-mota" /&gt;

'''Plateresque''', meaning "in the manner of a silversmith" (''plata'' being [[silver]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), was an [[art]]istic movement, especially [[Architecture|architectural]], developed in [[Spanish Empire|Spain and its territories]], which appeared between the late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and early [[Renaissance]] in the late 15th century, and spread over the next two centuries. It is a modification of Gothic spatial concepts and an eclectic blend of [[Mudéjar]], [[Flamboyant]] Gothic and [[Lombard architecture|Lombard]] decorative components, as well as Renaissance elements of [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] origin.&lt;ref name="bozal"&gt;Bozal, Valeriano; ''Art history in Spain: From the origins to the Enlightenment'', pp. 157, 165. Ed Akal (1978). {{ISBN|978-84-7090-025-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of this [[syncretism]] are the inclusion of shields and pinnacles on facades, columns built in the Renaissance neoclassical manner, and facades divided into three parts (in Renaissance architecture they are divided into two). It reached its peak during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref name="arellano"&gt;Arellano, Fernando; ''The Hispanic American Art'', pp. 13–14. Ed. Universidad Católica Andrés (1988). {{ISBN|978-980-244-017-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Salamanca]], but also flourished in other such cities of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as [[León, León|León]] and [[Burgos]] and in the territory of [[New Spain]], which is now [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="bozal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt; 

Plateresque has been considered down to current times a Renaissance style by many scholars. To others, it is its own style, and sometimes receives the designation of ''Protorenaissance''.&lt;ref name="arias" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marias"&gt;Marías, Fernando; ''The 16th century: Gothic and Renaissance'', p. 24. Ed. Silex Ediciones (2002). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-037-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some even call it ''First Renaissance'' in a refusal to consider it as a style in itself, but to distinguish it from non-Spanish Renaissance works.&lt;ref name="alonso" /&gt;

The style is characterized by ornate decorative facades covered with floral designs, chandeliers, [[festoon]]s, fantastic creatures and all sorts of configurations.&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt; The spatial arrangement, however, is more clearly Gothic-inspired. This fixation on specific parts and their spacing, without structural changes of the Gothic pattern, causes it to be often classified as simply a variation of Renaissance style.&lt;ref name="Bendala2003"&gt;Bendala Galán, Manuel; ''Manual of the Spanish art'', p. 416. Ed. Silex Ediciones (2003). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-099-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In New Spain the Plateresque acquired its own configuration, clinging tightly to its Mudéjar heritage and blending with Native American influences.&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt;

In Spain its development is most remarkable in the city of Salamanca although examples are found in most regions of the country.

In the 19th century with the rise of [[Historicism (art)|historicism]], the Plateresque architectural style was revived under the name of [[Monterrey Style]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendala 2003, p. 739&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name Plateresque came from the silversmith trade. [[Diego Ortiz de Zúñiga]] used it for the first time, applying it to the Royal Chapel of the [[Cathedral of Seville]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="bozal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arellano" /&gt;

== Problems of geographical area and consideration as Style ==
[[File:Cañas-Monsteriuo de Santa Maria del Salvador.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Altar plateresque of the [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercian monastery]] of Santa María del Salvador, in Cañas ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]])]]
[[File:Burgos - Convento Sta Dorotea 03.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Tomb of the Saint Juan de Ortega in the church of the convent of Santa Dorotea, [[Burgos]]]]

Traditionally Plateresque has been considered a style exclusively "Spanish", a term also applied to architecture in the Spanish territories held by the [[Crown of Spain|Spanish Crown]] between the 15th and 17th centuries. But by the mid-20th century this geographical connotation was questioned under the arguments of several authors, especially [[Camón Aznar]] (1945) and Rosenthal (1958), who defined Plateresque generically as a unitary amalgam of elements&amp;nbsp;– Gothic, Muslim, and Renaissance. Aznar does not regard it as a style properly denoted as Renaissance, and Rosenthal emphasizes its association with certain buildings in other European countries, mainly France and Portugal, but also Germany and others.&lt;ref name="arias"&gt;Arias de Cossío, Ana María; ''The Art of the Spanish Renaissance'', pp. 90–91. Ed. Encuentro (2009). {{ISBN|978-84-7490-909-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alonso"&gt;Alonso Ruiz, Begoña; ''Late Gothic architecture in Castile: los Rasines'', p. 23. Ed. University of Cantabria (2003). {{ISBN|978-84-8102-304-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nieto Alcaide, Víctor Manuel; Morales, Alfredo José; Checa Cremades, Fernando; ''Renaissance architecture in Spain, 1488–1599'', p. 60. Ed. Cátedra (1989). {{ISBN|978-84-376-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem highlights the imprecision of the name Plateresque and the difficulties inherent in using it to describe productions from a period of confusion and transition between styles, especially since they are characterized by decorative profusion suggesting an attempt to disguise the failure of Spanish architects to develop new structural and spatial ideas. It has even been suggested that this problem could be solved by identifying what is called Plateresque as the replacement of Gothic decoration with  grotesques inspired by the works of the Italian [[Sebastiano Serlio]].&lt;ref name="bassegoda"&gt;Bassegoda Nonell, Juan; ''History of the architecture'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Any persuasive argument, however, must admit that the Plateresque or Protorenaissance was an artistic movement that responded to the demands of the ruling classes of imperial Spain, which had just completed the [[Reconquista]] and begun the colonization of the Americas. The Spanish were developing a consciousness of their growing power and wealth, and in their exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize these with what are now considered national treasures.

== Features ==
=== Spanish Plateresque ===

Typical Plateresque facades, like those of [[altarpiece]]s, were made as carefully as if they were the works of [[goldsmith]]s, and decorated as profusely. The decoration, although of various inspirations, was mainly of plant motifs, but also had a profusion of medallions, heraldic devices and animal figures, among others. Plateresque utilized a wealth of materials: gold plates on [[Battlement|crests]] and roofs, vases, etc. There is evidence of more [[polychrome]] works at the conclusion of the first third of the 16th century, when there appeared heraldic crests of historical provenance and long balustrades, to mention one kind of less busy decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Quesada Marco, Sebastián; ''Dictionary of Spanish culture and civilization'', p. 64. Ed. Akal (1997). {{ISBN|978-84-7090-305-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of decoration for all architectural surfaces led to the creation of new surfaces and subspaces, which were in turn decorated profusely, such as [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and [[aedicula]]s.&lt;ref name="avila"&gt;Ávila, Ana; ''Images and symbols in the Spanish painted architecture (1470–1560)'', pp 80–83. Ed. Anthropos (1993). {{ISBN|978-84-7658-417-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian elements were also being developed progressively as decoration: [[Rustication (architecture)|rustications]], classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], Roman [[arch]]es and especially grotesques.&lt;ref&gt;Amorós, Andrés, y Camarero, Manuel; ''Annotated Anthology of the Spanish literature: history and texts: 16th century'', p. 183. Ed. Castalia (2006). {{ISBN|978-84-9740-125-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration had specific meanings and can not be read as merely decorative; thus laurels, military shields and horns-of-plenty were placed in the houses of military personnel. In a similar vein, Greek and Roman myths were depicted elsewhere to represent abstract humanist ideals, so that the decorative became a means to express and disseminate Renaissance ideals.&lt;ref name="avila" /&gt;

Plataresque implemented and preferred new spatial aspects, so ''caustrales'', or stairs of open boxes, made their appearance.&lt;ref name="Marías, Fernando p. 163"&gt;Marías, Fernando; ''El siglo XVU: Gothic and Renaissance'', p. 163. Ed. Silex Ediciones (1992). {{ISBN|978-84-7737-037-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were few spatial changes with respect to the Gothic tradition.

=== American Plateresque ===

In America, especially in today's Mexico, various indigenous cultures were in certain stages of development that can be considered Baroque when the Spanish brought with them the Plateresque style. This European phenomenon mixed symbiotically with local traditions, so that pure Gothic architecture was not built in America itself, but the Plateresque mixed with Native American influences, soon evolving into what came to be called American Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alejo Carpentier|Carpentier, Alejo]]; Márquez Rodríguez, Alexis; y García Carranza, Araceli; ''Recovered steps: Essays  of Theory and Literary Criticism'', p. 37. Ed. Fundación Biblioteca Ayacucho (2003). {{ISBN|978-980-276-354-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Plateresque style follows the line of [[Isabelline Gothic|Isabelline]], where decorative elements of Italianate origin combine with Iberian traditional elements to form ornamental complexes that overlay the Gothic structures. We can speak of Plateresque that retains Gothic forms as a basis until 1530. After that date, although it continued to be used and Plateresque ornaments were still evolving, it became part of an architecture that was beginning to incorporate Renaissance ideas. In 1563, with the start of construction of the [[El Escorial|monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial]], the Renaissance architecture was purified through the interventions of [[Juan de Herrera]], which ended the splendor and spread of the Plateresque in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="arias" /&gt; But in Mexico it was not forgotten, leading to a [[Neo-Plateresque]] style in the 18th century.

In any case the Plateresque, considered or not as a style, and whether exclusively Spanish or more broadly European, represents the transition between Gothic and Renaissance styles.

=== Isabelline Style (15th century) ===
{{Main|Isabelline style|Manueline}}

In the 15th century a tendency to decorate with flamboyance began to develop in the [[Crown of Castile]] from [[Flanders|Flemish]], Islamic and Castilian architecture, which received the name of [[Isabelline Gothic]] because most of the construction was done at the command of [[Isabella I of Castile]]. These ornaments, which were of progressive complexity, did not influence the internal structure of the buildings.

Something similar happened in the same period in Portugal, resulting in what became known as the [[Manueline]] style.

=== Plateresque Gothic (late 15th century–1530) ===

A movement began in late 15th century Spain to disguise Gothic buildings with florid decoration, especially grotesques, but the superficial application of this principle did not change the spatial qualities or architectural structure of those buildings. This process began when the Renaissance arrived in [[Spain]] and architects began copying Renaissance architectural features without understanding the new ideas behind them, that is, without letting go of medieval forms and ideas.

Many of the Plateresque buildings were already built, to which were added only layers of Renaissance ornamentation, especially around openings (windows and doors), and in general, all non-architectural elements, with some exceptions.&lt;ref name="avila"/&gt;

Although the appellation 'Plateresque' is usually applied to the act of superimposing new Renaissance elements on forms governed by medieval guidelines in architecture, this trend is also seen in the Spanish [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] of the time.&lt;ref name="Marías, Fernando p. 163"/&gt;

=== Plateresque Renaissance (1530–1560) ===

This is the period in which the Renaissance had taken hold on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], although it had not yet reached its peak there. That event occurred with the amendments by [[Juan de Herrera]] and [[Philip II of Spain]] to the design of the [[El Escorial|monastery of El Escorial]], whose construction began in 1563.

By that time the decoration, though still profuse, is completely within Italianate parameters and applied to buildings designed according to the logic of Renaissance ideas.

=== Monterrey Style (19th century and first third of 20th century) ===
[[File:Palacio de Monterrey de la Duquesa de Alba.JPG|thumb|270px|Palace of Monterrey]]
[[File:Ayto2.JPG|thumb|270px|Facade of the City Hall of [[Seville]] in the Plaza de San Francisco work by Diego de Riaño]]
{{Main|Monterrey style}}

The Monterrey style arose in the 19th century. It was named after the [[Palace of Monterrey]] in [[Salamanca]], which was built in a Neo-Plateresque style, an [[Historicism (art)|historicism]] of the Plateresque.

The style survived until the early 20th century, featured in national and regional 'revivals'. It spread widely, and though not accepted in the critical circles of academia, some examples can be found on the [[Gran Vía (Madrid)|Gran Vía]] of [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;Navascués Palacio, Pedro, y Alonso Pereira, José Ramón; ''La Gran Vía de Madrid''. Ed. Encuentro (2002). {{ISBN|978-84-7490-667-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Of San Antonio Gómez, Carlos; ''The Madrid of the, 98:

In Mexico there was also a new iteration of Plateresque which spread to the Southwestern United States, beginning in the first half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Zuno Hernández, José Guadalupe; ''History of the arts in the Mexican Revolution'', vol. 2, p. 41. Ed. National Institute of Historical Studies of the Mexican Revolution (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; This Neo-plateresque is not to be confused with that of Spain at the end of 19th and early 20th centuries, the so-called Monterrey style.

== Plateresque Revival ==
In the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] style centuries later, it was differentiated from the earlier and plainer [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival style]] with the additional refinement of Plateresque and [[Churrigueresque]] detailing. [[Bertram Goodhue]] and [[Carleton Winslow]] Sr. studied [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial structures]] in Mexico before  designing the [[Panama–California Exposition|1915 Panama-California Exposition]] in [[San Diego, California]], that introduced this style to the United States and subsequent widespread popularity. In Mexico there are other examples, such as the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico]].

{{Wiktionary|rockism}}

'''Rockism''' is the belief in certain values thought to be intrinsic to [[rock music]], making the genre superior to other forms of [[popular music]].&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt; A "rockist" may also be someone who regards rock music as the normative state of popular music.&lt;ref name="Rosen2006" /&gt; '''Poptimism''' (or '''popism'''&lt;ref name="Gormely2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gormely|first1=Ian|title=Taylor Swift leads poptimism’s rebirth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/03/taylor-swift-poptimism|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the belief that [[pop music]] is as worthy of professional critique and interest as rock music.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; Detractors of poptimism describe it as a counterpart of rockism that instead privileges the most famous or best-selling pop, [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]], and [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] acts.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mann2017"/&gt; 

Magazines devoted to the serious discussion of popular music first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, with some formative rock critics suggesting that enduring pop music art was made by singer-songwriters using traditional rock instruments on [[Album era|long-playing albums]], and that pop hits reside on a lower aesthetic plane as a source of "guilty pleasure".&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"/&gt; The term "rockism" was coined in 1981 by English rock musician [[Pete Wylie]]&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorman2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob Stanley (music)|title=Yeah!

Norton|isbn=978-0-393-24270-6|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon became a [[pejorative]] used humorously by self-described "anti-rockist" critics in the [[United Kingdom|British]] press.&lt;ref name="Morley"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morley|first1=Paul|authorlink1=Paul Morley|title=Rockism - it's the new rockism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/26/popandrock.coldplay|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally coinciding with the rise of [[New Pop]] in the early 1980s,&lt;ref name="Stanley2014"/&gt; the term was not generally used beyond small music magazines until the mid 2000s, partly due to the increasing number of [[blogger]]s who used it more seriously in analytical debate.&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;

In the 2000s, a critical reassessment of pop music was underway, and by the next decade, poptimism supplanted rockism as the prevailing ideology in popular [[music criticism]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1" /&gt; While poptimism was envisioned as the "antidote" to rockist attitudes,&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; opponents of its discourse argue that it has resulted in certain [[pop star]]s being shielded from negative reviews as part of an effort to maintain a consensus of uncritical excitement.&lt;ref name="Lob2016"/&gt; Others argue that the two viewpoints have similar flaws.&lt;ref name="mann2017"/&gt;

===Early rock criticism===
{{Details|Music journalism|Art rock}}
[[File:Robert Christgau 05 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Robert Christgau]], pictured in 2005, became one of the first professional rock and pop critics.

Until the late 1960s, "[[pop music|pop]]" was considered to have the same definition as "rock" or "rock and roll".&lt;ref name=Gloag983&gt;{{cite book|first=Kenneth|last=Gloag|title=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press|year=2001| isbn=0-19-866212-2|p=983}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s to the 1970s, music magazines such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Creem]]'' laid the foundation for [[music journalism|popular music criticism]]&lt;ref name="Wolk05"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolk|first1=Douglas|authorlink1=Douglas Wolk|title=Thinking About Rockism|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0518/050504_music_smallmouth.php|website=''[[Seattle Weekly]]''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050604021323/http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0518/050504_music_smallmouth.php|date=May 4, 2005|archivedate=June 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to make [[popular music]] worthy of study.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; Following the release of [[the Beatles]]' 1967 album ''[[Sgt.

"Pop" became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.&lt;ref name=Warner2003&gt;T.

==Definitions and etymology==

===Rockism===
{{see also|New Pop}}
"Rockism" was coined in 1981 when English rock musician [[Pete Wylie]] announced his Race Against Rockism campaign, an inversion of "[[Rock Against Racism]]".&lt;ref name="Gorman2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gorman|first=Paul|title=In Their Own Write: Adventures in the Music Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1U4UAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Sanctuary|isbn=978-1-86074-341-2|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was immediately repurposed as a [[polemic]]al label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism.&lt;ref name="Rag"/&gt; Former ''[[NME]]'' writer [[Paul Morley]] recalled: {{quote|... one or two music journalists writing in the one or two music magazines that existed then were very pleased. I was one of them, and was using the term "rockist" the minute after I read Wylie say it. ... If the idea of rockism confused you, and you lazily thought [[Pink Floyd]] were automatically better than [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], and that good music had stopped with [[punk rock|punk]], you were a rockist and you were wrong. ... Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we original campaigning anti-rockists had been given such a tough time at school for liking [[David Bowie|[David] Bowie]] and [[Marc Bolan|[Marc] Bolan]] and not [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer|ELP]] and [[Led Zeppelin|Led Zep]].&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;}}

There is no widespread consensus for the definition of "rockism".&lt;ref name="Rag"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Raggett|first1=Ned|title=Rockism|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/pop_playground/rockism.htm|magazine=[[Stylus Magazine]]|date=June 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, to be a "rockist" was defined as demanding a perception of authenticity in pop music despite whatever artifice is needed.&lt;ref name="Wolk05"/&gt; In 2004, music critic [[Kelefa Sanneh]] offered a definition of rockists: "[S]omeone who reduces rock 'n' roll to a caricature, then uses that caricature as a weapon. Rockism means idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest [[Celebrity|pop star]]; lionizing punk while barely tolerating [[disco]]; loving the live show and hating the music video; extolling the growling performer while hating the [[lip-synch]]er."&lt;ref name=sanneh&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelefa|last=Sanneh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/arts/music/the-rap-against-rockism.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105070445/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/arts/music/the-rap-against-rockism.html  |title=The Rap Against Rockism |journal=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2004 |deadurl=no |archivedate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further accused rockists of projecting a sexist, racist, and homophobic point of view.&lt;ref name="sanneh" /&gt;

''[[Seattle Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Douglas Wolk]] acknowledged the loose definition of rockism and proposed: "Rockism, let's say, is treating rock as ''normative''. In the rockist view, rock is the ''standard state'' of popular music: the kind to which everything else is compared, explicitly or implicitly."&lt;ref name="Wolk05"/&gt; ''[[Popmatters]]''{{'}} Robert Loss wrote that "traditionalism" describes the policing of the present with the past, making it a better word for "rockism".&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015" /&gt; Design critic and [[indie pop]] musician [[Nick Currie]] (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement [[Stuckism]], which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Currie|first1=Nick|authorlink1=Momus|title=Design Rockism|url=http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/design-rockism|website=Aiga Design Archives|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405135726/http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/design-rockism|archivedate=April 5, 2007|date=November 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, as a response to confusion over what the term meant, Morley said that the definition had "something to do with" the following five points:
* "a) the difference between [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] and [[Captain Beefheart|Beefheart]], [[Album Era|albums and singles]], intelligence and stupidity, glitter and denim, and shaky notions of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] and [[artificiality]]" 
* "b) being able to listen to [[Nick Drake]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] with the same levels of intensity"
* "c) how rock groups hold their guitars and what they do with their legs as they hold their guitars"
* "d) ''[[Q magazine]]'', which turned hardcore rockist values into a glossy magazine"
* "e) the fact that [[Franz Ferdinand (Band)|Franz Ferdinand]] are achingly nostalgic for anti-rockism but are themselves intrinsically rockist."&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt;

=== Poptimism ===
{{quote box|
 |quote=There is a name for this new critical paradigm, 'popism'—or, more evocatively (and goofily), '[[poptimism]]'—and it sets the old assumptions on their ear: Pop (and, especially, [[hip-hop]]) producers are as important as rock auteurs, [[Beyoncé]] is as worthy of serious consideration as [[Bruce Springsteen]], and ascribing shame to pop pleasure is itself a shameful act.

Poptimism (also called popism)&lt;ref name="Morley"/&gt; is a mode of discourse which holds that pop music deserves the same respect as rock music and is as authentic and as worthy of professional critique and interest.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt; It positions itself as an antidote to rockism&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; and developed following [[Carl Wilson (critic)|Carl Wilson]]'s book about [[Céline Dion]]'s album ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' and Sanneh's 2004 essay against rockism in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Lob2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lobenfield|first1=Clair|title=Poptimism Isn’t the Problem|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/poptimism-isn-t-the-problem-8137206|work=[[Village Voice]]|date=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Sanneh asks music listeners to "stop pretending that serious rock songs will last forever, as if anything could, and that shiny pop songs are inherently disposable, as if that were necessarily a bad thing. Van Morrison's '[[Into the Music]]' was released the same year as the Sugarhill Gang's '[[Rapper's Delight]]'; which do you hear more often?"&lt;ref name="sanneh" /&gt; Loss cited Sanneh's article as "a sort of ur-text on poptimism", elaborating:

{{quote|style=overflow:inherit;|By its impoverished terms, the rockist represents traditional values of authenticity while the poptimist is progressive, inclusive, and sees through the myths of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]. The rockist is nostalgic—the old fart who says they don’t make any good music anymore—while the poptimist looks forward and values the new. The rockist makes Art out of popular music, insists on serious meaning, and demands artists who sing their own songs and play instruments, preferably guitars; the poptimist lets pop be fun and, if not meaningless, slight. The rockist is a purist, the poptimist a pluralist; the rockist is old, the popist is young; the rockist is anti-commercialist, the poptimist could care less.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loss|first1=Robert|title=No Apologies: A Critique of the Rockist v. Poptimist Paradigm|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/196122-no-apologies-a-critique-of-the-rockist-v.-poptimist-paradigm/|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Sanneh published his 2004 article, an argument about rockism developed in various web circles.&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt; In 2006, music journalist [[Jody Rosen]] noted the growing backlash against rock's traditional critical acclaim and the new poptimism ideology.&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2006/05/the_perils_of_poptimism.html |title=The Perils of Poptimism - Does hating rock make you a music critic? |journal=Slate |first=Jody |last=Rosen |date=May 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, ''[[Washington Post]]'' writer Chris Richards wrote that, after a decade of "righteously vanquishing [rockism's] nagging falsehood", poptimism had become "the prevailing ideology for today’s most influential music critics. Few would drop this word in conversation at a house party or a nightclub, but in music-journo circles, the idea of poptimism itself is holy writ."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Criticism of poptimists==
===Overlap with rockism===
[[File:Christopher Austin Paul Morley.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Paul Morley]] (left), a longtime critic of rockism, argued that many of poptimism's traits were indistinguishable from rockism.]]

In 2006, Morley derided the seriousness of contemporary music writers: "Many of the self-proclaimed American anti-rockists—or popists, or poptimists, or pop pricks—actually write with a kind of fussy, self-important rockist sheen. And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been."&lt;ref name="Morley" /&gt; That same year, Rosen spoke positively of the new movement but forewarned of possible excesses; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored.&lt;ref name="Rosen2006"/&gt; A week later, ''PopMatters''{{'}} Rob Horning responded to Rosen's writing with a more negative view of poptimism, writing that it is "sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it. Basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can make the case for your own importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horning|first1=Rob|title='Poptimism' The Death of Pop Criticism|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/2413-poptimism_the_death_of_pop_criticism/|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Quietus]]'' in 2017, Michael Hann argued that "the poptimists are just as proscriptive as the rockists", and listed the following as a few poptimist "sacred cows, which are beyond challenge":

*"The solo release by the member of a manufactured group is no longer the sad addendum to the imperial years; it is a profound statement of artistic integrity."
*"The surprise release by the big-name act is in itself, a revolutionary act."
*"To not care about [[Taylor Swift]] or [[Beyoncé]] or [[Lady Gaga]] or [[Zayn Malik]] is in itself questionable. It reveals not your taste in music, but your prejudices. In the worst-case scenario, you may be revealing your unconscious racism and sexism. At best, you're trolling."
*"Commercial success, in and of itself, should be taken as at least one of the markers of quality. After all, 50m [[Elvis]] fans can't be wrong."
*"Just as 'authenticity' is worthless as a symbol of a music's worth, so contrivance and cynicism might be elevated and celebrated, as evidence of the maker's awareness of the game they are playing."&lt;ref name="mann2017"/&gt;

According to Loss, rockism and poptimism are ultimately the same thing, and both rockists and poptimists treat music as a social commodity while mystifying the conditions in which music occurs.&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; He adds that, as is common in "a culture wherein history isn't valued much", poptimism neglects its historical precedents. As it presents itself as a radical break in the discourse of popular culture, older rock critics and journalists are usually depicted as "a bunch of bricklayers for the foundations of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]", a notion that Loss disputes: "Like film studies, rock criticism of the late '60s and the '70s was an attempt to make popular music worthy of study; it was poptimism before its day. It's somehow become generally accepted that rock criticism before the new millennium was overwhelmingly rockist."&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt;

===Commercial bias===
After the 2000s, the effects of poptimism attracted a belief that once a pop star reaches a certain level of stardom, many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews.&lt;ref name="Lob2016"/&gt; Richards argued that poptimism cheerleads the already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards |first=Chris |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/at-the-top-of-the-pop-music-heap-theres-no-criticizing-the-view/2015/04/16/d98d53a8-e1f2-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html |title=Do you want poptimism? Or do you want the truth? |journal=The Washington Post |date=April 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''{{'}}s Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of [[clickbait|click-driven]] internet journalism that aspired to the lowest common denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and [[film critic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Saul|last=Austerlitz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/the-pernicious-rise-of-poptimism.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031173914/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/the-pernicious-rise-of-poptimism.html |title=The Pernicious Rise of Poptimism |journal=The New York Times Magazine |date=April 6, 2014 |archivedate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: "When [he] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' I imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, "Don't tell them that!" We like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that it never was in the first place."&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt; He also noted a minuscule number of lowly-rated albums in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', and ''PopMatters'', and that "telling consumers what to purchase is still the point of a lot of music 'criticism'."&lt;ref name="PMLoss2015"/&gt;

Hann says that when writers deal with "upmarket" readership, they "need to be able to justify your coverage, and that [means] thinkpieces hailing the cultural significance of the new pop stars. ... And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, you know what? This isn't much cop.'" He recalls his experience as music editor for ''The Guardian'', where he has "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted to read about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society."&lt;ref name="mann2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hann|first1=Michael|title=Is Poptimism Now As Blinkered As The Rockism It Replaced? |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/22389-rockism-poptimism|website=[[The Quietus]]|date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other fields==

''[[Flavorwire]]''{{'}}s Elisabeth Donnely said that literary criticism "needs a poptimist revolution" in order to understand current literary phenomena such as ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' and better connect with the reading audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elisabeth|last=Donnelly|url=http://flavorwire.com/474759/why-book-criticism-and-literary-culture-needs-a-poptimist-revolution | title=
Why Book Criticism and Literary Culture Needs a Poptimist Revolution |journal=Flavorwire |date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Salon (website)|''Salon'']] published an article subtitled "Book criticism needs a poptimist revolution to take down the genre snobs", in which Rachel Kramer Bussell argued that book critics ignore often very good work and alienate readers by focusing only on genres considered "literary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rachel|last=Kramer Bussell|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/05/19/simon_pegg_has_a_franzen_moment_book_criticism_needs_a_poptimist_revolution_to_take_down_genre_snobs/ | title=Simon Pegg has a Franzen moment: Book criticism needs a poptimist revolution to take down genre snobs |website=Salon |date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Writing for ''Salon'' in 2016, Scott Timberg commented on critics giving more respect to celebrity chef [[Guy Fieri]],{{clarify|reason=confusing – "more" than what?|date=October 2018}} saying "Love or hate what is called poptimism, the impulse seems to be coming to food and restaurant criticism". Timberg likened food critics' "'in defense of [Fieri]' movement" to rock critics who "began writing apologias for [[Billy Joel]] and composed learned deconstructions of [[Britney Spears]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fieri-ssance is here|author=Scott Timberg|date=September 21, 2016|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/09/21/the-fieri-ssance-is-here-sorry-anthony-bourdain-its-no-longer-cool-to-hate-on-guy-fieri/|publisher=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Send the Light''' ('''STL''') was a British Christian book distributor which had absorbed other Christian publishers and bookshops, and eventually merged with the [[International Bible Society]] to become one of the largest non-profit book distributors in the world under the title of IBS-STL Global, now known as [[Biblica]].

==Early history==
The name “Send the Light” first appeared in 1957 as a Christian literature evangelism ministry sending copies of the [[Gospel of John]] from Chicago to Mexico, under the direction of [[George Verwer]], then a student at [[Moody Bible Institute]]. Verwer later moved to Bolton in the UK, where he established [[Operation Mobilisation]] (OM), which today distributes Christian literature in many countries around the world. Verwer decided to keep the name “Send the Light” for one particular aspect of OM, exporting Christian books to India. As STL, this developed into a general distributor of Christian books, and relocated to Bromley in Kent.

==Rise to Prominence==
In January 1986, Keith Danby was made chief executive of STL. Danby had a background in finance and by introducing stock catalogues, a free telephone number and next-day deliveries he increased turnover by 52% in one year. In 1988 he set up an independent board for STL which separated it from the governance of OM, and the following year the company relocated to Carlisle. In the 1990s STL began to expand its interests.

In 1992 an old Christian publisher, [[Paternoster Press]], was acquired, and the first '''Wesley Owen''' Books and Music shop was opened in Bromley. The intention was to create a “Christian [[Waterstone's]]” which would be more professional than many of the Christian bookshops then found in the UK. The following year STL took over the [[Church of Scotland]] shops, the [[Evangelical Christian Literature]] (ECL) shops, and the [[Scripture Union]] shops. Danby explained that STL’s aim was to show “excellence combined with Christian compassion”.

In 1993 OM released STL to operate as a separate organisation to allow it to concentrate on the publishing and distribution of Christian literature.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101225113214/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Mar07/Art_Mar07_09.html].

In 2001 STL acquired Word UK, which produced books, music and videos. STL became the largest Christian organisation dealing with books in the UK. STL remained a charity, and in 2001 was listed as the 74th largest one in the UK. STL was also the main gateway for several of the biggest American Christian publishers, including [[Tyndale House]], [[Zondervan]], [[Moody Books]], [[Baker Books]], and Multnomah.

==Entering the American Market==
In 2003 STL furthered its push into the US market by acquiring OM_Literature. It also purchased the distributor FaithWorks, and in 2005 it bought its largest acquisition, Appalachian Distributors Inc. The CEO of STL USA is David Passman.

==Merger with the International Bible Society==
In January 2007, '''Send the Light''' merged with the [[International Bible Society]] providing a truly global reach. The result was the creation of one of the largest non-profit book distributors in the world. The STL leaders set a target for when the merger went through on 1 March 2007 of having “a Bible for everyone on Earth”. The new organisation became known as "IBS-STL Global" and the UK operation as '''IBS-STL (UK)''' and registered as a charity and a company limited by guarantee.

==Financial difficulties, administration==
The last set of financial statements by IBS-STL UK for the year ended 28 February 2009,&lt;ref&gt;IBS-STL UK, ''Financial Statements for the year ended 28 February 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; and approved by the Board on 6 July 2009, refer to having had a "challenging year for the Charity". This had been characterised by "a combination of weak economic conditions in the UK, and a difficult move to the new [[SAP AG|SAP]] IT system", leading to a "significant operational loss" for that year. The report highlighted the financial risks which the Charity was exposed to, particularly those associated with loans, leases, and trade debtors and creditors. There was however no indication that these risks would be so severe as to result in the collapse of the business just four months later.

On 16 November 2009 IBS-STL UK announced that due to "a succession of financial problems, in particular the failed implementation of a new [[SAP AG|SAP computer system]] in October 2008, the effects of which were exacerbated by the economic downturn" a decision had been taken to "exit the business" at which point a buyer was sought.&lt;ref&gt;STL Distribution Blog, http://stldistribution.blogspot.com/2009/11/ibs-stl-uk-trade-communication.html?showComment=1258403900001&lt;/ref&gt; However, no sale arrangement could be made and IBS STL (UK) formally entered into Administration on 18 December 2009. Two partners from [[Baker Tilly LLP|Baker Tilly Restructuring and Recovery LLP]], Manchester, were appointed by the High Court as joint administrators. The ensuing process of administration resulted in the following outcome for the principal trading activities of IBS-STL (UK) :-

=== ''STL Distribution'' ===
In December 2009 John Ritchie Ltd of Kilmarnock, Scotland, finalised a deal with the Administrators to become the owners of the Christian book distribution and wholesaler business, STL Distribution Ltd. John Ritchie Ltd stated their intention to retain Carlisle as the major base of operation for this business. Keith Danby was replaced by Ken Munro as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stldistribution.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2009-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;updated-max=2010-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;max-results=50|title=STL Distribution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wesley Owen''===
At the time the business collapsed, IBS STL (UK) were operating a chain of 41 retail units (bookshops) under the 'Wesley Owen' brand name, situated in various towns and cities throughout the UK. In the months following, a majority of these shops were taken over by other Christian-based companies or charitable trusts leaving only a small number unable to continue trading after no buyers were found.

* '''[[Koorong|Koorong Books]]''' of Sydney, Australia, bought the Wesley Owen brand and domain names and took over 8 bookshops at Bath, Birmingham, Bristol, Bromley, Coleraine, Derby, Glasgow and York.
* '''[[CLC International]]''' of Alresford, Hampshire, took over 6 shops at Bolton, Cambridge, Coventry, Guildford, Kingston upon Thames and Stockport.
* '''Nationwide Christian Trust''' of Essex took over 19 shops and rebranded them under the trading name '''Living Oasis'''. These were at Aberdeen, Bedford, Belfast, Cheltenham, Chester, Edinburgh, Harrogate, Harrow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, South Woodford, Sutton, Watford, Weston-super-Mare and Worthing.
* The three bookshops at Falkirk, Walsall and Woking were taken over by independent traders.
* No buyers were found for the shops at Brighton, Carlisle, Dundee and Macclesfield.

===''Authentic Book Publishing''===
'''Koorong''', in addition to purchasing the Wesley Owen brand (see above), also purchased all of the '''Authentic''' and '''Paternoster''' intellectual property and author contracts and with plans to continue the book publishing business from the existing Authentic base in the Milton Keynes area.

===''Authentic Music''===
'''[[Kingsway Communications]]''' of Eastbourne, East Sussex, bought the music part of the Authentic Media business based in Milton Keynes.

==Liquidation==
On 1 December 2010, the company was moved from administration and into [[creditors' voluntary liquidation]]. The final progress report from the Administrators&lt;ref&gt;Cash, Russell and Bailey, Donald ''IBS-STL (UK) In Administration 29 November 2010'', Joint Administrators signed 10/12/10&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the largest of the Secured Creditors, [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], had been repaid £3.278m from the realisation of their legal charges over one freehold and two long leasehold sites, leaving a shortfall of £1.2m owing. [[Scripture Union]] had recovered £311k from an arrangement to receive proceeds from debtor realisations, which left 14% outstanding on the amount owing. Preferential claims comprising outstanding holiday pay to employees were settled in full. Unsecured Creditor claims aggregating to over £9.5m had not been paid at all at the end of the administration and would be addressed during liquidation. With the administrator fees and costs totalling over £500k, the funds remaining from the realised assets amounted to £2.15m. The final dividend for distribution to unsecured creditors was just over £35,000.

Athletics were an important part of the cultural life of Ancient Greeks. Depictions of boxing and [[bull-leaping]] can be found back to the [[Bronze Age Greece|Bronze Age]].  Buildings were created for the sole use of athletics including [[Stadion (running race)|stadions]], [[palaestra]], and [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]]. Starting in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]], [[Panhellenic Games]], including the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], begin taking place each year. These games gave people from all over Greece the chance to gain fame for their athletic prowess. Athletics in Greece became one of the most commonly depicted scenes of everyday life in their art.

== Architecture relating to athletics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

As the site of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], the architecture of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] is heavily influenced by the theme of athletics. The temple of Zeus, for example, is decorated with a frieze containing the 12 labors of [[Heracles]], who is believed to be the founder of the Olympic Games, and a [[Eastern Pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia|pediment]] depicting the myth of [[Pelops]], another origin tale of the Olympics. 
[[File:Stadium at Olympia 2013.JPG|thumb|Birth of the Olympic Games in the Stadium at Olympia]]
The main site of where the Olympic Games took place was the [[Stadium at Olympia]] which is located to the east of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|sanctuary of Zeus]]. The physical landmarks of the Stadium are 212.54 meters long and 30–34 meters wide, and it served mainly for running races that determined the fastest person in the world. The track was made of hard-packed clay to serve as traction for the people competing in the running events.

The site of Nemea showcase both the practical and ceremonial use of athletic architecture in the early Hellenistic monumentalization of Panhellenic sanctuaries. The bath house [[Nemean Baths]] contains a western room with basin baths and an eastern plunge bath. The western basin room is common of 4th century baths throughout Greece and was likely place where visiting athletes could wash themselves during their stay. The eastern plunge bath however, is one of only 4 others in Greece, all of which have been found at Panhellenic ritual sites. Though its exact function is unknown, its public nature suggests that it may have had a ritual component in the athletic games or ceremonies. Nemea also housed a stadium, where athletes would participate in games, specifically the stadion (running event).

== Depictions of Games ==

During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] practiced several sports, including wrestling, bull jumping, acrobatics, and boxing. This is apparent in multiple pieces of art, ranging from frescoes to pottery. The youth of the boys in the [[Akrotiri Boxer Fresco]] hints that athletes began training very early on in life, suggesting that sports were extremely important to Minoan society. It has even been suggested that athletics played a religious role in society due to their widespread practice. Finally, the youth of athletes in many pieces of artwork indicates that athletic competition may have been a rite if passage into adulthood for the Minoans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhw.gr/olympics/ancient/en/102.html|title=OLYMPIC GAMES|website=www.fhw.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular and famous combat sports in Ancient Greece was [[boxing]]. Boxing in Ancient Greece was far less regulated than modern boxing, with opponents chosen at random, regardless of weight or age, and matches lasting until one of the competitors admitted defeat or was left unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/boxing.html|title=Ancient Sports: Boxing|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighters were often left disfigured; for example, one boxing injury commonly depicted was the [[cauliflower ear]], which was depicted notably in the [[Boxer Stele Fragment from Kerameikos|Boxer Stele from Kerameikos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many who participated in these ancient boxing matches were gravely injured or even killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-bloody-deadly-heavy-fights-of-ancient-greece|title=The Bloody, Deadly, Heavy Fights of Ancient Greece {{!}} FIGHTLAND|work=Fightland|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, boxing was highly popular among the Ancient Grecian population and therefore was frequently featured on works of art. Another notable depiction of an ancient boxer is [[Boxer at Rest]], also known as Terme Boxer, who has just finished a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2013/the-boxer|title=The Boxer: An Ancient Masterpiece Comes to the Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Boeotian Dancer's Group Kothon, Black Figure Tripod, 6th Century B.C.|kothon, black-figure tripod by the Boeotian Dancer's Group]] features two men engaged in a boxing match on one of its legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.artstor.org/#/asset/AMICO_DALLAS_103842516|title=Artstor|last=Artstor|website=library.artstor.org|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic events, particularly [[Panhellenic festivals]], brought drew both athletes and spectators. Occurrences of athletic competitions were first recorded by [[Homer]] in the [[Iliad]]. As a result, competitions had ties with war and military training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/abccliow/development_of_the_concept_of_sport_in_the_greek_world/0|title=Development of the Concept of Sport in the Greek World - World History Encyclopedia - Credo Reference|website=search.credoreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of athletic events in ancient art sometimes show the athletes wearing armor in order to illustrate the connection between athletes and warriors.

Depictions of athletic events were also portrayed on pieces of pottery used in everyday life. Artists like [[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]] and the [[Foundry Painter]] depicted events such as [[Pankration|pancration]] scenes and wrestling matches on kylixes which were then used at [[symposium]]s or male drinking parties. Both of these painters used the red-figure technique, developed in Athens in 530 B.C., in their work and this technique allowed them to have greater freedom to express movement, emotion, and anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vase/hd_vase.htm|title=Athenian Vase Painting: Black- and Red-Figure Techniques {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depictions of Athletic events in Art expanded as major athletic events also expanded. In 708 BCE, the [[pentathlon]] was added to the Olympic games. Since this event required the skills for five different events ([[Discus throw|discus]], [[Javelin throw|javelin]], [[long jump]], [[running]], and [[wrestling]]) these athletes were held in high regard among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be/eng/TC006EN.html|title=Ancient Olympics|website=ancientolympics.arts.kuleuven.be|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became common to have a [[Kylix depicting Pentathletes|kylix]] or an amphora depict these events, and in turn, it praised the athletes by leaving their legacy in the art.

The [[Kleophrades Terracotta Panathenaic Prize Amphora|Kleophrades terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora]] (ca. 500 BCE) provides an example of recognition for success in athletic endeavors. At the [[Panathenaic Games]], victors would be awarded a prize amphora filled with a luxury good like olive oil. The amphora itself would depict [[Athena Promachos]], or Athena as a military leader directing troops into battle, and the athletic event in which the victor competed. Recognition for athletic endeavors and success by depicting the event itself as this Panathenaic prize amphora does highlights just how important athleticism was to the Ancient Greeks. Another example of the many Panathenaic Prize Amphoras is the [[Euphiletos Painter Panathenaic Amphora]] (530 BC). Painted in black figure, this Panathenaic amphora depicts a [[Stadion (running race)|stadion]] from Panathenaic games. Like other prize amphora, this amphora serves to emphasize athleticism and the victors of these events.
[[File:Terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora MET DT5498.jpg|thumb|207x207px|[[Kleophrades terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora|Panthenaic Amphora By Kleophrades Painter]]]]
Descriptions of women’s sport during Archaic Period mainly come from literary sources, and there are a few examples of female sporting events. One of the most popular forms of physical activity for ancient Greek women is running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D.|first=Mills, Brett|date=|title=Women of Ancient Greece: Participating in Sport?.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED370951|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl|bronze statuettes of athletic Spartan girl]], which depicts Spartan young women involving in racing games, provide material evidence to the accounts of different women’s races in ancient Greece.

== Athletic Dedications ==

The prominence of athletic subject material in Greek art is no coincidence. Even statuary, called Athletic Dedications, arose as a way to immortalize Greek athletes and athletic games. Athletic events and art were so closely related that a common practice of athletes was to commemorate their victories with artistic dedications. One example of this would be the marble [[Apobates Base]] which commemorates victory in a chariot race at the [[Panathenaic Games]]. A competitor would erect a dedication to celebrate an athletic victory and place it in a sanctuary or Panhellenic site.  These dedications were an artistic celebration of athletic prowess which every Greek could observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/greek-art/beginners-guide-greece/a/olympic-games|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AGMA Victorious Apobates 7305.jpg|thumb|[[Apobates Base]]]]
As part of the games taking place at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], many individuals competed in the pentathlon, a competition consisting of five events. The [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon|Ancient Olympic Pentathlon]] consisted of the [[discus throw]], [[long jump]]s with weights attached to their feet, [[javelin throw]], [[running]], and [[wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/pentathlon.html|title=Ancient Olympic Events|last=|first=|date=|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victors of the pentathlon would go on to receive prizes such as exclusive items that were made specifically for the victor. For example, the amphorae of the [[Panathenaic Games]], often filled with expensive olive oil, featured [[Athena]] standing with a sword and shield to represent their victory in the games.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Bothmer|first=Dietrich|date=|title=A Panathenaic Amphora|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257530.pdf.bannered.pdf|journal=Metropolitan Museum of Art|volume=|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Olympics were dedicated to [[Zeus]], often these prizes would become votive dedications to him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Bronze Diskos Thrower Statue|Bronze Diskos Thrower]] (''Discobolus'') was a rare commodity that came from a time in which not many pieces survived: the end of the Persian Wars. The piece itself still exhibits many traits of archaic art, despite coming from the early Classical period (480 - 460 BCE). The athlete in the statue was a participant of diskos throwing, a very popular event in Ancient Greece and even modern day Olympics.

'''''Stetind in Fog''''' ({{lang-no|Stetind i tåke}}) is an oil painting by [[Peder Balke]] from 1864.

==Genesis==
Peder Balke got the inspiration for the painting during his first extended trip in 1832 to seek out North Norwegian nature. The dramatic landscape along the northern Norwegian coast impressed him and he returned to Stetind as a motif on several occasions later in life. Similar motifs are also in the 26 sketches that he sold to King [[Louis Philippe of France]], which are now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris.

[[File:Stetind_2009_2_crop.JPG|thumb|left]]
Stetind is situated on the [[:no:Stefjorden|Stefjorden]], at the headwaters of the [[Tysfjorden]]. In a [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] poll it was chosen as Norway's national mountain.&lt;ref name="NRK"&gt;{{cite web |ref=CITEREFMikalsenBudalen |last=Mikalsen |first=Kjell |last2=Budalen |first2=Andreas |date=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web |ref=CITEREFThorsn.C3.A6sHarnangAskheim2016 |last=Thorsnæs |first=Geir |last2=Harnang |first2=Harald |last3=Askheim |first3=Svein |date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Painting ==
The painting is a dramatic composition in the Romantic tradition and depicts the relationship of man to the forces of nature. The mountain of Stetind is positioned in the middle of the picture, which has a fairly low horizon line. A gray fog dominates the painting. Out in the wind are two boats and a small group of people standing on a rock knoll looking out over the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063612/NO_280_007.html|title=Stetind in Fog|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provenance ==
The painting was bought by the [[National Gallery (Norway)|National Gallery]] in Oslo in 1980. The National Gallery also has two smaller versions of the same scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1564">Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] wrote his '''Symphony No. 3''' in 1959-60. Although employing serial procedures, the harmonies are firmly tonal throughout. In fact, the romantic gestures of the symphony, the majestic use of brass (including [[Wagner Tuba]]s), as well as the use of German tempo markings, owes much to the symphonies of [[Anton Bruckner]], and the symphony has been termed by critics as ''neo-Brucknerian'' in style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19124">The '''Synod of Elvira''' ({{lang-la|Concilium Eliberritanum}}, {{lang-es|Concilio de Elvira}}) was an ecclesiastical [[synod]] held at Elvira in the [[Western Roman Empire|Roman province]] of [[Hispania Baetica]], now [[Granada]] in southern Spain.&lt;ref name = "Hennecke"&gt;{{Citation | first = Edgar | last = Hennecke | author-link = Edgar Hennecke | contribution = Elvira, Synod of | title = [[Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]] | edition = 3rd}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its date has not been exactly determined but is believed to be in the first quarter of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], approximately 305–6. It was one of three councils, together with the [[Synod of Arles (314)]] and the [[Synod of Ancyra]], that first approached the character of general councils and prepared the way for the first [[ecumenical council]]. It was attended by nineteen bishops and twenty-six presbyters, mostly resident in [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]]. Deacons and laymen were also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Philip | last = Schaff | title = History of the Christian Church}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty-one canons are recorded, although it is believed that many were added at later dates. All concern order, discipline and conduct among the Christian community.  Canon 36, [[Aniconism in Christianity|forbidding the use of images in churches]], became a bone of contention between Catholic and Protestant scholars after the [[Protestant Reformation]].

It is one of a number of [[Ancient church councils (pre-ecumenical)|pre-ecumenical ancient church councils and synods]].  The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia refers to this as a "council," conveying a wider scope than a synod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05395b.htm | publisher = New Advent | title = Catholic encyclopedia | year = 1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican refers to it using both terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_31011994_directory_en.html | publisher = Roman curia | place = The Vatican | title = Congregation of the clergy}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grenade, Puerta de Elvira.jpg|thumb|If the ancient Roman city of Elvira was located in the Albaicín district of Granada, as some think, the synod may have taken place just inside the Puerta de Elvira (eleventh-century), seen here.]]

==Place and purpose==
The place of meeting, Eliberri, rendered as Elvira,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eliberri]], Elimberri'' or ''Ilumberri'' was an ancient cognate of today Basque ''Hiriberri'' or ''Irunberri'' that mean 'new domain', 'new town.&lt;/ref&gt; was not far from the modern [[Granada]], if not, as A.W. Dale&lt;ref&gt;Dale 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edgar Hennecke&lt;ref name = "Hennecke" /&gt; think, actually identical with it. There the nineteen bishops and twenty-four presbyters, mostly  from [[Hispania Baetica]] and [[Carthago Nova]],{{Efn | Hennecke noted that Legio (Leon) and Saragoza were represented, but not Tarragona.}} assembled, probably at the instigation of [[Hosius of Córdoba]], but under the presidency of Felix of Accitum ([[Guadix]]) in Baetica, probably by virtue of his being the oldest bishop present,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Hosius%20(1),%20a%20confessor%20under%20Maximian | first = Henry | last = Wace | title = Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature | contribution = Hosius (1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view to restoring order and discipline in the church. The canons which were adopted reflect with considerable fullness the internal life and external relations of the Spanish Church of the 4th century. The reputation of this council drew to its canons further canons that came to be associated with the Synod of Elvira.

Victor De Clercq&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Clercq | first = Victor | type = review | contribution = Samuel Laeuchli, ''Power and Sexuality: The Emergence of Canon Law at the Synod of Elvira | title = Vigiliae Christianae | volume = 29 | issue = 1 |date=March 1975 | page = 76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; notes "that except for [[Hosius of Córdoba]], we know practically nothing about these men, nor do we know with certainty when and why the council was held, and that the church of Spain is one of the least known in pre-constantinian [sic] times". 

==The canons==
Maurice Meigne&lt;ref&gt;"Concile ou collection d'Elvire," ''[[Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique]]'' '''70''' (1975) pp 361-387&lt;/ref&gt; considers that only the first twenty-one canons in the list that has been transmitted&lt;ref&gt;Problems of the textual transmission of the canons are discussed in Hamilton Hess, ''The Early Development of Canon Law and the Council of Serdica'' (Oxford Early Christian Studies, Oxford: 2002) pp 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt; were promulgated at Elvira; the remainder having been added to the collection.

The social environment of [[Christian]]s in Hispania may be inferred from the canons prohibiting [[Interfaith marriage|marriage]] and other intercourse with [[Jew]]s, [[paganism|pagans]] and [[heretics]], closing the offices of [[flamen]] and [[duumvir]] to Christians, forbidding all contact with [[idolatry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Grigg | contribution = Aniconic Worship and the Apologetic Tradition: A Note on Canon 36 of the Council of Elvira | title = Church History | volume = 45 | issue = 4 |date=December 1976 | pages = 428–33}} finds that the hostility to [[icon]]s, forbidding the introduction of images into the churches is based on Christian [[apologist]]s' use of pagan sources denouncing the veneration of images, rather than on the prohibition in ''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'', which it fails to cite. He instances the contemporaneous apologists [[Arnobius]] and [[Lactantius]].&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise participation in pagan festivals and public games. The state of morals is mirrored in the canons denouncing prevalent vices. The canons respecting the clergy exhibit the clergy as already a special class with particular privileges, as acting under a more exacting moral standard, with heavier penalties for delinquency. The [[bishop]] has acquired control of the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacraments]], [[presbyter]]s and [[deacons]] acting only under his orders; the episcopate appears as a unit, bishops being bound to respect one another's disciplinary decrees.

The canons (which are available in English and Latin online) are almost entirely concerned with the conduct of various elements of the Christian community, and have no theological content as such.  Sanctions include long delays before baptism, exclusion from the [[Eucharist]] for periods of months or years, or indefinitely, sometimes with an exception for the death-bed, though this is also specifically excluded in some cases. Periods of [[penance]], often for sexual offences, extend to 5 or 10 years:  "Canon 5. If a woman beats her servant and causes death within three days, she shall undergo seven years' penance if the injury was inflicted on purpose and five years' if it was accidental.  She shall not receive communion during this penance unless she becomes ill.  If so, she may receive communion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fordham | title = Canon 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the canons which pertain to Jews served to maintain a separation between the two communities. Canon 15 prohibited marriage with pagans, while Canon 16 prohibited marriage of Christians with Jews. Canon 78 threatens Christians who commit adultery with Jews with [[ostracism]]. Canon 49 forbade the blessing of Christian crops by Jews, and Canon 50 forbade the sharing of meals by Christians and Jews.

Among the early canons (which are possibly the only original ones), Canon 1 forbade giving holy communion to lapsed Christians even ''in articulo mortis'', an unusually severe application of [[Novatianism|Novatianist principles]], which had divided the church since the recovery from mid 3rd-century persecutions: compare the severity of [[Cyprian of Carthage]]. The subject of this leading canon is a major indication for a date following recent persecution.

Among the later canons, of especial note are Canon 33, enjoining [[celibacy]] upon all clerics, married or not, and all who minister at the altar (the most ancient canon of [[clerical celibacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Charles A | last = Frazee | title = The Origins of Clerical Celibacy in the Western Church | journal = Church History | volume = 57 | issue = Supplement Centennial | year = 1988 | pages = 108–26 | doi=10.2307/3165654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also relating to the subject of clerical celibacy is Canon 27, which calls for bishops and other clergy to refrain from living with women unless they are of relation.&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, Karl Joseph von, Joseph Hergenröther, Alois Knöpfler, and Henri Leclercq. 1907. Histoire des conciles d'après les documents originaux. 236. Paris: Letouzey et Ané. http://www.llmcdigital.org/default.aspx?redir=87181.&lt;/ref&gt; This canon is believed to be condemning the practice of [[Syneisaktism]], or spiritual marriage, which was growing more and more popular among ascetic men and women.

Canon 36 states, "It has seemed good that images should not be in churches so that what is venerated and worshiped not be painted on the walls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm | quote = Placuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere, ne quod colitur et adoratur in parietibus depingatur | title = Elvira canons | publisher = Cua | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AS7rgB7f?url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm | archivedate = 2012-09-05 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia | quote = This canon has often been urged against the veneration of images as practised in the Catholic Church. [[Anton Joseph Binterim|Binterim]], De Rossi, and [[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]] interpret this prohibition as directed against the use of images in overground churches only, lest the pagans should caricature sacred scenes and ideas; [[Franz Xaver von Funk|Von Funk]], Termel, and [[Henri Leclercq|Dom Leclerq]] opine that the council did not pronounce as to the liceity or non-liceity of the use of images, but as an administrative measure simply forbade them, lest new and weak converts from paganism should incur thereby any danger of relapse into idolatry, or be scandalized by certain superstitious excesses in no way approved by the ecclesiastical authority.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | A possible translation is also: "There shall be no pictures in the church, lest what is worshipped and adored should be depicted on the walls."}}  It allegedly [[Aniconism|forbids pictures]] in churches (compare the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]] in the East); according to [[Philip Schaff]] this canon "has often been quoted by Protestants as an argument against image worship as idolatrous; while Roman Catholic writers explain it either as a prohibition of representations of the deity only, or as a prudential measure against heathen desecration of holy things".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schaff | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc2.v.vi.xv.html | title = History | volume = II | chapter = 55 | publisher = The Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 36 was the first official statement on art by the Christian Church and so of special interest in the history of Early Christian and medieval art, even if it represents Church policy only within the limits of the synod's jurisdiction of Spain.  Recent scholarship argues that, rather than read the canon as a simple prohibition against the use of Christian art as idolatrous as has traditionally been done, its purpose was to counter a disturbing culture of apostasy and loss of communal identity that had arisen in the Spanish Church through the strong integration of the Christian subculture within the dominant pagan culture (the result of a peaceful period of social integration followed by an unusually bloody persecution).[[:File:///C:/Users/Rackdude/Google Drive/Riverside/2015-2016/Winter/Wikipedia Project/Basic Files/Synod of Elvira.docx# edn1|[i]]]  In this, Canon 36 was a compromise solution in its silence on the subject of private Christian art.  Never adopted outside of Spain (although many other canons of the Synod of Elvira were), Canon 36 is tacit evidence of a significant point of transition in the development of a distinctly Christian artistic culture, one that was leaving the venerable Judaic precedent of the Second Commandment behind as the Church cautiously accepted its increasingly mainstream status and the powerful socio-political dynamic that was a part of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1999-03-01|title=In the Beginning: Theories and images of creation in Northern Europe in the twelfth century|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8365.00138/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=3–55|doi=10.1111/1467-8365.00138|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon 38, permits lay [[baptism]] under certain conditions, and Canon 53, forbids one bishop restoring a person [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by another.

Other provisions relating to images forbade Christian slave-owners from allowing their pagan slaves to keep their personal idols, or "if this is impossible to enforce, they must at least avoid the idols and remain pure.  If this does not happen, they are alienated from the church" (Canon 41).  Canon 60 says "If someone smashes an idol and is then punished by death, he or she may not be placed in the list of martyrs, since such action is not sanctioned by the Scriptures or by the apostles."  Canon 34 says "Candles are not to be burned in a cemetery during the day.  This practice is related to paganism and is harmful to Christians.  Those who do this are to be denied the communion of the church".  Other canons imposed "the rigorous form of fasting" every Saturday (Canon 26), forbade the baptism of chariot racers or stage performers (Canon 62), and many tightly control the reception of former pagan priests into the Christian church and clergy (Canons, 2,3,4,55).

Several canons relate only to the behaviour of women, such as Canon 67: "A woman who is baptized or is a catechumen must not associate with hairdressers or men with long hair..."  Canon 81 reads: "A woman may not write to other lay Christians without her husband's consent.  A woman may not receive letters of friendship addressed to her only and not to her husband as well."  However married former prostitutes are not to suffer delays in baptism on that account (Canon 44).

==Date of the synod==
The solution of the question of the date hinges upon the interpretation of the canons, that is, upon whether they are to be taken as reflecting a recent persecution, or as redacted in a time of peace, that is either after or before the [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecution under Diocletian]]. Thus the earliest investigators, [[Louis Duchesne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Duchesne | first = Louis | author-link = Louis Duchesne | title = Le concile d'Elvira et les flamines chrétiennes | language = French |trans-title=The Elvira council and the Christian… | journal = Mélanges Renier | place = Paris | year = 1887 | pages = 159–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Victor De Clercq,&lt;ref&gt;De Clercq (1954), ''Ossius of Cordova''.&lt;/ref&gt; argue for a date between 300 and 303, i.e. before the persecution under [[Diocletian]]; others for a date between 303 and 314, after the persecution, but before the [[Synod of Arles (314)]]; a few others argue for a date between the synod of Arles and the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], (325).  [[Karl Josef von Hefele]] and [[Robert William Dale]] follow early compilers of the canons [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi]] and [[Jean Hardouin]] in agreement upon 305 or 306, while Hennecke&lt;ref name = "Hennecke" /&gt; concludes that "the whole attitude points to a time of peace, not to one immediately following a persecution; the complete absence of any provisions as to the case of the lapsed is enough to preclude the modern theory as to the date".

==Documentation==
The scanty documentation of the Synod of Elvira was first assembled by  Ferdinand de Mendoza, ''De confirmando Concilio IIIiberitano ad Clementem VIII'', 1593.

The canons are available online [https://www.webcitation.org/6AS7rgB7f?url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm in English] and [http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/main/elvira/canons_of_elvira_01.shtml in Latin (with dictionary lookup links)]

The '''Tapestry of Creation''' or '''Girona Tapestry''' is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] panel of [[needlework]]  from the 11th century, housed in the Museum of the [[Cathedral of Girona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Measuring  3.65 x 4.70 m, it originally may have served as baldachin for the Altar of the Holy Cross in the church's entrance. Some believe that it was used as a curtain or even a carpet. It depicts a series of [[theology|theological scenes]] related with the Christian [[creation myth]]s.

The "[[tapestry]]" is actually a panel of [[Couching|couched needlework]] laid down on the surface of the ground fabric, a terracotta wool intertwined with  different colors (red, green, yellow, dark and light blue, gray) wool and white linen threads. The border is formed by a frame, rather deteriorated, containing small square pictures which, according to some scholars, could have been added later to the central sector, due to their different, [[Byzantine art|Byzantine-like]] style and themes.

The tapestry, of which only the upper part remains, is divided into three cycles:
*the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]], presided over by the [[Christ Pantocrator]]
*the cosmic elements
*the Stories of the Holy Cross

The Christ Pantocrator, depicted as a beardless young man, occupies a circle in the center of the tapestry. He is surrounded by a circle whose sectors, aside from the upper one with a dove, symbol of God, show the seven days of the creation, until the creation of [[Adam and Eve]]. The two circles include quotes from the Genesis.

The remaining space in the rectangle including the central disk, houses at the corner four representation of Winds, depicted by four young winged men in Roman-like dresses, driving vessels and blowing air into horns. The central upper square is an old man representing the Year, with the [[Wheel of Time]], while at the upper corners are the personifications of the Rivers of Paradise. The other six upper squares depict the Four Seasons, as well as [[Samson]] and [[Abel]] (or [[Cain]]).

The two lower corners show the personifications of the Sun (left, symbolizing Sunday) and the Moon (right, much deteriorated, symbolizing Monday), while the  side outer squares represent the months (only eight of which survive). At the bottom are incomplete scenes of the discovery of Holy Cross.

'''''The Banquet of a Rich Glutton''''' is a painting completed by the Italian [[Baroque art|Baroque]] painter [[Mattia Preti]] and housed in the Pinacoteca of the Gallerie Nazionali di Arte Antica ([[Palazzo Barberini]]) in Rome, Italy.

==Description==
The painting was likely commissioned by Antonio Caputo, a Neapolitan merchant from Preti during his stay in Naples. It was likely a companion piece to the ''Banquet of Absalom'' now hanging in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]].

The subject of this painting derives from the parable of the [[rich man and Lazarus]] found in the gospel of Luke 16: 19-31. The name ''Epulone'' has been attached in Italy to the rich man, but also generically refers to a ''feaster'' (with pejorative gluttonous suggestion). The etymology of the word comes from a banquet sometime prepared in honor of the gods. The painting depicts a rich man after completion of his meal, with empty plates, surrounded by servants, while in the background, is the beggar Lazarus.

The painting was purchased in 1895 from a [[Monte di Pietà]], where such a painting would have resonated as both a ''[[memento mori]]'' and counsel towards charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleriabarberini.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/181/preti-la-cena-del-ricco-epulone Entry at Gallerie Nazionali di Arte Antica].&lt;/ref&gt; The painting would have been thematically antithetical to the still life works depicting a cornucopia of a contemporary rich man's kitchen.

'''''The Red Vineyards near Arles''''' is an oil painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Vincent van Gogh]], executed on a privately primed [[French Standard Sizes for Oil paintings|Toile de 30]] piece of burlap in early November 1888. It depicts workers in a [[vineyard]], and is believed to be the only van Gogh painting sold during his lifetime. 

It has been listed among the artist's major works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lj75DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Russia|publisher=Penguin|date=2016|isbn=1465462635|quote=[...] but the real masterpieces are upstairs.

==History==
''The Red Vineyard'' was exhibited for the first time at the [[Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890|annual exhibition of Les XX, 1890]] in Brussels, and sold for 400 Francs (equal to about [[USD|$]]2,000 today) to [[Anna Boch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annaboch.com|title=Anna Boch.com  Impressionist, patron of many artists|website=annaboch.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an impressionist painter, member of [[Les XX]] and art collector from Belgium;&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker (1980), 356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickvance (1984), 168–169;206&lt;/ref&gt; Anna was the sister of [[Eugène Boch]], another impressionist painter and a friend of Van Gogh, too, who had painted Boch's portrait (''[[Portrait of Eugene Boch|Le Peintre aux Étoiles]]'') in [[Arles]], in autumn 1888. 

It was acquired by the famous Russian collector [[Ivan Morozov|Sergei Shchukin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://annaboch.com/theredvineyard/|title=The Red Vineyard by Vincent van Gogh - World's most valuable painting|website=annaboch.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later nationalised by the [[Bolsheviks]] with the rest of his collection, which eventually passed to the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Moscow]], where is resides today.

'''The Walther Collection''' is an art foundation dedicated to the critical understanding of historical and contemporary photography and related media. Through a program of international exhibitions, in-depth collections, original research, and scholarly publications, The collection aims to highlight the social uses of photography and to expand the history of the medium. The Walther Collection retains a three-gallery museum campus in Neu-Ulm, Germany, a Project Space in New York City, and produces an expansive traveling exhibition program worldwide. The collection’s exhibitions put in dialogue selective ''oeuvres'' of key European and American photography alongside expansive holdings of African photography and video art, with contemporary Chinese and Japanese photography and media art, and vernacular photographic imagery from across the globe. The collection’s exhibition program is complemented by public lectures and screenings, international scholarly symposia, and a critically acclaimed series of catalogs and monographs co-published with Steidl.

== The Collection ==

The Walther Collection is defined by its desire to establish a cross-cultural discourse in the fields of photography and media art, ranging across temporal and geographical differences to instigate in-depth analysis of the relationship between the history of the photographic medium and notions of subjectivity and social identity. By pairing works from African or Asian artists with that of their western counterpoints, The Walther Collection reimagines the poetic and political dimensions of the global photographic archive, with its diverse histories and changing meanings. Such an approach allows the collection to offer new perspectives on the legacy of anthropological and ethnographic visions of the Other.

Featuring historical imagery alongside modern and contemporary works, and including select pairings with practitioners from across the globe, The Walther Collection puts forth a nuanced consideration of the ways that photography has provided a structure for exploring the bounds of identity across chronological, spatial, cultural, and social contexts.

With over 15,000 works, the Walther Collection is considered one of the most significant holdings of contemporary Chinese, African and vernacular photography in the world.

The Walther Collection was founded on a nucleus of ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' ([[New Objectivity]]) photographers such as [[August Sander]] and [[Karl Blossfeldt]], and the industrial photographs of Bernd and Hilla Becher.[[Artur Walther#cite note-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]Central to the beginnings of the collection also include contemporary German artists Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth, all students of the Bechers. The methodological documentary approach favored by the artists of the school of ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' and the Kunstakademie Duesseldorf suggested a new, conceptual framework of taxonomies that became a defining influence on The Walther Collection’s acquisitions and gallery presentation.

For over three decades, Artur Walther traveled extensively across the globe, forging connections with artists and often accompanied by key curators within the field of photography. With a deeply investigative and research-driven approach, he focused on the work of practitioners in regions whose work provided significant contributions to expanding the history of the photographic medium.

The core of the collection’s Chinese works were acquired in the 1990s, often shortly after their production, and highlights some of the most significant works of Chinese performance photographers, including that of the Beijing East Village artists and Ai Weiwei, Cang Xin, Huang Yan, Song Dong, Zhang Huan, and Zhuang Hui. At a time when few western collectors took interest in the artistic landscape of the East, Walther was drawn to the experimental work coming out of the 1980s and 1990s by artists probing the socio-political changes they were witnessing. With continued research and artist engagement up to present-day, the collection charts the various trajectories of photography and video art in China from the end of the Cultural Revolution to the globalized works of contemporary media artists.

Beginning in the early 2000s, Walther began a dialogue with curator and critic Okwui Enwezor, who curated the first extensive African photography exhibition, ''In/Sight: African Photographers, 1940 to the Present'' (Guggenheim, 1996). In the following years, the two began a long-term examination into photography across the African continent. Extensive travels with Enwezor throughout the continent resulted in the core works within the collection’s holdings of African photography, including with masters in studio portraiture Seydou Keïta, J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere, Malick Sidibé, and Samuel Fosso, as well as South African social documentary photographers David Goldblatt Santu Mofokeng, Mikhael Subotzky’s, Guy Tillim, and [[Jo Ractliffe]]. The modern and contemporary African works featured in the collection now range from the 1950s to the present day, cutting across colonial and post-colonial histories while investigating the multivalent facets of social identity, questioning notions of belonging, and examining socio-political concerns of migration, lineage, and the legacies of colonialism.

The Walther Collection also significant holdings of late nineteenth and early twentieth-century cartes de visite, postcards, albums, vintage portraits and books from Southern and Eastern Africa. Walther was inspired by Santu Mofokeng’s ''The Black Photo Album'' and the way in which it created a ‘counter-archive’ of historical South African studio portraiture to expand his collection to include historical photography. The holdings of historical African photography are part of The Walther Collection’s ongoing process of revising conceptions of photographic history according to Hal Foster’s idea of the “archival impulse,” whereby confronting the archive, new systems of knowledge can be created.

While the collection’s engagements in these areas is ongoing, since 2015 it has accrued vast holdings of vernacular photography, non-fine art imagery. Rather than focusing on aesthetics, this view of vernacular photography concentrates on communal or ritual behaviors. It encompasses a broad social history, spanning from 1839 to the present, and retains a global scope, with particular attention to South Africa and the United States. By presenting exhibitions and initiating discussions around vernacular photography, the collection examines how photographic representations reinforce or subvert prevailing roles of class, gender, sexuality and race.

Taxonomy and seriality are key organizing and aesthetic motifs in the collection. Rejecting Henri Cartier-Bresson’s notion of the “decisive moment” in favor of ordering images according to types, movement, structure or time, the typological and serial approaches to photography interrogate and expose a set of formal similarities and methods, turning from pictorial representation toward systems of knowledge. Moreover, the formal concept of the typology allows The Walther Collection to stage a comprehensive conversation between artists of disparate geographic and cultural backgrounds. Bringing together portraits by modern photographic masters such as August Sander, Seydou Keïta, and Richard Avedon, or juxtaposing Karl Blossfeldt’s studies of plant forms, Bernd and Billa Becher’s typologies of industrial architecture, and J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere’s encyclopedic documentation of Nigerian hairstyles, such pairings open up a dynamic comparison that reveals not only similarities but also surprising new perspectives.

== Exhibition Spaces ==

=== The New York Project Space ===
Opened in 2011 and located in the West Chelsea Arts Building in New York City, The Walther Collection Project Space serves to extend the Collection's mission and program to American audiences. By functioning as an incubator, the Project Space allows The Walther Collection to stage dynamic and current exhibitions along with curatorial talks, gallery walkthroughs and screenings.

=== The Neu-Ulm Campus ===
The Neu-Ulm Museum space consists of three buildings: the White Cube, the Black House, and the Green House. The galleries of the 10,000 square-foot campus are distributed around three different buildings named for their architectural character.

The main building, the White Cube, was designed by the Ulm-based architectural firm of Braunger-Wörtz, and is a light-filled three-story structure consisting of a 5,000-square-foot gallery on the sub-ground level and a smaller, 1,500-square-foot gallery and reading room on the second floor. The Green House is a renovated two-level structure. The house remains exactly as it was built more than half a century ago, and its façade is covered with green ivy. There are two modest galleries on each floor, and their intimate scale allows for the exhibition of small-format works. The Black House is a one-level, bungalow-style structure with no windows on the sides of the building facing the street, lit by skylights and a glass curtain wall in the back.

=== Traveling Exhibitions ===
Travelling exhibitions are central to the Walther Collection’s global scope and desire to facilitate dialogue within and outreach beyond the field, expanding perspectives and engagement. The Walther Collection has participated in major art fairs such as [[African Photography Encounters|Rencontres Africaines de la Photographie]], Biennale Africaine de la Photographie (2017–2018); the Photography Show presented by AIPAD (2017); and [[Rencontres d'Arles]] (2014).

== Research ==
The Walther Collection has organized a symposium for each major exhibition series, cultivating a space for research and scholarly discussion between leading international academics, curators, artists, and cultural producers in the field. The result of these symposia form the basis of critical and scholarly writing featured in the collection’s publications.
