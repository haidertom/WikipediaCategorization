      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9766">[[Image:John Ruskin 1870.jpg|thumb|[[John Ruskin]] (1819-1900), c.1870. [[Leo Tolstoy]] described Ruskin as, "one of those rare men who think with their heart." A champion of the work of [[J.M.W. Turner]], Ruskin detested the work of [[James McNeill Whistler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm|title=Turner Whistler Monet - Tate|publisher=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An '''art critic''' is a person who is specialized in analyzing, interpreting and evaluating [[art]]. Their written critiques or reviews contribute to [[art criticism]] and they are published in newspapers, magazines, books, exhibition brochures and catalogues and on web sites. Some of today's art critics use [[art blog]]s and other online platforms in order to connect with a wider audience and expand debate about [[art]].

Differently from art history, there is not an institutionalized training for art critics (with only few exceptions); art critics come from different backgrounds and they may or may not be university trained.&lt;ref&gt;James Elkins, ''What happened to art criticism'', Prickley Paradigm Press, 2003, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional art critics are expected to have a keen eye for art and a thorough knowledge of [[art history]]. Typically the art critic views art at [[art exhibition|exhibitions]], [[art gallery|galleries]], [[museum]]s or [[artist]]s' [[studio]]s and they can be members of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] which has national sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aica-int.org/spip.php?article3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212152149/http://www.aica-int.org/spip.php?article3 |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very rarely art critics earn their living from writing criticism.

The opinions of art critics have the potential to stir debate on art related topics. Due to this the viewpoints of art critics writing for art publications and newspapers adds to public discourse concerning art and culture. [[Art collector]]s and patrons often rely on the advice of such [[critic]]s as a way to enhance their appreciation of the art they are viewing. Many now famous and celebrated artists were not recognized by the art critics of their time, often because their art was in a style not yet understood or favored. Conversely, some critics, have become particularly important helping to explain and promote new [[art movements]] &amp;mdash; [[Roger Fry]] with the [[Post-Impressionist]] movement, [[Lawrence Alloway]] with [[Pop Art]] as examples.

== Controversies ==

According to James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;James Elkins, ''Introduction'' in ''Is Art History Global?'', dir. James Elkins, Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2007, pp. 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a distinction between art criticism and art history based on institutional, contextual and commercial criteria; the history of [[art criticism]] is taught in universities, but the practice of art criticism is excluded institutionally from academia. An experience-related article is Agnieszka Gratza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/oct/17/frieze-art-critic-academia-journalism|title=Frieze or faculty? One art critic's move from academia to journalism|first=Agnieszka|last=Gratza|date=17 October 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Always according to James Elkins in smaller and developing countries, newspaper art criticism normally serves as art history. James Elkins's perspective portraits his personal link to [[art history]] and [[art historians]] and in ''What happened to art criticism'' he furthermore highlights the gap between art historians and art critics by suggesting that the first rarely cite the second as a source and that the second miss an academic discipline to refer to.&lt;ref&gt;. James Elkins, ''What happened to art criticism'', Prickley Paradigm Press, 2003, pp. 4-5 and p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at [[St Martins School of Art]] and [[Ateliers, Arnhem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesvenicebiennale.org/artist.asp?artistid=8 walesvenicebiennale.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 he won a [[Paul Hamlyn]] Award for the Visual Arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/3742194.stm news.bbc.co.uk, Thursday, 14 October, 2004], accessed April 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 he was Welsh artist-in-residence at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Searle, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/newbritishtalent/story/0,15594,1362667,00.html ''Picture perfect''], ''The Guardian'', Nov 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was shortlisted for the [[Beck's Futures]] prize in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,,-11505375813,00.html arts.guardian.co.uk], accessed April 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His work ''Walk a Mile in My Shoes'' was a rack of 41 pairs of size 13 shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Duff, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/becks-pushes-boundaries-with-bums-breakfast-and-smelly-shoes-471878.html ''Beck's pushes boundaries with 'Bums Breakfast' and smelly shoes''], ''The Independent'', March 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Williams won the [[Gold Medal (National Eisteddfod of Wales)|Gold Medal for Fine Art]] at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] for his mixed media sculptures and artworks, including carved [[wellington boot]]s filled with straw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/bedwyrs-tribute-farmer-wins-gold-1813602 "Bedwyr’s tribute to the farmer wins the Gold Medal for Art at the Eisteddfod"], ''Wales Online'', 1 August 2011, accessed 20 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of tortoise-mounted stelae originated no later than early 3rd century (late [[Han dynasty]]).
According to the 1957 survey by Chêng Tê-k'un (鄭徳坤), &lt;!-- there is [[:de:Zheng Dekun]] already.... --&gt;

The ''bixi'' tradition flourished during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasties]]. The Ming founder, the [[Hongwu Emperor]], in the first year after the dynasty had been proclaimed (1368), adopted regulations, allowing tortoise-based funerary tablets to the [[Mandarin square|higher ranks]] of the [[Chinese nobility|nobility]] and the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarinate]]. He tightened the rules in 1396, leaving only the highest nobility (those of the ''gong'' and ''hou'' ranks) and the officials of the [[mandarin square|top 3 ranks]] eligible for ''bixi''-based stelae. The type of [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] crowning the tortoise-born stele, and the type and number of other statuary at the tomb site, were prescribed by the same regulations as well.&lt;ref name=deGroot2&gt;{{citation

At the Hongwu Emperor's [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum|own mausoleum]], a huge ''bixi'' holding the so-called ''Shengde'' stele welcomes visitors at the Sifangcheng pavilion at the entrance of the mausoleum complex. Three centuries later (1699), the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty visited Nanjing and contributed another tortoise, with a stele praising the founder of the Ming, comparing him to the founders of the great Tang and Song dynasties of the past.&lt;ref name=pd2003&gt;[http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/9409/871387.html 明孝陵两大“碑石之谜”被破解] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018052502/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/9409/871387.html |date=2012-10-18 }} (Solving the two great riddles of the Ming Xiaoling's stone tablets).

The inscription is interpreted as "His reign was as glorious as that of the Tang and Song"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hongwu Emperor's tortoise tradition was continued by the later Ming and Qing emperors, [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties|whose mausoleums]] are usually decorated by ''bixi''-born steles as well.

Even the self-declared emperor [[Yuan Shikai]] was posthumously honored with a ''bixi''-based stele in [[Anyang]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynews.net.cn/jray/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=3736  洹园里的破嘴龟] (The tortoise with a broken mouth in Huanyuan Park) {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] Premier [[Tan Yankai]] (1880–1930), whose stele near [[Nanjing]]'s [[Linggu Temple]] had its inscription erased after the Communist Revolution.

Occasionally, a foreign head of state was honored with a ''bixi'' as well, as it happened to the sultan of [[Brunei]] [[Abdul Majid Hassan]], who died during his visit to China in 1408. The [[Tomb of the King of Boni|sultan's grave]], with a suitably royal ''bixi''-based monument, was discovered in Yuhuatai District south of [[Nanjing]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Rozan Yunos, [http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/11/09/the_brunei_sultan_who_died_in_china "The Brunei Sultan who died in China"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319185326/http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/11/09/the_brunei_sultan_who_died_in_china |date=March 19, 2009 }} The Brunei Times, 9.11.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After an [[Nestorian Christian|ancient Christian stele]] was unearthed in [[Xi'an]] in 1625, it, too, was put on the back of a tortoise. In 1907, this so-called [[Nestorian Stele]] was moved to the [[Stele Forest]] Museum along with its tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Michael |last=Keevak| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCsCcij1S4AC

These days, long-lost bixi continue to be unearthed during archaeological excavations and construction work. Among the most remarkable finds is the discovery of a huge 1200-year-old in [[Zhengding]] ([[Hebei]] Province) in June 2006. The stone turtle is 8.4 m long, 3.2 m wide, and 2.6 m tall, and weighs 107 tons.

The concept of a tortoise-borne, dragon-crowned stele was early adopted by China's northern neighbors. The earliest extant monument of the
[[Göktürks|Turkic Kaganate]] - the so-called "Bugut Stele" of the late 6th century from [[Arkhangai Province]] in western [[Mongolia]] with a [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and (most likely) [[Sanskrit]] inscription was installed on a stone tortoise. It is now in the provincial capital, [[Tsetserleg (city)|Tsetserleg]].&lt;ref name=bugut&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=2&amp;lang=e The Tatpar (Kutlug) kagan memorial complex, 581-582]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alyilmaz&gt;Dr. Cengiz Alyilmaz, [http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/alyilmaz.html On the Bugut Inscription and Mausoleum Complex]. Ēran ud Anērān: Studies presented to Boris Ilich Marshak on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday. Compareti, Raffetta, Scarcia - Editors. Electronic Version (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Turkish researcher Cengiz Alyilmaz, it was the design of this stele that influenced the builders of the important 8th-century stelae with [[Old Turkic script|Old Turkic]] inscriptions, many of which also stood on tortoises.&lt;ref name=alyilmaz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Bazylkhan  [http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?lang=e&amp;mod=1&amp;tid=1 The Orhon Inscriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, the most accessible one is probably [[Bayanchur Khan]]'s (Eletmish Bilge Kağan)'s [[Tariat inscriptions|Terhin-Gol stele]] (753 AD), now in the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in [[Ulan Bator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=24&amp;lang=e  Inscription El etmish Bilge kagan (Tariat // Terh)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)]] and the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] erected tortoise-based monuments as well, some of which have been preserved in Russia's [[Ussuriysk]] and Mongolia's [[Karakorum]].

In Japan, this form of tortoise-supported stele is found primarily at the graves of prominent [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) figures, especially in the city of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. Another large collection of tortoise-borne stelae, spanning 17th through 19th centuries, can be seen at the cemetery of the [[Tottori Domain]] ''[[daimyō]]'' outside [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori]]. Otherwise, the form does not seem to have been particularly popular in earlier or later times.

In Korea, tortoise-borne stelae are known already during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period (e.g., the Tombstone of King [[Muyeol of Silla]], erected 661).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cha.go.kr/korea/heritage/search/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,00250000,37 경주 태종무열왕릉비(慶州 太宗武烈王陵碑)] (Includes photos of Korean monuments) {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monuments of this type have been preserved from the later [[Goryeo]] dynasty as well, such as the [[Stele of Bongseon Honggyeongsa]] (1026).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackmoon.tistory.com/292 봉선홍경사사적갈비 (奉先弘慶寺事蹟碣碑); 성주사낭혜화상백월보광탑비 (聖住寺郎慧和尙白月보光塔碑)] (Includes photos of Korean monuments) {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam also has a long tradition of tortoise-born stelae, where they [[:commons:Category: Vinh Lang stele|commemorate]] emperor [[Lê Lợi]] as well as the graduates of the Confucian academy at Hanoi's [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]].

While there is no indigenous tradition of erecting stelae on tortoise-shaped pedestals in the United States, a Qing period ''bixi'' can be seen on campus of the [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. [[Harvard Bixi|This bixi]] was given as a gift to Harvard in 1936 by the members of Harvard Clubs in China; an appropriate text was carved for the occasion on the tablet carried by the tortoise.

==Development as an art form==
According to [[Victor Segalen]]'s assessment, the early ([[Han dynasty|Han]] and the [[Six Dynasties]]) stone tortoises were artistic images of quite real aquatic turtles.&lt;ref name=seg68/&gt; The creatures looked quite realistic through the [[Song dynasty]], when huge tortoise pedestals, such as the ones in [[Shou Qiu]] near [[Qufu]], or the one in [[Dai Miao]] at [[Mount Tai]] were erected.

The early-Ming specimens, while still definitely [[Green sea turtle|chelonian]], had sprouted small ears; sides of their heads and their [[carapace]]s are often decorated by a leaf-like design. They usually have prominent teeth, which real-life turtles don't.&lt;ref name=lishuai/&gt;
By the mid-[[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (the 18th century), however, the stele-bearing tortoise becomes the characteristic [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed ''bixi''.

According to some 19th-century western authors, the Chinese tradition of using a tortoise as a pedestal may have a common source with the Indian legend of the world being held up by a giant turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LoNAAAAIAAJ
|title=The Chinese reader's manual: A handbook of biographical, historical, mythological and general literary reference
|first= William Frederick|last= Mayers|year=1874|location=Shanghai|publisher=American Presbyterian Mission Press
|page=94}}, section 299 ("Kwei, 龟"). Quote: "The conception is probably derived from the same source with that of the Hindoo legend of the tortoise supporting an elephant, on whose back the existing world reposes." Mayers is also quoted in: {{citation|first=Charles Alfred Speed|last= Williams|title=Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs: An Alphabetical Compendium of Antique Legends and Beliefs, as Reflected in the Manners and Customs of the Chinese|publisher= Tuttle Publishing|year= 1988|ISBN= 0-8048-1586-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wV_3WRPC3gQC|page=405}} (reprint of the 1941 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The word ''bi'' 贔 or ''bixi'' 贔屭 (also written with a variant character, 贔屓) is translated by Chinese dictionaries as "strong", "capable to support great weight". The word ''bixi'' is attested already in [[Zhang Heng]]'s (78-139) "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" (''Xi Jing Fu''), which mentions "the great strides" of the giant divine ''bixi''.&lt;ref&gt;"Western Metropolis Rhapsody" ([[:zh:s:西京賦|西京賦]]), Quote: "綴以二華，巨靈贔屓，高掌遠蹠，以流河曲，厥跡猶存". Quoted also in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Zhang Heng's follower [[Zuo Si]] (250 - 305) in his ''[[Eastern Wu|Wu]] [[Jiankang|Capital]] [[Fu (poetry)|Rhapsody]]'' (''Wu Jing Fu'') explicitly associates the attribute ''bixi'' with the legendary giant turtle ''[[ao (turtle)|ao]]'', whose head supports a sacred mountain.&lt;ref&gt;"Wu Capital Rhapsody" ([[:zh:s:吳都賦|吳都賦]]), Quote: "巨鼇贔屓，首冠靈山" (Giant ''Ao'' ''bixi'' [i.e. 'mighty'], [his] head holds up a sacred mountain). Quoted also in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bixi'' became associated with the stele-carrying tortoises no later than the [[Ming dynasty]]. The terminology, however, did not immediately become stable. The earliest known Ming-era list of fantastic creatures appearing in architecture and applied art is given by [[Lu Rong]] (1436–1494) in his ''Miscellaneous records from the bean garden'' (椒园杂记, ''Shuyuan Zaji''). The ''bixi'', with the syllables swapped (屭贔, ''xibi''), appears in the first position in that list:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''xibi'' looks like a tortoise. By its nature it likes to carry heavy weights.  It used to be employed to support stone tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lu Rong]]'s  ''Shuyuan Zaji'' is quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "屭赑其形似龟，性好负重，故用载石碑". The full text of ''Shuyuan Zaji'' can be found at a number of sites online, e.g. here: [http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html  菽園雜記] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306151643/http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html |date=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lu Rong claims that his list (including the total of 14 creatures) is based on the ancient books of beasts and supernatural creatures, the ''[[Shan Hai Jing]]'' and the ''Bo Wu Zhi'' (博物志); however, as the modern researchers Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong note, that is not the case, and the names, much more likely, were taken by Lu Rong from the folklore of his times.&lt;ref name=yang2008&gt;[[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Lu Rong, the mighty tablet-carrying tortoise appears in various lists of the "[[Chinese dragon#Children of Dragon|Nine children of the Dragons]]", compiled by several Ming authors. However, both [[Li Dongyang]] (1441–1516) in his ''Huai Lu Tang Ji'' and Xie Zhaozhe ([[:zh:謝肇淛|謝肇淛]], 1567–1624) in his ''Wu Za Ji'' ([[:zh:五雜俎|五雜俎]], ''Five Assorted Offerings'', ca. 1592), refer to the tortoise that carries the stele by the name ''baxia'' (霸下), rather than ''bixi''; at the same time they apply the name ''bixi'' to the "literature-loving" dragons that appear on the sides of the stele:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''baxia'' has an innate love for carrying weights; the creature [that] now [is] under tablets is its image. ... The ''bixi'' has an innate love for literature; the dragons [that] now [are] on the sides of tablets are its image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Dongyang]]'s  ''Huai Lu Tang Ji''  (怀麓堂集) quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "霸下平生好负重，今碑座兽足是其遗像。... 赑屭平生好文，今碑两旁龙是其遗像。"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name ''bixi'', however, is given to the table-carrying tortoise in the more popular version of the list of the "Nine Children of the Dragon". In this form of the list, given e.g. by [[Yang Shen]] (1488–1559), the ''bixi'' is given the first position:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''bixi'' looks like a tortoise, and likes to carry heavy weights; [he] is the tortoise-carrier (''guifu'') now [seen] under stone tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yang Shen]]'s ''Sheng'an Ji'' (升庵集) quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "赑屭形似龟，好负重，今石碑下龟蚨是也。"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stone tortoises in art and popular lore==
The great stone tortoises, whose antiquity sometimes went farther into the history than anyone could remember, often made impression on people who saw them, and excited their curiosity. It is said that an old legend of the stone tortoise made by [[Lu Ban]] that went to swim in the ocean every summer, and came back to its seaside hill in the fall, inspired [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]]'s lines:
&lt;ref name=deGroot4_341&gt;{{citation

}}. The legend, and the reference to [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]], comes from the book ''Shu Yi Ji'' (述异记, "Extraordinary stories"), commonly ascribed to [[Ren Fang]] (460—508). The story from the tortoise from a seaside hill  (海畔石龜), as well as the one about another sea-going stone turtle from [[Linyi]] County  (臨邑縣), and their translations to [[Modern Standard Mandarin]], can be found [http://www.fulan.com/167/ebook/classic/taipinggj/tpgj374.html here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712014209/http://www.fulan.com/167/ebook/classic/taipinggj/tpgj374.html |date=July 12, 2006 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Lu Ji's poem: «[http://sc.zdic.net/weijin/1223279777683632.html 石龟尚怀海。我宁忘故乡] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724140557/http://sc.zdic.net/weijin/1223279777683632.html |date=July 24, 2011 }}». Unlike modern Chinese editions, {{harvnb|de Groot|1892b|p=341}} has  亡 (to die) instead of 忘 (to forget), which changes the meaning of the second line to "I'd rather die in my home village."&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening chapter of the 14th-century novel ''[[Water Margin]]'' involves Marshal Hong releasing 108 spirits imprisoned under an ancient stele-bearing tortoise.

A ''bixi'' plays a key role in a ghost story, "The Spirit of the Stone Tortoise" (贔屭精, ''Bixi jing''), 
from [[Yuan Mei]]'s (1716–1797) collection ''[[Zi Bu Yu|What the Master does not Speak of]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Thome, [https://scholar.google.com/ STRANGE OVERTONES: THE EXPRESSIONS OF RESENTMENT AND COMPASSION IN YUAN MEI’S WHAT THE MASTER DOES NOT SPEAK OF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903014320/https://scholar.google.com/ |date=September 3, 2009 }}. M.A. thesis, Arizona State University, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French poet and researcher [[Victor Segalen]] (1878–1919), who published both a scholarly book about China's stelae&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book of poetry-in-prose about them,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was also impressed by the "truly emblematic" stone tortoises, their "firm gestures and [[elegy|elegiac]] posture".&lt;ref name=segalen&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2007|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the image of the ''bixi'' continues to inspire modern Chinese artists.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Zhijie, [https://archive.is/20130131212441/http://www.qiuzhijie.com/image/Performance/nanjing/shiban/%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5%E4%B9%8B%E5%9F%8E.JPG "City of failure"] - the print is based on the Sifangcheng pavilion in the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation concerns==
As with other stone (particularly, marble and limestone) statuary, ''bixi'' turtles and their stelae are vulnerable to [[acid rain]] (or, in winter, acid snow). On the Harvard University campus, the curators of [[Harvard Bixi|its turtle]] protect it against the "acid snow" by wrapping it with a waterproof cover for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]" , Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A more ''bixi''-specific concern is the wear to the creatures' noses from the people who touch them for good luck. At Hanoi's [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], highly popular with visitors, this has become a sufficient concern to the site's managers as to make them develop plans for introducing creative landscaping and structural obstacles to keep visitors from touching the temple's 82 stone turtles.&lt;ref name=lishuai&gt;The custom of rubbing ''bixi'' for good luck (or, rather, protection from bag luck) is attested elsewhere e.g. in: 
李帅 (Li Shuai), 毛朝青 (Mao Chaoqing), [http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150114/42931143_0.shtml 赑屃不是龟. 专职驮石碑] (Bixi is not a turtle.

&lt;!-- first para - Science and optics--&gt;
'''Blue''' is one of the three [[primary color|primary colours]] of pigments in painting and traditional [[colour theory]], as well as in the [[RGB color model|RGB colour model]]. It lies between [[Violet (color)|violet]] and [[green]] on the [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of [[visible light]]. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a [[dominant wavelength]] between approximately 450 and 495 [[nanometre]]s.  Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; [[Azure (color)|azure]] contains some green, while [[ultramarine]] contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as [[Rayleigh scattering#Cause of the blue color of the sky|Rayleigh scattering]].  An optical effect called [[Tyndall scattering]] explains [[blue eyes]]. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called [[atmospheric perspective]].

&lt;!-- second para - history --&gt;
Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone [[lapis lazuli]] was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in [[the Renaissance]], to make the pigment [[ultramarine]], the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used [[cobalt blue]] to colour fine [[blue and white porcelain]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], European artists used it in the windows of [[Cathedrals]].  Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye [[woad]] until it was replaced by the finer [[indigo]] from America.  In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced mineral pigments and synthetic dyes.  Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits.  Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- third para - symbolism and associations--&gt;Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sometimes with sadness.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}} In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=22}} The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}}

==Shades and variations==
{{Main article|Shades of blue}}
[[File:Linear visible spectrum.svg|center|400px|Blue is between violet and green in the spectrum of visible light]]
Blue is the colour of light between violet and green on the [[visible spectrum]]. Hues of blue include indigo and [[ultramarine]], closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; [[Cyan]], which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[teal]], and [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]].

Blue also varies in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white.  Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, [[cobalt blue]], [[navy blue]], and [[Prussian blue]]; while lighter tints include [[sky blue]], [[azure (color)|azure]], and [[Egyptian blue]]. (For a more complete list see the [[List of colors|List of colours]]).

Blue pigments were originally made from minerals such as [[lapis lazuli]], [[cobalt]] and [[azurite]], and blue dyes were made from plants; usually [[woad]] in Europe, and ''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]'', or true indigo, in Asia and Africa. Today most blue pigments and dyes are made by a chemical process.

==Etymology and linguistic differences==
The [[modern English]] word ''blue'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''bleu'' or ''blewe'', from the [[Old French]] ''bleu'', a word of [[Germanic language|Germanic]] origin, related to the [[Old High German]] word ''blao''.&lt;ref name="Webster 1970"&gt;''Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary'', (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; In heraldry, the word [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] is used for blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|date=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=978-0-906670-44-6|pages=40, 343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russian and some other languages, there is no single word for blue, but rather different words for light blue (голубой, goluboy) and dark blue (синий, siniy). See [[Color term|Colour term]].

Several languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Korean Language|Korean]], and [[Lakota Sioux]], use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in Vietnamese the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is ''xanh''. In Japanese, the word for blue (青 ao) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning "go". (For more on this subject, see [[Distinguishing blue from green in language]])

Linguistic research indicates that languages do not begin by having a word for the colour blue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/211213-sky-isnt-blue|title=Why Isn't the Sky Blue?|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Radiolab]] at WNYC Studios|access-date=2018-04-27|others=with [[Guy Deutscher (linguist)|Guy Deutscher]]|location=New York|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colour names often developed individually in natural languages, typically beginning with [[black]] and [[white]] (or dark and light), and then adding [[red]], and only much later – usually as the last main category of color accepted in a language – adding the colour blue, probably when blue pigments could be manufactured reliably in the culture using that language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Human eyes perceive blue when observing light which has a [[dominant wavelength]] of roughly 450–495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.

Isaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description the [[visible spectrum]],  He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale, which he believed was related to the optical spectrum.  He included [[indigo]], the hue between blue and violet, as one of the separate colours, though today it is usually considered a hue of blue.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Hardy and Fred H. Perrin. ''The Principles of Optics.'' McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York. 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

In painting and traditional [[colour theory]], blue is one of the three [[primary color|primary colours]] of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide [[gamut]] of colours.  Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.  Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark grey. From the Renaissance onwards, painters used this system to create their colours. (See [[RYB]] colour system.)

The RYB model was used for [[colour printing]] by [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]] as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of magenta, cyan, yellow and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.

In the 19th century the Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] found a new way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called [[additive colour]] or the [[RGB colour model]], is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As the screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete picture on the screen.

&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=" 200px" &gt;
File:RGB illumination.jpg|Additive colour mixing. The projection of [[primary colour]] lights on a screen shows secondary colours where two overlap; the combination red, green, and blue each in full intensity makes white.
File:RGB pixels.jpg|Blue and orange pixels on an LCD television screen. Closeup of the red, green and blue sub-pixels on left.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

On the [[HSL and HSV|HSV colour wheel]], the [[Complementary color|complement]] of blue is [[yellow]]; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of [[red]] and [[green]] light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory ([[RYB color model|RYB]]) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be [[orange (colour)|orange]] (based on the [[Munsell color system|Munsell colour wheel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html |title=Glossary Term: Color wheel |website=Sanford-artedventures.com |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907184837/http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pigments and dyes===
Blue [[pigments]] were made from minerals, especially [[lapis lazuli]] and [[azurite]] ({{chem|Cu|3|(CO|3|)|2|(OH)|2|)}}.  These minerals were crushed, ground into powder, and then mixed with a quick-drying binding agent, such as egg yolk ([[tempera painting]]); or with a slow-drying oil, such as [[linseed oil]], for [[oil painting]]. To make blue [[stained glass]], [[cobalt blue]] (cobalt(II) aluminate: {{chem|CoAl|2|O|4}})pigment was mixed with the glass. Other common blue pigments made from minerals are [[ultramarine]] ({{chem|Na&lt;sub&gt;8-10&lt;/sub&gt;||Al|6|Si|6|O|24|S&lt;sub&gt;2-4&lt;/sub&gt;}}), [[cerulean blue]] (primarily cobalt (II) stanate: {{chem|Co|2|SnO|4}}), and [[Prussian blue]] (milori blue: primarily {{chem|Fe|7|(CN)|18}}).

[[Natural dyes]] to colour cloth and tapestries were made from plants. [[Woad]] and [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] were used to produce [[indigo dye]] used to colour fabrics blue or [[indigo]]. Since the 18th century, natural blue dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic dyes.

{{anchor|Reflex Blue}}	
"Reflex blue" used to be the name of a common blue pigment in ink manufacturing. 	
In the 1960s, the name was adopted into the proprietary [[Pantone Matching System]] (PMS) to refer to this specific pigment. Pantone "Reflex Blue" has the particularity of being identified only by this name, and not by a number code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pantone.com/help/?t=Origin-of-%27reflex-blue%27-name  Origin of 'reflex blue' name (pantone.com)] [https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/Reflex-Blue-C Pantone Reflex Blue C (pantone.com) [https://www.mitostudios.com/what-is-the-pms-number-of-reflex-blue/ What is the PMS Number of “Reflex Blue”?

===Why the sky and sea appear blue===
Of the colours in the visible spectrum of light, blue has a very short wavelength, while red has the longest wavelength. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. This effect is called [[Rayleigh scattering]], after [[Lord Rayleigh]], the British physicist who discovered it. It was confirmed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html|title=Why is the sky Blue?|website=ucr.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102085211/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html|archivedate=2015-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near sunrise and sunset, most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red. Therefore, when looking at the sunset and sunrise, the colour red is more perceptible than any of the other colours.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.patarnott.com/atms749/pdf/blueSkyHumanResponse.pdf Human color vision and the unsaturated blue color of the daytime sky] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715050855/http://www.patarnott.com/atms749/pdf/blueSkyHumanResponse.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}", Glenn S. Smith, ''American Journal of Physics'', Volume 73, Issue 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;590–597 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason: the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue, which comes to the eye of the viewer. The colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky, reflected by particles in the water; and by [[algae]] and plant life in the water, which can make it look green; or by sediment, which can make it look brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/waterchemistry/f/why-is-the-ocean-blue.htm|title=Why Is the Ocean Blue?|author=Anne Marie Helmenstine|website=About.com Education|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118203351/http://chemistry.about.com/od/waterchemistry/f/why-is-the-ocean-blue.htm|archivedate=2012-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric perspective===
The farther away an object is, the more blue it often appears to the eye. For example, mountains in the distance often appear blue. This is the effect of [[atmospheric perspective]]; the farther an object is away from the viewer, the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour, which is usually blue. In a painting where different parts of the composition are blue, green and red, the blue will appear to be more distant, and the red closer to the viewer.  The cooler a colour is, the more distant it seems.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la coulour'' (2009), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
[[Blue giant]]s are hot and luminous [[star]]s with surface temperatures exceeding 10,000&amp;nbsp;K. The largest [[blue supergiant star]]s are extremely massive and energetic, and are usually unstable. They are generally short-lived, either exploding in a [[supernova]] or periodically shedding their outer layers to become [[red giant]]s.

===Blue eyes===
[[File:Blue eye Stephen.png|thumb|Blue eyes actually contain no blue pigment. The colour is caused by an effect called [[Rayleigh scattering]], which also makes the sky appear blue.]]
Blue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment.

==History==

===In the ancient world===
[[File:Ebih-Il Louvre AO17551 n11.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the blue, lapis lazuli inlays used for the irises in the ''[[Statue of Ebih-Il]]'', dating to the twenty-fifth century BC, discovered in the temple of [[Inanna|Ishtar]] at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]]]

Blue was a latecomer among colours used in art and decoration, as well as language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, M., &amp; Cruse, M. I. (2001). Blue: The history of a color p. 64. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in [[cave paintings]] from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments.&lt;ref&gt;See Michel Pastoureau, ''Blue: Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – [[woad]] in Europe, [[indigo]] in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either [[lapis lazuli]] or [[azurite]].

Lapis lazuli, a semi-precious stone, has been mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand years, and was exported to all parts of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moorey|first=Peter Roger|title=Ancient mesopotamian materials and industries: the archaeological evidence|year=1999|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-042-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Lapis+lazuli+++mines+in+the+Badakhshan#v=onepage&amp;q=Lapis%20lazuli%20%20%20mines%20in%20the%20Badakhshan&amp;f=false|pages=86–87|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003232804/https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Ixuott4doC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Lapis+lazuli+++mines+in+the+Badakhshan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sW6_TvWKBIKr8AOTn623BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lapis%20lazuli%20%20%20mines%20in%20the%20Badakhshan&amp;f=false|archivedate=2015-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran and Mesopotamia, it was used to make jewellery and vessels. In Egypt, it was used for the eyebrows on the funeral mask of [[King Tutankhamun]] (1341–1323 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Bongioanni &amp; Maria Croce (ed.), ''The Treasures of Ancient Egypt: From the Egyptian Museum in Cairo'', Universe Publishing, a division of Ruzzoli Publications Inc., 2003. p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Importing lapis lazuli by caravan across the desert from Afghanistan to Egypt was very expensive. Beginning in about 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians began to produce their own blue pigment known as [[Egyptian blue]] by grinding [[silica]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[copper]], and [[alkalai]], and heating it to {{convert|800|or| 900|C}}. This is considered the first synthetic pigment.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase, W.T. 1971, "Egyptian blue as a pigment and ceramic material." In: R. Brill (ed.) ''Science and Archaeology''. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-02061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian blue was used to paint wood, papyrus and canvas, and was used to colour a glaze to make [[faience]] beads, inlays, and pots. It was particularly used in funeral statuary and figurines and in tomb paintings. Blue was considered a beneficial colour which would protect the dead against evil in the afterlife. Blue dye was also used to colour the cloth in which mummies were wrapped.&lt;ref&gt;J. Baines, "Color Terminology and Color Classification in Ancient Egyptian Color Terminology and Polychromy", in ''The American Anthropologist'', volume LXXXVII, 1985, pp.&amp;nbsp;282–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt blue was associated with the sky and with divinity. The Egyptian god [[Amun]] could make his skin blue so that he could fly, invisible, across the sky. Blue could also protect against evil; many people around the Mediterranean still wear a blue amulet, representing the eye of God, to protect them from misfortune.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Blue glass was manufactured in [[Mesopotamia]] and Egypt as early as 2500 BC, using the same copper ingredients as Egyptian blue pigment. They also added cobalt, which produced a deeper blue, the same blue produced in the Middle Ages in the stained glass windows of the cathedrals of Saint-Denis and Chartres.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ishtar Gate]] of ancient [[Babylon]] (604–562 BC) was decorated with deep blue glazed bricks used as a background for pictures of lions, dragons and [[aurochs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=F.R.|last=Matson|title=Compositional Studies of the Glazed Brick from the Ishtar Gate at Babylon|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts. The Research Laboratory|year=1985|isbn=978-0-87846-255-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks classified colours by whether they were light or dark, rather than by their hue. The Greek word for dark blue, ''kyaneos'', could also mean dark green, violet, black or brown. The ancient Greek word for a light blue, ''glaukos'', also could mean light green, grey, or yellow.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastourou, ''Bleu: Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks imported indigo dye from India, calling it indikon. They used Egyptian blue in the wall paintings of [[Knossos]], in Crete, (2100 BC). It was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by [[Pliny the Elder]] (red, yellow, black, and white), but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on Greek temples and to colour the beards of Greek statues.&lt;ref name="Ball106"&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans also imported indigo dye, but blue was the colour of working class clothing; the nobles and rich wore white, black, red or violet. Blue was considered the colour of mourning, and the colour of barbarians. Julius Caesar reported that the Celts and Germans dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies, and tinted their hair blue when they grew old.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''The Gallic Wars'', V., 14, 2. Cited by Miche Pastourou, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Romans made extensive use of blue for decoration. According to [[Vitruvius]], they made dark blue pigment from indigo, and imported Egyptian blue pigment. The walls of Roman villas in [[Pompeii]] had frescoes of brilliant blue skies, and blue pigments were found in the shops of colour merchants.&lt;ref name="Ball106"/&gt; The Romans had many different words for varieties of blue, including ''caeruleus'', ''caesius'', ''glaucus'', ''cyaneus'', ''lividus'', ''venetus'', ''aerius'', and ''ferreus'', but two words, both of foreign origin, became the most enduring; ''blavus'', from the Germanic word ''blau'', which eventually became ''bleu'' or blue; and ''azureus'', from the Arabic word ''lazaward'', which became azure.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu: Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Byzantine Empire and the Islamic World===
Dark blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire. In Byzantine art Christ and the Virgin Mary usually wore dark blue or purple. Blue was used as a background colour representing the sky in the magnificent mosaics which decorated Byzantine churches.&lt;ref&gt;L. Brehier, ''Les mosaiques a fond d'azur'', in ''Etudes byzantines'', volume III, Paris, 1945. pp. 46ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic world, blue was of secondary importance to green, believed to be the favourite colour of the [[Prophet Mohammed]].  At certain times in [[Moorish Spain]] and other parts of the Islamic world, blue was the colour worn by Christians and Jews, because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, Couleurs – Pigments et teintures dans les mains des peoples, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Dark blue and turquoise decorative tiles were widely used to decorate the facades and interiors of mosques and palaces from Spain to Central Asia.  Lapis lazuli pigment was also used to create the rich blues in [[Persian miniatures]].

===During the Middle Ages===
In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages, blue played a minor role. The nobility wore red or purple, while only the poor wore blue clothing, coloured with poor-quality dyes made from the [[woad]] plant. Blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches. This changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the [[Abbe Suger]] rebuilt the [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. He installed [[stained glass]] windows coloured with [[cobalt]], which, combined with the light from the red glass, filled the church with a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known as the "bleu de Saint-Denis". In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches, including at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the 12th century was the veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]], and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing. In earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black, grey, violet, dark green or dark blue. In the 12th century the Roma Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from Asia; [[ultramarine]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Blue became associated with holiness, humility and virtue.

Ultramarine was made from lapis lazuli, from the mines of [[Badakshan]], in the mountains of Afghanistan, near the source of the [[Oxus]] River. The mines were visited by Marco Polo in about 1271; he reported, "here is found a high mountain from which they extract the finest and most beautiful of blues." Ground lapis was used in Byzantine manuscripts as early as the 6th century, but it was impure and varied greatly in colour. Ultramarine refined out the impurities through a long and difficult process, creating a rich and deep blue. It was called ''bleu outremer'' in French and ''blu oltremare'' in Italian, since it came from the other side of the sea. It cost far more than any other colour, and it became the luxury colour for the Kings and Princes of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour''. p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Louis IX of France]], better known as Saint Louis (1214–1270), became the first king of France to regularly dress in blue. This was copied by other nobles.  Paintings of the mythical [[King Arthur]] began to show him dressed in blue.  The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield, sprinkled with golden [[fleur-de-lis]] or lilies. Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Blue – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once blue became the colour of the king, it also became the colour of the wealthy and powerful in Europe. In the Middle Ages in France and to some extent in Italy, the dyeing of blue cloth was subject to license from the crown or state. In Italy, the dyeing of blue was assigned to a specific guild, the ''tintori di guado,'' and could not be done by anyone else without severe penalty. The wearing of blue implied some dignity and some wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel V. Thompson, ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'' (1956), Dover Publications, New York, ({{ISBN|0-486-20327-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ultramarine, several other blues were widely used in the Middle Ages and later in the Renaissance. [[Azurite]], a form of copper carbonate, was often used as a substitute for ultramarine. The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius, or Armenian stone. The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made a pale blue with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite background colour of the German painter [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour''. pp.&amp;nbsp;139–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Another blue often used in the Middle Ages was called tournesol or folium. It was made from the plant [[Crozophora tinctoria]], which grew in the south of France. It made a fine transparent blue valued in medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour. pp.&amp;nbsp;141–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common blue pigment was [[smalt]], which was made by grinding blue cobalt glass into a fine powder. It made a deep violet blue similar to ultramarine, and was vivid in frescoes, but it lost some of its brilliance in oil paintings. It became especially popular in the 17th century, when ultramarine was difficult to obtain. It was employed at times by [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[El Greco]], [[Van Dyck]], [[Rubens]] and [[Rembrandt]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the European Renaissance===
In the Renaissance, a revolution occurred in painting; artists began to paint the world as it was actually seen, with perspective, depth, shadows, and light from a single source. Artists had to adapt their use of blue to the new rules.  In medieval paintings, blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary, and identify her. In Renaissance paintings, artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red, lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights. [[Raphael]] was a master of this technique, carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance, and patrons sometimes specified that it be used in paintings they commissioned. The contract for the ''Madone des Harpies'' by [[Andrea del Sarto]] (1514) required that the robe of the Virgin Mary be coloured with ultramarine costing "at least five good florins an ounce."&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; Good ultramarine was more expensive than gold; in 1508 the German painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] reported in a letter that he had paid twelve ducats – the equivalent of forty-one grams of gold – for just thirty grams of ultramarine.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often painters or clients saved money by using less expensive blues, such as azurite smalt, or pigments made with indigo, but this sometimes caused problems. Pigments made from azurite were less expensive, but tended to turn dark and green with time. An example is the robe of the Virgin Mary in The ''[[Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints (Raphael)|Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints]]'' by [[Raphael]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in New York. The Virgin Mary's azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001822|title=Raphael (Raffaello Sanzio or Santi) – Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=metmuseum.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704115007/http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001822|archivedate=2012-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of oil painting changed the way colours looked and how they were used.  Ultramarine pigment, for instance, was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in [[tempera]] painting, in frescoes.  To balance their colours, Renaissance artists like Raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine.  The sombre dark blue robe of the Virgin Mary became a brilliant sky blue.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titian]] created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through, which made a complex and luminous colour, like stained glass. He also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine, which gave subtle variations to the blue.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', pp.&amp;nbsp;186–89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue and white porcelain===
In about the 9th century, Chinese artisans abandoned the [[Han blue]] colour they had used for centuries, and began to use [[cobalt blue]], made with [[cobalt]] salts of [[alumina]], to manufacture fine [[blue and white porcelain]], The plates and vases were shaped, dried, the paint applied with a brush, covered with a clear glaze, then fired at a high temperature. Beginning in the 14th century, this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to Europe where it inspired a whole style of art, called [[Chinoiserie]].  European courts tried for many years to imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain, but only succeeded in the 18th century after a missionary brought the secret back from China.

Other famous white and blue patterns appeared in Delft, Meissen, Staffordshire, and Saint Petersburg, Russia.

===War of the blues – indigo versus woad===
[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Vermeer]] used natural ultramarine in his paintings, as in his ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''. The expense was probably borne by his wealthy patron [[Pieter van Ruijven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Girl with a Pearl Earring |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/girl_with_a_pearl_earring.html |publisher=essentialvermeer.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630060601/http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/girl_with_a_pearl_earring.html |archivedate=2015-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While blue was an expensive and prestigious colour in European painting, it became a common colour for clothing during the Renaissance. The rise of the colour blue in fashion in the 12th and 13th centuries led to a blue dye industry in several cities, notably [[Amiens]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Erfurt]]. They made a dye called pastel from [[woad]], a plant common in Europe, which had been used to make blue dye by the Celts and German tribes.  Blue became a colour worn by domestics and artisans, not just nobles. In 1570, when Pope [[Pius V]] listed the colours that could be used for ecclesiastical dress and for altar decoration, he excluded blue, because he considered it too common.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur effets et symboliques'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of making blue with woad was long and noxious – it involved soaking the leaves of the plant for from three days to a week in human urine, ideally urine from men who had been drinking a great deal of alcohol, which was said to improve the colour. The fabric was then soaked for a day in the resulting mixture, then put out in the sun, where as it dried it turned blue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The pastel industry was threatened in the 15th century by the arrival from India of the same dye ([[indigo]]), obtained from a shrub widely grown in Asia. The Asian indigo dye precursors is more readily obtained. In 1498, [[Vasco de Gama]] opened a trade route to import indigo from India to Europe.  In India, the indigo leaves were soaked in water, fermented, pressed into cakes, dried into bricks, then carried to the ports London, Marseille, Genoa, and Bruges. Later, in the 17th century, the British, Spanish, and Dutch established indigo plantations in Jamaica, South Carolina, the Virgin Islands and South America, and began to import American indigo to Europe.

The countries with large and prosperous pastel industries tried to block the use of indigo. The German government outlawed the use of indigo in 1577, describing it as a "pernicious, deceitful and corrosive substance, the Devil's dye."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13242/13242-8.txt ''Lippincott's Magazine of Popular Literature and Science'', Volume 17, No. 100, April 1876] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106154802/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13242/13242-8.txt |date=2012-11-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D G Schreber, ''Historische, physische und economische Beschreibung des Waidtes'', 1752, the appendix; Thorpe JF and Ingold CK, 1923, ''Synthetic colouring matters – vat colours'' (London: Longmans, Green), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], in an edict of 1609, forbade under pain of death the use of "the false and pernicious Indian drug".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucaud |first=Édouard |editor-last=Frost |editor-first=John |title=The book of illustrious mechanics of Europe and America |year=1846 |page=236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaQbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA236 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629124556/https://books.google.com/books?id=TaQbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA236 |archivedate=2016-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was forbidden in England until 1611, when British traders established their own indigo industry in India and began to import it into Europe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'' p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts to block indigo were in vain; the quality of indigo blue was too high and the price too low for pastel made from woad to compete. In 1737 both the French and German governments finally allowed the use of indigo. This ruined the dye industries in Toulouse and the other cities that produced pastel, but created a thriving new indigo commerce to seaports such as Bordeaux, Nantes and Marseille.&lt;ref&gt;F. Lauterbach, ''Der Kampf des Waides mit dem Indigo'', Leipzig, p. 25. Cited by Michel Pastoureau, Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur, pp.&amp;nbsp;108–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another war of the blues took place at the end of the 19th century, between indigo and synthetic indigo, discovered in 1868 by the German chemist Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer. The German chemical firm BASF put the new dye on the market in 1897, in direct competition with the British-run indigo industry in India, which produced most of the world's indigo. In 1897 Britain sold ten thousand tons of natural indigo on the world market, while BASF sold six hundred tons of synthetic indigo. The British industry cut prices and reduced the salaries of its workers, but it was unable to compete; the synthetic indigo was more pure, made a more lasting blue, and was not dependent upon good or bad harvests. In 1911, India sold only 660 tons of natural indigo, while BASF sold 22,000 tons of synthetic indigo.  In 2002, more than 38,000 tons of synthetic indigo was produced, often for the production of blue jeans.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Elmar Steingruber "Indigo and Indigo Colorants" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue uniform===
[[File:5.29.10NYPDByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|New York City police officers on Times Square (2010).]]
In the 17th century, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], was one of the first rulers to give his army blue uniforms. The reasons were economic; the German states were trying to protect their pastel dye industry against competition from imported indigo dye. When Brandenburg became the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] in 1701, the uniform colour was adopted by the Prussian army. Most German soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the [[First World War]], with the exception of the Bavarians, who wore light blue.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks in part to the availability of indigo dye, the 18th century saw the widespread use of blue military uniforms. Prior to 1748, British naval officers simply wore upper-class civilian clothing and wigs. In 1748, the British uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue, now known as [[navy blue]].&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Hill, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy'', Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Continental Navy]] of the United States was created in 1775, it largely copied the British uniform and colour.

In the late 18th century, the blue uniform became a symbol of liberty and revolution. In October 1774, even before the United States declared its independence, [[George Mason]] and one hundred Virginia neighbours of [[George Washington]] organised a voluntary militia unit (the Fairfax County Independent Company of Volunteers) and elected Washington the honorary commander.  For their uniforms they chose blue and [[Buff (colour)|buff]], the colours of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], the opposition party in England, whose policies were supported by George Washington and many other [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] in the American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blueandbuff.blogspot.com/2009/10/buff-and-blue-whig-politics-in-late.html|title=Blue and Buff: Buff and Blue: Whig politics in the late 18th century|author=Blue and Buff|website=blueandbuff.blogspot.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416121410/http://blueandbuff.blogspot.com/2009/10/buff-and-blue-whig-politics-in-late.html|archivedate=2014-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Chernow]], ''[[Washington: A Life]]'', p. 174. {{ISBN|978-0-14-311996-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Continental Army]] was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the [[American Revolution]], the first [[Continental Congress]] declared that the official uniform colour would be brown, but this was not popular with many militias, whose officers were already wearing blue. In 1778 the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform, and in 1779 Washington made the official colour of all uniforms blue and [[buff (colour)|buff]]. Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until 1902, and is still the colour of the dress uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html|title=Army Dress Uniform|website=army.mil|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119095538/http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html|archivedate=2014-11-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the [[Gardes Françaises]], the elite regiment which protected [[Louis XVI]], wore dark blue uniforms with red trim. In 1789, the soldiers gradually changed their allegiance from the king to the people, and they played a leading role in the [[storming of the Bastille]]. After the fall of Bastille, a new armed force, the [[Garde Nationale]], was formed under the command of the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who had served with George Washington in America. Lafayette gave the Garde Nationale dark blue uniforms similar to those of the Continental Army. Blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies, opposed to the white uniforms of the Royalists and the Austrians.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Tulard, Jean-François Fayard, Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de la Révolution française'', 1789–1799, Éditions Robert Laffont, collection Bouquins, Paris, 1987. {{ISBN|2-7028-2076-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] abandoned many of the doctrines of the French Revolution but he kept blue as the uniform colour for his army, although he had great difficulty obtaining the blue dye, since the British controlled the seas and blocked the importation of indigo to France. Napoleon was forced to dye uniforms with woad, which had an inferior blue colour.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;137–40&lt;/ref&gt; The French army wore a dark blue uniform coat with red trousers until 1915, when it was found to be a too visible target on the battlefields of [[World War I]].  It was replaced with uniforms of a light blue-grey colour called horizon blue.

Blue was the colour of liberty and revolution in the 18th century, but in the 19th it increasingly became the colour of government authority, the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants. It was considered serious and authoritative, without being menacing. In 1829, when [[Robert Peel]] created the first [[London Metropolitan Police]], he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark, almost black blue, to make the policemen look different from soldiers, who until then had patrolled the streets. The traditional blue jacket with silver buttons of the London "bobbie" was not abandoned until the mid-1990s, when it was replaced by a light blue shirt and a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as NATO blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm|title=History|author=Metropolitan Police|website=met.police.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081203173318/http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm|archivedate=2008-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City Police Department]], modelled after the London Metropolitan Police, was created in 1844, and in 1853, they were officially given a navy blue uniform, the colour they wear today.&lt;ref name="okidegbe"&gt;{{Citation |last=Okidegbe |first=Ngozi |chapter=I Love a Man in Uniform: The Debate Surrounding Uniforming the New York Police Force in the 19th Century |editor-last=Wiggerich |editor-first=Sandro |editor2-last=Kensy |editor2-first=Steven |title=Staat Macht Uniform |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag |publication-date=2011 |isbn=978-3-515-09933-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search for the perfect blue===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, chemists in Europe tried to discover a way to create synthetic blue pigments, avoiding the expense of importing and grinding lapis lazuli, azurite and other minerals. The Egyptians had created a synthetic colour, Egyptian blue, three thousand years BC, but the formula had been lost. The Chinese had also created synthetic pigments, but the formula was not known in the west.

In 1709 a German druggist and pigment maker named [[Johann Jacob Diesbach]] accidentally discovered a new blue while experimenting with potassium and iron sulphides. The new colour was first called Berlin blue, but later became known as [[Prussian blue]]. By 1710 it was being used by the French painter [[Antoine Watteau]], and later his successor [[Nicolas Lancret]]. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – HIstoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;114–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1820s, Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of [[Nagasaki]]. It was called ''bero-ai'', or Berlin blue, and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment, ''ai-gami'', made from the [[dayflower]]. Prussian blue was used by both [[Hokusai]], in his famous wave paintings, and [[Hiroshige]].&lt;ref&gt;oger Keyes, ''Japanese Woodblock Prints: A Catalogue of the Mary A. Ainsworth Collection'', R, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College, 1984, p. 42, plate #140, p. 91 and catalogue entry #439, p. 185.  for more on the story of Prussian blue in Japanese prints, see also the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824 the [[Societé pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie]] in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial [[ultramarine]] which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, [[Christian Gmelin]] then a professor of chemistry in Tübingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine, which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul (1930).  ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: McGraw Hill p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878 a German chemist named a. Von Baeyer discovered a synthetic substitute for [[indigotine]], the active ingredient of indigo. This product gradually replaced natural indigo, and after the end of the First World War, it brought an end to the trade of indigo from the East and West Indies.

In 1901 a new synthetic blue dye, called [[Indanthrone blue]], was invented, which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun. This dye gradually replaced artificial indigo, whose production ceased in about 1970.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Impressionist painters===
The invention of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters. [[J.M.W. Turner]] experimented with the new cobalt blue, and of the twenty colours most used by the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], twelve were new and synthetic colours, including cobalt blue, ultramarine and cerulean blue.&lt;ref name="Ball265"&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important influence on painting in the 19th century was the theory of complementary colours, developed by the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839. He demonstrated that placing complementary colours, such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow, next to each other heightened the intensity of each colour "to the apogee of their tonality."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Eugene Chevreul, ''De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs'', Paris,  (1839).  Cited by Philip Ball, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1879 an American physicist, Ogden Rood, published a book charting the complementary colours of each colour in the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden Rood, Modern Chromatics, (1879).&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of painting was used by Claude Monet in his ''Impression – Sunrise – Fog'' (1872), where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun, (1872) and in ''Régate à Argenteuil'' (1872), where he painted an orange sun against blue water. The colours brighten each other. Renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in ''Canotage sur la Seine'' (1879–1880). Both Monet and Renoir liked to use pure colours, without any blending.&lt;ref name="Ball265"/&gt;

Monet and the impressionists were among the first to observe that shadows were full of colour. In his ''La Gare Saint-Lazare'', the grey smoke, vapour and dark shadows are actually composed of mixtures of bright pigment, including cobalt blue, cerulean blue, synthetic ultramarine, emerald green, Guillet green, chrome yellow, vermilion and ecarlate red.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Blue was a favourite colour of the impressionist painters, who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods, feelings and atmospheres. [[Cobalt blue]], a pigment of cobalt oxide-aluminium oxide, was a favourite of [[Auguste Renoir]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It was similar to [[smalt]], a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass, but it was much improved by the French chemist [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], who introduced it in 1802.  It was very stable but extremely expensive. Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo, "'Cobalt [blue] is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cobalt blue |url=http://webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/coblue.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620100134/http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/coblue.html |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Gogh described to his brother Theo how he composed a sky: "The dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt, and others of a lighter blue, like the bluish white of the Milky Way&amp;nbsp;... the sea was very dark ultramarine, the shore a sort of violet and of light red as I see it, and on the dunes, a few bushes of prussian blue."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his brother Theo, (1888). Cited by Philip Ball, from ''Letters of Vincent van Gogh'', edited by M. Roskill, Flamingo, London, 2000. p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue suit===
Blue had first become the high fashion colour of the wealthy and powerful in Europe in the 13th century, when it was worn by [[Louis IX of France]], better known as Saint Louis (1214-1270).  Wearing blue implied dignity and wealth, and blue clothing was restricted to the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel V. Thompson (1956), ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'', Dover Publications, New York ({{ISBN|0-486-20327-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; However, blue was replaced by black as the power colour in the 14th century, when European princes, and then merchants and bankers, wanted to show their seriousness, dignity and devoutness (see [[Black]]).

Blue gradually returned to court fashion in the 17th century, as part of a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue business suit has its roots in England in the middle of the 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the [[London fire]] of 1666, King [[Charles II of England]] ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, waistcoats and breeches, and the palette of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.&lt;ref name="SuitablyDressed"&gt;"Suitably Dressed," the ''Economist'', December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the American Revolution, the leader of the Whig Party in England, [[Charles James Fox]], wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat and breeches, the colours of the Whig Party and of the uniform of [[George Washington]], whose principles he supported. The men's suit followed the basic form of the military uniforms of the time, particularly the uniforms of the cavalry.&lt;ref name="SuitablyDressed"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, during the [[British Regency|Regency]] of the future King [[George IV]], the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George [[Beau Brummel]]. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form.  The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight trousers to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on the form of the body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, "If people turn to look at you in the street, you are not well dressed."&lt;ref&gt;*Kelly, Ian. ''Beau Brummell: The Ultimate Dandy''. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes.  Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.&lt;ref name="SuitablyDressed"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===In the 20th and 21st century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, many artists recognised the emotional power of blue, and made it the central element of paintings. During his [[Blue Period]] (1901–1904) [[Pablo Picasso]] used blue and green, with hardly any warm colours, to create a melancholy mood. In Russia, the [[symbolist]] painter [[Pavel Kuznetsov]] and the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] art group (1906–1908) used blue to create a fantastic and exotic atmosphere. In Germany, [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and other Russian émigrés formed the art group called [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), and used blue to symbolise spirituality and eternity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Wassily Kandinsky, M. T. Sadler (Translator) ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Dover Publ. (Paperback). 80 pp.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-486-23411-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Matisse]] used intense blues to express the emotions he wanted viewers to feel. Matisse wrote, "A certain blue penetrates your soul."&lt;ref&gt;"Un certain bleu pénètre votre âme." Cited by C.A. Riley, ''Color Codes'', University Press of New England, Hanover, New Hampshire, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the art of the second half of the 20th century, painters of the [[abstract expressionist]] movement began to use blue and other colours in pure form, without any attempt to represent anything, to inspire ideas and emotions. Painter [[Mark Rothko]] observed that colour was "only an instrument;" his interest was "in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;''Mark Rothko 1903–1970''. Tate Gallery Publishing, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fashion blue, particularly dark blue, was seen as a colour which was serious but not grim. In the mid-20th century, blue passed black as the most common colour of men's business suits, the costume usually worn by political and business leaders. Public opinion polls in the United States and Europe showed that blue was the favourite colour of over fifty per cent of respondents. Green was far behind with twenty per cent, while white and red received about eight per cent each.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu – Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&amp;nbsp;149–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 a German immigrant in San Francisco, [[Levi Strauss]], invented a sturdy kind of work trousers, made of [[denim]] fabric and coloured with [[indigo]] dye, called [[jeans|blue jeans]]. In 1935, they were raised to the level of high fashion by [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue magazine]]. Beginning in the 1950s, they became an essential part of uniform of young people in the United States, Europe, and around the world.

Blue was also seen as a colour which was authoritative without being threatening. Following the [[Second World War]], blue was adopted as the colour of important international organisations, including the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]], [[UNESCO]], the European Union, and [[NATO]]. United Nations peacekeepers wear blue helmets to stress their peacekeeping role. Blue is used by the [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems]] to denote friendly forces, hence the term "blue on blue" for [[friendly fire]], and [[Blue Force Tracking]] for location of friendly units. The [[People's Liberation Army]] of China (formerly known as the "Red Army") uses the term "Blue Army" to refer to hostile forces during exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/army/organisation/blue-army.asp|title=Blue Army (OPFOR) Units|accessdate=2013-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814034817/http://www.sinodefence.com/army/organisation/blue-army.asp|archivedate=2013-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw the invention of new ways of creating blue, such as [[chemiluminescence]], making blue light through a chemical reaction.

In the 20th century, it also became possible to own your own colour of blue. The French artist [[Yves Klein]], with the help of a French paint dealer, created a specific blue called [[International Klein blue]], which he patented. It was made of ultramarine combined with a resin called Rhodopa, which gave it a particularly brilliant colour. The baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers developed its own blue, called [[Dodger blue]], and several American universities invented new blues for their colours.

With the dawn of the [[World Wide Web]], blue has become the standard colour for [[hyperlinks]] in [[Graphical user interface|graphic browsers]] (though in most browsers links turn purple if you visit their target), to make their presence within text obvious to readers.

* In the English language, blue often represents the human emotion of sadness, for example, "He was feeling blue".
* In German, to be "blue" (''blau sein'') is to be drunk. This derives from the ancient use of urine, particularly the urine of men who had been drinking alcohol in dyeing cloth blue with woad or indigo.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Eva.

* The word ''blue'' was used in England the 17th century as a disparaging reference to rigid moral codes and those who observed them, particularly in ''blue-stocking'', a reference to Oliver Cromwell's supporters in the parliament of 1653.
* In the middle of the 18th century, blue was the colour of [[Tory]] party, then the opposition party in England, Scotland and Ireland, which supported the British monarch and power of the landed aristocracy, while the ruling [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] had orange as their colour.  Flags of the two colours are seen over a polling station in the series of prints by [[William Hogarth]] called [[Humours of an election]],  made in 1754–55. Blue remains the colour of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party of the UK]] today.

[[Krishna]] and [[Rama|Ram]], Vishnu's avatars, are usually blue. [[Shiva]], the destroyer, is also depicted in light blue tones and is called ''neela kantha'', or blue-throated, for having swallowed poison in an attempt to turn the tide of a battle between the gods and demons in the gods' favour.  Blue is used to symbolically represent the fifth, throat, [[chakra]] ([[Vishuddha]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Samantha. ''The Seven Rays: a Universal Guide to the Archangels''.

'''Chris Tally Evans''' is a British disabled artist, actor, director and writer. He trained at the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]] as a performer and graduated from [[Trinity College, London]] with a teaching diploma.

==Career==

Evans' interest in theatre and music started as a teenager when he joined West Glamorgan Youth Theatre and West Glamorgan Youth Arts Company as an actor, dancer and musician. He was lead guitarist for the West Glamorgan Youth Arts Company production of Leonard Bernstein's "Mass" at Swansea's Brangwyn Hall and London's Wembley Arena and was a dancer in Vaughan Williams' "Job" at a performance attended by Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1981. In both these productions he shared the stage with [[Russell T Davies]], writer and producer of [[Doctor Who]]. By the age of 14 he was playing the guitar semi-professionally in pubs and clubs in the Swansea area, as well as for a number of theatre shows. For two years at this time he was lead guitarist in the backing band of a very young [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]. Later Evans played in a number of bands including the electric folk band Straight From the Wood who chalked up memorable appearances at Club Ifor Bach, Cardiff, Gwyl Pontardawe Festival and the Village Pump Folk Festival in Trowbridge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25051">'''Craftivism''' is a form of [[activism]], typically incorporating elements of [[anti-capitalism]], [[environmentalism]], solidarity, or [[third-wave feminism]], that is centered on practices of [[craft]] - or what can traditionally be referred to as "domestic arts". Craftivism includes, but is not limited to, various forms of needlework including yarn-bombing or cross-stitch. Craftivism is a social process of collective empowerment, action, expression and negotiation. In craftivism, engaging in the social, performative and critical discourse around the work is central to its production and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Ele. "Activist Tendencies in Craft". http://research.gold.ac.uk/3109/, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners are known as '''craftivists'''.

== Background ==
The term '''craftivism''' was coined in 2003 by writer Betsy Greer in order to join the separate spheres of craft and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greer|2008|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Craftivism, Arnolfini, Bristol |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/craftivism-arnolfini-bristol-1855855.html |first=Charles |last=Darwent |date=3 January 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Her favorite self-created definition of the term states, "craftivism is a way of looking at life where voicing opinions through creativity makes your voice stronger, your compassion deeper &amp; your quest for justice more infinite"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crafting a Green World. What is Craftivism? Division over the Definition Explodes Etsy Team |url=http://craftingagreenworld.com/2009/04/04/what-is-craftivism-division-over-the-definition-explodes-an-etsy-team/ |work=Crafting a Green World |first=Julie |last=Finn |date=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term craftivism is a recent addition to crafting lexicon, the use of craft as a subversive tactic can be found throughout history. First, the word craft is often associated with trickery. To call someone crafty is to identify them as clever and cunning &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, one would say to "spin" a plot. Similarly, the French word for trick is tricoter, which means to tie or knot together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', the character [[Madame Defarge]], a worker for the [[French Revolution]], secretly encodes the names of those soon to be executed in her knitting.

=== Feminism ===
Craftivism identifies strongly with feminist movements. Craftivism is often interpreted as having emerged from [[third-wave feminism]] but feminist activism and craft were unified beforehand.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bratich|first1=Jack|last2=Bush|first2=Heidi|title=Fabricating Activism: Craft Work, Popular Culture, Gender|journal=Project Muse|date=2011|volume=22|issue=2|url=https://www.academia.edu/1117424/Fabricating_Activism_Craft-Work_Popular_Culture_Gender|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices of craft or "domestic arts" have traditionally existed and been organized spatially within the private sphere. Therefore, the labor and production of craft was generally interpreted as unproductive female labor in the home, as it was never integrated into profit-making systems. Rather, it was [[marginalized]] and undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women's significant and creative work in the private sphere—clothing the family, knitting blankets, weaving the loom—did not receive the same respect as male-dominated activity in the public realm. Furthermore, the patriarchy has been successful in claiming these domestic values for women and using it as a way to keep women in subservient roles.&lt;ref name="Sabella"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sabella |first=Jennifer |date=May 12, 2008 |title= Craftivism: Is crafting the new activism? |work=The Columbia Chronicle |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of consumer-friendly crafts, including kits, transfers and readymade designs, has further diminished the status of craft and women's amateur practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Hackley, "Quiet Activism and the New Amateur," Design and Culture, 5:2 (2013): 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Women and craft have been excluded from the fine art world and as a result many women put their creativity towards craft practices. Craft was "a universal female art from transcending race, class, and national borders. Needlework is the one art in which women controlled the education of their daughters and the production of art, and were also the critics and audience."&lt;ref name="Packer 2010"/&gt; Although practices of craft were spatially organized within the private sphere, women occasionally would organize groups to engage in these practices collectively. In these craft circles or meet ups women would not only share patterns and skills but also engage in conversation about their lives in the private sphere. These groups of women would discuss their lives and personal struggles encountered as women. This type of group discussion is a form of activism rooted in [[Consciousness raising]] that was key to [[Second-wave feminism]]&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; as it helped to raise awareness about the types of oppression women were experiencing in their everyday lives.

The Anti Capitalist, Anti Sweatshop and DIY movements popularized practices of craft for activism. These movements influenced third-wave feminists to adopt a craftivism ethos. Most forms of craftivism identify strongly with [[third-wave feminism]]. Third-wave feminist crafters are attempting to subvert the association of craft with domesticity by embracing domestic arts while identifying as feminists who are making the choice to embrace this new domesticity. Third-wave feminists are reclaiming knitting, sewing, and other crafting activities traditionally feminized and associated with the private sphere. Through this reclamation, contemporary women aim to reconnect with the female-dominated art forms, to legitimatize the importance of undervalued craft, and to show that 21st century women have the privilege to express themselves through craft, with fewer constraints exercised by the patriarchy. This act of resistance and shattering of the public/private binary is expressed physically through public knitting and craft circles who take a private-sphere activity and insert themselves in the male-dominated spaces of the city&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"&gt;Robertson, Kirsty. 30 March 2006.

Queen's University.&lt;/ref&gt; One example would be the [[Anarchist Knitting Mob]] who held a "Massive Knit" event in Washington Square Park to honour the death of activist and urbanist [[Jane Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;http://massiveknit.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Knitters decorated the trees, benches, and light posts with colourful yarn and unique patterns.

Retrieved 28 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
Women’s craft has often been undervalued or ignored in the art world. Women’s craft is considered belonging to a lesser cultural sphere and categorized under such terms as ‘applied’, ‘decorative’ or ‘lesser’ than other art forms such as painting or sculpture.&lt;ref name="Packer 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Packer|first1=Carolyn|title=The Evolution of Craft In Contemporary Feminist Art|journal=Scholarship Claremont|date=2010|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=scripps_theses|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This critique of women’s craft and craftivism as a ‘lesser’ art form has been contested within the discourse of feminism. Some Feminist Art discourse excludes craftivism. This feminist intervention into the art world perpetuates a hierarchy of art where craft is a lower art form. Some feminists deem craftivism as reinforcing domesticity and consider it a retrogression of the feminist cause rather than a subversive tactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raven|first1=Charlotte|title=How the 'New Feminism' Went Wrong|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/06/charlotte-raven-feminism-madonna-price|website=www.theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmentalism ===
Craftivism is also centered on ideas of environmentalism and sustainability. When buying new materials, many craftivists choose organic fabrics and fairly traded products such as home-spun yarns. Yet, even more popular within the movement is the utilization of vintage, thrifted and repurposed goods in order to minimize waste and promote reuse. This display of resourcefulness acknowledges the finite resources on Earth, and the valorization of quality over quantity. Craftivist, Betsy Greer, is quoted saying, "While I think that crafting has become something fairly elite and cliquish in some areas, at its heart, it is very much made for individuals who value both their time and their money".&lt;ref name="Sabella"/&gt;

=== Anti-capitalism ===
Historically, craft was the pre-capitalist form of production, where each created item possessed a "use-value," a term comparing the usefulness of an item to the exchange equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vivienne |last=Brown |year=2009 |editor=Stephanie Taylor |editor2=Steve Hinchliffe |editor3=John Clarke |editor4=Simon Bromley |chapter=Rubbish society: affluence, waste and values |title=Making Social Lives |location=Milton Keynes |publisher=The Open University |page=122 |isbn=0749216417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now within a capitalist system of mass production, craft has become a commodity to be bought and sold for money, where it is now referred to as having an "exchange-value".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this movement from use-value to exchange-value, there is less emphasis on the time and skill expended to create an object, and more importance on making it available to the masses as inexpensively as possible. Traditionally associated with a strong community so vital to the creation and distribution of craft, crafting has since lost its use-value and has been "captured by capital".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular way to resist the commoditization of craft is through the Do-It-Yourself or DIY movement. Popularized through "zines" of the 1990s, DIY inspires people to be self-sufficient and to rely less on the market for basic necessities that can easily be created on one's own. DIY is a resistance to both the capitalist nature of the fashion industry and pressures to conform and buy a style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first= Charlotte |date=January 31, 2005 |title=Political protest turns to the radical art of knitting |work= The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/31/arts.artsnews1 |accessdate=2 November 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the Counterfeit Crochet Project, which seeks to "debase and defile designer items one step at a time".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Counterfeit Crochet Project by Stephanie Syjuco http://www.counterfeitcrochet.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Crafters have also subverted the market through the use of open source patterns and information sharing on the internet. Sites like [[Burdastyle]] allow crafters to upload and download sewing projects at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burdastyle.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Cat Mazza's online software [[KnitPro]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microrevolt.org/knitPro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; allows users to download images into detailed knitting patterns at no charge.

====Anti-sweatshop====
Efforts within the craftivist movement against capitalism focus primarily on the international issue of [[sweatshops]]. Some craftivists believe that either sewing one's own clothing or buying only hand-made is the best way to protest unfair labor practices around the globe. Other craftivists take the issue even further, using the act of crafting as a protest against sweatshops. Artist and activist [[Cat Mazza]] created a campaign against the inhumane labor practices of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] through the creation of a giant blanket depicting Nike's trademark swoosh. From 2003-2008, international crafters were asked to mail in 4x4 inch stitched squares to border the blanket and to sign a petition against Nike.&lt;ref&gt;Microrevolt Blanket. http://www.microrevolt.org/web/blanket.htm April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mazza also created a second web-based software called [[Knitoscope]] that transforms video into animated knitted stitches.&lt;ref name="turbulence.org"&gt;http://www.turbulence.org/Works/microRevolt/testimonies.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each video has a corresponding testimony featuring various professionals who work against sweatshop labor.&lt;ref name="turbulence.org"/&gt;

Artist and Activist Kirsty Robertson feels that the subversive efforts of craftivists against capitalism are limited by their dependency on the internet and new communication. She points out that for this reason, global justice knitters are not completely removed from the economy themselves &lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

===Anti-war===
Some craftivists see their art form as a protest against war and violence. Anti-war craftivists choose to make their statement by juxtaposing a colorful, soft, and fuzzy yarn with cold and dangerous weapons. In 2006, Danish artist Marianne Jorgensen stitched a giant pink "tank blanket" and placed it over a M24 Chafee combat tank to protest the Iraq war.&lt;ref name="marianneart.dk"&gt;Pink M.24 Chafee. http://www.marianneart.dk/ April 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She has been making these blankets since Denmark entered the Iraq War, and doesn't plan to stop until it is over. She writes on her website that, "Unsimilar to a war, knitting signals home, care, closeness and time for reflection...When [the tank] is covered in pink, it becomes completely unarmed and it loses its authority".&lt;ref name="marianneart.dk"/&gt; Much like Jorgensen, Canadian artist [[Barb Hunt]] works to question the acceptance of military logic in society by creating knitted antipersonnel land mines out of wool.&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

Similar to her campaign against Nike, Cat Mazza started an anti-war effort entitled "Stitch for Senate" on the fourth anniversary of the Iraq War. She enlisted two people from each state to knit a soldier's helmet liner which would be sent on to every senator. Unlike the apolitical Operation Home Front efforts that knitted gear for soldiers, Mazza wanted "to start a dialogue about the war and to get politicians to keep the promises they made during the midterm elections".&lt;ref name="Gohil, Neha Singh 2007"&gt;Gohil, Neha Singh. March 13, 2007. Activists use knitting needles to make their point. Columbia News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Viral Knitting Project]] is an anti-war effort that translates the 0/1 binary code of the dangerous Code Red computer virus into a knitting pattern of knit/purl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirstyrobertson.com/viral%20knitting/viral%20knitting.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713153258/http://www.kirstyrobertson.com/viral%20knitting/viral%20knitting.html |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The color and code relate to the anti-terrorism alerts of post 9/11 United States. The project is attempting to "draw together links between technology, culture, capitalism and war".&lt;ref name="Robertson, Kirsty 2006"/&gt;

===Social justice issues===
The Craftivist Collective, founded by Sarah Corbett, is an activist social enterprise which uses craftivism to engage people in social justice issues and solidarity movements.&lt;ref name="ohcomely"&gt;Charlotte Humphery, ''We'll change the world stitch by stitch'', ''Oh Comely'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/158988814/resistance|title=Resistance by Crafterdark|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a manifesto and a checklist of goals for the work of the group which includes being welcoming,&lt;ref name="satreview"&gt;Ruth Lewy, ''I get frustrated knitting socks. I want to make a difference.'', ''The Times Saturday Review'', 10 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging and positive,&lt;ref name="positive2"&gt;Rin Simpson, ''Getting crafty: a creative approach to activism'', ''Positive News'', Winter 2012&lt;/ref&gt; creative and non-threatening,&lt;ref name="house"&gt;Holly Howe, ''Sarah Corbett'', ''House'', Autumn 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and focusing on global poverty and human rights injustices.&lt;ref name="bigissuenorth"&gt;Jameela Oberman, ''Stitch in time'', ''Big Issue in the North'', 10–16 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Craftivist Collective's key achievements was to convince the [[M&amp;S]] board to pay their 50,000 employees the living wage in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Alexi Duggins, [https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2017/sep/18/why-craftivists-are-hiding-notes-in-pockets-during-london-fashion-week ''Is there a protest message in your new jacket's pocket? You've been shop-dropped''], theguardian.com, 18 September 2017, retrieved 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.
This campaign was awarded with the Economic Justice Campaigner of the year 2017 by [[Sheila McKechnie Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://smk.org.uk/oxy_testimonial/sarah-corbett-craftivism-economic-justice-award-winner-2017/ ''Sarah Corbett, Craftivism, Economic Justice Award winner 2017''], smk.org.uk, 18 August 2017, retrieved 30 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;, and was nominated for the 2017 [[Care2]] UK Impact Award. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.care2services.com/2017-uk-impact-award ''Vote now for the 2017 UK Impact Award finalists!''] care2services.com, retrieved 28 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of this award, Sarah Corbett continues to work with large charities to deliver strategic craftivism projects and teach them in the art of gentle protest.&lt;ref&gt;Kirstie Brewer [https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-42181743 ''Why I leave hidden messages in High Street clothes''], bbc.com, 1 December 2017, retrieved 30 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guerrilla Kindness ===
Australian artist Sayraphim Lothian uses craftivism to "make people's day brighter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/9834934/Kakapo-sculptures-hidden-in-Christchurch |title=Kakapo sculptures hidden in Christchurch |website=Stuff.co.nz |date=17 March 2014 |author=Will Harve |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She leaves small handcrafted works of art on the streets for people to find and take home  “aimed at creating tiny bubbles of joy in the lives of passersby, tiny surreal moments that might make people do a double take.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannaokun/people-who-use-crafting-for-activism |title=10 People Who Use Crafting For Activism |website=buzzfeed.com |date=22 April 2014 |author=Alanna Okun |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protest models ==
When craftivists take to the street, they utilize various protest models.

A popular form of protest is the "knit-in," where knitters infiltrate a public space and knit. They might ride a subway, occupy a civic building, or sit in a park. They use the knit-in to draw attention to their issue of concern. The [[Revolutionary Knitting Circle]] of Calgary, Canada stage a knit-in in front of Calgary's financial office buildings during the summit of the G-8 nations in 2002.&lt;ref name="Gohil, Neha Singh 2007"/&gt; The Knit-in not only provides an opportunity to protest against injustice, but also allows for a running discussion about social issues between the stationary knitters. Jack Bratich of [[Rutgers University]] argues that, "Knitting in public also creates a gendered question of space. It rips open the enclosure of the domestic space to public consumption, exposing productive work that has contributed to women's invisible and unpaid labor".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bratich|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are, thereby, able to gain power from an activity that previously symbolized their repression.

Craftivist [[Carrie Reichardt]] has covered her home, car and studio with mosaics which utilizes  ceramics, screen-printing and transfers to highlight "plight of inmates on death row, the Black Panthers, and the spirituality of the planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/07/homes |title=Interiors |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 February 2010 |author=Kate Makhail |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of craft-themed activism is guerilla art. The Texas-based group [[Knitta]] places street art such as street pole cozies and antenna warmers in cities throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knitta homepage|url=http://www.knittaplease.com/Home.html|website=knittaplease.com|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306151047/http://www.knittaplease.com/Home.html|archivedate=6 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a blogger in England, Sarah Corbett, "creates textile art with political messages in public spaces first by herself at a blog called 'a lonely craftivist' and then as the head of the worldwide Craftivist Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alonelycraftivist.blogspot.com/ |title=a lonely craftivist |website=alonelycraftivist.blogspot.com |date=4 October 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers for [[Postcards To Voters]] often create their own hand-decorated postcards to send to potential voters ahead of elections in hopes of increasing turnout. The work can be done solo, but is often done at "postcarding parties" at a volunteer's home or a cafe.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Writing Postcards Brings Voters Back From the Edge: ‘It’s Sharpie Therapy’ |date=November 1, 2018 |last1=Tackett |first1=Michael |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/us/politics/postcards-democrats-midterm-elections.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In transition==
In the spring of 2009, an online debate began over the definition of craftivism. The debate spread after the self-titled Craftivism team on [[Etsy]] had an inner-group argument about the political affiliation of its members, causing some members to leave the group. 
The original description of the group states, "The Etsy Craftivism Team is a team of progressive Etsyans who believe that craft and art can change the world. Some of us use our work to carry messages of protest and political activism. Others believe that the act of making craft can be an act of resistance. Still others see that by buying and selling directly from the maker we are challenging the all pervasive corporate culture that promotes profit over people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://craftingagreenworld.com/2009/04/04/what-is-craftivism-division-over-the-definition-explodes-an-etsy-team/ |title=What is Craftivism? Division over the Definition Explodes an Etsy Team - Crafting a Green World |website=Craftingagreenworld.com |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conservative members accused the group of assuming a liberal agenda, and argued that politics should not be involved. Some members of the group felt that the mere act of crafting itself was political, while others felt that the act must also be attached to a political message. Rayna Fahey from Radical Cross Stitch replied to a thread stating "Personally if a John McCain supporter joined this group and told me that my latest piece in support of indigenous sovereignty was a well-made piece that serves the purpose for which it was designed well, I'd think that was awesome and I'd have hope for the future of this world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whose Craftivism?|url=http://radicalcrossstitch.com/2009/04/06/whose-craftivism/|website=radicalcrossstitch.com|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408031802/http://radicalcrossstitch.com/2009/04/06/whose-craftivism/|archivedate=8 April 2009|date=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, craftivist Betsy Greer believes that "the personal is political," and that you cannot separate the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greer|2008|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Daorson Coin.jpg|300px|thumb|left| Illyrian [[Coin]] found at Daorson, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]
Daorson was built around a central fort or [[acropolis]], surrounded by [[Cyclopean masonry|cyclopean walls]] made of huge&lt;ref&gt;Urbano biće Bosne i Hercegovine - page 27 by Seka Brkljača - 1996, "Its name was Daorson. It belonged to the illyrian sphere. Its 46 meters of the old fortress are preserved."&lt;/ref&gt; stone blocks (similar to those in [[Mycenae]], in [[Greece]]). The acropolis would have housed all of the important administrative, public and religious buildings. The defensive wall extending from southwest to northeast was 65 metres long, 4.2 metres wide, and from 4.5 to 7.5 metres high with doors and towers on both sides. The Daorsi used the [[Greek language]] and alphabet and kept trading relations with the Greeks.

The remnants of numerous wine amphorae have been found, including some ceramic fragments. The most valuable of the finds is a bronze helmet decorated with a series of Greek mythological figures, including [[Aphrodite]], [[Nike (mythology)|Nika]], [[Heli (mythology)|Heli]], [[Dionysus|Dionysius]], [[Muse]], [[Pegasus]]. The inscription on it is similar to the inscription on a helmet found in [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]]. The remnants of a granite sculpture of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] have also been found. This piece includes an Illyrian relief with thirteen snakes and five pairs of eagle’s wings. A small building housed a [[mint (coin)|mint]] facility.  Thirty-nine different coins were discovered in this building, the majority (29) depicted King [[Ballaios]], who ruled after 168 BC.  Nine of the recovered coins had a Greek inscription with an image of a boat. Money was of immense importance to the Daorsi, allowing the tribe to remain independent while securing their business, cultural and trade links with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;pg=PA177] Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, page 177, "Two other coinages of Illyrian peoples are dated to the period following 168 BC. Those with the legend DAORSON with a galley on the reverse were produced by the Daorsi."&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Daorsi were attacked by the [[Delmatae]],&lt;ref&gt;I greci in Adriatico, Volume 2 by Lorenzo Braccesi, Mario Luni, page 152, "The Daorsi suffered directly from the attacks of the Delmatae and were understandably one of the first peoples who had left Genthius half brother Caravantius and sought protection from the Roman state placing their armed forces at the disposal of the Romans. After the war they were rewarded by having been given immunity..."&lt;/ref&gt; they joined [[Vis (island)|Issa]]&lt;ref&gt;The magistrates of the Roman Republic - by Thomas Robert Shannon Broughton - 1960 - page 446, "Head of a commission sent, after the receipt of complaints from Issa and the Daorsi, to observe conditions in Illyria and Dalmatia."&lt;/ref&gt; in seeking the protection of the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] state.  The Daorsi abandoned [[Caravantius]] and fought on the side of the Romans, contributing with their strong navy.  After the [[Illyrian Wars]] the Romans gave the Daorsi immunity.

==Site description==
[[File:Daorson, Bosnia and Herzegovina.jpg|thumb|Remains of the outer walls of Daorson, as seen in 2013.]]
Ošanjići consist of three linked stones groups, the disposition of which is dictated by the lie of the land.

The central area is occupied by a dominant hill fort or acropolis below and to the south and south-west of which are terraces on the ridge, while to the east, on the Banje plateau, is the outer-acropolis area of residential and commercial, mainly artisanal and trade quarters of the settlement.

The hill fort was built on a prehistoric fortified settlement which had been in existence there since the early (17/16th century BCE) to the end of the late [[Bronze Age]] (9/8th century BCE). The date of the ransacking of the town of Daorson that finally put an end to human settlement there can be determined with fair accuracy as the mid or second half of the 1st century BCE from the details of the wars waged by the Roman Praetor [[Vatinius]] against the Delmati. No permanent settlement ever arose on the ruins of the town of Daors. There is ample evidence of its advanced culture and civilization: it minted its own coins and produced complex artistically decorated buckles, there is [[graffiti]] on shards of pottery vessels, and parts of stone statues of human figures some 2 m in height were found.

A megalithic wall, erected following the lie of the land, has been dated to the 4th century BCE, when both towers were probably built following the construction of the wall.  The rest of the acropolis is of later date, through to the 1st century BCE. 
One of the most important finds is a helmet with the Greek inscription ΠΙИ, probably the abbreviated Illyrian name of the owner PINNES; it was probably made in the 3rd century BCE.[10]

'''Edgelands''' are the transitional, [[Liminality|liminal]] areas of space to be found on the boundaries of country and town - with the spread of [[urbanisation]], an increasingly important facet of the twenty-first century world.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Walker - 2002 Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History - Page 134 1473836131 "AN 'EDGE-LAND': THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WITHAM VALLEY EAST OF CANWICK ROAD by Dennis Mills THE TERM 'EDGE-LAND' has been coined recently for the concept of a neglected area on the fringe of a city. Frequently such ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html Our beautiful edgelands]&lt;/ref&gt;  However a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside...ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Robert Macfarlane (writer)|Robert Macfarlane]], ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).
[[Alice Coleman]] (Kings College London, dept geography) in 2nd Land Use Survey of Great Britain, refers to  "rurban fringe". Indicating a similar landscape but with negative overtones.

Nevertheless it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century - as a distinct realm of Nature increasingly disappeared beneath the commodifying impact of globalising [[late capitalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2002) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; - that the significance of the unstructured borderlands between organised town and organised country, part man-made, part natural,&lt;ref&gt;M. Pratt, ''My Wild Northumbria'' (2015) p. 176 and 208&lt;/ref&gt; both for wildlife and for human exploration, came into fuller focus. [[Psychogeography]] charted the London orbital, while bombsites, canal banks and brownfield sites were documented in poetry and prose, film and photography;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Macfarlane, ''Landmarks'' (2015) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and the borderlands as an untapped, transgressive resource became almost the object of a new cult.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fry, ''Design in the Borderlands'' (2014) p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Exogenesis: Symphony'''", commonly known as simply "'''Exogenesis'''", is a song by English [[alternative rock]] band [[Muse (band)|Muse]], featured on their 2009 fifth studio album ''[[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]]''. Written by lead vocalist, guitarist and pianist [[Matthew Bellamy]] over the course of a number of years, the song is presented as a [[symphony]] in three [[Movement (music)|movement]]s entitled &lt;!-- Please do not edit these titles, they are correct!! --&gt;"Overture", "Cross-Pollination" and "Redemption", respectively, each occupying a separate track at the end of the album and spanning nearly 13 minutes in total. "Exogenesis" was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] in the United States on 17 April 2010, with 500 copies to be made available by import in the United Kingdom through the band's official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.mu/shop/product/245/exogenesis/menu/4/singles/ |title=Exogenesis - 12 |publisher=[[Muse (band)|Muse]] |accessdate=26 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403005002/http://muse.mu/shop/product/245/exogenesis/menu/4/singles/ |archivedate=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2012, an official music video directed by Japanese comedian Tekken was released for ''Redemption'', the third part of the Exogenesis Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPBfaMsA97o&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and composition==
A song in the long, symphonic style of "Exogenesis" was first hinted at as a possible inclusion for Muse's fifth studio album in early 2008, when British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' quoted Bellamy as revealing that "I think on the next album I’d like to do at least one 15-minute [[space rock]] solo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/35085 |title=Muse: next album to have '15-minute space rock solo' |publisher=''[[NME]]'' |date=12 March 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was later discussed further and in a more extreme sense, when Bellamy suggested that the band may reject the conventional [[album]] format in favour of releasing a series of [[Single (music)|single]]s, or indeed "one 50-minute symphony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/36945 |title=Muse begin work on fifth album |publisher=''[[NME]]'' |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the band confirmed that recording had begun for the album in late 2008, Bellamy explained more about the symphonic song, which he revealed would be in three parts on the album:

{{cquote|There is a new song in three parts, more of a symphony than a song, which I have been working on sporadically for many years [...] As a large percentage of the composition is orchestral, I have never wanted to collaborate with a string arranger as they may make it 'theirs'. So I have been arranging the orchestral elements myself, which is taking a long time. It should hopefully make the next album as the final three tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/41287 |title=Muse aim to include 'hardest song ever' on new album |publisher=''[[NME]]'' |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the presence of "Exogenesis", among other songs, Bellamy hinted at the [[Classical music|classical]] direction taken by the band in writing and recording ''The Resistance'', describing the record as "A symphonic album" and joking that "We'll be knocking on [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]'s door, you know?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nme.com/news/muse/43149 |title=Muse: 'Our new album is set for Classic FM' |publisher=''[[NME]]'' |date=2 March 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking for the [[iTunes LP]] feature for ''The Resistance'', Bellamy said the following about the inspirations and meanings of "Exogenesis":

{{cquote|["Exogenesis: Symphony"] is influenced by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Pink Floyd]]. It looks at the concept of '[[panspermia]]'. It is a story of humanity coming to an end and everyone pinning their hopes on a group of astronauts who go out to explore space and spread humanity to another planet. Part 1 is a jaded acceptance that civilization will end. Part 2 is a desperate hope that sending the astronauts to find and populate other planets will be successful alongside the recognition that this is the last hope. Finally, Part 3 is when the astronauts realize that it is just one big cycle, and recognize that unless humanity can change it will happen all over again.}}

==Release and reception==
On 3 July 2009, Muse revealed, via their [[Twitter]] page, the track listing for ''The Resistance''; the "Exogenesis" was shown to occupy the final three tracks of the album, with the three parts being dubbed "Overture",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/muse/status/2459545233 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305165117/https://twitter.com/muse/status/2459545233 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 March 2016 |title=9.

The song has been acclaimed by critics. In a pre-release interview with the band, ''NME'' identified "Exogenesis" as one of the highlights of the album, describing it as "more bombastic than anything Muse have ever previously done" and revealing that it features "classical piano from Bellamy and a full orchestra throughout."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.muselive.com/index.php?m=single&amp;id=4726 |title=Muse in NME |publisher=Muselive (quoting ''[[NME]]'') |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712062611/http://www.muselive.com/index.php?m=single&amp;id=4726 |archive-date=12 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; French media source ''JudeBox'' reviewed the album before its release, comparing Bellamy's vocal performance to that of [[Radiohead]] frontman [[Thom Yorke]] and identifying classical composers [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt]] as influences for the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muselive.com/forums.php?m=posts&amp;p=1568373#1568373 |title=Re: The Resistance Mini-Review |publisher=Muselive |date=9 July 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' quoted Bellamy as revealing that the song features an [[orchestra]] of over 40 musicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v356/turkeyleader/musemojo.jpg |title=Muse: Progressive stadium rock three dream up album five |last=Wilkinson |first=Roy |publisher=''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''NME'' praised the "classical piece [...] put together by [[Matthew Bellamy]] over the course of many years" as the "Most astonishing and over-the-top of all" the songs on ''The Resistance''.&lt;ref name="nme"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.muselive.com/forums.php?m=posts&amp;p=1593522#1593522 |title=The Italian Job |publisher=''[[NME]]'' |accessdate=23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature article quoted bassist and backing vocalist [[Christopher Wolstenholme]] as saying the following on the song:

{{cquote|You can always just take the band away from that track and just have the orchestral bit and it would still be beautiful. I just think it's a stunning piece of music and we've never done something like that before, where you've got all these songs that are in different movements. The orchestra were the main bit of the song and the band was more of a backdrop. The strings were at the forefront. It's fucking astonishing.&lt;ref name="nme"/&gt;}}

Drummer [[Dominic Howard]] was quoted as adding the following to the description of "Exogenesis":

{{cquote|It's a real journey that song as well. It’s kind of... you can’t really hear what Matt’s singing in the first part much, but the whole song is about leaving the destructive planet we’ve created, leaving it behind to go populate somewhere else in the universe. So it's a big journey anyway, it's a big kind of filmic, visual journey as well.&lt;ref name="nme"/&gt;}}

On possibly performing the song live, Bellamy was quoted simply as enthusiastically declaring that "We’ll give it a go!"&lt;ref name="nme"/&gt; For most shows of [[The Resistance Tour]], "Overture" has been a staple and is usually played at the start of an encore, leading into "[[Stockholm Syndrome (Muse song)|Stockholm Syndrome]]".{{cn|date=September 2015}}

"Exogenesis: Symphony" was released on 17 April 2010 in the US on 12" vinyl only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprp.com/category/releases/ |title=Releases |publisher=THEPRP |accessdate=23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Exogenesis: Symphony Part I" was used for [[Dior Homme]]'s advertisement called "A Rendezvous", directed by [[Guy Ritchie]] and starring [[Jude Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodbackwash.com/video-jude-law-for-dior-homme-directed-by-guy-ritchie-music-by-muse/ |title=Video: Jude Law for Dior Homme -Directed By Guy Ritchie-Music By Muse |publisher=HollywoodBackwash.com |accessdate=8 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909161721/http://www.hollywoodbackwash.com/video-jude-law-for-dior-homme-directed-by-guy-ritchie-music-by-muse/ |archivedate=9 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit controversy==

In September 2012, three years after the release of ''The Resistance'' and "Exogenesis", Charles Bollfrass claimed that the "Symphony" copied his original cinematic project with the same name. Speaking to a Manhattan court, Bollfrass stated that he had developed a "cinematic science-fiction rock opera" titled "Exogenesis" when he contacted the band in 2005, as well as the rock band [[System of a Down]], to compose the film's original score. The following year, Muse told him they were not interested in pursuing the project, but System of a Down's lead guitarist, [[Daron Malakian]], had said yes, announcing his band's hiatus during an MTV interview.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530066/system-down-plan-hiatus-after-ozzfest.jhtml&lt;/ref&gt; Bollfrass was seeking $3.5 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entlawdigest.com/2012/09/06/1772.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the lawsuit, [[Muse (band)|Muse]] stated "The claim is complete nonsense, and is categorically denied. It appears to be based on a 'screenplay' which the band never received or saw, produced by someone the band has never heard of. It speaks volumes that the album in question was released a full three years ago, and yet this is the first that has been heard of these groundless allegations."&lt;ref&gt;http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2012/09/11/lawsuit-alert-did-muse-really-rip-off-a-sci-fi-writer-for-their-album-the-resistance/&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit was finally dismissed in April 2013 by Judge [[Louis L. Stanton]] after an earlier attempt to dismiss had failed in 2012. In dismissing the case, Judge Stanton held that Bollfrass' claims had "practically no legal or factual basis." "The similarity of the two works here lies in their concepts, abstracted to a high degree of generality," Judge Stanton wrote. "Both works are based on a concept of planetary breakdown and space travel, but their treatment is markedly different."&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.law360.s3.amazonaws.com/0429000/429520//mnt/rails_cache/https-ecf-nysd-uscourts-gov-cgi-bin-show_doc-pl-caseid-401143-de_seq_num-49-dm_id-11262284-doc_num-13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bollfrass also said the cover art for "The Resistance" featured an image from the storyboards of his screenplay." But while Judge Stanton tossed the lawsuit, he denied Warner Music's request for attorneys' fees, saying "there was no evidence to conclude that Bollfrass' complaint was frivolous."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law360.com/articles/429520/warner-music-escapes-copyright-suit-over-muse-song&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
The symphony is also noted for its live performances; despite the fact that "Cross-Pollination" has not been played live, "Overture" has been performed at virtually every date on [[The Resistance Tour]], besides festival appearances (although it had been played at one or two of the festival slots, this was however rare). "Redemption" was finally played for the first time ever in January 2013 in Saitama, Japan.&lt;ref name="Exo pt. 3 Live"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qaZVqo-6JE] Exogenesis Part 3 Live at Saitama Super Arena, Japan&lt;/ref&gt;  Live performances during arena dates would usually take place during the first song of the encore set and would involve the band performing on the towers which comprised the arena tour's stage design, as they slowly rose up and blue lighting covered the stage. However, during later dates, the song was sometimes used as the concert opener, although this was rare. Stadium performances were more notable however, as the band would release a UFO into the crowd whilst the song was being played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cochrane |first=Greg |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11281742 |title=Newsbeat - Rockers Muse bring UK 'UFO' tour to a close at Wembley |publisher=BBC |date=2010-09-13 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UFO would circle the stadium and, as [[Matt Bellamy]]'s vocals started, an acrobat in the guise of an alien would drop out of the bottom of the UFO and begin performing acrobatics above the audience. This was also a notable event in Muse's live career, as the band had tried and failed on previous tours to secure a UFO to use in live performances, only to have their plans foiled because of health and safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2010/muses-ufo-banned-from-t-in-the-park |title=Muse’s UFO Banned From T In The Park |publisher=Xfm |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fiber art''' refers to [[fine art]] whose material consists of natural or synthetic [[fiber]] and other components, such as [[Cloth|fabric]] or [[yarn]].  It focuses on the materials and on the manual labour on the part of the artist as part of the works' significance, and prioritizes aesthetic value over utility.

==History==
The term fiber art came into use by curators and art historians to describe the work of the artist-craftsman following [[World War II]].  Those years saw a sharp increase in the design and production of "art fabric."   In the 1950s, as the contributions of craft artists became more recognized—not just in fiber but in clay and other media—an increasing number of [[Weaving|weavers]] began binding fibers into nonfunctional forms as works of art.&lt;ref name=Lunin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lunin|first=Lois F.|title=The Descriptive Challenges of Fiber Art|journal=Library Trends|year=1990|volume=38|issue=4|pages=697–716|publisher=Board of Trustees, University of Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 70s brought an international revolution in fiber art.&lt;ref name=Baizerman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baizerman|first=Suzanne|title=California and the Fiber Art Revolution|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|year=2004|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/tsaconf/449/|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Beyond weaving, fiber structures were created through knotting, twining, plaiting, coiling, pleating, lashing, and interlacing.  Artists in the United States and Europe explored the qualities of fabric to develop works that could be hung or free standing, "two or three dimensional, flat or volumetric, many stories high or miniature, nonobjective or figurative, and representational or fantasy."&lt;ref name=Lunin /&gt;   The [[second-wave feminism|women's movement]] of the same era was important in contributing to the rise of fiber art because of the traditional association of women with textiles in the domestic sphere; indeed, many of the most prominent fiber artists are women.&lt;ref name=Baizerman /&gt;

Since the 1980s, fiber work has become more and more conceptual, influenced by [[Postmodern art|postmodernist]] ideas.  For fiber artists, in addition to long-standing experimentation with materials and techniques, this brought "a new focus on creating work which confronted cultural issues such as: [[gender feminism]]; [[domesticity]] and the repetitive tasks related to women's work; politics; the social and behavioral sciences; material specific concepts related to fiber's softness, permeability, drapability, and so on."&lt;ref name=Marcus&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Sharon|title=Critical Issues in Tapestry|journal=A Quarterly Review of Tapestry Art Today|year=2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=2–3|url=http://americantapestryalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Critical-Issues-in-Tapestry-SMarcus.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiber within the context of the textile arts==
Modern fiber art takes its context from the [[textile arts]], which have been practiced globally for millennia. Traditionally, fiber is taken from [[plant fiber|plants]] or [[animal fiber|animals]], for example [[cotton]] from cotton seed pods, [[linen]] from [[flax]] stems, [[wool]] from [[sheep]] hair, or [[silk]] from the spun cocoons of silkworms. In addition to these traditional materials, [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] materials such as plastic [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]] are now used.

In order for the fiber to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be [[spinning (textiles)|spun]] (or twisted) into a strand known as [[yarn]]. When the yarn is ready and [[dye]]d for use it can be made into cloth in a number of ways. [[Knitting]] and [[crochet]] are common methods of twisting and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric.  The most common use of yarn to make cloth is [[weaving]].  In weaving, the yarn is wrapped on a frame called a [[loom]] and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the [[warp (weaving)|warp]]. Then another strand of yarn is worked back and forth wrapping over and under the warp.  This wrapped yarn is called the [[weft]]. Most art and commercial textiles are made by this process.

For centuries weaving has been the way to produce clothes. In some cultures, weaving forms demonstrate social status. The more intricate the weaving, the higher the status.  Certain symbols and colors also allowed identification of class and position. For example, in the ancient [[Inca civilization|Incan civilization]], black and white designs indicated a military status.&lt;ref name=getlein /&gt;

In Europe between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries woven pieces called "[[tapestry|tapestries]]" took the place of paintings on walls. ''The Unicorn in Captivity'' is part of a series consisting of seven tapestry panels known as ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' by Franco Flemish from this time period.  Much of the art at the time in history was used to tell common folktales that also had a religious theme. As Mark Getlein wrote, "Tapestry is a special type of weaving in which the weft yarns are manipulated freely to form a pattern or design on the front of the fabric...Often the weft yarns are of several colors and the weaver can use the different-colored yarns almost as flexible as a painter uses pigment on canvas."&lt;ref name=getlein&gt;{{cite book|last=Getlein|first=Mark|title=Living with art|year=2008|publisher=McGraw Hill|pages=288–289|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/77076176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time period in the Middle East, fiber artists did not make tapestry or wall hanging weavings, but instead created beautifully crafted rugs. The woven rugs did not depict scenes in a story, but instead used symbols and complex designs. An example of this type of art are the giant rugs known as the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s. Getlein wrote, "Like most Islamic carpets, they were created by knotting individual tufts of wool onto a woven ground."&lt;ref name=getlein /&gt;

Another fiber art technique is [[quilting]] in which layers of fabric are sewn together.  Although this technique has not been around for as long as weaving, it is a popular form of art in American history.  Recently, quilted fiber art wall hangings have become popular with art collectors.  This non-traditional form often features bold designs. [[quilt art|Quilting as an art form]] was popularized in the 1970s and 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Robert|title=The Art Quilt|date=1997|publisher=Hugh Lauter Levin Associates|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-007-9|url=http://www.saqa.com/news/history_Shaw.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132332/http://www.saqa.com/news/history_Shaw.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fiber art techniques are knitting, [[rug hooking]], [[felting]], [[braid]]ing or plaiting, [[macrame]], [[lace]] making, [[flocking (texture)]] and more.  There are a wide variety of dye techniques.  Sometimes [[cyanotype]] and heliographic ([[sun printing]]) are used.

Fiber artists face the same dilemma of all artists; determining "what is art?" More so with fiber arts and other media associated with [[handicraft]], because they have long been associated with domestic or utilitarian production. Typically, pieces like [[pot-holder]]s, which just follow patterns without doing anything more, are not considered works of fiber art. Fiber art works are works of art that communicate some sort of message, emotion or meaning and go beyond just the literal meaning of the materials. Fiber arts face the challenge at times of the message or meaning of the work of art being eclipsed by the study of the materials used and their history, rather than what they contribute to the overall work of art.&lt;ref name=Koplos&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koplos |first=Janet |title=When is Fiber Art "Art"? |journal=FiberArts |year=1986 |issue=March/April |url=http://www.fiberarts.com/ |accessdate=29 April 2009 |publisher=Interweave Press LLC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106042857/http://fiberarts.com/ |archivedate=6 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism and fiber art==

===History of textile work===
Sewing had always been considered [[women's work]], of which was often part-time, casual, most likely in the home and not regarded as important enough to declare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hudson|first1=Pat|authorlink=Pat Hudson|title=Women's Work|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/womens_work_01.shtml|work=BBC - History|date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Western Society, textiles are described usually as 'textiles' or 'fiber'. These two terms most commonly connote ideas identified with domesticity and women's creativity. This women's creativity is labor-intensive yet devalued as this women's work, where it becomes invisible and described as non-productive.&lt;ref&gt; Jefferies, Janice. "Text and textiles: weaving across the borderlines'.' In New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies. Manchester University Press. 1995. Print. Page 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] changed the whole industry. Women started to sew less because it became more affordable to purchase well-made clothing from stores. Fabric retailers found that they needed to convince women to return to their sewing machines, so the companies devised a variety of strategies to revitalize sewing. A theme that many retailers employed was to send out the message that sewing not only saved money and let them explore their personal style, but was also a way to be feminine and show gracefulness. Sewing was portrayed as a way to be a good mother and an attractive and thrifty wife.&lt;ref&gt; Gordon, Sarah A. " "Make It Yourself": Home Sewing, Gender, and Culture, 1890-1930". Columbia University Press, New York. 2009. Print. Pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Deborah Thom, professor at Cambridge University, helps detail out a time where fiber art took a feminist turn during the [[Women's suffrage|Suffrage Movement]]
where women were making embroidered banners for their protests.&lt;ref&gt; Dr. Deborah Thom [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b016vxz1 "Woman's Hour"], "BBC Radio News", Sat 5 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===The reclamation of fiber arts===
In the 1970s, needlework was reclaimed by the [[Feminist Movement]]. This began the reintroduction of textiles and fiber in 'high art'.

[[Judy Chicago]] founded the first feminist art program in the United States, and proceeded to coin the name [[Feminist Art]], with many artists working with fiber arts, especially in her project [[Womanhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Viki D. Thompson Wylder and Lucy R. Lippard. Judy Chicago. Watson-Guptill Publications. June 2002. Print. Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chicago created one of the first pieces of "high art" that incorporates and celebrates needlework and fabrics within women's history, called [[The Dinner Party]](1979). 

===''The Subversive Stitch''===
In 1984, [[Rozsika Parker]] published ''The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the making of the feminine''. Parker has published books on art history and psychotherapy, and uses theories from both fields in her analysis of "women's work".&lt;ref&gt;Mida, Ingrid, [http://fashionismymuse.blogspot.ca/2010/07/book-review-subversive-stitch.html "Book Review: The Subversive Stitch, Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine"], ''Fashion is my Muse'', 29 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Parker examines the belief of women and embroidery as both feminine and natural, and the appearance of natural that is actually socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Pennina|title=New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies|date=1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-4258-5|pages=76–84|edition=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM4fvz0mGtsC&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;ots=MokGm1V4oP&amp;dq=Afterthoughts%20on%20curating%20%E2%80%98The%20Subversive%20Stitch&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Afterthoughts on curating 'The Subversive Stitch'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people had varying reactions from emotionally moved to deeply disgraced after seeing the exhibitions 'The Subversive Stitch', of which incorporated two shows called 'Embroidery in Women's Lives 1300-1900' and 'Women in Textiles Today' in July 1989, as recorded in Pennina Barnett's article "Afterthoughts on curating 'The Subversive Stitch' ". The critical response from women and feminist's reviews and articles were similar. These two shows were based on Parker's book.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

Barnett describes that most historical studies of embroidery concentrate on questions of style and technique, where these exhibitions track the idea of femininity that was forced upon women through embroidery from medieval times, when it was considered a high art form practiced by both men and women, to its current denotation as a 'feminine craft'.  But perhaps this exhibition, with both historical and modern shows side by side provoke new ideas into the more historical objects. Adding names and dates to the creation of the objects thrusts them into the art world once again. The context in which these women worked, varying greatly because of class, race, and gender, juxtaposed with contemporary work beside names, dates, and even poetry created a language and a new critical way of looking into this medium.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

As [[Ann Newdigate]] states in her essay "Kinda art, sorta tapestry: tapestry as shorthand access to the definitions, languages, institutions, attitudes, hierarchies, ideologies, constructions, classifications, histories, prejudices and other bad habits of the West",  there was a shift in textiles after ''The Subversive Stitch'' was published.
{{quote|text="Then in 1984 when Rozsika Parker's ''The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine'', focusing on textiles, could not be resisted by even the most conservative of Western practitioners; modernism was finally disrupted in the Low Art sphere. The empowering implications spread beyond European textile artists and affected curators, teachers, and art administrators in a much wider Western context. The post-modern influence, even though in only a few instances, started to blend the firmly drawn lines of hierarchical distinctions. Twenty years after I had taken up art as my vocation, I began to feel the oppositional codes of the [[separate spheres]] slowly eroding as I wrote my thesis and investigated the domestication of tapestry from its previous high art status (until about the turn of the century) as a European male practice.|sign=Ann Newdigate|source=''Kinda art, sorta tapestry: tapestry as shorthand access to the definitions, languages, institutions, attitudes, hierarchies, ideologies, constructions, classifications, histories, prejudices and other bad habits of the West'', New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies. Page 178.}}

===Craftivism within fiber arts===
[[Craftivism]] is the continuation of craft for political purposes by women. It's largely linked to [[third-wave feminism]] and also other Feminist movements such as the music movement [[Riot Grrrl]]. The term craftivism was coined by Betsy Greer in 2003, and runs Craftivist Collective, however it is technically not a new term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://craftivist-collective.com/our-story/ |title=Our Story |website=craftivist-collective.com |accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Germaine Greer]], of who advocates for the connection of women, nature, and craft. She argued that women's craft should be in the home because it is a living art, not in a gallery or museum because it is a dead male culture, supporting the use of textiles in different settings, of which craftivism almost always employs.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

===Fiber arts today===
In texts such as ''Hoopla: The art of Unexpected Embroidery'', written by Leanne Prain, she interviews fiber artists from all around the world working with different styles and materials about their contemporary practices within contemporary art and commercial design. The book is a documentation of interviews with many different fiber artists from around the world. All of the interviews are tailored to each different artist, however one question that Leanne Prain keeps asking is "Do you believe that your gender or social class has any bearing on your attraction to and involvement with needlework?". Many artists in the book do identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Prain, Leanne. Hoopla: The art of Unexpected Embroidery. Arsenal Pulp Press. Vancouver, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, not all fiber artists are feminists, even with its histories. In a review written by Karen Rosenberg about "Pricked: Extreme Embroidery" at the Museum of Arts and Design (January-April 2008), she states that it sounded like curators wanted to avoid the word 'craft' and describe these works by addressing process and materiality, of which sound "less dated". Rosenberg states that the most powerful argument against needlework as craft is the employment of threads as paint and painting or at least addressing painterly gesture. Rosenberg states that all of the artists exhibiting are attempting to blur the distinction between the decorative arts and the fine arts. However, Karen Rosenberg also critiques that the works were situated too close to each other, referring to the display as looking like a booth at a craft fair, so the success of leaving those associations behind has not been accomplished yet.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Karen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/arts/design/28embr.html?_r=0 "Needling More Than the Feminist Consciousness"], ''The New York Times'', 28 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine, Kate Walker is quoted saying that she has {{quote|text=”never worried that embroidery's association with femininity, sweetness, passivity and obedience may subvert my work's feminist intention. Femininity and sweetness are part of women's strength. Passitivity and obedience, moreover, are the very opposite of the qualities necessary to make a sustained effort in needlework. What's required are physical and mental skills, fine aesthetic judgment in colour, texture and composition; patience during long training; and assertive individuality of design (and consequent disobedience of aesthetic convention). Quiet strength need not be mistaken for useless vulnerability."|sign=[[Kate Walker (artist)|Kate Walker]]|source=''[[Rozsika Parker]], The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine''. 1984. Print}}

The overall tone of the textile and fiber arts today sounds usually similar to feminist theory and strategy when Ann Newdigate states:
{{quote|text="For me, now, it does not matter whether what I do in my studio complies with a minor or a major language – whether it is kinda art or sorta textile. Whenever I feel a definition coming on , I try to remember to ask myself 'Who constructed the definition?', 'Who needs the oppositional distinctions and is going to benefit from them?', and 'Why should I comply with those codes and conventions?”|sign=Ann Newdigate|source='' Kinda art, sorta tapestry: tapestry as shorthand access to the definitions, languages, institutions, attitudes, hierarchies, ideologies, constructions, classifications, histories, prejudices and other bad habits of the West'', New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies, page 181}}In 2013, Canadian artist, [[Colleen Heslin]] won national recognition for her piece ''Almost Young and Wild and Free'' which was praised for its "fresh approach to a traditional medium" using textiles and craftwork to produce a colourful, abstract canvas of dyed materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|first=|year=2014|title=Reel Artists|url=|journal=Canadian Art|volume=30.4|pages=46|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">'''Film analysis''' is the process in which a [[film]] is analyzed in terms of [[mise-en-scène]], [[cinematography]], [[sound]], and [[editing]].  One way of analyzing films is by the shot-by-shot analysis, though that is typically used only for small clips or scenes. Film analysis is closely connected to [[film theory]].

Different authors suggest various approaches to film analysis. [[Jacques Aumont]] and [[Michel Marie]] in their publication Analysis of Film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L’Analyse des films/Analysis of Film|year=1988|publisher=Nathan|author=Aumont Jacques|author2=Michele Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose several key points regarding film analysis. (1) There is general method of film analysis, (2) film analysis can never be concluded as there will always be something more to explore and (3) it is necessary for one to have knowledge about film history in order to perform a film analysis. They recognize various types of approaches: (1) Text-based film analysis (structural approach), (2) topic based analysis (narrative approach), (3) picture and sound approach (iconic analysis), (4) psychoanalytical approach and (5) historical approach.

Another methodology is suggested by Thomas and Vivian Sobchack in their publication Introduction to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Film|year=1997|publisher=Longman|isbn=067339302X|author=Thomas Sobchack|author2=Vivian Sobchack}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest viewer can observe following elements: (1) analysis of film space, (2) analysis of film time and (3) film sound. As they focus mainly on iconic aspects of film they further propose additional elements: the image, tone, composition and movement.

==Iconic analysis==
Iconic analysis basically deals with [[image]] or [[picture]] (and sometimes also film sound). In iconic analysis we try to understand how different pictorial elements convey the meaning of film. There are several examples in [[film history]] where image was even more than just key element of film (i.e. pre WWII avant-garde films, [[Italian neorealism]], [[film noir]], etc.). However today in most narrative films ([[Fictional film]]) we try to hide [[pictorial elements]] from [[audience]] and mask them behind the [[Narrative|story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Film|year=1997|publisher=Longman|isbn=067339302X|author=Thomas Sobchack|author2=Vivian Sobchack}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such films it is usually difficult (if not event pointless) to analyze image as such. We therefore more often tend to observe various other elements like light, camera movement (see [[Cinematography]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] etc. and try to understand how these elements influence or cross-reference other elements of film, like story, mood etc. As iconic analysis derives from single image and it is closely related to techniques of film production thus demanding at least brief understanding of these technical elements of film it is mostly useful method of research for film schools and other educational institutions. Film critics tend not use this method as a “stand alone” approach, but they rather use it as a part of other analysis method.

==Semiotic analysis==
Semiotics (also called semiotic studies and in the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called semiology) is the study of meaning-making, the philosophical theory of signs and symbols. This includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes ([[semiosis]]), indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of [[linguistics]], which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of [[language]] more specifically. As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign systems]]. Semiotics often is divided into three branches:
[[Semantics]] is the relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their ''denotata'', or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. [[Syntax|Syntactics]] is relations among signs in formal structures. [[Pragmatics]] is the relation between signs and sign-using agents.

==Psychoanalytical approach==
Ancient Greek philosophy's "overturning of mythology"&lt;ref&gt;Love, Page 53, By Wikipedians&lt;/ref&gt; as a definition to understanding of the heightened [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., Eroticism p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] takes an almost [[transcendent (philosophy)|transcendent]] manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: "the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty".&lt;ref&gt;"The Symposium", in Benjamin Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shot by shot analysis==
This is a written description of a given sequence in a film in order of the shots.  According to Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, when doing shot-by-shot analysis, we start with describing the techniques used in the shots or images we are analyzing. After that, we also need to elaborate what effects these techniques can produce when viewing the movie; for example, camera leads what we see in the film so the changes in camera angles have impact on audience's interpretations of the meanings the movie tries to convey. Some of the techniques used in film producing could be composition (foreground/background, frame/raming, etc.), [[cinematography]] ([[close-up]], [[medium shot]] and [[long shot]], pan shot, tilt shot, etc.), editing ([[montage (filmmaking)|montage]], [[eyeline match]], etc.), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Michael, and Melissa Lenos. ''An Introduction to Film Analysis: Technique and Meaning in Narrative Film.'' London: Continuum, 2012. Print. {{ISBN|9780826430021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments from internet-based film analysts==
A number of varied film analysis approaches have emerged and gained popularity on the internet such as those by [[Red Letter Media]] and Rob Ager.&lt;ref&gt;Quercia, Jacopo Della. "Six pop culture mysteries that were solved by fans" http://www.cracked.com/article_19684_6-pop-culture-mysteries-that-were-solved-by-fans.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wook, Kim. Time Entertainment. "29 movie head-scratchers explained" http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/13/hollywood-mystery-solved-29-movie-head-scratchers-explained/slide/the-thing/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 [[Room 237]], a documentary showcasing a variety of such interpretations of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s horror film [[The Shining (film)|The Shining]], was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and generated wide media coverage followed by a distribution deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Leffler | first=Rebecca | title=Cannes 2012: Michel Gondry’s 'The We &amp; The I' to Open Director's Fortnight | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michel-gondry-cannes-film-festival-directors-fortnight-314985 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate=2012-04-25 | date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 Selection |url=http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/2012-selection-h201.html |work=[[Directors' Fortnight]] |publisher=quinzaine-realisateurs.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426224019/http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/2012-selection-h201.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has since generated considerable comment and debate from film critics and film communities.&lt;ref&gt;Vanairsdale, S.T.

[[File:Flag of Slovakia vertical (gabbe).jpg|thumb|right|When flown vertically the coat of arms is rotated. This is the reverse side.]]

The current form of the [[national flag|national]] '''flag of Slovakia''' was adopted by [[Slovakia]]'s Constitution, which came into force on 3 September 1992. The flag, [[Pan-Slavic colors|in common]] with other [[Slavs|Slavic]] nations, uses the colors white, blue and red.

==History==
Slovakia's flag in its current form (but with another coat of arms on it or without any arms) can be dated back to the revolutionary year 1848{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} (see: ''[[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas]]''). It was also used semi-officially in [[Czechoslovakia]] before [[World War II]], by the [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovak Republic]] during [[World War II]].

In 1990, the Interior Ministry tasked [[Ladislav Čisárik]], a painter and heraldic artist, and [[Ladislav Vrtel]], an expert in heraldry, with creating a new coat of arms and national flag.&lt;ref name=teraz/&gt;&lt;ref name=sme&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Zomrel autor slovenských národných symbolov Ladislav Čisárik ml. |url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20618149/zomrel-autor-slovenskych-narodnych-symbolov-ladislav-cisarik-ml.html |work=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]] |publisher= |date=2017-08-03 |accessdate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ssp&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcela|last=Glevická|title=How the national emblem appeared – including so far secret communism designs |url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20460586/how-the-national-emblem-appeared-including-so-far-secret-communism-designs.html |work=[[The Slovak Spectator]] |publisher= |date=2017-02-16 |accessdate=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čisárik and Vrtel based their designs for a modern coat of arms and flag on an existing 14th Century coat of arms.&lt;ref name=teraz/&gt;&lt;ref name=sme/&gt; However, Čisárik and Vrtel chose to enlarge the double cross three times to emphasize it as a national symbol.&lt;ref name=teraz/&gt;&lt;ref name=sme/&gt; In addition to the national coat of arms and the national flag, the duo also designed a new presidential standard, which incorporates the double cross as well.&lt;ref name=teraz/&gt;&lt;ref name=sme/&gt;

The new flag was finally adopted (initially without Čisárik's and Vrtel's coat of arms) on 1 March 1990 as the flag of the Slovak Republic within Czechoslovakia. The coat of arms was added on 3 September 1992 and a special law describing the details of the flag followed in February 1993.

==Design==
Since the Slovak flag without the coat of arms is identical to the current [[Flag of Russia|flag of the Russian Federation]], and can also be compared to the modern [[flag of Slovenia]], the [[Constitution of Slovakia]] added the [[Coat of arms of Slovakia|national coat of arms]] in September 1992.

'''Henrietta Hodson''' (26 March 1841 – 30 October 1910) was an English actress and theatre manager best known for her portrayal of comedy roles in the [[Victorian era]].  She had a long affair with the journalist-turned-politician [[Henry Labouchère]], later marrying him.

==Biography==
Hodson was born at Upper Marsh in St Mary's parish, [[Westminster]], London. She was the eldest daughter of George Alfred Hodson (1822–1869), an Irish-born comedian, singer and innkeeper, and Henrietta Elizabeth Noel, an actress and singer. Her two sisters, Kate (later Mrs Charles Henry Fenton, but known on stage as Kate Gordon) and Sylvia (Mrs J. Stripling Blythe), were also actresses. Hodson's cousin was the theatre producer [[George Musgrove]].&lt;ref&gt;Gittins, Jean.

=== Early career ===
Hodson made her first professional stage appearance at the Theatre Royal, [[Glasgow]], in 1858. In 1860, she and [[Henry Irving]] worked together in [[Manchester]] in ''The Spy, or, A Government Appointment''.  She joined J. H. Chute's Bath and Bristol companies in 1861 and built a reputation as a popular soubrette and [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] actress.  An 1883 ''[[New York Times]]'' article calls her "the cleverest [[Aladdin]] in [[H. J. Byron]]'s piece I remember to have seen."&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/01/17/106245396.pdf "London Facts and Gossips"], ''The New York Times'', 17 January 1883&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, at the Theatre Royal in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, she played the role of [[Oberon]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' under the management of [[Madge Kendal|Madge Robertson]] (later Mrs Kendal), who also starred in the play, and [[Ellen Terry]].  There she also played the title role in the burlesque ''Endymion''.  In 1864, she married Richard Walter Pigeon, a solicitor and widower from [[Bristol]], England, who had several children, and left the stage.  They had one child, George Walter Noel Pigeon, born in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k104/samesizedfeet/Picture2-1.png Baptisim record from International Genealogical Index v. 5.0, British Isles], FamilySearch&lt;/ref&gt; Hodson left her husband, amid rumours of abuse, and returned to acting, using her maiden name.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k104/samesizedfeet/freemandsDecember191871.png Information from the ''Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser'' (Dublin, Ireland, December 19, 1871, p. 4, col. 5) about an 1870 lawsuit in which Hodson's husband attempted to wrest control from her of the Royalty Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Hodson made her London début at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] under the management of [[Marie Wilton]] (later Lady Bancroft) and H. J. Byron, as Prometheus in Byron's Christmas show, ''Pandora's Box, or, The Young Spark and the Old Flame''.&lt;ref name=Pascoe&gt;Pascoe, Charles E. (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jm0BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 "Hodson, Henrietta."], ''Our actors and actresses. The dramatic list'' (1880), pp. 180–81, David Bogue, London, accessed 25 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], Irving, [[J. L. Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]] and Terry, Hodson joined a new company at [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]], and opened with [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Double Marriage'', in which Hodson played the small role of Jacintha.  About 1868, she moved in with [[Henry Labouchère]],&lt;ref name=Genealogy&gt;[http://www.labouchere.co.uk/linkpages/labbyanddora.htm "Labby and Dora"]. labouchere.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; a member of parliament and later a journalist and playwright, who was one of the founders of Queen's Theatre, but they could not marry until years later when her first husband died.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Other roles that season included Arabella Fotheringay in ''The First Night'', Lucy in Byron's ''Dearer than Life'' and in the same author's ''The Lancashire Lass'', and the title role in ''Oliver Twist''.  In addition to roles in other Byron pieces, she acted at Queen's in various [[extravaganza]]s and burlesques, including ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''The Stranger'' by [[Robert Reece]], ''The Gnome King'' by William Brough, the successful ''The Turn of the Tide'' by [[F. C. Burnand]], and ''Twixt Axe and Crown'' by [[Tom Taylor]].  She stayed with that company for three years.&lt;ref name=Pascoe/&gt;

=== Later years ===
In 1870, she managed the [[Royalty Theatre]] for a season, playing in many of its pieces.  She starred in Reece's ''Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat'' and other burlesques.  Back at Queen's Theatre, she played [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] in ''[[The Tempest]]'' and Imogen in ''[[Cymbeline]]''.  In 1871 she began to manage the Royalty again, starring there in ''The Honeymoon'' as Juliana.  She instituted the innovation of using a hidden orchestra below the stage.  Also in 1871, she played Lady Amaranth in [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keefe's]] ''Wild Oats'', followed by such roles as Nydia the blind girl in [[John Oxenford]]'s version of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton's]] ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1872), Dick Wastrell in ''Old London'', adapted from ''Les Chevaliers du Brouillard'' (1873; a French dramatisation of ''[[Jack Sheppard]]''), and Jane Theobald in Gilbert's ''Ought We to Visit Her?'' (1874).&lt;ref name=Pascoe/&gt; During that play, she quarrelled with Gilbert, threatened him with legal action when he described the quarrel to others, and demanded a written apology, which she then made public.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 104–05&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 in [[Liverpool]], Hodson created the title character of Clytie in [[Joseph Hatton]]'s dramatisation of his novel of the same name.  That year she also created the lead role of Eliza Smith in [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Zoo]]'' in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/zoo/html/zoo_home.html G&amp;S Archive page on ''The Zoo'']&lt;/ref&gt; She repeated the role at the [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1876.  In 1877, she became the leading actress with the [[Haymarket Theatre]], then managed by [[John Baldwin Buckstone]].  There she played Cynisca in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]''.  Gilbert did not wish to cast her, but under her contract with the Haymarket, she insisted on taking the role and again threatened legal action.&lt;ref name=Ainger125&gt;Ainger, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The next Gilbert piece at the theatre was a revival of ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'', and Hodson insisted on playing a different role than the one Gilbert and Buckstone wished.&lt;ref name=Ainger125/&gt; Buckstone gave the actress notice that she would not be needed the next season.  Hodson blamed Gilbert and consulted her solicitor.  When he told her that she had no case, she instead complained of Gilbert's "persecution" of her and criticised his demanding directing methods in a pamphlet-letter circulated among theatre professionals.  Gilbert responded quickly with an open letter, setting forth a series of letters and references that showed inaccuracies in Hodson's statements.  This was published on 27 May 1877 in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', along with Hodson's rebuttal.  In the end, she did not appear in ''The Palace of Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=3 May 2011 }}, Retrieved on 12 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Hodson returned to Queen's Theatre as Dolores, Countess Rysoor, in Labouchère's ''Fatherland'', an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Patrie!''.  She retired from acting soon afterwards and lived in comfort at [[Alexander Pope]]'s Villa at Cross Deep [[Twickenham]], near London, with Labouchère.  However, in 1881, she tutored and mentored [[Lillie Langtry]] in her early stage work, accompanying Langtry to America the next year, although the two soon fell out, and Hodson returned to England.

In 1887, she finally married Labouchère, with whom she already had a daughter, Mary Dorothea (1884–1944).  In 1903 Hodson and her husband moved to Villa Christina, near [[Florence, Italy]].  She died there at the age of 69.  Her daughter, Mary Dorothea, married Carlo Emanuele Starabba, 2nd Marchese di Rudinì (the son of [[Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudinì]], prime minister of Italy) in 1903, then the Prince Gyalma Odescalchi De Szerem, and finally Don Eugenio [[Ruspoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Princess Eugene Ruspoli Obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 4 December 1944; p. 6, col. G&lt;/ref&gt; Hodson and Labouchère are buried at the cemetery of San Miniato al Monte, Florence.&lt;ref name=Genealogy/&gt;

The '''Hüseyindede vases''' are Early [[Hittites|Hittite]] vases decorated with reliefs, which were found in excavations at [[Hüseyindede Tepe]] near Yörüklü in the [[Turkey|Turkish]] province of [[Çorum Province|Çorum]]. There are fragments of four vases in total. Two of them were nearly complete and were able to be restored. They are on display in the [[Çorum Archaeological Museum]].

== Discovery ==
During site inspections by the Turkish archaeologists Tunç Sipahi und Tayfun Yıldırım in 1996, sherds of Early [[Hittites|Hittite]] pottery were found on the surface on the south side of Hüseyindede Tepe among other things. During an emergency excavation in 1997 and further regular excavations from 1998 in collaboration with the Çorum Archaeological Museum, fragments of earthenware pottery and parts of four distinct Hittite relief vases were brought to light. Two of them were found in an ancient storeroom; the other two amongst the surrounding debris.&lt;ref name="Y2001"&gt;Yıldırım, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–62.&lt;/ref&gt; They were restored in the museum. Vase B, the smaller one, which includes an image frieze, was published by Sipahi in 2001, while the restoration of Vase A, which has four image friezes, was still ongoing.&lt;ref name="Sipahi2001ab"&gt;Sipahi, 2001a &amp; b.&lt;/ref&gt; Vase A was finally published in 2002 by Yıldırım, at the Hittitology congress in [[Ankara]].&lt;ref name="Y2005"&gt;Yıldırım, 2005, pp. 761–774&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Hittite relief vases have been known since the excavations of [[Boğazkale|Boğazköy]] (the Hittite capital of [[Hattusa]]). Fragments have also been found at [[Alishar Hüyük|Alişar]], [[Alaca Höyük]], Eskiyapar, Kabaklı, Elbistan-Karahöyük und [[Kaman-Kalehöyük]]. They have generally been dated to the early period of the Hittite Empire, in the first quarter of the second millennium BC. The sole reconstructed example was a four frieze vase from [[İnandıktepe]], which is on display in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in Ankara, and a fragment with three friezes from Bitik. The motifs depicted on these vases consist of ritual activities, offering scenes, and festivals with acrobats, dancers and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Seeher, 2011, 382–3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The clay of the vases is mixed with gold [[mica]], which is normal in Hittite pottery. They were turned on a [[potter's wheel]]. After they were turned, figures made of high-quality clay were attached to the surface of the vases, in friezes. The surfaces were hatched to encourage adhesion. The resulting composition consists of red, black and cream coloured clays.&lt;ref name="Y2001" /&gt;

=== Vase A ===
[[File:HüseyindedeVaseA-gesamt.webm|thumb|Rotating view of Vase A]]
[[File:HüseyindedeVaseA-Stierköpfe.jpg|thumb|Bulls' heads on the upper lip]]
Vase A is an example of the Bitik-İnandık-Type, which is to say that it has four bands of frieze. It is 86&amp;nbsp;cm high, 50&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and has four handles.  These seem to be the usual dimensions for vases of this type. The upper lip is a tube of clay broken up by a small basin and four bulls' head [[protome]]s facing inwards. Liquid might have been poured into the basin in the course of offering ceremonies; from the basin it would flow out of the bull protome's mouth and into the vessel. This structure is also typical of the Bitik-İnandık vase type and is also known from [[rhyton|rhyta]] from [[Kültepe]].&lt;ref name="Y20028" /&gt;

The two lower friezes are divided into four scenes by the handles. The bottom frieze shows four bulls facing in alternate directions, with their heads lowered towards the ground. They are generally linked to the local weather god. Their dynamic posture is unique in Hittite iconography of this time and contrasts with other depictions in which they are led away to be sacrificed. They support the scene above on their shoulders, a feature seen also in seal impressions, a bronze plate from Alaca Höyük, and an ivory plaque from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]. The four scenes of the second layer show an offering procession for a god. The first three images probably show people bringing a [[roe deer]], a [[red deer]] and a ram. The two deer are led by a rope by men with a short kilt, while the ram is led by a man at its side. In front of the ram there are two other men, probably priests, in a pose of prayer. In the fourth scene of this layer, the god is shown at right, seated on a high-backed chair, with a worshiper and a musician playing the [[lyre]] in front of him. A similar scene is seen on the İnandık vase, but in that case the object of worship is the weather god in the form of a bull, as also on the [[orthostates|orthostate]] reliefs from Alaca Höyük.&lt;ref name="Y20028" /&gt;

The third frieze, which is the widest and most elaborate, shows another procession, which in this case leads to a temple and an altar. The mudbricks of the temple building are shown in different coloured clays.Objects on the roof are probably altars, though Yıldırım alternatively suggests that they are decorative objects or a railing. To the right of the temple, there is an altar, which also recalls the Alaca Höyük orthostate reliefs. Several people approach the building from the left. The last of these is a musician who plays a string instrument which looks a lot like the Turkish [[Bağlama]]. In front of him is a woman with a pair of [[cymbal]]s in her hands. Three women with cult objects precede her. The objects held by the two leftmost women cannot be identified, but Yıldırım thinks the third women has a type of incense burner which is mentioned in Hittite texts about religious rituals. The procession is led by two men with swords. The final scene in the third frieze, right of the altar, is remarkable. It shows two female figures sitting next to each other on a bed, with a man standing next to it holding up a bowl. The right woman seems to be helping the other with her jewellery or makeup. The left woman, dressed in black, might be a queen or goddess. A possible connection has been suggested with a [[Hieros gamos]]. In that case, the standing man would be the divine or royal bridegroom. But we can only speculate about the identity of the depicted individuals, since they have no identifying attributes. According to another interpretation, the left figure is a sculpture, like another sitting figure in a carriage in the uppermost frieze. Textual evidence records that statues in temples were decorated on ceremonial occasions and led in processions.&lt;ref name="Y20028" /&gt;

The fourth and uppermost frieze of the vase is missing a large piece, but depicts another procession. An ox-drawn carriage transports two individuals: a priest and a goddess (or, as mentioned above, a statue of a goddess) who sit on the raised area at the back. The middle part of the carriage, which probably had ritual implements hidden under a cover, is missing. Further to the right, the ox's head and horns are visible, along with the yoke, which is held by a man who guides the animal. The other figures on this level are musicians: two men who play lutes, a woman with cymbals and a female dancer.  A male figure, who wears a quiver-like item on his back, is not fully preserved.&lt;ref name="Y20028"&gt;Yıldırım 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;591–600 &amp; 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;837–850&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vase B ===
[[File:HüseyindedeVaseB-Fries.webm|thumb|Rotating view of the frieze on Vase B]]
[[File:HüseyindedeVaseB-Stierspringer.jpg|thumb|Bull-leaping scene]]
Vase B has no handles and at 52&amp;nbsp;cm in height is smaller than Vase A. It has only one frieze, running around the neck, under the projecting rim of the vase. As a result of fire damage after the vase was smashed, the colours have been altered. The original red and cream colours have turned into dark browns, reds and blacks. Only one fragment of the frieze, showing a woman with cymbals, retains the original colours. The band of images is between 7 and 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm high and is 52&amp;nbsp;cm long. It depicts an acrobatic scene, accompanied by musicians and dancers.&lt;ref name="Sipahi2001ab" /&gt;

According to the general view, two frontally depicted women are to be understood as the left margin of the whole scene. They have their hands on their hips and wear long, sweeping dresses with some kind of variegated apron. Sipahi considers them to be dancers, leading a circle dance, similar to the [[Yalli]] practiced in modernday East Turkey. A woman and a man playing cymbals come after them. This instrument which is identified with the ''galgaturi'' of Hittite texts by [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]] (among others), is a common motif in Hittite art, especially on relief vases. Usually the instrument is shown being played by women; the depiction of a male player here is unusual. The next figure is a male musician with a long-necked lute, similar to the modern Saz, which commonly appears on Early Hittite relief vases. The next two men are not fully preserved, but appear to be squatting with cymbals in their hands. The position of their legs suggests a dancing movement. Then there is another standing musician, with only part of the head and the hands holding a cymbal preserved. After that comes the main scene of the frieze.&lt;ref name="Sipahi2001ab" /&gt;

This central scene shows three acrobats [[bull-leaping|jumping over a bull]]. The bull faces right and is held by a man with a halter. This man holds an object in his right hand, possibly for providing a rhythm to the performers. Of the leftmost bull-leaper, only arms and the head are preserved. By comparison with similar vases from İnandık and Boğazköy it is assumed that he was shown springing up from a crouching position. A second man is shown doing a backflip, landing his feet on the hindquarters of the bull. The third leaper is shown leaping over the back of the bull. Since the positions of the three leapers are very different, they probably do not represent three phases of a single leap. Rather, they depict simultaneous action, with acrobats and dancers performing all around a quiescent bull. In this way the Hittite image differs from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] depictions of bull-leaping, which are well known from [[Knossos]]. In depictions from the Aegean athletes are shown jumping over a charging bull's head or flank, but in this case a ritual performance on and around a calm bull seems to be depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Taracha 2002, pp.7–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sipahi 2001b, pp.107–125&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fragments ===
Three additional fragments of a vase of the Bitik-İnandık-Type (i.e. with four friezes) show a male figure, probably a cook, with two-handled cooking pots of a type known from the [[Karum (trade post)|Assyrian trading colonies]] and the Hittite period. On the fragments of a distinct vase of the same type, a divinity, a lion and another figure are depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Yıldırım 2008, p.837&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''imperial phase''' is the period in which an artist is regarded to be at their commercial and creative peak simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Ewing"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tom|last=Ewig|date=May 28, 2010|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/poptimist/7811-poptimist-29/|title=Imperial|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Tom Ewing described three criteria for defining an artist's imperial phase: "command, permission, and self-definition". He defined "command" as an artist's ability to push the boundaries of their medium in a way that produces lasting change. "Permission" is the public's goodwill toward and interest in the artist's work. Finally, "self-definition" is the concept that the imperial phase defines the rest of the artist's career; future works will be compared to those from the imperial phase.&lt;ref name="Ewing" /&gt;

The '''International Architecture Awards''' are the oldest global awards for new architecture, landscape architecture, interiors and urban planning. The program was launched by the [[Chicago Athenaeum]] Museum of Architecture and Design in 2005 to honor and celebrate the most outstanding architecture designed and built or unbuilt throughout the world.

The International Architecture Awards are the only non-commercial, global, and public awards program given jointly by two not-for-profit Museums in the United States and Europe dedicated to public education concerning architecture and industrial design.

The Awards are also independent of any affiliation to a commercial trade organization such as the RIBA or AIA.

The Awards are also regarded internationally as the mark of excellence, recognizing the best global architecture practices, as well as the corporate clients, developers, state and local governments, institutions, general contractors that produced them.

The Program is open to all international architecture offices and U.S. firms with projects outside the United States. (U.S. submissions are judged annually for the American Architecture Award.

The awards are awarded annually at the end of September by the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design, and Metropolitan Arts Press Ltd. In 2009 the awards were presented in partnership with The European Center for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies.

The winning projects are selected by the international jury from a short list of several hundred international submissions from architectural practices around the world. 
The short-list is then judged by a jury of peer practitioners, educators, and architecture journalists and critics.  Juries have taken place in Dublin, Oslo, Stuttgart, Munich, Istanbul, Athens, Vilnius, Helsinki, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

All submitted projects are to be designed by architects in their respective countries of origin or abroad three years prior to the award year. For example, the deadline for submissions for the 2019 International Architecture Awards is December 1, 2018 for buildings designed and/or built between 2015-2018.
Categories include:  Skyscrapers, high rises, corporate offices and complexes, housing, schools, universities, institutions, museums, galleries, social housing, entertainment, libraries, restoration and renovations, restaurants, industrial buildings, private homes, sports and transportation buildings, infrastructure, energy facilities, civic and community buildings, expositions buildings, exhibits, religious buildings, public spaces, urban planning, and landscape architecture.

The awarded projects form an exhibition "The City and the World" that have toured inside Europe and South America including The International Biennial of Architecture Buenos Aires and The Istanbul Design Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Chicago Athenaeum: International Architecture Awards 2008  | work = | publisher = detail.de | date = | url = http://www.detail.de/artikel_athenaeum-chicago-award_22800_En.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023085045/http://www.detail.de/artikel_athenaeum-chicago-award_22800_En.htm|archive-date=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Finnish architects select 97 buildings in thirty nations to win the world's most prestigious 2009 International Architecture Awards| work = | publisher =Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design | date =September 21, 2009 | url = http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/intarch/2009/2009INTARCHSPRESSRELEASE.pdf| accessdate = 2010-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008195558/http://www.chi-athenaeum.org/intarch/2009/2009INTARCHSPRESSRELEASE.pdf |archive-date=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kenan &amp; Kel''''' is an American [[teen]] [[sitcom]] created by [[Kim Bass]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. It starred ''[[All That]]'' cast members [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A 'Honeymooners' For Kids|author=Hinman, Catherine|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-08-17/lifestyle/9608150907_1_kenan-and-kel-kenan-thompson-kel-mitchell|date=August 17, 1996|work=The Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 62 episodes and a [[Two Heads Are Better Than None|made-for-TV movie]] were produced over four seasons from 1996 to 2000. The first two seasons were filmed at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], and the remaining two were filmed at the [[Nickelodeon on Sunset|Nick on Sunset]] theater in [[Hollywood]].

''Kenan &amp; Kel'' received critical acclaim, with praise of the performance of the title characters. It won the "Favorite TV Show" award at the 1998 [[Kids Choice Awards]], and Thompson and Mitchell were ranked No. 40 and No. 39, respectively, on VH1's 100 Greatest Kid Stars. Reruns of the show are currently shown on TeenNick, as part of their programming block ''[[NickSplat]],'' as well as MTV2, a sister channel of TeenNick under Viacom.

==Premise==
The show was set in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and centered on the antics of two mischievous teenagers, Kenan Rockmore ([[Kenan Thompson]]) and Kel Kimble ([[Kel Mitchell]]). Kenan is a high school student with a job at a local grocery store, while Kel is his clumsy, [[orange soda]]-loving best friend.

Episodes of the series always open and closed with Kenan and Kel breaking the [[fourth wall]] by interacting with the studio audience, standing in front of a red curtain that is placed in front of the main set while they are still in character. A frequent running gag of the openings is Kel never knowing what the night's episode would be about and Kenan refusing to tell him. The closings would frequently feature Kenan coming up with a new scheme, often asking Kel to get various assorted items and meet him somewhere. Frazzled, Kel would exclaim his catchphrase, "Aww, here it goes!"

Another catchphrase commonly heard throughout the series is "WHYYYYYYY!?!?", usually screamed by Kenan after Kel does something stupid.

The theme song, entitled "Aw, Here It Goes", is performed by rapper [[Coolio]]. He is featured in the opening credits of the show along with Kenan and Kel. The lyrics describe the show and reference other famous duos such as [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]], [[Abbott &amp; Costello]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], and former [[Los Angeles Lakers]] teammates [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], as well as [[Nancy Drew]] and [[The Hardy Boys]].

==Production==
The series was created by Kim Bass (who also co-created the teen sitcom ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]''). It was reminiscent of the classic [[double act|comedic duo]] stylings of [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Martin and Lewis]] or Abbott and Costello (who were actually mentioned in the theme song), with Kenan being the straight man and Kel his comedic foil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenen, Kel Get a Show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-08-13/features/9608130309_1_smashing-pumpkins-nickelodeon-kenan-thompson|date=August 13, 1996|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was taped in front of a live-studio audience and ran from August 17, 1996&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0172OK1RI/|title=Kenan &amp; Kel Season 1|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to July 15, 2000&lt;ref name="amazon5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00MEYYLI2/|title=Kenan &amp; Kel Season 5|publisher=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, totaling 62 episodes. One full-length [[TV movie]] was created, entitled ''Two Heads Are Better Than None'', which aired on July 15, 2000, thus ending the series serving as its finale. The Kenan &amp; Kel characters also made a special guest appearance on the ''[[Cousin Skeeter]]'' two-part episode, "Hoo, I'm Wild Wild West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0549853/|title="Cousin Skeeter" The Hoo, I'm Wild Wild West: Part 1 (TV Episode 1999)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
Reruns of the series briefly aired on ''[[Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvschedulearchive.com/other/nick-gas/1999-030099.txt&lt;/ref&gt; After the series finished its run, reruns continued to air on Nickelodeon from January 21, 2001 to February 15, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvschedulearchive.com/nickelodeon/2004/020904.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

The series reran on [[TeenNick|The N]] (later known as TeenNick) from October 13, 2007, to August 2, 2009. It then returned to the channel from July 25, 2011, to February 3, 2013, and again from March 4, 2013, to May 31, 2014, as part of its ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'' programming block (later called [[The Splat]] and now called [[NickSplat]]), which continues to air sporadic reruns.

The '''Kentucky Foundation for Women'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfw.org KFW Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes feminist art and [[social justice]] by awarding grants to individual artists and organizations, providing time and space for artists and activists at its retreat center, sharing information, and building alliances.

The Kentucky Foundation for Women is a 501(c)3 private, independent foundation that was established in 1985 by author [[Sallie Bingham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salliebingham.com SallieBingham.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. At the time, Ms. Bingham's philanthropic gift of $10 million was the largest endowment to any women's fund in the United States. The mission of the Kentucky Foundation for Women is "to promote positive [[social change]] by supporting varied feminist expression in the arts."&lt;ref name="kfw.org"&gt;Kentucky Foundation for Women website http://www.kfw.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation funds two grant programs annually, they are ''Artist Enrichment'' and ''Arts Meets Activism''. Both grant programs are artist-centered, feminist in nature, and demonstrate high artistic quality. Applicants to both programs are expected to be able to express their commitment to [[feminism]] and their understanding of the relationship between art and social change.

Grant awards range from $1,000 to $7,500 per project. Social change, as defined by the foundation, includes "eliminating societal barriers to women: neutralizing discrimination against women based on age, ethnicity, [[sexual orientation]], physical ability, economic condition, and geographic origin; and producing actions, conditions, policies, attitudes, and behaviors that benefit women."&lt;ref&gt;"The Perfect Marriage" by Kopana Terry, ''Arts Across Kentucky Magazine'', Spring 2003, pages 55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1985 and 2005 the Kentucky Foundation for Women awarded 1298 grants to individuals and organizations totaling $7,140,831.

[[Image:Hopscotch House.JPG|left]]'''Hopscotch House''' is a program of the Kentucky Foundation for Women; it is first and foremost an artist retreat center for feminist artists. It is also used by a variety of groups and organizations that are working to better the lives of women and girls in Kentucky.

Hopscotch House was purchased by the Kentucky Foundation for Women in 1987 and was first used by a group of [[Women\'s fiction|women writers]] known as the Wolf Pen Writer's Colony. In the early 1990s Hopscotch House became available to other [[women artists]] and women's groups. Over the years, Hopscotch House has served hundreds of women including artists, activists, feminists, eco-feminists, art critique groups, drumming circles, quilting groups, social justice groups, girls' empowerment groups, arts organizations, and [[Social work|social service]] organizations.

The property is considered a "classic" Kentucky farmstead and is located 13 miles east of [[downtown Louisville]]. The house has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a library of women's literature and [[reference work]]s, a large living room/dining area, a sun room, and a deck. The large kitchen is fully furnished and well equipped so that residents can prepare their own meals. Separate studio space for artists is available upon request.&lt;ref name="kfw.org"/&gt;

==Other activities and support==

The Kentucky Foundation for Women has provided financial gifts for special projects such as the '''National Sculpture Conference: Works by Women''' held in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1987. The conference honored American women sculptors ages 67–88. The honorees were: [[Selma Burke]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], Clyde Connell, [[Dorothy Dehner]], Louise Bourgeois [https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/bourgeois/index.html], [[Claire Falkenstein]], Sue Fuller, Louise Nevelson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louisenevelsonfoundation.org/ Louise Nevelson Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claire Zeisler]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women Sculptors Have Their Say" by Elizabeth Bookser Barkley, ''Tristate Magazine, The Cincinnati Enquirer'', April 26, 1987, pages 3–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hot Flash Fan''', purchased by the foundation, was a collaborative project completed by more than 50 artists. "The project is a fan incorporating needlework, knotting, quilting, and painting in an expression of feelings associated with menopause."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00326 Chicago, Judy, 1939- . Papers, 1947-2004 (inclusive), 1957-2004 (bulk): A Finding Aid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lead artists for the project were: [[Judy Chicago]], facilitator; [[Ann Stewart Anderson]], originator and principal coordinating artist; Ada O'Connor, principal embroidery artist/coordinator; Judith Myers, quilting coordinator. The Hot Flash Fan was on display at the [[Water tower|Water Tower]], home of the Louisville Visual [[Art association|Art Association]], before being added to the Foundation's permanent collection.

The Kentucky Foundation for Women published 50 issues of the [[Literary magazine|literary journal]] '''''The American Voice''''', which featured international and Kentucky writers. The editor of the Pan-American journal was Frederick Smock and was published trianually from 1986 to 1999. During that time ''The American Voice'' published two stories that were awarded the [[Pushcart Prize]] that honors the best poetry, [[Short story|short fiction]], and essays published in the small presses. It was a feminist publication that was known for featuring works by well-known authors such as [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Isabel Allende]], and [[Reynolds Price]] alongside Kentuckians [[Wendell Berry]], [[James Still]], and [[Sena Jeter Naslund]]. The journal also nurtured the work of less established, home-grown talent and published early work by the award-winning poet Aleda Shirley, novelist [[Barbara Kingsolver]], playwright [[Naomi Wallace]], and children's author George Ella Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;"Editor aims to bring Kentucky into the literary mainstream" by Ira Simmons, ''The Courier-Journal'', May 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sallie Bingham Award===
The '''Sallie Bingham Award''' was established in 1996 to recognize individuals and groups who have made outstanding contributions toward changing the lives of Kentucky women through feminist expression in the arts. Recipients are given a $500 cash award, a [[Gold plating|gold-plated]] Ginko pin and plaque. The award is announced at KFW Day, an annual celebration held each fall at Hopscotch House.

'''''La Maison Cubiste''''' ('''''The Cubist House'''''), also called '''''Projet d'hôtel''''', was an architectural installation in the ''Art Décoratif'' section of the 1912 Paris ''[[Salon d'Automne]]'' which presented a [[Cubist]] vision of architecture and design.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Blau, Nancy J.

The facade was designed by the sculptor [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]].

==Description==
[[File:Raymond Duchamp-Villon, 1912, Maquette originale de La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House, Façade architecturale), Document du Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], original model of the ''architectural facade'' (destroyed)]]
''La Maison Cubiste'' had a 10 by 8 meter plaster facade with highly geometric trim,  behind which were two furnished rooms; a living room (''Salon Bourgeois'') and a bedroom.  Paintings by [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] were hung in the salon.&lt;ref name="The Sun" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1912nov30-01012?View=Search&amp;SearchView=PDFHits&amp;pages=1012 André Mare, ''Salon Bourgeois, Salon d'Automne'', The Literary Digest, ''Doom of the Antique'', New York City, November 30, 1912, p. 1012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"&gt;[https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/cubism-at-the-met-modern-art-that-looks-tragically-antique-157075 Ben Davis, ''"Cubism" at the Met: Modern Art That Looks Tragically Antique'', Exhibition: "Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection", Metropolitan Museum of Art, ArtNet News, 6 November 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of spectators at the salon passed through the full-scale model.&lt;ref name="La Maison Cubiste, 1912"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324a.html La Maison Cubiste, 1912] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313233214/http://www.kubisme.info/kt324a.html |date=2013-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an early example of ''art décoratif'', a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Cubism now was recognized as significant to a broad range of applications, beyond the bounds of fine art. The movement opened the way toward new possibilities, a modern geometrical vision that could be adapted to architecture, interior design, graphic arts, fashion and industrial design; the basis of [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref name="news.artnet.com"/&gt;

[[File:La Maison Cubiste, Le Salon Bourgeois, Salon d'Automne, 1912, Paris.jpg|thumb|260px|''Le Salon Bourgeois'', designed by [[André Mare]] inside ''La Maison Cubiste'', in the decorative arts section of the Salon d'Automne, 1912, Paris. Metzinger's ''[[Femme à l'Éventail]]'' on the left wall]]
Mare called the living room in which Cubist paintings were hung the ''Salon Bourgeois''. Léger described this name as 'perfect'. In a letter to Mare prior to the exhibition Léger writes: "Your idea is absolutely splendid for us, really splendid. People will see Cubism in its domestic setting, which is very important."&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

The facade of the house (''Façade architecturale''), designed by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished in a bourgeois, colorful, and rather traditional manner, particularly compared with the paintings.  The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine ''Art et Décoration'':  "He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety.  He achieves it."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=52}} The Cubist element was provided by the paintings.  Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=54}}  This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]], New York, Chicago and Boston.&lt;ref name="Goss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/frdc/hd_frdc.htm|title=French Art Deco|author=Goss, Jared|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt315s.html Kubistische werken op de Armory Show]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/detail-duchampvillons-faade-architecturale-14604 Raymond Duchamp-Villon, listed in catalog of the New York Armory Show exhibit as number 609, ''Facade architectural, plaster'', 1913, unidentified photographer.

==Cubist theory==

Metzinger and Gleizes in ''Du "Cubisme"'', written during the assemblage of ''La Maison Cubiste'', described the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work was called the "antithesis of the picture". "The true picture" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, "bears its ''raison d'être'' within itself. It can be moved from a church to a [[drawing-room]], from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, excerpt from ''Du Cubisme'', 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

"Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye".&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;
For the occasion, an article entitled ''Au Salon d'Automne "Les Indépendants"'' was published in the French newspaper ''Excelsior'', 2 Octobre 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Salon d'Automne 1912, page from ''Excelsior'' reproduced]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Excelsior (journal)|Excelsior]] was the first publication to privilege photographic illustrations in the treatment of news media; shooting photographs and publishing images in order to tell news stories. As such ''L'Excelsior'' was a pioneer of [[photojournalism]].

[[Walter Pach]], president of the landmark 1913 exhibition known as the Armory Show, wrote a pamphlet for the occasion, "A Sculptor’s Architecture", in which he discussed Duchamp–Villon’s ''La Maison Cubiste'' as exemplary of a new architectural style for the modern era.&lt;ref name="Cubist room" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pach"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/items/detail/sculptors-architecture-14573 Walter Pach, ''A sculptor's architecture'', 1913, Published by the Association of American Painters and Sculptors. Kuhn family papers, and Armory Show records, 1859-1984, bulk 1900-1949. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution]&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]his work of M. Duchamp-Villon's is an example of what possibilities are contained in a style like the present one whose philosophy is a base", writes Pach, "not a limitation." Continuing, Pach writes, "His work in architecture is by no means a turning aside from his sculpture, but a furthering of it. In the present facade he has simply a "subject" whose organization was to be developed from the forms suggested by a man or woman."&lt;ref name="Pach" /&gt;

When the art collector Michael Stein, brother of [[Gertrude Stein]], first introduced the work of Duchamp-Villon to Pach, he noted that it would be "admirably suited to the needs of building with concrete". Pach agreed. But speaking with the sculptor convinced Pach that this style had its first application to building with stone, and that it emerged from "an appreciation and solution of the new problem of steel and stone."&lt;ref name="Pach" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The final word I would speak about this architecture is its quality of response to the needs of America. We have yet enormous areas that will be built up into cities, we are going to tear down and rebuild most of the edifices, that already exist. With the freedom that this order gives to individual development and with its possibilities of expansion to make it suit the largest building as well as the smallest, it seems to clearly fix the type of our ideal. Before a photograph of the sky-scrapers of Manhattan Island, Raymond Duchamp-Villon said that he saw the possibilities of the modern cathedral. (Walter Pach, 1913)&lt;ref name="Pach" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==

Chochol was one of three Czech architects (members of the [[Mánes Union of Fine Arts]]), with [[Pavel Janák]] and [[Josef Gočár]], influenced by Cubism]]
It is difficult to measure the influence of the Maison Cubiste.  No actual house following the same design was ever built, and later Deco and modernist residences followed very different models.   However, the house was a great success in emphasizing the role of Cubism as an alternative to traditional art and design.  Mare joined ranks with furniture designer [[Louis Süe]] to form the design company ''Atelier Français'', which became one of he most important furniture manufacturers in Paris, helping to develop the early [[Art Deco]] furniture style.  The scandal in the press caused by the paintings displayed there was a major contributor to the popularity of Cubist art. Thanks largely to the popularity of the exposition, the term "Cubist" began to be applied to anything modern, from women's haircuts to clothing to theater performances.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=54}}

[[Le Corbusier]] had reportedly been enthused by ''La Maison Cubiste'' during the 1912 exhibition. "He saw in it important solutions for the problem of building with cement." Le Corbusier subsequently exhibited his model for ''Maison Citrohan'' (a mass production prototype) at the Salon d'Automne of 1922.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WXuEAwKcSQC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=raymond+duchamp-villon,+%22cubist+house%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2hs3T3cDPAhXEUBQKHVFbBmYQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=raymond%20duchamp-villon%2C%20%22cubist%20house%22&amp;f=false Alice T.

No buildings like the Cubist House were built in France, but the model did have an impact in Czechoslovakia (now the [[Czech Republic]]) then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], where architects wanted to show their independence from the Viennese style.  In 1913 the Czech architect [[Pavel Janák]] was commissioned to reconstruct the facade of a large baroque house, the Fara House in the town of Pelhrimov in south Bohemia,   in the cubist style. Janák redid the baroque facade by adding angular geometric forms similar to those on the model of the cubist house in Paris.  Because of this quest for architectural independence from Austria,  many art deco houses, mostly in the later more typical Deco style, are found in Prague and other cities in the Czech Republic.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=191-192}}

A '''megalith''' is a large [[Rock (geology)|stone]] that has been used to construct a structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. The word '''''megalithic''''' describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar or concrete, representing periods of [[prehistory]] characterised by such constructions. For later periods, the word ''[[monolith]]'', with an overlapping meaning, is more likely to be used.

The word ''megalith'' comes from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|μέγας}}'' ([[transliteration]] ''mégas'', meaning "great") and ''{{lang|grc|λίθος}}'' (transliteration ''líthos'' meaning "stone"). ''Megalith'' also denotes one or more rocks hewn in definite shapes for special purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early stone complexes in eastern Turkey==
[[File:Göbekli_Tepe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Göbekli Tepe]]
At a number of sites in eastern Turkey, large ceremonial complexes from the [[9th millennium BC]] have been discovered.&lt;ref name="ArchMag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov–Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They belong to the incipient phases of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Large circular structures involving carved megalithic [[orthostat]]s are a typical feature; e.g. at [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]]. Although these structures are the most ancient megalithic structures known so far, it is not clear that any of the European Megalithic traditions (see below) are actually derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S. (2003), ''After the Ice - A Global Human History, 21,000-5,000 BC'', London, 62-71&lt;/ref&gt; At Göbekli Tepe, four stone circles have been excavated from an estimated 20. Some measure up to 30 metres across. As well as human figures, the stones carry a variety of carved reliefs depicting boars, foxes, lions, birds, snakes and scorpions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/23/archaeology.turkey|title=7,000 years older than Stonehenge: the site that stunned archaeologists|first=Nicholas|last=Birch|date=22 April 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Eastern megaliths==
[[File:Atlit-Yam, Ritual structure made of stones, restoration.JPG|thumb|upright=1.10|Megalithic structure at [[Atlit Yam]], Israel]]
[[Dolmens]] and standing stones have been found in large areas of the Middle East starting at the [[Turkey|Turkish]] border in the north of [[Syria]] close to [[Aleppo]], southwards down to [[Yemen]]. They can be encountered in [[Lebanon]], Syria, [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The largest concentration can be found in southern Syria and along the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], however they are being threatened with destruction. They date from the late Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan; an introduction and field guide''. Amman, Jordan: The American Center of Oriental Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  Megaliths have also been found on [[Kharg Island]] and [[pirazmian]] in [[Iran]], at [[Barda Balka]] in [[Iraq]]. [[File:Smeisani, Amman, Jordan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Standing stone in [[Amman]], Jordan.]]
A semicircular arrangement of megaliths was found in Israel at [[Atlit Yam]], a site that is now under the sea. It is a very early example, dating from the [[7th millennium BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.400-atlityam-israel.html|title=Atlit-Yam, Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most concentrated occurrence of dolmens in particular is in a large area on both sides of the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], with greater predominance on the eastern side. They occur first and foremost on the [[Golan Heights]], the [[Hauran]], and in Jordan, which probably has the largest concentration of dolmen in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, only very few dolmen have been identified so far in the [[Hejaz]]. They seem, however, to re-emerge in Yemen in small numbers, and thus could indicate a continuous tradition related to those of [[Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]].

The standing stone has a very ancient tradition in the Middle East, dating back from [[Mesopotamia]]n times. Although not always 'megalithic' in the true sense, they occur throughout the [[Orient]], and can reach 5 metres or more in some cases (such as [[Al Karak|Ader]] in Jordan). This phenomenon can also be traced through many passages from the [[Old Testament]], such as those related to [[Jacob]], the grandson of [[Abraham]], who poured oil over a stone that he erected after his famous dream in which angels climbed to heaven (Genesis 28:10-22). Jacob is also described as putting up stones at other occasions, whereas [[Moses]] erected twelve pillars symbolizing the tribes of Israel. The tradition of venerating (standing) stones continued in [[Nabatean]] times and is reflected in, e.g., the Islamic rituals surrounding the [[Kaaba]] and nearby pillars.
Related phenomena, such as cupholes, rock-cut tombs and circles also occur in the Middle East.

==European megaliths==
[[File:Triangle megalith, Fondachelli Fantina Sicily,.JPG|thumb|Triangle megalith of Valle Levante, [[Fondachelli-Fantina]], Sicily]]
The most common type of megalithic construction in Europe is the [[portal tomb]] – a chamber consisting of upright stones ([[orthostat]]s) with one or more large flat capstones forming a roof. Many of these, though by no means all, contain human remains, but it is debatable whether use as burial sites was their primary function. The megalithic structures of [[Malta]] are believed to be the oldest in Europe, in particular [[Skorba Temples]]. Though generally known as ''dolmens'', the term most accepted by archaeologists is ''portal tomb''. However many local names exist, such as ''anta'' in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and Portugal, ''stazzone'' in [[Sardinia]], ''hunebed'' in the Netherlands, ''Hünengrab'' in Germany, ''dysse'' in Denmark, and ''cromlech'' in [[Wales]]. It is assumed that most portal tombs were originally covered by earthen mounds.

The second-most-common tomb type is the [[passage grave]]. It normally consists of a square, circular, or cruciform chamber with a slabbed or [[corbelling|corbelled]] roof, accessed by a long, straight passageway, with the whole structure covered by a circular mound of earth. Sometimes it is also surrounded by an external stone kerb. Prominent examples include the sites of [[Bru na Boinne|Brú na Bóinne]] and [[Carrowmore]] in Ireland, [[Maes Howe]] in [[Orkney]], and [[Gavrinis]] in France.
[[File:paulnabrone.jpg|left|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Poulnabrone dolmen|Poulnabrone portal tomb]], Ireland]]
The third tomb type is a diverse group known as [[gallery grave]]s. These are axially arranged chambers placed under elongated mounds. The Irish [[court tomb]]s, British [[long barrow]]s, and German ''Steinkisten'' belong to this group.

Another type of megalithic monument, the single standing stone, or [[menhir]] as it is known in France, is very common throughout Europe, where some 50,000 examples have been noted. Some of these are thought to have an astronomical function as a marker or foresight. In some areas, long and complex alignments of such stones exist, the largest known example being located at [[Carnac]] in [[Brittany]], France.

In parts of Britain and Ireland a relatively common type of megalithic construction is the [[stone circle]], of which examples include [[Stonehenge]], [[Avebury]], [[Ring of Brodgar]] and [[Beltany stone circle|Beltany]]. These, too, display evidence of astronomical alignments, both solar and lunar. Stonehenge, for example, is famous for its [[solstice]] alignment. Examples of stone circles are also found in the rest of Europe. The circle at [[Lough Gur]], near Limerick in Ireland has been dated to the Beaker period, approximately contemporaneous with Stonehenge. The stone circles are assumed to be of later date than the tombs, straddling the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]]s.

===Tombs===
[[File:hunebed-d27.jpg|thumb|Large T shaped ''Hunebed'' D27 in [[Borger-Odoorn]], Netherlands.]]
'''Megalithic tombs''' are aboveground burial chambers, built of large stone slabs (megaliths) laid on edge and covered with earth or other, smaller stones. They are a type of [[chamber tomb]], and the term is used to describe the structures built across [[Atlantic Europe]], the Mediterranean, and neighbouring regions, mostly during the [[Neolithic]] period, by Neolithic farming communities. They differ from the contemporary [[long barrow]]s through their structural use of stone.

There is a huge variety of megalithic tombs. The free-standing single chamber [[dolmen]]s and [[portal dolmen]]s found in [[Brittany]], Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, [[Wales]], and elsewhere consist of a large flat stone supported by three, four, or more standing stones. They were covered by a stone [[cairn]] or earth [[tumulus|barrow]].
[[File:Construcción megalito.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Construction of a megalith grave]]
[[File:Dolmenmontebubbonia.jpg|right|thumb|Dolmen of Monte Bubbonia ([[Sicily]])]]
In Italy, dolmens can be found especially in [[Sardinia]]. There are more than 100 dolmen dating to the Neolithic (3500–2700 BC) and the most famous is called ''Dolmen di Sa Coveccada'' (near [[Mores]] ). During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Nuragic civilization]] built c. 800 [[Giants' grave]], a type of megalithic [[gallery grave]] that can be found throughout [[Sardinia]] with different structures.  The earliest megalithic tombs in Sardinia are the circular graves of the so-called [[Arzachena culture]], also found in [[Corsica]], [[southern France]] and eastern Spain.

Dolmen are also in Apulia and in Sicily. In this latter region, they are small structures located in Mura Pregne ''([[Palermo]])'', Sciacca ''([[Agrigento]])'', Monte Bubbonia ''([[Province of Caltanissetta|Caltanissetta]])'', Butera ''(Caltanissetta)'', Cava Lazzaro ''([[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]])'', Cava dei Servi ''([[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]])'', Avola ''(Siracusa)'', [[Argimusco]] in [[Montalbano Elicona]] ([[Messina]]). Dating to the early Bronze Age (2200–1800 BC), the prehistoric Sicilian buildings were covered by a circular mound of earth. In the dolmen of ''Cava dei Servi'', the archaeologists found numerous human bone fragments and some splinters of Castelluccian ceramics ''(Early Bronze Age)'' which confirmed the burial purpose of the artefact.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Piccolo, ''op. cit.'', pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Megalito Aquila, Altopiano dell'Argimusco (ME).JPG|thumb|Eagle, one of the Megaliths of [[Argimusco]], [[Sicily]]]]

Examples with outer areas, not used for burial, are also known.  The [[Court Cairn]]s of southwest [[Scotland]] and northern Ireland, the [[Severn-Cotswold tomb]]s of southwest England and the [[Transepted gallery grave]]s of the [[Loire]] region in France share many internal features, although the links between them are not yet fully understood. That they often have antechambers or forecourts is thought to imply a desire on the part of the builders to emphasize a special [[ritual]] or physical separation of the dead from the living.
[[File:Tumulus Saint-Michel (2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Saint-Michel tumulus]], megalith grave in [[Brittany]]]]

The [[Passage grave]]s of [[Orkney]], Ireland's [[River Boyne|Boyne]] Valley, and north Wales are even more complex and impressive, with cross-shaped arrangements of chambers and passages. The workmanship on the stone blocks at [[Maeshowe]] for example is unknown elsewhere in northwest Europe at the time.

Megalithic tombs appear to have been used by communities for the long-term deposition of the remains of their dead, and some seem to have undergone alteration and enlargement. The organization and effort required to erect these large stones suggest that the societies concerned placed great emphasis on the proper treatment of their dead. The [[ritual]] significance of the tombs is supported by the presence of [[Pre-historic art|megalithic art]] carved into the stones at some sites. Hearths and deposits of pottery and animal bone found by archaeologists around some tombs also implies that some form of burial feast or sacrificial rites took place there.

Further examples of megalithic tombs include the stalled cairn at [[Midhowe Chambered Cairn|Midhowe]] in Orkney and the passage grave at [[Bryn Celli Ddu]] on [[Anglesey]]. There are also extensive grave sites with up to 60 megaliths at [[Louisenlund (Bornholm)|Louisenlund]] and [[Gryet]] on the Danish island of [[Bornholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europage.dk/bornholm/luisenlund/index.htm "Louisenlund tæt ved Østermarie på Bornholm"], Europage.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 14 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite its name, the [[Stone Tomb]] in [[Ukraine]] was not a tomb but rather a sanctuary.

===Other structures===
[[File:Annotated.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Cup and ring marks]], in England]]
In association with the megalithic constructions across Europe, there are often large [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] of various designs – ditches and banks (like the [[Dorset Cursus]]), broad terraces, circular enclosures known as [[henges]], and frequently artificial mounds such as [[Silbury Hill]] in England and [[Sassari|Monte d'Accoddi]] in [[Sardinia]] (the prehistoric step pyramid) .
A lot of spirals are found through of Sardinia: the best known is ''Perda Pinta'' of [[Mamoiada]].

It seems that spirals were an important motif for the megalith builders (see [[Megalithic Temples of Malta]]). They have been found carved into megalithic structures all over Europe, along with other symbols such as lozenges, eye-patterns, zigzags in various configurations, and [[cup and ring mark]]s. While not a written script in the modern sense of the term, these symbols are considered to have conveyed meaning to their creators, and are remarkably consistent across the whole of Europe.

===Spread of megalithic architecture in Europe===
[[File:Nurage1rp.jpg|thumb|Nurage in Sardinia]]
In Europe megaliths are, in general, constructions erected during the [[Neolithic]] or late stone age and [[Chalcolithic]] or Copper Age (4500–1500 BC). The megalithic structures of [[Malta]] are believed to be the oldest in Europe. Perhaps the most famous megalithic structure is [[Stonehenge]] in England. 
In Sardinia, in addition to dolmens, menhirs and circular graves there are also more than 8000 megalithic structure made by a Nuragic civilisation, called [[Nuraghe]]: buildings similar to towers (sometimes with really complex structures) made using only rocks. They are often near [[giants' grave|giant's grave]] or the other megalithic monuments.
[[File:Tumulus de Kercado 2005 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Tumulus]] of Kercado, near Carnac. Smaller but older structure in the area. (Part of the [[Cairn]] is visible)]]
The French [[Comte de Caylus]] was the first to describe the [[Carnac stones]]. [[Pierre Jean-Baptiste Legrand d'Aussy]] introduced the terms ''[[menhir]]'' and ''[[dolmen]]'', both taken from the [[Breton language]], into antiquarian terminology. He mistakenly interpreted megaliths as gallic tombs. In Britain, the [[antiquarian]]s [[John Aubrey|Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley|Stukeley]] conducted early research into megaliths. In 1805, [[Jacques Cambry]] published a book called ''Monuments celtiques, ou recherches sur le culte des Pierres, précédées d'une notice sur les Celtes et sur les Druides, et suivies d'Etymologie celtiques'', where he proposed a [[Celt]]ic stone cult. This unproven connection between [[druids]] and megaliths has haunted the public imagination ever since.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In Belgium, there are the [[Wéris megaliths]] at Wéris, a little town situated in the [[Ardennes]]. In the Netherlands, megalithic structures can be found in the northeast of the country, mostly in the province of [[Drenthe]]. [[Knowth]] is a [[passage grave]] of the [[Brú na Bóinne]] neolithic complex in Ireland, dating from c. 3500–3000 BC. It contains more than a third of the total number of examples of [[megalithic art]] in all Europe, with over 200 decorated stones found during excavations.

[[Nabta Playa]] at the southwest corner of the western Egyptian desert was once a large lake in the [[Nubia]]n Desert, located 500 miles south of modern-day [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/news/nubia.html|work=Archaeology|title= Neolithic Skywatchers|author= Andrew L.

[[Namoratunga]], a group of megaliths dated 300 BC, was used by [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]-speaking people as an alignment with star systems tuned to a lunar calendar of 354 days. This discovery was made by B. N. Lynch and L. H. Robins of [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Krup, Edwin C. (2003). ''Echoes of the Ancient Skies''. Courier Dover Publications, pp. 170(1) {{ISBN|0-486-42882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Tiya (archaeological site)|Tiya]] in central [[Ethiopia]] has a number old megaliths. Some of these ancient structures feature engravings, and the area is a World Heritage Site. Megaliths are also found within the Valley of Marvels in the East Hararghe area.

==Asian megaliths==
[[File:Gochang Dolmen Sites - 3.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Northern-style megalithic burial from Jukrim-ri, Gochang-eub, [[North Jeolla Province]], [[Korea]].]]
Megalithic burials are found in Northeast and Southeast Asia. They are found mainly in the [[Korean Peninsula]]. They are also found in the [[Liaoning]], [[Shandong]], and [[Zhejiang]] in China, the East Coast of [[Taiwan]], [[Kyūshū]] and [[Shikoku]] in Japan, [[Đồng Nai Province]] in [[Vietnam]] and [[South Asia]]. Some living megalithic traditions are found on the island of [[Sumba]] and [[Nias]] in [[Indonesia]]. The greatest concentration of megalithic burials is in Korea. Archaeologists estimate that there are 15,000 to 100,000 southern megaliths in the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Goindol [Megalith] in ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage (ed.) NRICH, Seoul. {{ISBN|89-5508-025-5}} pp. 72-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhee | first1 = Song-nai | last2 = Choi | first2 = Mong-lyong | year = 1992 | title = Emergence of Complex Society in Prehistoric Korea | url = | journal = Journal of World Prehistory | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = 68 | doi=10.1007/bf00997585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical estimates hover around the 30,000 mark for the entire peninsula, which in itself constitutes some 40% of all dolmens worldwide (see [[Dolmen#Asia|Dolmen]]).

===East Asia===

====Northern style====
Northeast Asian megalithic traditions originated in [[northeast China]], in particular the [[Liao River]] basin.&lt;ref&gt;Rhee and Choi (1992): 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Sarah M. (1999) "Megalithic Monuments and the Introduction of Rice into Korea" in ''The Prehistory of Food: Appetites for Change''.  C. Gosden and J. Hather (eds.) Routledge, London. pp.147–165&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of erecting megalithic burials spread quickly from the Liao River Basin and into the Korean Peninsula, where the structure of megaliths is geographically and chronologically distinct. The earliest megalithic burials are called "northern" or "table-style" because they feature an above-ground burial chamber formed by heavy stone slabs that form a rectangular cist.&lt;ref name="Rhee and Choi 1992: 68"&gt;Rhee and Choi (1992): 68&lt;/ref&gt; An oversized capstone is placed over the stone slab burial chamber, giving the appearance of a table-top. These megalithic burials date to the early part of the [[Mumun pottery period]] (c. 1500–850 BC) and are distributed, with a few exceptions, north of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. Few northern-style megaliths in northeast China contain [[grave goods]] such as [[Liaoning bronze dagger culture|Liaoning bronze daggers]], prompting some archaeologists to interpret the burials as the graves of chiefs or preeminent individuals.&lt;ref name="Nelson 1999"&gt;Nelson (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether a result of grave-robbery or intentional mortuary behaviour, most northern megaliths contain no grave goods.

====Southern style====
Southern-style megalithic burials are distributed in the southern [[Korean Peninsula]]. It is thought that most of them date to the latter part of the Early Mumun or to the Middle Mumun Period.&lt;ref name="Rhee and Choi 1992: 68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson 1999"/&gt; Southern-style megaliths are typically smaller in scale than northern megaliths. The interment area of southern megaliths has an underground burial chamber made of earth or lined with thin stone slabs. A massive capstone is placed over the interment area and is supported by smaller propping stones. Most of the megalithic burials on the [[Korean Peninsula]] are of the southern type.
[[File:Orim-dongmegalithpetroglyph.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.55|Representations of a dagger (right) and two human figures, one of which is kneeling (left), carved into the capstone of Megalithic Burial No. 5, Orim-dong, [[Yeosu]], Korea.]]

As with northern megaliths, southern examples contain few, if any, artifacts. However, a small number of megalithic burials contain fine red-burnished pottery, bronze daggers, polished groundstone daggers, and greenstone ornaments. Southern megalithic burials are often found in groups, spread out in lines that are parallel with the direction of streams. Megalithic cemeteries contain burials that are linked together by low stone platforms made from large river cobbles. Broken red-burnished pottery and charred wood found on these platforms has led archaeologists to hypothesize that these platform were sometimes used for ceremonies and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;GARI [Gyeongnam Archaeological Research Institute] (2002) ''Jinju Daepyeong Okbang 1 - 9 Jigu Mumun Sidae Jibrak'' [The Mumun Period Settlement at Localities 1 - 9, Okbang in Daepyeong, Jinju]. GARI, Jinju.&lt;/ref&gt; The capstones of many southern megaliths have 'cup-marks' carvings. A small number of capstones have human and dagger representations.

====Capstone style====
These megaliths are distinguished from other types by the presence of a burial shaft, sometimes up to 4 m in depth, which is lined with large cobbles.&lt;ref name="Bale"&gt;Bale, Martin T. "[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~ekp/resources/studies/bale-yulha-ri.html Excavations of Large-scale Megalithic Burials at Yulha-ri, Gimhae-si, Gyeongsang Nam-do]" in ''Early Korea Project''. Korea Institute, Harvard University. Retrieved 10 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A large capstone is placed over the burial shaft without propping stones. Capstone-style megaliths are the most monumental type in the [[Korean Peninsula]], and they are primarily distributed near or on the south coast of Korea. It seems that most of these burials date to the latter part of the Middle Mumun (c. 700–550 BC), and they may have been built into the early part of the Late Mumun. An example is found near modern [[Changwon]] at Deokcheon-ni, where a small cemetery contained a capstone burial (No. 1) with a massive, rectangularly shaped, stone and earthen platform. Archaeologists were not able to recover the entire feature, but the low platform was at least 56×18 m in size.

The [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]] is the host of [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] megalith cultures both past and present. Living megalith cultures can be found on [[Nias]], an isolated island off the western coast of [[North Sumatra]], the [[Batak]] people in the interior of North Sumatra, on [[Sumba]] island in [[East Nusa Tenggara]] and also [[Toraja]] people from the interior of [[South Sulawesi]]. These megalith cultures remained preserved, isolated and undisturbed well into the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Several megalith sites and structures are also found across Indonesia. Menhirs, dolmens, stone tables, ancestral stone statues, and [[step pyramid]] structure called ''Punden Berundak'' were discovered in various sites in [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]], and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]].

The Punden step pyramid and menhir can be found in Pagguyangan near Cisolok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pangguyangan | work = Dinas Pariwisata dan Budaya Provinsi Jawa Barat | url = http://www.disparbud.jabarprov.go.id/wisata/dest-det.php?id=878&amp;lang=id | language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cipari]] megalith site also in West Java displays monoliths, stone terraces, and sarcophagi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hasil Pemugaran dan Temuan Benda Cagar Budaya PJP I | author1 =I.G.N.

=== South Asia ===
[[File:MarayoorDolmen.JPG|thumb|Megalithic dolmen in Marayoor, India.]]

The case-example is that of Brahmagiri, which was excavated by Wheeler (1975) and helped establish the culture sequence in south Indian prehistory. However, there is another distinct class of megaliths that do not seem to be associated with burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N.Vahia, M.

In South Asia, megaliths of all kinds are noted; these vary from Menhirs, Rock-cut burial, chamber tomb, dolmens, stone alignment, stone circles and anthropomorphic figures.{{sfn|N.Vahia, M. Menon, Abbas, Yadav|p.4}} These are broadly classified into two (potentially overlapping) classes (after Moorti, 1994, 2008): ''Sepulchral'' (containing remains of the dead), or memorial stones where mortal remains along with funerary objects are placed; and ''Non-sepulchral'' including large patterned placement of stones over a wide area. The 'non-sepulchral' type is associated with astronomy and cosmology in South Asia and in other parts of the world (Menon and Vahia, 2010).{{sfn|N.Vahia, M. Menon, Abbas, Yadav|p.3-4}}

In the context of prehistoric anthropomorphic figures in India, (Rao 1988/1999, Upinder Singh 2008) note that it is unclear what these giant anthropomorphs symbolize. They usually occur in association with megalithic monuments and are located in megalithic burial grounds, and may have been connected with ancestor worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=K.P|title=Megalithic Anthropomorphic Statues: Meaning and Significance|url=http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/BIPPA/article/viewFile/11729/10358|website=http://journals.lib.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melanesian megaliths==
Megaliths occur in many parts of [[Melanesia]], mainly in [[Milne Bay Province]], [[Fiji]] and [[Vanuatu]]. Few excavations has been made and little is known about the structures.
The megalith tomb Otuyam at [[Kiriwina]] has been dated to be approximately 2,000 years old which indicates that megaliths are an old custom in Melanesia. However very few megaliths have been dated. The constructions have been used for different rituals. For example, tombs, sacrifices and rituals of fecundity. Dance sites exist next to some megaliths. In some places in Melanesia rituals are continued to be held at the sacred megalith sites. The fact that the beliefs are alive is a reason that most excavations have been stopped at the sites.

==Micronesian megaliths==
Megalithic structures in Micronesia reach their most developed form on the islands of [[Pohnpei]] and [[Kosrae]] in the Eastern Caroline Islands. On these two islands there was extensive use of prismatic basalt columns to build upland building complexes such as those at Salapwuk on Pohnpei and Menka on Kosrae.  These building sites, remote from the ocean, appear to have been abandoned early.  Megalithic building then shifted to constructing networks of artificial islands on the coast that supported a multitude of common, royal and religious structures.  Dating of the structures is difficult but the complex at [[Nan Madol]] on Pohpei was probably inhabited as early as 800 c.a. probably as an artificial islands with the more elaborate buildings and religious structures added to the site from 1000–1400 AD.

Nan Madol almost certainly served as the economic, government and religious site for a centralized monarchy which is historically named the 'Saudeleurs'.  By legend the Saudeleurs were from elsewhere, possibly in the south or west but no specific origin has ever been established.  Nan Madol lost prominence and was later abandoned after the overthrow of the [[Saudeleur dynasty]].  The oral history suggests this overthrow was by a group of warriors from Kosrae. 
The megalithic site at Lelu on the island of Kosrae, based on dating studies and oral history, rose to prominence about 1400 AD corresponding roughly with the fall of Nan Madol and endured for the next three hundred years or so.  It was largely abandoned by the time of European contact.

The architecture at these Micronesian sites is characteristic and has little in common with other megalithic sites. Prismatic basalt columns were brought from a great distance to the artificial islands and the rock was stacked in a layers of stretchers and runners filled in the center with coral debris.  This structure allowed creation of walls up to 10 meters in height with great durability.  The presence of step pyramids in the south western corner of Nan Madol as well as in Lelu suggests some Melanesian influence but other structures such as the royal residence, the religious structures and common areas as well as the elaborate interconnecting system of canals has no parallel elsewhere in the Pacific region.

==Modern theories==
Megaliths were used for a variety of purposes ranging from serving as boundary markers of territory, to a reminder of past events, and to being part of the society's religion.&lt;ref&gt;d'Alviella, Goblet, et al. (1892) pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Common motifs including crooks and axes seem to be symbols of political power, much as the crook was a symbol of Egyptian pharaohs. Amongst the [[indigenous peoples]] of India, [[Malaysia]], [[Polynesia]], North Africa, North America, and South America, the worship of these stones, or the use of these stones to symbolize a spirit or deity, is a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Goblet, et al. (1892) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, some scholars believed that all megaliths belonged to one global "Megalithic culture"&lt;ref&gt;Gaillard, Gérald (2004) ''The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-22825-5}}, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; ([[hyperdiffusionism]], e. g. ‘the Manchester school’,&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster Brown, P. (1976) p.267&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] and [[William James Perry]]), but this has long been disproved by modern dating methods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Nor is it believed any longer that there was a pan-European megalithic culture, although regional cultures existed, even within such a small areas as the British Isles.  The archaeologist Euan Mackie wrote "Likewise it cannot be doubted that important regional cultures existed in the Neolithic period and can be defined by different kinds of stone circles and local pottery styles (Ruggles &amp; Barclay 2000: figure 1). No-one has ever been rash enough to claim a nationwide unity of all aspects of Neolithic archaeology!"&lt;ref&gt;Mackoe, Euan W, "The structure and skills of British Neolithic Society: a brief response to Clive Ruggles &amp; Gordon Barclay. (Response)", ''Antiquity'' September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of megalithic structure ===
The types of megalithic structure can be divided into two categories, the "polylithic type" and the "monolithic type."&lt;ref&gt;Keane, A. H. (1896) p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Different megalithic structures include:

{|width=85% cellspacing=3 style="border: 1px; margin-bottom: 3px;"
|cellspacing=3 cellpadding=3 valign="top"|
;Polylithic type
* [[Dolmen]]: a free-standing chamber, consisting of standing stones covered by a capstone as a lid. Dolmens were used for burial and were covered by mounds.
** [[Great dolmen]]s
** [[Rectangular dolmen]]s
** [[Simple dolmen]]s
** [[Polygonal dolmen]]s
* [[Taula]]: a straight standing stone, topped with another forming a 'T' shape.
* [[Cistvaen]]s
* [[Unchambered long barrow]]s
* [[Guardian stones]]
* [[Passage grave]]
* [[Tumuli]] or barrows
* [[Punden]] or Punden Berundak: step earth and stone pyramid, similar to tumuli but reinforced with stone walls.
* [[Cairn]]s or ''Galgals''

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Morning at Grand Manan''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Alfred Thompson Bricher]]. It is part of the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], and is currently on view in the Paine Early American Painting Gallery. 

==Description==

Painted along [[Grand Manan|Grand Manan Island]], a favorite vacation spot of the artist in [[New Brunswick]], Canada, Bricher painted the sunrise coming above the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a tiny [[inlet]] on the coast.&lt;ref name=Catalog&gt;{{cite web|title=Morning at Grand Manan Catalog Entry|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/morning-grand-manan-bricher-alfred-thompson#ext-text-1396|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four sailing ships are clearly visible against the pink sky. On the left of the canvas, a sharp, rocky cliff face is seen, breaking up the composition. Bricher clearly depicts each wave rolling onto the beach in minute detail. The sun is positioned a little left of center of the canvas, but is the major focal point, drawing the eye in. Just like the Hudson River painters, Bricher hides his brushstrokes, as if to make the canvas disappear.

==Historical Information==

Alfred Thompson Bricher was part of the [[Luminism (American art style)|American Luminist]] movement, coming out of the [[Hudson River School]]. Much like the [[impressionism|Impressionists]], they were interested in the play of light in [[landscapes]], with Bricher himself being particularly interested in how light played against the ocean. Bricher, in particular, became famous for his [[seascapes]] and depicting the North Atlantic seaboard.&lt;ref name=Catalog /&gt; Bricher is considered the last important luminist painter. ''Morning at Grand Manan'' came at the height of his career, and displayed Bricher's acquisition of European aesthetics into his own paintings.&lt;ref name=Questroyal&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=William Tylee Ranney|title=Biography|url=http://www.questroyalfineart.com/artist/alfred-thompson-bricher|publisher=Questroyal Fine Art|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Acquisition===

Bricher sold ''Morning at Grand Manan'' to the Vose Gallery in [[Boston]] in 1898. The Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased the painting in 1970 using the Martha Delzell Memorial Fund.

[[File:Music for Electric Metronomes (1960) score.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Score for ''Music for Electric Metronomes'']]
'''''Music for Electric Metronomes''''' is an [[avant-garde]] [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] composition written in 1960 by Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/64647/SASAKI-THESIS.pdf|title=Trio Webster: Toshi Ichiyanagi's Fusion of Western and Eastern Music|type=Doctor of Music Arts thesis|first=Maiko|last=Sasaki|page=9|publisher=Rice University|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for any number of performers between three and eight. The piece involves the manipulation of electric [[metronome]]s, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions. It is a very theatrical piece,&lt;ref&gt;Ichiyanagi, Toshi. [http://www.edition-peters.de/product/music-for-electric-metronomes/ep66148 ''Music for Electric Metronomes'', Theatre Piece], [[Edition Peters]]&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with [[Fluxus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond|first=Michael|last=Nyman|authorlink=Michael Nyman|chapter=Indeterminacy 1960–70|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521653831|page=111|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; an experimental art movement from the sixties. The only true scored "instrument" is an electric metronome for each individual player,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Marianne Williams Tobias|title=Classical Music Without Fear: A Guide for General Audiences|page=74|publisher=Inidiana University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780253216182}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer. Because the [[Graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] of the [[sheet music|score]] – a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths – leaves room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced. There is no [[conducting|conductor]] for the performance. It has been recorded on the album ''Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's &amp; 1990's''.&lt;ref&gt;{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mr0002091556|label=Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's &amp; 1990's|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of a performance by the [[S.E.M. Ensemble]] in 1992 at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], the music critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], described the piece as "merely a timid, spastic prelude to [[György Ligeti]]'s monumental ''[[Poème symphonique]]" for 100 metronomes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/24/arts/review-music-sem-evokes-john-cage-as-teacher.html "Review/Music; S.E.M. Evokes John Cage as Teacher"] by [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 December 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Score==

The score for ''Music for Electric Metronomes'' consists of a diagram featuring series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths accompanied by a set of directions. Each player looks at the score and chooses a path, starting from one "end" of the score, and finishing at another. There are 10 "ends" to start and finish with. This path should culminate in about 8 minutes worth of actions, sounds, and metronome manipulation. Once the player has chosen their path, they will use numbers as guides for meter and duration, and various types of lines as a guide to choosing their actions and sounds. Each player will begin at their respective ends, and start the metronome at the BPM (beats-per-minute) designated by their starting number. Then, using the amount of beats specified, they will gradually adjust the [[tempo]] of the metronome to the next designated BPM on their path. The connecting line between these BPMs is what specifies the action(s) or sound(s) that follow:&lt;ref&gt;[http://post.at.moma.org/content_items/90-toshi-ichiyanagi-and-the-art-of-indeterminacy "Toshi Ichiyanagi and the Art of Indeterminacy"], seminar by Yayoi Uno Everett, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, 15 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* A straight, unbroken line means that no action will follow the metronome change. A single curved unbroken line stands for a single action, such as walking. An unbroken line with two or more curves means to make two more actions.
* A straight, dotted line means to make a single physical sound, such as clapping or voice sounds. A single curved dotted line means to make any number of physical sounds of one kind. A dotted line with two or more curves means to make two or more physical sounds of different kinds.
* A straight, zig-zag line means to make a single sound using an external object like an instrument or machine. A single curved zig-zag line means to make any number of sounds using a single external object. A zig-zag line with two or more curves means to make two or more sounds using external objects from two or more sources.

The '''Northcote Koori Mural''' is located in St Georges Road [[Thornbury, Victoria]] in the [[City of Darebin]]. It was designed by former [[Northcote High School]] art teacher [[Megan Evans]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://meganevans.asia/meganevans.asia/Biography.html Megan Evans Visual Artist, Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with members of the Thornbury-based [[Aborigines Advancement League]], which owns the mural.

[[File:St Georges Road Aboriginal history mural 2.JPG|thumb|St Georges Road Aboriginal history mural 2]]
[[File:St Georges Road Aboriginal history mural 3.JPG|thumb|St Georges Road Aboriginal history mural 3]]

Evans worked with Aboriginal artist and elder [[Lin Onus]] researching and designing the mural in collaboration with members of the Victorian Aboriginal Community, and it was painted in between 1983 and 1985, by trainee artists including Les Griggs, a Gunditjmara man (1962–93), Ray Thomas, Millie Yarran, Ian Johnson and Elaine Trott and many other volunteers.

The Northcote Koori Mural  was originally located opposite the [[Northcote Town Hall]] on Council land in High Street. this site was later sold and the mural was moved to the Aboriginal Advancement League in St. Georges Road, Thornbury where a large, free-standing wall was erected specifically to accommodate the mural on the edge of the Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] Sporting Complex. Megan Evans considered the artwork significant because “…it was a landmark for the Aboriginal community at that time and because Northcote Council was prepared to support a project which was politically ahead of its time.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofdarebin.vic.gov.au/Files/Creating_Place.pdf Creating Place, Public Art Policy and Practice in Darebin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209195843/http://www.cityofdarebin.vic.gov.au/Files/Creating_Place.pdf |date=9 February 2012 }} Arts &amp; Cultural Planning Unit of Darebin City Council with the assistance of Sarah Poole Arts Management&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the local council sold the land where the mural was situated and it was relocated to nearby St George’s Road, Thornbury, close to the AAL’s current location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowitja.org.au/sites/default/files/docs/Sort-of-like-reading-a-map-amended.pdf Fran Edmonds with Maree Clarke ‘'SORT OF LIKE READING A MAP A COMMUNITY REPORT ON THE SURVIVAL OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART SINCE 1834'' page 29, Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health, 2009] {{ISBN|978-0-7340-4090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was proposed for includsion on the Darebin Heritage Overlay in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aboriginal mural|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/#detail_places;26593|work=Victorian Heritage Database|publisher=State of Victoria|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mural represents Victoria's Aboriginal culture and history and contains strong political statements about the incarceration of Aboriginal people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preston mural a slice of Indigenous history|url=http://www.abc.net.au/arts/stories/s3109749.htm|work=ABC Arts|publisher=ABC|accessdate=30 January 2013|author=Reko Rennie|format=Video upload|date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other elements, it depicts large-scale renderings of historical artworks by [[Tommy McRae]] and [[William Barak]], a representation of Aboriginal men manacled in neck chains taken from a well known photograph, and the Lake Tyers land rights campaign of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowitja.org.au/sites/default/files/docs/Sort-of-like-reading-a-map-amended.pdf Fran Edmonds with Maree Clarke ‘'SORT OF LIKE READING A MAP A COMMUNITY REPORT ON THE SURVIVAL OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART SINCE 1834'' page 29, Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Health, 2009] {{ISBN|978-0-7340-4090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darebin Council allocated $10,000 in its 2011-12 budget for a report on how to restore the artwork and then a further $80,000 in the 2012-13 budget for the mural's conservation and restoration, after it had become dilapidated from weather and an occasional target of graffiti vandals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://northcote-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/cash-ensures-brighter-picture-for-thornbury-mural/ 'Cash ensures brighter picture for Thornbury mural Council' ''Northcote Leader'' 11 Jul 12 by Madeline Healey]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original painted panels were removed, and a restored digital print copy was installed in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/north/thornburys-famed-koori-mural-returns-in-digital-form/story-fnglenug-1226785008499 Julia Irwin, 'Thornbury's famed Koori mural returns in digital form' ''Northcote Leader'' 17 December, 2013 5:00PM]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of Professor Benjamin H. Rand''''' is an 1874 painting by [[Thomas Eakins]]. It is [[oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and depicts [[Benjamin H. Rand]], a doctor at [[Jefferson Medical College]] who taught Eakins anatomy. In the painting, Rand is reading a book while petting a cat.

The portrait was the first Eakins made of someone outside his family.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;Adams, Henry (2005). ''Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-515668-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a prelude to what he considered his most important painting, ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' (1875). Rand donated it to Jefferson Medical College when he retired.

It was purchased by [[Alice L. Walton]] for an estimated US$20 million in April 2007, to be housed at the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;Vogel, Carol (April 12, 2007). Philadelphia School Sells a Second Eakins. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Reader's Digest Condensed Books''''' were a series of hardcover [[anthology]] collections, published by the American general interest monthly family magazine ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' and distributed by [[direct mail]].  Most volumes contained five (although a considerable minority consisted of three, four, or six) current best-selling novels and nonfiction books which were [[abridged]] (or "condensed") specifically for ''Reader's Digest''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02680426 Springer.com: "The continuous publication of the Reader's Digest Condensed Books directmail
subscription series since 1950 is a cultural phenomenon."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/65843-reader-s-digest-condensed-book-series-to-get-wider-distribution.html Publishers Weekly: "Reader's Digest Condensed Book Series to Get Wider Distribution" March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was popular; a 1987 New York Times article estimated annual sales of 10 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/02/nyregion/new-editor-at-digest-s-condensed-books.html N.Y. Times: "New Editor at Digest's Condensed Books" August 2, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popularity, old copies are notoriously difficult to sell. &lt;ref&gt;[https://nathanhobby.com/2012/03/11/readers-digest-condensed-books-as-difficult-to-dispose-of-as-bins-of-radioactive-waste/ "Readers Digest Condensed Books as diffiult to dispose of as bins of radioactive waste"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claytonlibrary.org/donating.htm Clayton Library: "We Don't Accept Reader's Digest Condensed Books--they do not sell."]&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of their publication schedule, the volumes were issued four times each year, with the rate gradually increasing to a bi-monthly schedule by the early-1990s. The series was produced for 47 years (1950–1997), until being renamed ''[[Reader's Digest Select Editions]]''. (''Note'': UK editions seem to have been somewhat different from USA editions. Pre-1992 Canadian editions also contain different titles).

Occasional titles  such as ''[[The Leopard]]'' (Summer 1960), ''[[The Days Were Too Short]]'' (Autumn 1960), and ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]'' (Autumn 1970) were not written in English but published as abridgments of the translated versions. In a few cases, new editions of older works (''[[Up from Slavery]]'', originally published in 1901 (Autumn 1960), ''[[A Roving Commission: My Early Life]]'', originally published in 1930 (Autumn 1951) or ''[[Goodbye Mr. Chips]]'', originally published in 1934 (Summer 1961)) were also among the condensed selections.

'''SELL''' ('''Syndicat des éditeurs de logiciels de loisirs''') is a French organisation that promotes the interests of video game developers. The group mainly distributes information about video game professionals to authorities and consumers. Created in 1995, the group is chaired by [[Philippe Sauze]] from [[Electronic Arts]] France. The general delegate is [[Jean Claude Larue]] (ex. [[Infogrames Entertainment, SA|Infogrames]]).

From June 1999 until the arrival in 2003 of [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]], the organisation rated the content of video games in France. Their classification system had four categories: "tous publics" (all audiences), "12 ans et plus" (12 years and over), "16 ans et plus" (16 years and over), and "interdit aux moins de 18 ans" (restricted under 18 years).

The '''''Solly Madonna''''' by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]] was painted somewhere between 1500 and 1504.

An early work, it clearly shows the influence of Raphael's teacher [[Perugino]].&lt;ref name="Sociology, Religion and Grace"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEh_AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;f=false | title=Sociology, Religion and Grace | publisher=Routledge | author=Szakolczai, Arpad | year=2007 | isbn=9781134194506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two motifs in this work would recur in later Madonnas by Raphael. The virgin Mary is reading a book, as in the [[Madonna and Child (Raphael, Pasadena)|Madonna and Child]] in the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[Connestabile Madonna]], the [[Madonna Colonna]] and the [[Madonna del cardellino]]. As in that last painting a small bird, a [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]], is part of the scene.&lt;ref name="Uffizi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNE3ofu8psMC&amp;lpg=PA420&amp;dq=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;pg=PA420#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;f=false | title=Uffizi | publisher=Giunti Editore | author=Fossi, Gloria | year=2004 | isbn=9788809036765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is located in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. It is called the ''Solly Madonna'' because it was owned by the British banker and art collector [[Edward Solly]] (1776–1848).

'''Space for Pan African Research Creation and Knowledge (SPARCK)''' is a multi-sited, multi-disciplinary project founded in 2008 in collaboration with [[The Africa Centre]].&lt;ref name=Sparck&gt;{{cite web |type= About |url= http://www.sparck.org/about|title=SPARCK |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is structured around a series of residencies for artists from across Africa and the [[African diaspora]] working in numerous media and styles, a wide range of exhibitions, installations, performances, screenings, Internet link-ups, publications, round-table discussions and workshops.  Its initiatives are directed at a diverse body of the public and actively engaged local communities.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;{{cite web|title=SPARCK|url=http://www.africacentre.net/sparck|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
SPARCK is a triennial endeavour.  Its first three-year initiative (2009–2011) was entitled "Net / Works:  Trans-Local Cultures in the Making of African Worlds.” This initiative explores intersections between creativity in multiple fields (visual, performance and new media arts; the spoken and written words; on-the-ground and in-the-virtual-world activism) and emergent urban spaces in the African world. It brings [[Cape Town]] and South Africa into a lively exchange with networks of urban artists, activists and scholars from three countries: [[Nigeria]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt;

Through its multiple projects, SPARCK aims to foster cross-disciplinary and trans-local partnerships and endeavours, to promote dialogue and exchange that transcends the boundaries of age, social class, gender, as well as spatial, professional and ethnic difference.&lt;ref name="Contemporary And"&gt;{{cite web|title=Residencies|url=http://www.contemporaryand.com/blog/institue/sparck-space-for-pan-african-research-creation-and-knowledge/|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts Residencies===

====Diary of a Paranoid Schizophrenic====
SPARCK launched its first arts residency in March 2009 with artist, Kakudji. A controversial multi-media artist, Kakudji was invited to construct a two-part project in South Africa.

Part 1 took place in [[Johannesburg]], during the first half March. The project, entitled "Urban Scenographies," brought together over 30 artists from four continents for a period of one month and gave rise to three events: a 3-day festival of performances, exhibitions and installations held in inner-city [[Johannesburg]]; a conference/performance at one of France's foremost experimental arts venues, Théâtre Paris-Villette; and a multi-disciplinary installation at [[Art Basel]].  An experimental video by Kakudjii about the Scenographies project was featured in all three settings.

Part 2 of Kakudji's residency took place In [[Cape Town]] from 16 March to 16 April 2009. Alongside video and still photography documenting his encounter with the "Mother City," Kakudji produced a body of some fifty [[collages]].  In these works, Kakudji made use of local currency to frame his perceptions of the city and more broadly of South Africa.  Thematically and formally, the work focused on notions of deal-making:  how things are made and un-made, done and undone and how economies of violence (monetary, political, social) are developed and implemented through such processes.&lt;ref name=Sparck11&gt;{{cite web|title=Diary of a Paranoic Schizophrenic|url=http://www.sparck.org/diary-of-a-paranoid-schizophrenic|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ground | Overground | Underground====
Mowoso, a [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] trans-disciplinary collective, began "Ground | Overground | Underground" in July 2009 and had their first showing in November 2012 at Afropolis. The intention of the project was to tell the story of the path [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] man travels from his home continent to the West, the centre of 21st century digital globalisation. The project began with a series of videos filmed in [[Mbandaka]], [[Kinshasa]], and Mikili, and used the materials collected in these places to evolve into a performance, installation, and architecture. Using various materials, the project sought to call attention to the bombardment of electronic technology overtaking the world and, more specifically, the devastation caused in the Congo by the West's mad rush for [[coltan]].&lt;ref name=Sparck2&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground Overground Underground|url=http://www.sparck.org/mowoso|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neoliberal Machine====
"Neoliberal Machine" was a product of the collaboration of Eza Possibles, an arts collective of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and OKUP, a French arts collective, over the course of three years from 2009–2012. The project incorporated a wide range of media, including web arts, cartography, video, performance, installation arts, collage and painting. The focus of the project is the "art of the deal" in the contemporary global economy.&lt;ref name=Sparck3&gt;{{cite web|title=Neoliberal Machine|url=http://www.sparck.org/neoliberal-machine|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====WiAiA – World into Art into Africa====
"WiAiA" was a workshop that took place in 2009 to discuss how contemporary art produced in Africa and the diaspora is and should be written about. It sought to find alternatives to the shallowness and cliches that mark much writing surrounding African art, and questioned how to more adequately address the relevance of African art in global cultural exchange.&lt;ref name=Sparck4&gt;{{cite web|title=Wiaia|url=http://www.sparck.org/about-wiaia|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South-South Conversations====
The South-South Conversations began in 2010–2011 as a series of one-month residencies by photographers in three cities in Africa and then three cities of the African Diaspora in Southern Asia. Though the focus was initially photography, the project quickly evolved to include also experimental video, prose, sound, and internet interventions.&lt;ref name=Sparck5&gt;{{cite web|title=South South Conversations|url=http://www.sparck.org/south-south-conversations|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Photographic Journeys====
Photographic Journeys was a 6-city, 9-artist residency from 2009–2011 that sought to challenge preconceived notions about informal, parallel, and other undervalued economies. The philosophy of the project was that the terms "informal" and "parallel" further marginalise these economies that are actually common to the majority of people on the planet. Through this project, artists explored the global dynamics that relate to these practices and the human condition in the late capitalist world.&lt;ref name=Sparck6&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographic Journeys|url=http://www.sparck.org/about-pj|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Totems====
Totems is a movable installation by Herve Youmbi, a [[Demographics of Cameroon|Cameroonian]] visual artist. The project examines the impact of globalised capitalism on African art, in two parts: an ephemeral architectural space made of travel bars, and a photo exhibition of portraits of artists from the "developing world." In the photographs, the artists wear sunglasses whose lenses have been covered by the logos of major museums, art fairs, galleries, or auction houses, intended to suggest, among other things, admiration, envy, and alienation.&lt;ref name=Sparck7&gt;{{cite web|title=Totems|url=http://www.sparck.org/about-totems|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Urban Scenographies====
Artists Mega Mingiedi and Androa Mindre held one-month residencies in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] from December 2012 to January 2013 to explore issues of urban public and common space, body politics and theatricality in the neighbourhood of [[Ouakam]]. The produce of their residencies was a public performance piece in which they turned themselves into living incarnations of temporary restaurants or other meeting places on street corners in [[Kinshasa]].&lt;ref name=Sparck8&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Scenographies|url=http://www.sparck.org/about-malewa|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
In early 2009, SPARCK's directors, Kadiatou Diallo and Dominique Malaquais, were invited to participate in [[Transmediale]], an international festival of contemporary art and digital culture held in Germany. The festival, based in [[Berlin]], showcases cutting-edge arts projects exploring the impact of new technologies on cultures worldwide, through exhibitions and installations, film and video programmes, live performances, publications, conferences and discussion panels linking live audiences with online participants.&lt;ref name=Sparck9&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmediale09 Festival|url=http://www.sparck.org/transmediale09-festival-berlin|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPARCK team participated in two discussion sessions.  The first was entitled "Re-Hacking Your world: Sensible Software.” It focused on emergent digital and cellular cultures in Africa and activist / artistic possibilities arising from these. The second session, entitled “Critical Consumer Practice,” centred on the work of one of SPARCK’s collaborators, a new media collective based in [[Kinshasa]] called Mowoso.  The session was a live, online collaboration between Mowoso and SPARCK, linking Kinshasa and Berlin in real time with discussants on four continents, around an experimental performance and a debate about a highly contentious subject:  the trade in [[Coltan]], a metal essential to the production of cell phones, which has had a powerful and violent impact on vast swaths of Central and Eastern Africa.&lt;ref name="Sparck9"/&gt;

In April 2009, SPARCK participated in a colloquium on African urbanism hosted by the African Centre for Cities (ACC) at the [[University of Cape Town]]. This was the first in a series of three encounters, to take place over the next three years, bringing together artists and academics around novel ways of thinking about cities in Africa. SPARCK's participation in this process grows out of a broader collaboration between SPARCK and the colloquium organisers, Edgar Pieterse, founder and director of the ACC, and AbdouMaliq Simone, Professor of sociology at [[Goldsmith's College]], [[University of London]], both of whom have played a key role in developing the ideas and practices that underlie SPARCK.&lt;ref name=Sparck10&gt;{{cite web|title=African Urbanism Colloquium|url=http://www.sparck.org/african-urbanism-colloquium-cape-town-|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stunt performer''', often referred to as a '''stuntman''', '''stuntwoman''' or '''daredevil''', is a trained professional who performs [[stunts]], often as a career.

==Overview==
A stuntman typically performs stunts intended for use in a [[film|motion picture]] or dramatized [[television]]. Stunts seen in films and television include car crashes, falls from great height, drags (for example, behind a horse), and explosions.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

There is an inherent risk in the performance of all stunt work. The most risk exists when performing stunts in front of a live audience. In filmed performances, visible safety mechanisms can be removed by editing. In live performances the audience can see more clearly if the performer is genuinely doing what they claim or appear to do. To reduce the risk of injury or death, most often stunts are choreographed or mechanically-rigged so that, while they look dangerous, safety mechanisms are built into the performance. Despite their well-choreographed appearance, stunts are still very dangerous and physically testing exercises.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;

From its inception as a professional skill in the early 1900s to the 1960s, stunts were most often performed by professionals who had trained in that discipline prior to entering the movie industry.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; Current film and television stunt performers must be trained in a variety of disciplines including martial arts and [[stage combat]], and must be a certified trained member of a professional stunt performers organisation first, in order to obtain the necessary [[insurance]] to perform on stage or screen.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; This allows them to better break down and plan an action sequence, physically prepare themselves, and incorporate both the safety and risk factors in their performances.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; However, even when executed perfectly, there is still strain and performing stunts often results in unplanned injury to the body.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

Daredevils are distinct from stunt performers and [[stunt double]]s; their performance is of the stunt itself, without the context of a film or television show. Daredevils often perform for an audience. Live stunt performers include [[escape artist]]s, [[sword swallower]]s, glass walkers, [[fire eater]]s, [[trapeze artist]]s, and many other [[sideshow]] and [[circus]] arts. They also include motorcycle display teams and the once popular [[Wall of death (carnival sideshow)|Wall of Death]]. The [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]] films and television series are well-known and prominent recorded examples of the act in modern cinematography.

Some people, such as [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harry Houdini]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Tony Jaa]], and [[Jayan]], act as both stunt performers and daredevils at various parts of their career.

==History==

===Cascadeur===
[[File:Action. Rodeo BAnQ P48S1P12760 detail.jpg|thumbnail|Circus performers doing an automobile stunt in [[Delorimier Stadium]], [[Montreal]], in 1946]]
The earliest stunt performers were travelling entertainers and [[circus]] performers, particularly trained [[gymnast]]s and [[acrobatics|acrobats]]. The origin of the original name, the French language word ''cascadeur'', may have been derived from the requirement to fall in a sequence of movements during a scene or stunt involving water (''Cascade'' is the French language term for [[waterfall]])&lt;ref name=Freese&gt;{{cite book|title=Hollywood Stunt Performers, 1910s-1970s: A Biographical Dictionary|author=Gene Scott Freese|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co Inc|date=30 April 2014|ISBN=978-0786476435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] circus use of the word ''Kaskadeur'', it meant performing a sequential series of daring leaps and jumps without injury to the performer. This acrobatic discipline required long training in the ring and perfect body control to present a sensational performance to the public.&lt;ref name=ActArtDe/&gt;

The word stunt was more formally adopted during the 19th century travelling [[vaudeville]] performances of the early [[Wild West Shows]], in North America and Europe. The first and prototypical wild west show was [[Buffalo Bill]]'s, formed in 1883 and lasting until 1913. The shows which involved simulated battles with the associated firing of both guns and arrows, were a romanticized version of the [[American Old West]].

===Stage combat===
{{main|Stage combat}}
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[stage combat]] scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and North America were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as "standard combats". During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] masters in Europe began to research and experiment with [[historical fencing]] techniques, with weapons such as the [[two-handed sword]], [[rapier]], and [[smallsword]], and to instruct actors in their use.&lt;ref name=Wolf /&gt;

Notable among these revivalist instructors were [[George Dubois]], a fight director and martial artist from [[Paris]] who created performance fencing styles based on [[gladiator]]ial combat as well as Renaissance [[rapier and dagger]] fencing. [[Egerton Castle]] and Captain [[Alfred Hutton]] were part of a wider [[Victorian era]] group based in [[London]], involved in reviving [[historical fencing]] systems. Circa 1899–1902, Hutton taught stage fencing classes for actors via the [[Bartitsu]] Club, where he also served on the Board of Directors and learned the basics of [[jujutsu]] and the Vigny method of [[stick fighting]] from his fellow instructors.&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;Wolf, Tony. (2009) ''A Terrific Combat!!! Theatrical Duels, Brawls and Battles, 1800-1920''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early cinema===
By the early 1900s, the motion picture industry was starting to fire-up on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but had no need for professional stunt performers.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt; First, motion pictures were so new that even if the producer had a budget for performers, there were more than enough applicants willing to do the scene for free. For instance, if you needed a shot of someone on a steel beam {{convert|1000|ft}} up on a New York skyscraper, then there was always some willing to do the scene for real, and often for free. Second, the [[Spanish–American War]] had just ended, and there were many physically fit and trained in the handling of firearms young men looking for some work. Thirdly, the former wild west was now not only tamed, but also starting to be fenced in, greatly reducing the need for and pay of the former [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt;&lt;ref name=TiHWestern /&gt;

The first picture which used a dedicated stunt performer is highly debated, but occurred somewhere between 1903 and 1910.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt; The first possible appearance of a stunt-double was Frank Hanaway in ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', shot in 1903 in [[Milltown, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=LPFHM /&gt;&lt;ref name=TiHWestern /&gt; The first auditable paid stunt was in the 1908 film ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', with $5 paid by the director to the acrobat who had to jump upside down from a cliff into the sea.&lt;ref name=ActArtDe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actionartist.de/en/stunt.htm|title=The history of the Stuntman|author=Ilian Simeonow|publisher=ActionArtist.de|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional daredevil, [[Rodman Law]], was a trick parachutist known to thousands for climbing the side of buildings and parachuting out aeroplanes and off of tall [[base jumping|base]] objects like the Statue of Liberty. Some of his stunts were filmed by newsreel cameras and media still photographers. Law was brought into movies in 1912 to perform some of his stunts as the hero.

As the industry developed in the West Coast around [[Hollywood]], [[California]], the first accepted professional stuntmen were clowns and comedians like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]] and the [[Keystone Kops]].&lt;ref name=SMAssoc /&gt; The reason for this was that staple diet of the early films was an almost continual roll call of pratfalls, high dives and comedy car wrecks – the basic ingredients of a circus clown's routine.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc /&gt; But much like their circus-based predecessors, these actors/stuntmen were not specifically trained to perform stunts, but instead learned through trial and error.&lt;ref name=Freese /&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM /&gt;

===Cowboy professionals===
From 1910 onwards, American audiences developed a taste for [[action movies]], which were replicated into successful serials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Olivia|title=A Look at the History of Stunt Performers|url=https://www.oliviasummers.com/blog/2016/10/5/a-look-at-the-history-of-stunt-performers|website=Female Stunt &amp; Precision Car Driver|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mostly western-themed scripts required a lot of extras, such as for a galloping cavalry, a band of Indians or a fast riding sheriff’s posse; all of whom needed to proficiently ride, shoot and look right on camera.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tripsintohistory.com/2012/08/18/movie-stuntmen-we-wouldnt-have-the-old-western-films-without-them/|title=Movie Stuntmen / We Wouldn’t Have the Old Western Films Without Them|publisher=tripsintohistory.com|date=August 18, 2012|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers also kept pushing the directors calling for riskier stunts using a recurring cast, necessitating the use of dedicated stunt doubles for most movie stars.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; The directors turned to the current rodeo stars for inspiration for their action scenes, and employed former cowboys as extras who not only brought with themselves the right look and style, but also rodeo techniques that included safe and replicable horse falls.&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;

Early recruits included [[Tom Mix]], who after winning the 1909 National Riding and Rodeo Championship, worked for the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] in [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale]]. Mix made his first appearance in ''The Cowboy Millionaire'' in October 1909, and then as himself in the short documentary film titled ''Ranch Life in the Great Southwest'' in which he displayed his skills as a cattle wrangler. Mix eventually performed in over 160 cowboy matinee movies during the 1920s, and is considered by many as the first matinee cowboy idol.&lt;ref name="TiHWestern" /&gt;

The recruitment venture was aided in 1911 by the collapse of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch|Miller-Arlington]] rodeo show, that left many rodeo performers stranded in [[Venice, California]]. They including the young Rose August Wenger, who married and was later billed as [[Helen Gibson]], recognised as the first American professional stunt woman.&lt;ref&gt;Truitt, Evelyn Mack (1984). Who Was Who On Screen. New York: Bowker. {{ISBN|0-8352-1906-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas H. Ince]], who was producing for the [[New York Motion Picture Company]], hired the entire show's cast for the winter at $2,500 a week. The performers were paid $8 a week and boarded in Venice, where the horses were stabled. They then rode the {{convert|5|mi}} each day to work in [[Topanga Canyon]], where the films were being shot. In 1912, Helen made $15 a week for her first billed role as [[Ruth Roland]]'s sister in ''[[Ranch Girls on a Rampage]]''.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jgodsey/2223877544 Gibson, Helen. unpublished letter December 24, 1966]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After marrying [[Hoot Gibson|Edmund Richard "Hoot" Gibson]] in June 1913, the couple continued working rodeo's in the summer and as stunt doubles in the winter in California, most often for [[Kalem Company|Kalem Studios]] in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]].&lt;ref name="In Very"&gt;Gibson and Kornick, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1915 while on the Kalem payroll doubling for [[Helen Holmes]] in ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]'' [[adventure film]] [[Serial (film)|series]], Helen performed what is thought to be her most dangerous stunt: a leap from the roof of a station onto the top of a moving train in the ''A Girl’s Grit'' episode. The distance between station roof and train top was accurately measured, and she practiced the jump with the train standing still. In the actual shoot, with the trains accelerating velocity timed to the second, she leapt without hesitation and landed correctly, but with forward motion she rolled forward, saving herself from injury and improving the shot by catching hold of an air vent and dangling over the edge. She suffered only a few bruises.&lt;ref name="wise"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Wise|title=Stunting In the Cinema|date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the out of work cowboys and out of season rodeo riders, and the directors/producers, figured out a system for the supply of extras. A [[speakeasy]] called ''The Watering Hole'' was located close to a Los Angeles located [[corral]] called the Sunset Corral.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; Every morning, the cowboys would congregate at ''The Watering Hole'', where the directors would send over their assistants to hire for the following day. The cowboys would then dress in their normal riding clothes (unless told other wise, for which they were paid extra), and ride to the set, most of which were located to the north in the vicinity of the [[San Fernando Valley]].&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; These "riding extras" jobs paid $10 per day plus a box lunch, and most were only hired on a per day basis.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; These early cowboy actors eventually gained the nickname ''The Gower Gulch Gang'', as many of the small studios cranking out westerns were located on Gower Avenue.&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt;

Subsequently, a number of rodeo stars entered the movie industry on a full-time basis, with many "riding extras" eventually becoming movie stars themselves, including:&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; [[Hank Bell]] (300 films, between 1920 and 1952); [[Bill Gillis]]; [[Buck Jones]]; [[John Montgomery (equestrian)|Jack Montgomery]] (initially worked as Tom Mix's body-double); and [[Jack Padjeon]] (first appeared in 1923, played [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in the [[John Ford]] directed ''[[The Iron Horse]]'' in 1924).&lt;ref name=TiHWestern/&gt; But the best known stuntman turned star was probably [[Yakima Canutt]], who with his apprentices - who included [[John Wayne]]&lt;ref name=ActArtDe/&gt; - devised during the 1930s new safety devices, including: the 'L' [[stirrup]] which allowed a rider to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup; and cabling equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team. A focus on replicable and safe stunts saved producers money and prevented lost down-time for directors through reduced accidents and injury to performers.&lt;ref name=LPFHM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonepinefilmhistorymuseum.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=288&amp;Itemid=73|title=Stuntmen &amp; Women |publisher=[[Lone Pine Film History Museum]]|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuntmen were now an integral part of a films drawing power, helping to fill cinemas with thrill seeking patrons anxious to see the new Saturday matinee.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

===''Safety Last!''===
[[File:Safetylast-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harold Lloyd]] in 1923's ''[[Safety Last!]]'', hanging (safely) from the clock tower. Lloyd may have been influenced by the real life stunts of [[Rodman Law]] a decade earlier]]
Producer/actor [[Harold Lloyd]]'s film ''[[Safety Last!]]'' of 1923, is often considered one of the first to deploy thought-through safety devices and pre-planning in the execution of its filming and stunts. In the script, Lloyd's "country boy" character goes to the city to be a success, and ends up climbing a tall building as a stunt. Critics at the time claimed it to be the most spectacular daredevil thrill comedy.

The entire stunt sequence was shot on location the Atlantic Hotel in [[Broadway, Los Angeles]] (demolished 1957), at actual heights. But the films directors [[Fred C. Newmeyer]] and [[Sam Taylor (director)|Sam Taylor]] planned into two safety features:
*Mattresses occupied hidden platforms under each performer, who also was wearing a heavily padded corset under their clothing
*Each performer was attached via a safety harness to a secure safety wire, attached to the building
Producer [[Hal Roach]] and Lloyd had been forced into the costs of planning and construction of these safety devices, as simply without them the city commissioners had refused the production a [[film permit]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Lloyd, ever curious, decided after filming had completed to use a life-size cotton-filled dummy to see what the effect of an accident would have been should they have needed to use the required safety devices. On seeing the results, he didn't film another production without them.&lt;ref name=ActArtDe/&gt;

In 1983 in his personal homage to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd called ''[[Project A]]'', [[Jackie Chan]] repeats some of the most famous scenes from the early film era, including Lloyd's clock scene from ''Safety Last!'' While Lloyd only hanged from the tower, Chan took it a step further and actually fell from the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-6-most-needlessly-dangerous-jackie-chan-stunts/|title=The 6 Most Needlessly Dangerous Jackie Chan Stunts|author=Seanbaby|publisher=Cracked.com|date=August 11, 2012|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0085127|'A' gai wak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swashbuckler films===
{{main|Swashbuckler film}}
Swashbuckler films were a unique genre of action movies, utilising the earlier developed art of [[cinematic fencing]], a combination of stage combat and fencing. The most famous of these were the films of [[Douglas Fairbanks]], which defined the genre. The stories came from romantic costume novels, particularly those of [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Rafael Sabatini]], and included triumphant, thrilling music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosteronfilm.com/important/swash.htm Foster on Film].&lt;/ref&gt; There were three great cycles of swashbuckler films: the Douglas Fairbanks period from 1920 to 1929; the [[Errol Flynn]] period from 1935 to 1941; and a period in the 1950s heralded by films, including ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1952) and ''[[The Master of Ballantrae (film)|The Master of Ballantrae]]'' (1953), and the popularity of the British television series ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1955&amp;ndash;1959).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1136123/index.html Screen Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action movies===
The preference to employ ready existing professionals from outside the film industry, either as performers or doubles, continued in the period both up to and beyond [[World War II]], when again the industry was awash with young, fit men looking for work.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; However, in 1958 ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'' starring [[Robert Mitchum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0052293|Thunder Road}}&lt;/ref&gt; with stunt coordinator was [[Cary Loftin]] and a stunt team including [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]], Neil Castes Sr., [[Robert Hoy]], and [[Dale Van Sickel]], introduced the era of the [[car chase]] movie. With the later development of modern action movie, the accident rate of both stunt performers and movie stars started to quickly increase.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; The stunt performers took resultantly action to professionalise their industry, with the creation of new stunt performer run registration, training, certification, and booking agencies.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuntmen.com/about.html|title=Steeped in Heritage &amp; History|publisher=Stuntmen's Association|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, modern stunt technology was developed, including [[air ram]]s, [[air bag]]s, and [[Squib (explosive)|bullet squibs]]. [[Dar Robinson]] invented the decelerator during this period, which used dragline cables rather than airbags for stunts that called for a jump from high places.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=Hearst Magazines|date=Oct 1984|issn=0032-4558|pages=86,122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-development of this technology and professional performance training continues to evolve to the present, brought about through the need to not only create more visual impact on screen in the modern action movie era.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; It also provides a safe platform to a new breed of trained professional stunt performers, including [[Bill Hickman]], [[Terry Richards (actor)|Terry Richards]], and motorcycle greats [[Bud Ekins]] and [[Evel Knievel]]. These new professionals were not only driven to create visual impact, but also perform seemingly impossible feats in a safe and repeatable manner.&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; Latterly came the fast action [[Martial arts movies]] as a distinct genre, originating for western consumption mainly from [[Hong Kong]] from the 1940s, choreographed and later acted in by stunt performers turned stars including [[Bruce Lee]] and [[Sonny Chiba]] from the 1960s, Kent Norman "Superkentman" Elofson, and latterly [[Jackie Chan]].&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

In 1982, [[Jackie Chan]] began experimenting with elaborate [[stunt]] action sequences in ''[[Dragon Lord]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon Lord|publisher=Love HK Film|url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/dragon_lord.htm|accessdate=2011-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most [[take]]s required for a single scene, with 2900 takes,&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon Lord (DVD Description)|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dragon-Lord-DVD-Jackie-Chan/dp/B0000A5BRV|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a [[loft]] and falls to the lower ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kicking and Screening: ''Wheels on Meals,'' ''Armour of God,'' ''Police Story,'' and more are graded with an eye for action|author=David Everitt|date=August 16, 1996|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293788,00.html|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, ''[[Project A]]'' saw the official formation of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]] and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies).

''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' (1985) contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a [[car chase]] through a [[shanty town]], Chan stopping a [[double-decker bus]] with his service [[pistol|revolver]] and a climactic fight scene in a [[shopping mall]]. This final scene earned the film the nickname "Glass Story" by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of [[sugar glass]] that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene, in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably, resulting in Chan suffering [[Burn#Classification by degree|second-degree burns]], particularly to his hands, as well as a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing.&lt;ref name="I Am Jackie Chan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html|title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing|author=[[Jackie Chan]]|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Hong Kong action movie]] stars who became known for performing elaborate stunts include Chan's [[Peking Opera School]] friends [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]], as well as "[[girls with guns]]" stars such as [[Michelle Yeoh]] and [[Moon Lee]].

==Future==
{{POV|section|date=June 2017}}
While modern [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) technology is considered by many stunt professionals{{Who|date=March 2015}} to potentially be curtailing the industry to but a shadow of its former self, the costs of CGI on most films and for most scenes presently far outweigh the benefits. While CGI allows directors to create stunts that would be very expensive, dangerous or simply impossible to perform with real stunt people,&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt; the backlash has resulted in a new genre of "real" movies marketed on the basis that the scenes are real and that no CGI has been used to create the final production.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAssoc/&gt;

==Awards==
There is no [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] category for stunt performance, but in 1967, Yakima Canutt was awarded an honorary Oscar for his stunt career.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt; The [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] awards an [[Emmy]] for [[stunt coordinator]]s.

The [[Taurus World Stunt Awards]] gives stunt people their own annual awards, but also through its [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] offers financial support to stunt men around the world who have been injured while on the job.&lt;ref name=Freese/&gt;&lt;ref name=LPFHM/&gt;

==Deaths==
Although the stories that stuntmen died while filming ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'' and ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' are apocryphal myths, life-threatening injuries and deaths are not uncommon. Contracts often stipulate that the footage may be used if the performer is injured or dies during filming, and some filmmakers including Jackie Chan, consider it disrespectful not to do so.&lt;ref name=Guard184647&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-184647,00.html|title=Has a stuntman or stuntwoman performing a death-defying stunt in a film ever failed to defy death and instead been killed?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), a number of stunt performers and actors were injured, the most notable of which was [[Robert Drew Morgan|Robert Drew "Bob" Morgan]]. While filming a gunfight on a moving railroad flatcar loaded with logs, one of the chains that held the logs snapped, and Morgan was crushed by the falling timber.  Notwithstanding, this scene appeared fully in the film, in its entirety.  Morgan's wife, actress [[Yvonne De Carlo]], put her own career on hold, in order to nurse him back to health over five years; however, the couple later divorced in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81689098|title=Robert Drew "Bob" Morgan|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">A '''symmetry element''' is a point of reference about which [[symmetry operation]]s can take place. In particular, symmetry elements can be identities, mirror planes, axes of rotation (both proper and improper), and centers of inversion.&lt;ref name="Mortimer2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G. Mortimer|title=Mathematics for Physical Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoSv5tmATsC&amp;pg=PA276|date=10 June 2005|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-049288-9|pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A symmetry element corresponds to a symmetry operation that generates the same representation of an object.

==Identity==

The identity symmetry element is found in all objects and is denoted '''E'''.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Michael; Burns, Gerald; Glazer, Alexander. Space groups for solid state scientists.&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to an operation of doing nothing to the object.

==Mirror planes==

Mirror planes are denoted by '''σ'''. In particular, a vertical mirror plane is denoted '''σ{{sub|v}}'''.

==[[Cyclic symmetry]]==

Cyclic symmetry, also known as radial symmetry, is represented by an axis about which the object rotates in its corresponding symmetry operation. For proper axes of rotation, cyclic symmetry is denoted as '''C{{sub|n}}''', where n is the order of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, Michael; Burns, Gerald; Glazer, Alexander. Space groups for solid state scientists.&lt;/ref&gt;
Improper rotation, also known as [[screw axis]] symmetry, is denoted by '''S{{sub|n}}'''. 
Improper rotation is the composition of a rotation axis and a mirror plane. In its symmetry operation, the object is rotated about the axis, then reflected across a mirror plane that is normal to the axis of rotation.

==Inversion==

For inversion, denoted '''i''', there must be a point in the center of an object that is the inversion center. In the inversion operation for 3D coordinates, the inversion center is the origin (0,0,0). When an object is inverted, the position vector of a point in an object, ⟨x,y,z⟩, is inverted to ⟨-x,-y,-z⟩.

{{nihongo|'''''Sōgetsu-ryū'''''|草月流|}} is a school of ''[[Ikebana]]'', or [[Japan]]ese floral art.

== History ==
[[File:Teshigahara Sofu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The founder Sōfu Teshigahara in 1948]]
Sogetsu was founded by [[Sōfu Teshigahara]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikebanahq.org/sogetsu.php|title=Ikebana International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sofu's father was an Ikebana master, who taught his son from childhood.  Sofu wanted to become a painter, but he found that the possibilities for creative expression in using green materials are endless, just as in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kadensho, the book of flowers|last=Teshigahara|first=Sofu|publisher=Sogetsu Shuppan Inc.|year=1979|isbn=4-88145-001-8|location=|pages=9–12|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He found that the strict rules of traditional ikebana did not allow individual expression. He broke away from traditional ikebana and formed his school in 1926.&lt;ref name="sogetsu.or.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/know/about/timeline/|title=IKEBANA SOGETSU Time-line - Know Sogetsu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the beginning, he promoted the school through radio.

As of 2016, there have been four headmasters.  Sofu's daughter Kazumi was a gifted artist. She became the second headmaster until she died at age 47.  Her elder brother, film director [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]], took over.  The current headmaster is Akane, Sofu's granddaughter.&lt;ref name="sogetsu.or.jp"/&gt;

The Sogetsu school is an open-minded and avant-gardist school. The school was one of the first to have English textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Ikebana|last=Beunen|first=Ilse|publisher=Stichting Kunstboek|year=2015|isbn=978-90-5856-504-4|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ikebana DSC 9552 (13032184793).jpg|thumb|Free-style arrangement]]
A famous saying by Sofu Teshigahara and credo of the Sogetsu school is that Sogetsu can be done by anyone, anywhere, anytime with any kind of material. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ikebana Sogetsu|last=Teshigahara|first=Hiroshi|publisher=Shufunotomo co., Ltd.|year=1986|isbn=4-07-974618-0|location=|pages=1|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is led by Akane Teshigahara, the founder's granddaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/akane/profile/|title=IKEBANA SOGETSU Profile - Sogetsu and Akane Teshigahara|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted practitioners include Master Instructor Koka Fukushima, whose masterclasses worldwide have received acclaim in floral art circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2005/08/13/people/koka-fukushima/|title=Koka Fukushima|first=Vivienne|last=Kenrick|date=13 August 2005|publisher=|via=Japan Times Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Sogetsu-Kaikan-Akasaka-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Sōgetsu Hall headquarters in Tokyo]] 

The headquarters was constructed by the architect [[Kenzo Tange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogetsu.or.jp/e/know/hall/|title=IKEBANA SOGETSU Sogetsu HQ Building - Know Sogetsu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles ==
''Sōgetsu'' typically uses either a tall, narrow vase such as one made from a bamboo stem, or a flat, open dish in which the flowers and branches are fixed in a hidden [[kenzan]] spiked support. However, other forms are possible, including highly elaborate creations that fill an entire hall.  The arrangements in a tall vase are called Nageire, the once in a shallow container are called Moribana.

One of ''Sōgetsu'''s central ideas is that an arrangement should have three strong elements, each with certain proportions and arranged at a certain angle. But there is considerable latitude to work with whatever materials are available and to express the spirit of the moment.

== Headmasters ==

* 2nd Teshigahara Kasumi　(勅使河原霞), 1932-1980
* 3rd Teshigahara Hiroshi　(勅使河原宏), 1927-2001

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2008">'''''The Megaliths of Upper Laos''''' (orig. French: ''Les Megaliths du Haut Laos'') is a 1930 work of [[archaeology]] by [[Madeleine Colani]], examining and cataloging approximately ten thousand [[megalith]]s in [[Laos|Upper Laos]].&lt;ref name="hills-2008"&gt;Ben Hills, [http://www.smh.com.au/travel/activity/great-outdoors/crack-open-the-jars-20081113-63u7.html "Crack open the jars"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', Oct. 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to Colani's work, the megaliths were considered among the more mysterious megaliths.&lt;ref name="NYT-2012"&gt;Elisabeth Eaves, [http://travel.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/travel/in-laos-the-lady-and-the-jars.html "In Laos, the Lady and the Jars"], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Colani, after reviewing the [[Plain of Jars]] for decades, cataloged the megaliths and argued "convincingly" in ''The Megaliths of Upper Laos'' that they were [[urn]]s,&lt;ref name="NYT-2012" /&gt; used in [[Bronze Age]] [[funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell Ciochon and Jamie James, [http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/laoskeep.html "Laos Keeps Its Urns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715053256/http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/laoskeep.html |date=2009-07-15 }}, Ciochon's Bioanthropology Website, University of Iowa (last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Megaliths of Upper Laos'', a two-volume, 600-page work that both cataloged and described the artifacts, and presented Colani's theories as to their origin and use, has been described as Colani's "great contribution to archaeological literature".&lt;ref name="NYT-2012" /&gt;  The book brought the megaliths to the broader attention of the Western public and scholarly community.&lt;ref name="hills-2008" /&gt;

==Plot==
In late 19th-century New Mexico, Samuel Jones reappears hoping to reconcile with his adult daughter Magdalena "Maggie" Gilkeson. She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed. 

The [[U.S. Cavalry]] refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a [[Chiricahua]], and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco. After the two agree to join the group, and Maggie treats Honesco's injuries, Kayitah informs Maggie that Jones had been a member of their Chiricahua band where he gained the name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan ("shit for luck") during his wanderings.

It is finally with the combined efforts of the two families that they are able to free the women, at the cost of Kayitah's life, and immediately flee to the mountains with the kidnappers behind them. Knowing they have no other choice but to stand their ground, the group fights off the remaining kidnappers. During the battle, Jones fights El Brujo, the one responsible for kidnapping his granddaughter. When Brujo attempts to kill Maggie with a shotgun, Jones sacrifices his life to save his daughter as both he and Brujo fall off a cliff to their deaths. Maggie shoots at the last remaining kidnappers to scare them off. She realizes her father's love for her and finally forgives him.

Then she goes home with her father’s body, her daughters and the other kidnapped girls.

==Reception==

''The Missing'' was well received among Native American populations within the United States, many of which citing the use of the Apache language to be clearly spoken and well understood.&lt;ref name=seattletimes/&gt; Actors such as Tommy Lee Jones, Jay Tavare, Simon R. Baker, and others had to learn to speak the Chiricahua dialect of the Apache language that was used throughout the film.&lt;ref name=amind.net&gt;{{cite web| url=http://americanindian.net/reviewsthemissing.html| title=Phil Konstantin's Review of The Missing| author=Phil Konstantin| date=September 2004| publisher=AmericanIndian.net| accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavare has noted that there are only about 300 people still fluent in Chiricahua today, and following screenings of the film, Native American students said the film helped stimulate pride through its authenticity.&lt;ref name="seattletimes" /&gt;

''The Missing'' grossed $27 million domestically and $11.4 million internationally for a worldwide total of $38.4 million.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{mojo title|missing03|The Missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{plot|date=January 2013}}
A widow wanted her son to learn a trade. He insisted that he wanted to be a thief. She predicted he would end up hanging from a bridge.  One day he did not go to church, and told her that the first trade she heard when she came out would be his. He came to the path and shouted "Thievery" in a disguised voice. She again predicted he would hang from the bridge but gave him to the Black Gallows Bird to learn the trade. The man taught him, and then said they must rob a man who had sold his cattle. On Halloween, they hid in the loft. The shifty lad went down and stirred up the cattle, sending people out; while they were gone, he stole nuts and sewed a leather hide to the thief. He cracked nuts, though the thief warned him he would be heard. He was heard, and the people came, and the thief ran off with the hide still attached. The people said he was stealing the hide and chased him. The Shifty Lad stole the gold and silver while they were gone, and brought them to the thief; they split them.  

Soon, a tenant sent a man to get a wether to give as a wedding gift. The Shifty Lad bet his master that he could steal it from the man's back. When he was coming, the lad put a dirty shoe in his path; the man said that if he had the other one, he would clean this one and have a pair. The Shifty Lad ran ahead of his, and put the shoe in the way again. The man went back to get the other, and the lad took the wether and the shoes and won his bet.  The tenant sent the same man after a kid. The lad bleated like the wether, and when the man searched for it, thinking to come back with both, the lad stole the kid. The third time, the tenant directed him to never let the wether go, and so he brought it home.

The shifty lad had his master hang him, and let him down when he kicked his legs. He praised it, and his master let him hang him, but the lad killed him. His wife was angry, and the lad fled. He took service with a wright who lived next to the king's storehouse, and broke into it to steal. The gifts persuaded the wright and his wife to let him. At the advice of the Seanagal, the king set a hogshead of pitch to catch the thief, and it caught the wright. The lad cut off his head to prevent their learning who he was.

The king displayed the body to discover who grieved at the sight, but when the wright's wife cried out, he cut his foot and pretended she cried over that. Then the body was hung from a tree for the same reason. The lad took a horse with casks of whiskey by them, as if he were hiding from the soldiers. They chased him, and he fled, leaving the horse. They took it back, found the whiskey, and became drunk. The lad took the body. The king sent a black pig about to dig up the body. When it rooted about the wright's house, the lad sent the soldiers inside to eat and drink while it searched. He killed the pig and buried it while they ate. The king sent men to discover where people had pig's flesh they could not account for; the lad killed the soldiers sent to his house, and then started a rumor that the soldiers meant to massacre them, so all the people killed the soldiers.  

The Seanagal advised to give a ball, since the man would be the boldest and dance with the princess; when the lad did so, the Seanagal marked him with a black dot, but the lad saw it and marked the Seanagal himself with two and twenty other men with one. The king decided that he was beaten, and that he wanted so clever a man for his son-in-law. He had all the men with the black dots put in a room, and had a child give one an apple. The lad drew him with a shaving and a drone, and the child gave him the apple. They took the shaving and drone, but the child remembered them and still gave him the apple, so the shifty lad married the princess.  

One day, while they walked on the bridge, the lad told the princess that his mother said he would hang from that bridge. She said that if he wished to go over the wall, she would hold him by her handkerchief. He did, and hanged there, but a cry went up about a fire, startling the princess. She let go. The lad fell and died.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3811">'''Theatre studies''' (sometimes referred to as '''theatrology''' or '''dramatics''') is the study of theatrical performance in relation to its literary, physical, psycho-biological, sociological, and historical contexts. It is an interdisciplinary field which also encompasses the study of theatrical [[aesthetics]] and [[semiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;Helbo, André (1987).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6646">'''THINK AGAIN''' is an artist-activist collaborative founded in 1997 by David John Attyah (b. Los Angeles) and [[S.A. Bachman]] (b. Columbus, Ohio.) They produce interventions that recruit art-making in the service of public address. Their work — digital murals, billboards and wallscapes, exterior projections, and viral poster campaigns — links the global to the local and combines cultural theory, sociological research, and activism to create a visual language for engaging civic dialogue. THINK AGAIN projects have explored a diverse range of issues including  queer liberation; the ways capitalism and misogyny conspire to jeopardize women and the outnumbered; the logic of militarization; international labor and the treatment of immigrants; and gentrification and displacement.

Many of its projects privilege face-to-face interactions: handing out postcards at Pride parades, parking mobile billboards in front of City Halls and grocery stores, and disseminating posters to activists mobilizing against the war machine. THINK AGAIN has distributed tens of thousands of printed matter free-of-charge through art spaces, grassroots community organizations, unions and the internet. Documentation of the work of THINK AGAIN can be found at http://sabachman.com and http://www.dja-art.work

=== Projects ===
*'''Actions Speak''' (2008-2010) is a multi-media project examining political brutality and public policy, and reconsiders social problems like HIV/AIDS and violence against women. The project features a 17 x 67 foot interior wall mural and a concurrent outdoor projection.  Debuting the week before the 2008 Presidential Election, ''Actions Speak'' promotes dialogue between art and public response, between global reality and local action. Commissioned by the [[Worcester Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agitart.org/actionsspeak/ www.agitart.org/actionsspeak]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-m-l.org/?q=node/171 www.c-m-l.org/?q=node/171]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://agitart.org/actionsspeak/press/afterimage.pdf AFTERIMAGE Vol. 38 No. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The NAFTA Effect''' (2006-2007) is a series of public projections in Los Angeles addressing how [[free trade]] reshapes the lives of people on both sides of the [[United States–Mexico border]].
*'''Hola/Hello''' (2002 and 2006) includes postcards and installations that link the rape, sexualized violence, and [[Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez|murder of over three hundred unidentified women]] in [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], to the structural effects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and intergovernmental relations between the US and Mexico.
*'''Protestgraphics''' (2001-2004) was one of the first websites to respond to the 9/11, U.S. military action in Iraq and Central Asia, violence against Arab and Muslim Americans, and to the Bush administration's [[War on Terrorism]]. In addition to the online archive, 500 sets of posters were distributed free of charge to organizations and activists internationally. Major campaign:  "Act Like It's A Globe, Not An Empire."
*'''CIA.TV''' (2001-2003) included a mobile billboard in [[Los Angeles, California]] and a web debate inviting the public to think critically about the increasingly blurry lines between news and entertainment at a political moment when federal agencies want permission to withhold information from the public, seek expanded surveillance authority and increase their budgets.
*'''Target Marketing Is Not A Social Movement''' (2001-2002) is a mobile billboard and postcard project that addressed [[target market]]ing and "Gay Chic."
*'''Popping The Question''' (2000) is a caravan of mobile billboards circulated throughout the cities of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and [[San Francisco, California]] intended to inspire public debate about the topics of marriage and family.

'''Trinity Church''' ({{lang-sv|Heliga trefaldighetskyrkan}}) is a [[church (building)|church building]] in [[Kristianstad]], [[Sweden]], built between 1617 and 1628 by [[Christian IV of Denmark]]. He had founded the city of Kristianstad in 1614 at a time when [[Scania]] was part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. The church's large size and style reveal the king's ambitions for his new city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydsverige.dk/?pageID=153 Heliga Trefaldighets kyrka. From Syssverige.dk. Danish.] Retrieved 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Trefoldighedskirken indre 2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Nave and chancel.]]
Designed by the Flemish-Danish architect, [[Lorenz van Steenwinckel]], the grand building is widely considered by many to be [[Scandinavia]]'s finest [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] church. Its extensive nave is able to accommodate congregations of up to 1,400. Like many Danish churches of the times, it is built of red brick. But this church is decorated with many sandstone statues and ornaments, including several monograms of Christian IV, testifying to his involvement.

The well-preserved interior is decked with star-shaped [[Groin vault|cross vaults]], supported by pillars of granite. Trinity Church has been little altered since it was built. The main addition is its 59-meter-tall tower constructed in 1865. The church is pleasantly and abundantly illuminated thanks to its 26 tall windows.

The entrance through the western tower opens into a six-bay nave, with wide aisles, terminating in a projecting eastern sanctuary. The vaults are covered with a cross-gabled roof, with large ornamented gables on the north and south sides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zKH3j0X8mgcC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=trinity+church+architecture+kristianstad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RsI0GpfZ19&amp;sig=KficaLWaDllHnYtRfJFrZalzkOw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tDouS62NBsXPjAei__WeBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=trinity%20church%20architecture%20kristianstad&amp;f=false Marian Card Donnelly: Architecture in the Scandinavian countries.

==Furnishings and decorations==

The pulpit, which is sculpted in Belgian and Italian marble, shows Christ and the four evangelists. The impressive canopy hanging above the pulpit weighs almost a ton.

The Baroque organ case survives, including the case pipes, from German-born Johan Lorentz's &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musikhistoriskmuseum.dk/reg/lorentzx.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912192522/http://www.musikhistoriskmuseum.dk/reg/lorentzx.htm |archivedate=2005-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1630 organ, but the organ itself has been replaced.

[[William Blake]] illustrated ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' more often than any other work by [[John Milton]], and illustrated Milton's work more often than that of any other writer. The illustrations demonstrate his critical engagement with the text, specifically his efforts to redeem the "errors" he perceived in his predecessor's work.

==Description and provenance==
[[File:But536.1.4.wc.100.jpg|thumb|''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'' (1808), version from the "Butts set"]]

'''The Thomas set'''

The paintings of the Thomas set are each approximately 10x 8.25 inches. They were commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas at an unrecorded date, sometime before 1807. Although the sheets were trimmed at some time, obliterating the date from several, some still retain the date of 1807, establishing the year of their completion. Thomas' grandson inherited them from his father, and sold them at [[Sotheby's]] in 1872. By 1876 they were in the collection of Alfred Aspland, who by 1885 took them to Sotheby's again, dispersing the set among several buyers. [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]] reunited the works in 1914, and today they are still in the collection of the [[Huntington Library]].

'''The Butts set'''

The dimensions of the Butts set, also known as the "large set", are 19.5x15.5 inches, nearly twice that of the Thomas set. Dated 1808, they were commissioned from Blake by his patron Thomas Butts, who also commissioned many paintings on biblical themes from Blake. In the early 1850s, Butts' son Thomas Butts Jr. offered the individual paintings for sale at several auctions, resulting in the dispersal of the set. Today it remains divided between four museums. Nine of the paintings were sold at Messrs. Foster in 1853 to J. C. Strange, passing through several other hands before they were acquired by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], their present owner. The other three were sold to one "Fuller" at an unknown date, from whom the passed to H.A.J. Munro. Munro further complicated matters by selling the three paintings to separate buyers at [[Christie's]] in 1868. No. 1 was acquired by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1869, No. 2 by [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]] in 1916, and No. 10 by the [[Houghton Library]] in 1966.

'''The Linnell set'''

The Linnell set is incomplete – it contains only ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'', ''The Creation of Eve'' and ''Michael Foretells the Crucifixion''. These are exactly the same as their corresponding entries in the Butts set in both size and composition, the major difference being their loose handling of the watercolor. Like the Linnell set of [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|William Blake's ''Illustrations of the Book of Job'']], these were commissioned by Blake's patron [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]], and traced by Linnell from the Butts set. An entry in Linnell's journal dates the commission to 9 May 1822. Currently ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'' and ''The Creation of Eve'' are in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], and ''Michael Foretells the Crucifixion'' is in the collection of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].

==Analysis==
[[File:THe Four Zoas.jpg|thumb|Illustration to ''[[Milton a Poem]]''. In Blake's mythology, Adam and Satan are two extremes of the fallen Albion.]]
There are twelve plates in each of the ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' sets, one for each of the books in the poem. While some of these, such as ''Satan, Sin and Death: Satan Comes to the Gates of Hell'', depict specific scenes from the epic; others, such as ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'', are syntheses of several scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar 1980, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, Blake employed visual barriers to separate the elements from different scenes, such as the arc of the bower in ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve''.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar 1980, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Blake's mythology|Blake's mythology]], [[Albion (Blake)|Albion]]'s fall from a divine [[androgyny]] to a sexual nature divides him into the Four Zoas, their spectres (representative of hypocritical morality), and their emanations (female halves). In the ''Paradise Lost'' illustrations, Adam is analogous to the fallen [[Albion (Blake)|Albion]], Satan to Adam's [[Spectre (Blake)|Spectre]] and Eve to Adam's [[William Blake's mythology|emanation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
