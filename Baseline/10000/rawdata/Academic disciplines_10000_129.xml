      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6408">In [[computer science]], specifically in [[algorithm]]s related to [[pathfinding]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be '''admissible''' if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | year = 2002

 | isbn = 0-13-790395-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Search algorithms ==
An admissible heuristic is used to estimate the cost of reaching the 
goal state in an [[informed search algorithm]]. In order for a heuristic
to be admissible to the search problem, the estimated cost must always 
be lower than or equal to the actual cost of reaching the goal state. 
The search algorithm uses the admissible heuristic to find an estimated 
optimal path to the goal state from the current node. 
For example, in [[A* search]] the evaluation function (where 
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the current node) is:

&lt;math&gt;f(n) = g(n) + h(n)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; = the evaluation function.
:&lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;/math&gt; = the cost from the start node to the current node
:&lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; = estimated cost from current node to goal.

&lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is calculated using the heuristic 
function. With a non-admissible heuristic, the A* algorithm could 
overlook the optimal solution to a search problem due to an 
overestimation in &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formulation==

: &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a node
: &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a heuristic
: &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is cost indicated by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to reach a goal from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;h^*(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal cost to reach a goal from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; is admissible if, &lt;math&gt;\forall n&lt;/math&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;h(n) \leq h^*(n)&lt;/math&gt;

==Construction==
An admissible heuristic can be derived from a [[Relaxation (approximation)|relaxed]]
version of the problem, or by information from pattern databases that store exact solutions to subproblems of the problem, or by using [[Inductive transfer|inductive learning]] methods.

==Examples==
Two different examples of admissible heuristics apply to the [[fifteen puzzle]] problem:
* [[Hamming distance]]
* [[Manhattan distance]]

The [[Hamming distance]] is the total number of misplaced tiles. It is clear that this heuristic is admissible since the total number of moves to order the tiles correctly is at least the number of misplaced tiles (each tile not in place must be moved at least once). The cost (number of moves) to the goal (an ordered puzzle) is at least the [[Hamming distance]] of the puzzle.

The Manhattan distance of a puzzle is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;h(n)=\sum_\text{all tiles} \mathit{distance}(\text{tile, correct position})&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the puzzle below in which the player wishes to move each tile such that the numbers are ordered. The Manhattan distance is an admissible heuristic in this case because every tile will have to be moved at least the number of spots in between itself and its correct position.&lt;ref name="Korf,2000"&gt;{{Citation | first=Richard E. | last=Korf | contribution-url=https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2000/AAAI00-212.pdf | doi=10.1007/3-540-44914-0_3 | contribution=Recent progress in the design and analysis of admissible heuristic functions | series=SARA 2000.

The subscripts show the Manhattan distance for each tile. The total Manhattan distance for the shown puzzle is:
:&lt;math&gt;h(n)=3+1+0+1+2+3+3+4+3+2+4+4+4+1+1=36&lt;/math&gt;

==Optimality Guarantee==
If an admissible heuristic is adapted in an algorithm (for example in [[A* search algorithm]]), then this algorithm would eventually find an optimal solution to the goal. A well-known and easy-to-understand example is [[breadth-first search]]. In the case of BFS, the heuristic evaluation function &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; equals to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for each node &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which is obviously less than the actual cost (thus '''underestimated'''). This heuristic would cause the BFS algorithm to search literally all the possible paths and eventually find the optimal solution (i.e., the shortest path to the goal).

As an example&lt;ref&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23970588/why-do-admissable-heuristics-guarantee-optimality&lt;/ref&gt; of why admissibility can guarantee optimality, let's say we have costs as follows:(the cost above/below a node is the heuristic, the cost at an edge is the actual cost)

  0     10   0   100   0
 START ----  O  ----- GOAL
  |                   |
 0|                   |100
  |                   | 
  O ------- O  ------ O
 100   1    100   1   100

So clearly we'd start off visiting the top middle node, since the expected total cost, i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;10 + 0 = 10&lt;/math&gt;. Then the goal would be a candidate, with &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;10+100+0=110&lt;/math&gt;. Then we'd clearly pick the bottom nodes one after the other, followed by the updated goal, since they all have &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; lower than the &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; of the current goal, i.e. their &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;100, 101, 102, 102&lt;/math&gt;. So even though the goal was a candidate, we couldn't pick it because there were still better paths out there. This way, an admissible heuristic can ensure optimality.

However, note that although an admissible heuristic can guarantee final optimality, it's not necessarily efficient.

==Notes==
While all [[consistent heuristic]]s are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent.

For tree search problems, if an admissible heuristic is used, the [[A* search algorithm]] will never return a suboptimal goal node.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9137">'''Agent-assisted automation''' is a type of [[call center]] technology that automates elements of what the call center agent 1) does with his/her desktop tools and/or 2) says to customers during the call using pre-recorded audio. It is a relatively new{{when?|date=November 2017}} category of call center technology that shows promise in improving call center productivity and compliance.

== Types of agent-assisted automation ==
;Desktop integration

Desktop integration is focused on how the agents interact with their desktop tools. The main challenge is that there are often many desktop tools, some new, some [[legacy system]]. These tools can make the process of handling customers’ requests quite cumbersome and time consuming. That time on the phone can often be frustrating for customers and expensive for companies. By using software to integrate the tools, the process can be streamlined. For example, information can be entered once and populated across multiple tools or doing a step in one tool can automatically accomplish a different step in another desktop tool.

;Pre-recorded audio

Pre-recorded audio (sometimes referred to as [[soundboard (computer program)]] or as soundboard technology) is another form of agent-assisted automation. The purpose of using pre-recorded messages is to increase the probability (and in some cases error-proof the process so) that the right information is provided to customers at the right time. The required disclosures are pre-recorded to ensure accuracy and understandability. By integrating the recordings with the [[customer relationship management]] software, the right combination of disclosures can be played based on the combination of goods and services the customer purchased. The integration with the [[customer relationship management]] software also ensures that the order cannot be submitted until the disclosures are played, essentially error-proofing ([[poka-yoke]]) the process of ensuring the customer gets all the required [[consumer protection]] information.

Phone surveys are ideal applications of this technology. Whether surveying market preferences or political views, the pre-recorded audio with an agent listening allows the questions to be asked in the same way every time, uninfluenced by the agents' fatigue levels, accents, or their own views. 
 
;Fraud prevention

[[Fraud prevention]] is a specialized type of agent-assisted automation focused on reducing [[ID theft]] and [[credit card fraud]]. ID theft and credit card fraud are huge threats for call centers and their customers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7953401.stm| title= Overseas credit card scam exposed| work= bbc.co.uk.com |date= March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and few good solutions exist, but new agent-assisted automation solutions are producing promising results. The technology allows the agents to remain on the phone while the customers use their phone key pads to enter the information. The tones are masked and the information passes directly into the [[customer relationship management]] system or [[payment gateway]] in the case of credit card transactions. The automation essentially makes it impossible for call center agents and also call center personnel that might be monitoring the calls to steal the [[Payment card number|credit card number]], social security number, or other [[personally identifiable information]].

;Outbound [[telemarketing]]

Another specialized application space of agent-assisted automation goes under numerous headings including outbound prospecting, [[cold calling]], solicitation, [[fund-raising]], etc. Turnover is high among agents engaged in this kind of work because the task is tedious and emotionally difficult. It is tedious because you spend the bulk of your day, not talking to qualified leads, but in getting wrong numbers and answering machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Madrigal | first=Alexis| url= http://m.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/almost-human-the-surreal-cyborg-future-of-telemarketing/282537/| title= Almost Human:  The Surreal Cyborg Future of Telemarketing | work= The Atlantic |date= December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As good and as ubiquitous as predictive dialing technology has become, it still makes a lot of mistakes because the phone number inputs are outdated. It is emotionally difficult work because, beyond the tedium, you spend a lot of time hearing the word “No!”, getting hung-up on, and cussed at. The pre-recorded audio allows you to dispense with wrong numbers and answering machines while you move onto the next call. Agents can easily handle two or three overlapping calls, an immediate productivity hit. Additionally, agents using the technology don’t seem to take the gruff treatment as personally. They report that it feels as if the customer is saying “no” to the software, not to them. Finally, contribution amounts and conversion rates can be improved by adding some intelligence into the scripts, for example by raising and lowering the initial contribution amount based on the wealth of the area you are calling into or using pre-recorded audio with different accents, Southern when calling in the South, for example.  Another benefit of the technology is that it enables the work to be done by lower cost agents in offshore locations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Schelmetic | first=Tracey| url= http://www.tmcnet.com/channels/predictive-dialer/articles/365304-automated-outbound-sales-go-high-tech.htm| title= Automated Outbound Sales Go High-Tech | work= tmcnet.com |date= January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Benefits==
Just as [[automation]] has benefited manufacturing by reducing the mental and physical effort required of workers while simultaneously improving throughput, quality, and safety, agent-assisted automation is improving call center results while reducing the tiring aspects of the job for agents.

In some cases, the agent-assisted automation streamlines the process and allows calls to be handled more quickly. By eliminating cutting and pasting from one application to another, by auto-navigating applications, and by providing a single view of the customer, agent-assisted automation can reduce call handle time and increase agent productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carden |first=Francis |url=http://www.connectionsmagazine.com/articles/2009/improve-agent-productivity.html |title=Improving Call Center Agent Productivity and Customer Service |publisher=connectionsmagazine.com |date=November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303175330/http://www.connectionsmagazine.com/articles/2009/improve-agent-productivity.html |archivedate=2014-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, in theory, the more steps that can be automated and the more logic that can be built into the call flow (e.g., if the customer buys items 2 and 9, then disclosures a, c, and f are read by the pre-recorded audio), then companies may be able to reduce the amount of training that is required of the agents while at the same time ensuring more consistency and accuracy. However, no published studies have reported this result yet.

But an even larger problem in [[call centers]] is between-agent variation in behavior and results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Adsit | first=Dennis| url= http://www.isixsigma.com/operations/call-centers/fixing-between-agent-variation-can-make-all-difference/| title= Fixing Between-agent Variation Can Make All the Difference | publisher= isixsigma.com |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents differ in the amount of training and coaching they receive, they differ in the amount of experience they have, their jobs are repetitious and tiring, and the process and procedures the agents are supposed to follow constantly change. Moreover, there are significant individual differences between agents in their intelligence, personality, motivations, etc. which all affect performance. Despite the large amount of money call centers have spent over decades trying to reduce between-agent variation, the problem is still so prevalent that one large study of customer interactions with call centers found that a customer’s experience was completely a function of the quality of the agent who happened to answer the phone.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, J., Coffman, C., Harter, J. (July-August, 2005) Manage Your Human Sigma, Harvard Business Review, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the most significant benefit of agent-assisted automation may prove to be in how the automation error-proofs or [[poka-yoke]] the process and ensures that something that needs to be done or said happens every time. Properly implemented, the between-agent variation for whatever step of the process the automation is applied to may be able to be reduced to near zero.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, S. (2008) How to win a no-win situation. ''In Queue''. http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/images/stories/InQueue/vol3no12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in a [[collection agency]] whose processes and procedures are closely regulated by the [[Fair Debt Collection Practices Act]].

'''Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets (ASTEP)''' is a program established by [[NASA]] to sponsor research projects that advance the technology and techniques used in [[planetary exploration]].  The objective is to enable the study of [[astrobiology]] and to aid the planning of extraterrestrial exploration missions while prioritizing science, technology, and field campaigns.

==Overview==
ASTEP is one of four elements of NASA's Astrobiology Program, which falls under the Planetary Science Division of the Science Mission Directorate. According to the formal description from NASA, "The ASTEP program sponsors the development of technologies that enable remote searches for, and identification of, life in extreme environments, including planetary surfaces and subsurfaces."&lt;ref name="IceBite"&gt;(Marinova, 2010)  http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_expedition&amp;task=detail&amp;id=3388&amp;type=blog&amp;pid=19&lt;/ref&gt; ASTEP is concerned with discovering technologies which will enable scientists to study astrobiology both on the surface of the Earth and on extraterrestrial bodies. A central focus of ASTEP's research is terrestrial field campaigns, or long-duration expeditions where researchers live in the same region they are studying. These are conducted on Earth in remote or hostile locations, such as Antarctica or the bottom of the ocean. Through understanding complex and exotic life on Earth, such as [[extremophile]]s, scientists hope to better define the characteristics they should look for and the locations they should seek when attempting to discover extraterrestrial life.

==Methodology==
ASTEP funded projects typically perform research by searching for and studying [[extremophile]] biology in Earth's harshest environments through the use of field research campaigns. The environments where this research is conducted is meant to simulate the expected conditions on extraterrestrial worlds in the Solar System. Past field work has typically targeted two regions. Arctic and Antarctic climates simulate the low temperatures expected on many other planets such as [[Mars]], near rover landing sites.&lt;ref name="IceBite"/&gt; Underwater regions are also an area of study because they simulate high pressure, low light and variable temperature conditions. This region simulates proposed missions to explore the vast liquid water ocean that is expected to reside under Jupiter's moon, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].&lt;ref name="MidCaymen"&gt;(German, 2009) http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3287/oases-for-life-on-the-mid-caymen-rise&lt;/ref&gt;

ASTEP promotes the development of new exploration technologies and techniques that can search, identify, and study life in extreme conditions in locations that are difficult to access. There is a broad range of things that can fall into this category. Previous examples include laboratories such as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]], sampling techniques, the [[Mars rovers]], the Titan lander ([[Huygens (spacecraft)|Huygens]]), and submersibles.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;(Billings, Apout ASTEP, 2008) {{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/astep/about/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528091403/http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/astep/about/ |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomous systems are preferred because data can be collected without the presence of humans near the test area. The field campaigns are used as a proof-of-concept for the proposed technologies as well as a demonstration. They are generally tested with mock-mission where conditions and challenges simulate those that might be experienced on an actual mission. This helps identify their strengths and weaknesses in the technology’s mission execution and structural endurance.

Beyond the practice of new technologies, ASTEP strives to learn more about astrobiology through observation and study on the field campaigns. Analyzing the collected samples helps researchers determine the thermal, photonic, pressure, and chemical boundary conditions for living organisms. Understanding how these organisms adapt and evolve in these extreme conditions may be similar to the methods used by extraterrestrial organisms, and thus offers clues about where life may be found. Another area of study is the environmental footprint that [[extremophile]] life leaves behind, [[biomolecule]]s or [[biosignature]]s such as chemical trails, geological formations, etc. Identifying these clues often inspires new biology searching techniques, and simplifies mission planning.

==Other projects==
[[Stromatolite]] building provides important geological information on the history of [[microorganism]]s dating back to over a billion years ago. In recent years, ASTEP has been researching how these layered fossils could have formed by studying modern day [[microbial mat]]s, which leave stromatolite similar to their ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;(Schirber, [[Astrobiology Magazine]], 2010) http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/3418/first-fossil-makers-in-hot-water&lt;/ref&gt;

ASTEP's instrument development program is currently working on a prototype to detect the presence of [[DNA]] on the Martian surface.&lt;ref name="IceBite"/&gt; The prototype will replicate any DNA found in Martian ice or regolith using [[polymerase chain reaction]] amplification techniques.

The [[IceBite]] Project involves testing drills for future Martian missions where ice will need to be penetrated. The research is being conducted in high altitude Antarctic valleys which closely resemble the ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'' landing site in geologic composition.&lt;ref name="IceBite" /&gt; As of 2009, the scientists have successfully completed the first phase of the three-year mission, which was to probe the region, install scientific  instruments, and determine the future testing sites.&lt;ref name="IceBite"/&gt;

A team of ASTEP scientists are exploring the [[Cayman Trough|Mid-Cayman Spreading Center]], a wide ridge at the westernmost region of the Cayman Trough. Oceanic life reaches the extremes at the depths, where the pressure is the greatest and underwater [[sea vent]]s pump hot and mineral-rich water into the ocean. Project researchers think [[extraterrestrial life]] could be similar to the exotic life forms found near these vents. The submersible [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]] was developed by ASTEP to autonomously survey the hydrothermal vent systems at the depths of the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center.&lt;ref name="MidCaymen"/&gt;

==Publicity==
In order to raise awareness about the research being conducted under the auspices of ASTEP, scientists have been increasingly using blogs as a way to convey information about their studies, typically when they are performing science at a remote location on a terrestrial field test. Scientists have also begun contacting museums via satellite uplink to discuss astrobiology with the public.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; The most prominent blog is produced by NASA's IceBite team, which performs annual expeditions to Antarctica.

Some commentators have noted the necessity of bureaucracies in modern society. The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which one can organize the human activity and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies are necessary to maintain order, maximize [[efficiency]], and eliminate favoritism. On the other hand, Weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to [[individual freedom]], with the potential of trapping individuals in an impersonal "[[iron cage]]" of rule-based, rational control.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRitzer"/&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
The term "bureaucracy" is French in origin and combines the French word ''bureau'' – desk or office – with the Greek word κράτος (''Kratos'') – rule or political power.&lt;ref name= "merriam-webster1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bureaucracy |title= Bureaucracy | type = definition | work = Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was coined in the mid-18th century by the French economist [[Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Riggs | first = Fred W | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000366/036645fo.pdf | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] |trans-title=Introduction: semantic evolution of the ‘bureaucracy’ term | language = fr | title = Introduction : Évolution sémantique du terme 'bureaucratie' | journal = Revue internationale des sciences sociales | publisher = Unesco | place = Paris | volume = XXX I | year = 1979 | number = 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a satirical pejorative from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Anter, Andreas. [http://trivium.revues.org/3794 L'histoire de l'État comme histoire de la bureaucratie]. ''Trivium'', 7; 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Gournay never wrote the term down but was later quoted at length in a letter from a contemporary:
{{quotation |The late M. de Gournay... sometimes used to say: "We have an illness in France which bids fair to play havoc with us; this illness is called bureaumania." Sometimes he used to invent a fourth or fifth form of government under the heading of "bureaucracy."|[[Baron von Grimm]]&lt;ref name= "Handbook"/&gt;}}

The first known English-language use dates to 1818.&lt;ref name= "merriam-webster1"/&gt; Here, too, the sense was pejorative, with Irish novelist [[Sydney, Lady Morgan|Lady Morgan]] referring to "the Bureaucratie, or office tyranny, by which Ireland has so long been governed."&lt;ref name = "lady morgan"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nCc1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35|title=Florence Macarthy|first= Sydney|last=Lady Morgan|accessdate= 2014-11-18|page=35|year=1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, the word was being used in a more neutral sense, referring to a system of public administration in which offices were held by unelected career officials. In this sense "bureaucracy" was seen as a distinct form of management, often subservient to a monarchy.&lt;ref name= "google1"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KtFI15WCr_8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Bureaucracy|first=David|last= Beetham|publisher= Google |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the definition was expanded by the German sociologist [[Max Weber]] to include any system of administration conducted by trained professionals according to fixed rules.&lt;ref name= "google1"/&gt; Weber saw the bureaucracy as a relatively positive development; however, by 1944 the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises noted that the term bureaucracy was "always applied with an opprobrious connotation,"&lt;ref name= "Mises" /&gt; and by 1957 the American sociologist Robert Merton noted that the term "[[bureaucrat]]" had become an [[epithet]].&lt;ref name= "Merton" /&gt;

==History==

===Ancient===
[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|Students competed in [[imperial examination]]s to receive a position in the bureaucracy of [[ancient China]].]]
Although the term "bureaucracy" was not coined until the mid 18th century, organized and consistent administrative systems are much older. The development of writing (ca. 3500 BC) and the use of documents was critical to the administration of this system, and the first definitive emergence of bureaucracy is in ancient [[Sumer]], where an emergent class of [[scribe]]s used [[clay tablet]]s to administer the harvest and allocate its spoils.&lt;ref name="Scribes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|editor=Jack M. Sasson|year=1995|publisher=Macmillan Library Reference|chapter=The Scribes and Scholars of Ancient Mesopotamia|author=Laurie E. Pearce|pages=2265–2278|url=https://www.academia.edu/562267/The_scribes_and_scholars_of_ancient_Mesopotamia|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]] also had a hereditary class of scribes that administered the [[civil service]] bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Scribal training"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scribal Training in Ancient Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=92|number=2|year=1972|author=Ronald J. Williams|jstor=600648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] was administered by a hierarchy of regional proconsuls and their deputies. The reforms of [[Diocletian]] doubled the number of administrative districts and led to a large-scale expansion of Roman bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;As taken from the ''[[Laterculus Veronensis]]'' or ''Verona List'', reproduced in Barnes, ''New Empire'', chs. 12–13 (with corrections in T.D. Barnes, "Emperors, panegyrics, prefects, provinces and palaces (284–317)", ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 9 (1996): pp. 539–42). See also: Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9; Cascio, "The New State of Diocletian and Constantine" (CAH), 179; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Christian author [[Lactantius]] claimed that Diocletian's reforms led to widespread economic stagnation, since "the provinces were divided into minute portions, and many presidents and a multitude of inferior officers lay heavy on each territory."&lt;ref name="Lactantius"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lactantius|author-link=Lactantius|title=On the Manner in which the Persecutors Died|chapter=Chapter 7|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Empire split, the [[Byzantine Empire]] developed a notoriously [[Byzantine bureaucracy|complicated administrative hierarchy]], and in time the term "Byzantine" came to refer to any complex bureaucratic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/byzantine|title=Byzantine – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-webster.com|date=2012-08-31|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient China]], the [[Han dynasty]] established a complicated bureaucracy based on the teachings of [[Confucius]], who emphasized the importance of [[Li (Confucian)|ritual]] in a family, relationships, and politics.&lt;ref name="Confucius"&gt;{{cite book|author=Riegel, Jeffrey|chapter=Confucius|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Spring 2012|editor=Edward N. Zalta|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/confucius}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each subsequent Dynasty, the bureaucracy evolved. During the [[Song dynasty]], the bureaucracy became [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]. Following the [[Song dynasty|Song]] reforms, [[imperial examination|competitive exams]] were held to determine who was qualified to hold a given position.&lt;ref name="McKnight1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=Brian E.|title=Village and Bureaucracy in Southern Sung China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEr8_6LieVMC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=1983-02-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56060-1|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial examination system lasted until 1905, six years before the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]], marking the end of China's traditional bureaucratic system.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Modern===
====The United Kingdom====
[[File:London customs house 18th century.jpg|thumb|The 18th century [[HM Customs and Excise|Department of Excise]] developed a sophisticated bureaucracy. Pictured, the [[Custom House, London]].]]
A modern form of bureaucracy evolved in the expanding [[HM Customs and Excise|Department of Excise]] in the United Kingdom during the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{original research inline|date=June 2016}} The relative efficiency and professionalism in this state-run authority allowed the government to impose a very large [[tax burden]] on the population and raise great sums of money for [[military budget|war expenditure]]. According to [[Niall Ferguson]], the bureaucracy was based on "recruitment by examination, training, promotion on merit, regular salaries and pensions, and standardized procedures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNwfbPVMb_wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Cash Nexus: Money and Politics in Modern History, 1700-2000|author=Niall Ferguson|year=2013|publisher=Penguin UK|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was subject to a strict hierarchy and emphasis was placed on technical and efficient methods for tax collection.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Instead of the inefficient and often corrupt system of [[tax farming]] that prevailed in [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] states such as France, the [[Exchequer]] was able to exert control over the entire system of tax revenue and government expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/workingPapers/2012/WP167.pdf|title=3 Public finance in China and Britain in the long eighteenth century|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, the ratio of fiscal bureaucracy to population in Britain was approximately 1 in 1300, almost four times larger than the second most heavily bureaucratized nation, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPxlQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Linda+Weiss%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Kc8gUqOwGKay7AbL7IFA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAw|title=States and Economic Development: A Comparative Historical Analysis|author1=Linda Weiss |author2=John Hobson |year=1995|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], argued in his ''Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China'' (1847) that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution [[meritocratic]].&lt;ref name="Bodde"/&gt; Influenced by the ancient Chinese [[imperial examination]], the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than "preferment, patronage, or purchase".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf Full text of the Northcote-Trevelyan Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222072511/http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf |date=22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodde"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to implementation of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=David|title=Fair game|publisher=The Guardian|date=2003-07-09|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate =2003-07-09|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
Like the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system. Under [[Louis XIV of France]], the old nobility had neither power nor political influence, their only privilege being exemption from taxes. The dissatisfied noblemen complained about this "unnatural" state of affairs, and discovered similarities between [[absolute monarchy]] and bureaucratic [[despotism]].&lt;ref name="Jacoby1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Jacoby|title=The Bureaucratization of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGwVaki8uXIC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=September 16, 2013|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02083-2|page=40-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the translation of [[Confucian]] texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a [[meritocracy]] reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancien regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Western perception of China even in the 18th century admired the Chinese bureaucratic system as favourable over European governments for its seeming meritocracy; [[Voltaire]] claimed that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and [[François Quesnay]] advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE1"&gt;Schwarz (1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
The governments of China, Egypt, Peru and Empress [[Catherine II]] were regarded as models of Enlightened Despotism, admired by such figures as Diderot, D'Alembert and Voltaire.&lt;ref name="Jacoby1973"/&gt;

Napoleonic France adopted this meritocracy system &lt;ref name="EE"/&gt; and soon saw a rapid and dramatic expansion of government, accompanied by the rise of the French civil service and its complex systems of bureaucracy. This phenomenon became known as "bureaumania". In the early 19th century, [[Napoleon]] attempted to reform the bureaucracies of France and other territories under his control by the imposition of the standardized [[Napoleonic Code]]. But paradoxically, that led to even further growth of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iSkH1Qf6xsC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142|title=Handbook of Administrative History - Paper - J.C.N. Raadschelders|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other industrialized nations====
By the mid-19th century, bureaucratic forms of administration were firmly in place across the industrialized world. Thinkers like [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] began to theorize about the economic functions and power-structures of bureaucracy in contemporary life. [[Max Weber]] was the first to endorse bureaucracy as a necessary feature of modernity, and by the late 19th century bureaucratic forms had begun their spread from government to other large-scale institutions.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

The trend toward increased bureaucratization continued in the 20th century, with the public sector employing over 5% of the workforce in many Western countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Within capitalist systems, informal bureaucratic structures began to appear in the form of corporate power hierarchies, as detailed in mid-century works like ''[[The Organization Man]]'' and ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, a powerful class of bureaucratic administrators termed ''[[nomenklatura]]'' governed nearly all aspects of public life.&lt;ref name="Voslensky"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Michael Voslensky|author-link=Michael Voslensky|year=1984|title=Nomenklatura: The Soviet Ruling Class|publisher=Doubleday|edition=1st|isbn=0-385-17657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s brought a backlash against perceptions of "big government" and the associated bureaucracy. Politicians like [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] gained power by promising to eliminate government regulatory bureaucracies, which they saw as overbearing, and return economic production to a more purely capitalistic mode, which they saw as more efficient.&lt;ref name="ThatcherBBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewpoints: How did Margaret Thatcher change Britain?|website=BBC News|date=13 April 2013|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22076774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speech"&gt;{{cite speech|title=A Time For Choosing|author=Ronald Reagan|date=27 October 1964|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/timechoosing.html|website=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, managers like [[Jack Welch]] gained fortune and renown by eliminating bureaucratic structures inside corporations.&lt;ref name="Welch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |title=Jack Welch's Encore |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=14 June 1997 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101031942/http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |archivedate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in the modern world, most organized institutions rely on bureaucratic systems to manage information, process records, and administer complex systems, although the decline of paperwork and the widespread use of electronic databases is transforming the way bureaucracies function.&lt;ref name="Modernity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199563654.do|title=Managing Modernity: Beyond Bureaucracy?|editor1=Stewart R.

==Theories==

===Karl Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] theorized about the role and function of bureaucracy in his ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'', published in 1843. In ''[[Philosophy of Right]]'', [[Hegel]] had supported the role of specialized officials in [[public administration]], although he never used the term "bureaucracy" himself. Marx, by contrast, was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while [[corporation|corporate]] and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist. He wrote that "The Corporation is civil society's attempt to become state; but the bureaucracy is the state which has really made itself into civil society."&lt;ref name="Marx1843"/&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
Writing in the early 1860s, political scientist [[John Stuart Mill]] theorized that successful monarchies were essentially bureaucracies, and found evidence of their existence in [[Imperial China]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the regimes of [[Europe]]. Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election. Mill wrote that ultimately the bureaucracy stifles the mind, and that "a bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy."&lt;ref name="Mill"/&gt;

===Max Weber===&lt;!--'Weberian bureaucracy' redirects here--&gt;
{{Quote box
| quote = Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge
|Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge|–'''Max Weber'''&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;}}
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] was the first to formally study bureaucracy and his works led to the popularization of this term.&lt;ref name="BuSach"/&gt; In his 1922 essay ''Bureaucracy'',[https://www.academia.edu/31803869/_Bureaucracy_by_Max_Weber_Translated_and_Edited_by_Tony_Waters_and_Dagmar_Waters],&lt;ref&gt;Weber, 2015, pp. 73–127 in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; published in his magnum opus ''[[Economy and Society]]'', Weber described many [[ideal type|ideal-typical]] forms of [[public administration]], government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:
* hierarchical organization
* formal lines of authority ([[command hierarchy|chain of command]])
* a fixed area of activity
* rigid division of labor
* regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks
* all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations
* officials with expert training in their fields
* career advancement dependent on technical qualifications
* qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015, p. 76, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy, and Social Stratification, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber listed several preconditions for the [[emergence]] of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a [[monetary economy]] requiring a more efficient administrative system.&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt; Development of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and [[transportation]] technologies make more efficient administration possible, and [[democratization]] and rationalization of culture results in demands for [[equal treatment]].&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt;

Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to [[rational-legal authority]], indispensable to the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c3Mcnh8hCgC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Max Weber (2015) extract], books.google.ca; accessed 30 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of [[Western society]].&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/&gt; Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless "[[iron cage]]" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRitzer"/&gt; Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/&gt; Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized [[civil service]] of the Continental type is called "Weberian civil service".&lt;ref name="Hooghe2001"/&gt;

===Woodrow Wilson===
Writing as an academic while a professor at [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s essay "[[The Study of Administration]]"&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson, "The Study of Administration", ''Political Science Quarterly'', July 1887&lt;/ref&gt; argued for bureaucracy as a professional cadre, devoid of allegiance to fleeting politics. Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that "is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress."

Wilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, "Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Ludwig von Mises===
In his 1944 work ''[[Bureaucracy (book)|Bureaucracy]]'', the Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] compared bureaucratic management to profit management. Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to "the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life." Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, "What must be realized is only that the strait jacket &lt;!--[sic]--&gt; of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement."&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a "trained incapacity" resulting from "over conformity". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as "arrogant" and "haughty".&lt;ref name="Merton"/&gt;

=== Elliott Jaques ===
In his book “A General Theory of Bureaucracy”, first published in 1976, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55877281|title=Constructing the infrastructure for the knowledge economy : methods and tools, theory and structure|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|others=Linger, Henry,|year=|isbn=0306485540|location=New York|pages=104|oclc=55877281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elliott Jaques]] argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met:
* Number of levels in a bureaucracy hierarchy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies).
* Roles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity.
* The level of work complexity in the roles must be matched with the level of human capability of the role holders (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 Levels of human capability).
* The level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles.
* Any managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process).
* Lateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (7 types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2089721|title=A general theory of bureaucracy|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1976|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0435824783|location=London|oclc=2089721}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/free-associations/kirsnerjaques.html|title=Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy|website=www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1990/01/in-praise-of-hierarchy|title=In Praise of Hierarchy|date=1990-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The definition of effective bureaucratic hierarchy by [[Elliott Jaques]] is of importance not only to sociology but to social psychology, social anthropology, economics, politics, and social philosophy. They also have a practical application in business and administrative studies.

Every child has the '''right to adequate nutrition''' under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In New Zealand, an estimated 100,000 New Zealand children go to school every day without breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2014/vol-127-no-1407/6383 |title=Food in schools: targeting versus the right to food - New Zealand Medical Journal |publisher=Nzma.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20140528_00000044/education-breakfast-and-lunch-programmes-in-schools-amendment|title=Education (Breakfast and Lunch Programmes in Schools) Amendment Bill — First Reading|last=(HoR)|first=Reporting Services|date=2014-05-28|website=Parliament.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 11 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognises 'the fundamental right for everyone to be free from hunger’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hhr/Economic_social_cultural.pdf |format=PDF |title=International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights |website=Who.int |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Auckland]] region, there are approximately 43,000 children in decile 1 and 2 state schools. Of these 57% are [[Pacific Islander|Pasifica]], 30% are [[Māori people|Māori]], and 4% are [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]. The remaining 9% are [[Asian people|Asian]]/[[Middle Eastern]] and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="cpag.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Publications/2-0%2025804%20Hunger%20for%20Learning%20Brochure.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hunger for Learning |website=Cpag.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] advised the Minister in 2006 that "decile one and two schools draw their students from our most vulnerable communities and cope with multiple issues related to poverty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz |title=Ministry of Health NZ |publisher=Health.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 Ministry of Health survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/publication/portrait-health-key-results-2002-03-new-zealand-health-survey |title=A Portrait of Health: Key results of the 2002/03 New Zealand Health Survey &amp;#124; Ministry of Health NZ |publisher=Health.govt.nz |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that there is a high percentage of children between the age of 5 to 14 who "sometimes or always ate nothing before school",&lt;ref name="cpag.org.nz"/&gt; compared to a New Zealand Health Survey that found around 15% of children leave for school without eating breakfast.

The [[Children's Ombudsman#New Zealand|Children's Commissioner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz |title=Home » Office of the Children’s Commissioner |publisher=Occ.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; released a Framework for Food in Schools Programme stating "Children need to be fed adequately for a range of nutritional, educational and social reasons and should be fed regardless of their parent's income or status. To end this, breakfast should be made available to decile 1 and 2 primary, intermediate and primary intermediate combined schools."

==Background==
The evolution of children’s right itself to adequate nutrition has fast been on the rise in the last 10 years.  In 2004, 26% of children were reported as living in serious or significant hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/sm/upload/jq/66/v2/dv/WEB%20VERSION%20OF%20LFB.pdf |format=PDF |title=Left Further Behind |website=Cpag.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the [[Child Poverty Action Group]] published ''Hard to Swallow''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Publications/HTS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hard to Swallow : Foodbank Use in New Zealand |website=Occ.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sounded alarms about the increasing number of families who resorted to using food banks.  Key recommendations of the 2005 report that free but good quality breakfasts should be provided for children in decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate schools as a means of ensuring that the most vulnerable children were sufficiently nourished to enable them to learn efficiently  at school.

Past Governments have ignored the problem or helped construct the public debate of the issue portrayed as one of parental failure.  Poor quality diet has also been portrayed as a matter of personal preference.  The [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]] in 2000-2008 responded to the poor diet with social marketing campaigns such as Push-Play,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/move-it-or-lose-it-–-push-play-30-minutes-day] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to encourage families to eat healthier foods to improve people's health and fitness.  In the early 2000s, the Treasury found poor child nutrition is a risk factor for the child's ability to learn.

The current [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|National Government]] has avoided the debate about food insecurity, instead claiming ‘poor food choices’ and removed Labour’s public health initiates around healthy eating and exercise in 2008.

Nationally, there are 115,000 children in decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate, and secondary schools with private charities, schools and teachers scrambling to fill the nutrition gaps of many of these students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/statistics/schooling/student-numbers/6028 |title=School Rolls |publisher=Education Counts |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand policymakers aim to create equality of opportunity for children as part of a broader social investment strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/ |title=Publications and resources - Ministry of Social Development |publisher=Msd.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing breakfast, free, to all children attending decile 1 and 2 primary and intermediate schools would be one positive way to achieve this stated policy aim.  It would also help redress the balance in favour of the low-income households that have found themselves left further behind as New Zealand’s income inequality has grown over the last thirty years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===International obligations===
The [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] furthers a stand to which the child has a sufficient right to adequate nutrition.  Relevant provisions are set out in Article 27.

States Parties recognise the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.

# The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities and financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child's development.
# States Parties, in accordance with national conditions and within their means, shall take appropriate measures to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right and shall in the case of need provide material assistance and support programmes, particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing.

School food programmes would also be consistent with the conclusion of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in New Zealand.  The Committee’s recommendation in paragraph 43:&lt;ref name="UN Convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/international-human-rights-instruments-1/united-nations-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child|title=United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child — Ministry of Justice, New Zealand|website=Justice.govt.nz|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"The Committee recommends that the State Party take all necessary measures to provide appropriate support to allow disadvantaged families and their children to move out of poverty in a sustained way, while at the same time, continuing to provide assistance to those living below the poverty line"''&lt;ref name="UN Convention"/&gt;

===The Scottish Experiment===
The Scottish Government have achieved a successful model for 'breakfast clubs'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/resources/b/genericresource_tcm4207824.asp&lt;/ref&gt; with the particular focus on children with the greatest need. 
The decision here was drawn to provide food for children in school both to improve students' education and improve their diets.&lt;ref name="Scotland's breakfast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityfoodandhealth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/breakfastclub-0632.pdf |format=PDF |title=Breakfast Clubs ... More of a Head Start |website=Communityfoodandhealth.org.uk |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophy behind food in Scottish schools is a ‘whole school’ approach that recognises food sits within children’s social context.&lt;ref name="Scotland's breakfast"/&gt;

The contrast with the New Zealand government’s reliance on corporate beneficence and private charity could not be more abrupt. 
Breakfast clubs have been present in Scotland for many years.  An evaluation of Glasgow’s project provides some insight into the variations between schools that make a school-by-school approach more sensible than a one- size- fits-all model.&lt;ref name="Scotland's breakfast"/&gt;

The evaluation found the factors affecting the likely success and delivery of breakfasts include: 
*  availability and sustainability of funding; 
*   availability and sustainability of assistance. Paid staff and volunteers can be difficult to recruit and retain 
*    local support for the club. 
*    support for the aims of the club, i.e. whether health promotion is included as part of the programme, or whether there is a perception that the programme is a babysitting service; 
*    school catchment and attendance levels. Some schools charged for breakfast, and the evaluation found attendance at breakfast clubs was lower in areas where low-income families are less likely to be able to afford breakfasts; 
*    operational and logistical issues including food quality and health and safety considerations. This may include the safety of children coming to school early (e.g. across busy roads with no supervised crossings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2003/02/16273/17574|title=Hungry for Success - A Whole School Approach to School Meals in Scotland:|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2003-02-19|website=www.gov.scot|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand Programmes==
New Zealand has no national scheme for food in schools, however, there are adequate non-Government programmes operating in hundreds of schools.&lt;ref name="cpag.org.nz"/&gt;  Boards of Trustees have absolute jurisdiction in the management of the school, within the general law of New Zealand.  The only rules currently mandated by central Government with regard to food in schools is National Administrative Guideline 5;&lt;ref name="NAG Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.govt.nz/ministry-of-education/legislation/nags/|title=The National Administration Guidelines (NAGs)|last=Zealand|first=Education in New|website=Education in New Zealand|language=en-NZ|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#    Each board of trustees is also required to provide a safe physical and emotional environment for students; 
#    promote healthy food and nutrition for all students; and 
#    comply in full with any legislation currently in force or that may be developed to ensure the safety of students and employees.&lt;ref name="NAG Guidelines"/&gt;

===Current programmes===
*	'''KidsCan''':  Providing non-perishable goods such as bread, baked beans and spreads to 276 participating schools on a termly basis.  Non-food items are also provided such as raincoats and footwear.   KidsCan receives $150,000 per annum from the Government and more substantial amounts from New Zealand business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kidscan.org.nz|title=KidsCan|website=Kidscan.org.nz|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*	'''Fruit in Schools''':  Providing fruit to all decile 1 and 2 schools, a fully funded Government scheme at around $7 million per annum.&lt;ref name="Fruit in Schools programme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/life-stages/child-health/fruit-schools-programme|title=Fruit in Schools programme|website=Ministry of Health NZ|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*	'''KickStart''':  Providing Weetbix and milk to 500 participating schools across New Zealand two days a week, fully supported by Fonterra and Sanitarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kickstartbreakfast.co.nz |title=KickStart Breakfast Programme - Provided by Fonterra and Sanitarium |website=Kickstartbreakfast.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*	'''Health Promotion Agency'''- Breakfast Eaters Promotion:  this promotion does not include provisions of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpa.org.nz|title=HPA - Health promotion agency {{!}}|website=Hpa.org.nz|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other health promotions in areas including nutrition 
*	'''Garden to Table Programme''':  involving nine schools supported by an international trust to develop edible gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardentotable.org.nz|title=Home {{!}} Garden to Table: Grow, Harvest, Prepare, Share|website=Gardentotable.org.nz|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*	'''Health Promoting Schools''':  advisors contracted by the ministry of health work directly within the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hps.tki.org.nz|title=Welcome to Health Promoting Schools - Health Promoting Schools|website=hps.tki.org.nz|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*	 Schools and communities do their own things with a mix of community sponsorship, private funding, and relationships with businesses.

Generally, schools initiate programmes because they are concerned with the quality of the students’ food.  The ''Fruit in Schools'' programme appears to have provided an incentive to shift schools to having a greater focus on the health aspects of foods.&lt;ref name="Fruit in Schools programme"/&gt;

===Funding===
Schools operate their breakfast programmes at little or no cost and are usually run by the Red Cross, Kickstart Project and local churches.  The National Government in 2013 started to fund 50% of the expansion Food in Schools programme over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8724642/Govt-rolls-out-expanded-food-in-schools|title=Govt rolls out expanded food in schools|last=Rutherford|first=Kate Chapman and Hamish|date=2013-05-28|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz|language=English|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools have different experiences with recruiting and retaining volunteers from within the community: some school programmes are run by teachers, others are run by volunteers drawn from within the school, and parents.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Publications/2-0%2025804%20Hunger%20for%20Learning%20Brochure.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hunger for Learning |website=Cpag.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most donations from businesses or individuals tend to be in a way of food rather than money.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Education (Breakfast and Lunch programmes in schools) Amendment Bill==
The ''Education (Breakfast and Lunch programmes in schools) Amendment Bill''&lt;ref name="nzlii.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/bill/ealpisab2012557/ |title=Education (Breakfast and Lunch Programmes in Schools) Amendment Bill 2012 |publisher=Nzlii.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed to provide a legislative basis for making food in schools available to all decile 1 to 3 primary and intermediate schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL12617_1/education-food-in-schools-amendment-bill |title=New Zealand Parliament - Education (Food in Schools) Amendment Bill |publisher=Parliament.nz |date=2015-03-18 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This Bill will amend the Education Act 1989 providing the introduction of a fully funded State breakfast and lunch programmes, however was not passed.&lt;ref name="nzlii1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/bill/ealpisab2012557/|title=Education (Breakfast and Lunch Programmes in Schools) Amendment Bill 2012|website=Nzlii.org|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catering to all decile 1 and 2 schools and other designated schools in New Zealand. The meals will be available to all enrolled students in these schools free of charge, and will be required to meet Ministry of Health nutritional guidelines.
The introduction of State led and funded food in schools programmes in low decile schools has been recommended by the [[Child Poverty Action Group]] in their 2011 report ''Hunger for learning'', where nutritional barriers to children’s education, and by the Children’s Commissioner’s ''Solutions to child poverty in New Zealand''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz/assets/Uploads/EAG/Final-report/Final-report-Solutions-to-child-poverty-evidence-for-action.pdf |format=PDF |title=Solutions for Child Poverty in New Zealand |website=Occ.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a key measure to address child poverty.&lt;ref name="nzlii.org"/&gt;
In conjunction with the Ministry of Health, the [[Ministry of Education]] will develop a plan to monitor schools at least once every 12 months to ensure they are providing meals each day they are open for instruction and that the meals follow nutritional guidelines.&lt;ref name="nzlii1"/&gt; An evaluation of the breakfast and lunch programmes will be conducted within the first 3 years to further develop and improve their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="nzlii.org"/&gt;

==Benefits of current programmes==
Breakfast, in particular, has been found to have a beneficial effect on children’s study, behaviour, and attendance and there is mounting evidence that eating a good quality breakfast reduces the risk of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Reports/Poverty/A-framework-for-food-in-schools.pdf |format=PDF |title=A FRAMEWORK FOR FOOD IN SCHOOLS PROGRAMMES IN NEW ZEALAND |website=Occ.org.nz |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Evidence for the benefit of breakfast for children is mixed. In large part, this is due to benefits diminishing as children get older and exercise more control over their food intake, with older children being more likely to skip breakfast altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eating Breakfast and its Impact on Children’s Daily Diet|author1=Wilson, N. |author2=Parnell, W. |author3=Wohlers, M. |author4= Shirley, P. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For younger children the evidence is clear that breakfast provides a number of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children, Food and Poverty: Food Insecurity Among Primary School Students in the Wellington Region. Unpublished thesis, School of Social and Cultural Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington.|last=Gerritson|first=S|publisher=Unpublished thesis, School of Social and Cultural Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breakfast is the meal most likely to be skipped, with only 40% of New Zealand children reporting eating breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=NZ Food NZ Children: Key Results of the 2002 National Children’s Nutrition Survey.|last=Ministry of Health|publisher=Wellington: Ministry of Health.|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health reported that found around 15% of children leave for school without having eaten breakfast, and that Maori and Pacific children were less likely to eat breakfast at home every day compared with other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Portrait of Health-Key Results of the 2006/07 New Zealand Health Survey|last=Ministry of Health|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakfast can make a positive contribution to children’s learning. The positive social benefit seen in New Zealand have also been observed overseas (Wahlstrom &amp; Begalle, 1999). In Scotland, teachers report better attendance and better behaviour from children as a consequence of breakfast clubs there (Sheridan, 2001, para 17), and in its 2007 report to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.org.nz/childrens-rights-and-advice/uncroc/|title=UNCROC|website=Office of the Children’s Commissioner|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Scottish government noted that new universal and subsidised school meal programmes in Scotland were improving children’s health and academic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofmdfmni.gov.uk|title=Home page of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister|website=OFMDFM|access-date=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28668">'''Civil religion''', also referred to as a '''civic religion''',&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; is the implicit religious values of a nation, as expressed through public [[ritual]]s, symbols (such as the national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments, battlefields, or national cemeteries). It is distinct from churches, although church officials and ceremonies are sometimes incorporated into the practice of civil religion.{{sfn|Wimberley|Swatos|1998}} Countries described as having a civil religion include France,&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance/&gt; South Korea,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; and the former Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} As a concept, it originated in French [[political thought]] and became a major topic for U.S. [[sociologist]]s since its use by [[Robert Bellah]] in 1960.

==Origin of term==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society. For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the [[State (polity)|state]] by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, [[Rousseau]] outlines the simple [[dogma]]s of the civil religion:
# [[deity]]
# [[afterlife]]
# the reward of [[virtue]] and the punishment of [[vice]]
# the exclusion of [[religious intolerance]]{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1967 |2a1=Juergensmeyer |2y=2003 |2p=245 |3a1=Meyer-Dinkgrafe |3y=2004 |3p=30 |4a1=Shanks |4y=2000 |4p=29}}
The Italian historian [[Emilio Gentile]] has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a [[political religion]].{{sfn|Gentile|2006}}

==Sociology of religion==
[[File:National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, DC]], is often used for state [[funeral]]s for political leaders.]]
In the [[sociology of religion]], '''civil religion''' is the [[folk religion]] of a [[nation]] or a [[politics|political]] [[culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by [[leadership|leader]]s within that society.  On the other hand, it is somewhat less than an [[establishment of religion]], since established churches have official [[clergy]] and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*the invocation of God in political speeches and public monuments;
*the quotation of [[religious text]]s on public occasions by political leaders;
*the veneration of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach moral ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation's wars;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious symbols on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for worship;
*[[founding myth]]s and other [[national myth]]s
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
[[File:Arc De Triomphe 2004.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in [[Paris]] commemorates those who died in France's wars.]]

Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term '''''civil religion''''' or '''''civic religion''''' to refer to [[ritual]] expressions of [[patriotism]] of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Among such practices are the following:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain [[National Day|patriotic holidays]];
*reciting [[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]] (like the pledges of allegiance found in countries such as the [[Pledge of Allegiance (Bahamas)|Bahamas]], [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|the Philippines]], and [[Pledge of Allegiance (South Korea)|South Korea]]);
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a monarch;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified [[mythology|mythologized]] tales of [[List of national founders|national founders]] and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also [[romantic nationalism]]);
*[[monument]]s commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the state, the predominant national racial/ethnic group,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; the national constitution, or the monarch;
*expressions of solidarity with people perceived as being national kindred but residing in a foreign country or a foreign country perceived as being similar enough to the nation to warrant admiration and/or loyalty;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*expressions of hatred towards another country or foreign ethnic group perceived as either currently being an enemy of the state and/or as having wronged and slighted the nation in the past;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of '''civil religion''' substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch's coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying [[oath of office|"I do solemnly swear..."]] (customarily followed by "so help me God", although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying "I do solemnly affirm..." (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==

===Prehistory and classical antiquity===
{{Disputed section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], his [[capite velato|head ritually covered]], conducts a public sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter]]
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the [[Pharaoh]] or the [[Chinese Emperor]] were considered manifestations of a [[Divinity]]. Tribal world-view was often [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]], the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian [[polis]] was a secular [[polytheism]] focused on the [[Olympian Gods]] and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. For example, the Athenian ecclesia charged that [[Socrates]] worshiped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis and condemned him to death.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor [[Augustus]] officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of classical [[paganism]]. [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] were essentially local in character; the [[Roman Empire]] attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman [[Greek mythology|pantheon]].  In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'', the Altar of Peace, showing the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and his family worshiping the gods.  He also encouraged the publication of works such as [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid|Æneid]]'', which depicted "pious [[Aeneas|Æneas]]", the [[legend]]ary ancestor of [[Rome]], as a role model for Roman religiosity. Roman historians such as [[Livy]] told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue. The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], the worship of the ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of the Emperor.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

===Rousseau and Durkheim===
The phrase ''civil religion'' was first discussed extensively by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his 1762 treatise ''The Social Contract''. Rousseau defined ''civil religion'' as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which [[virtue]] is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in [[freedom of religion|religious tolerance]].  He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries.{{sfn|Beiner|1993}} Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments.  For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an artificial source of civic virtue.{{sfn|Demerath|Williams|1985}}

Wallace studies [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), the French sociologist who analysed civil religion, especially in comparative terms, and stressed that the public schools are critical in implementing civil religion. Although he never used the term he laid great stress on the concept.{{sfn|Wallace|1977}}

==Examples==
===France===
Secular states in Europe by the late 19th century were building civil religion based on their recent histories. In France's case, Baylac argues, the French government:
{{quote|encouraged a veritable state religion, worshiping the flag and multiplying the national holidays and commemorative monuments.&amp;nbsp;... July 14 became a national holiday in 1882; the centennial of the French Revolution was celebrated in 1889. In Italy, the secular state multiplied the celebrations: State holidays, King and Queen's birthdays, pilgrimage of 1884 to the tomb of Victor-Emmanuel II. A patriotic ideology was created.&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance&gt;{{cite book |last=Baylac |first=M.-H. |year=1997 |title=Histoire 1ère |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Bordas |page=134}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Lindaman|Ward|2013|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===South Korea===
In contemporary South Korea, the predominating civil religion has been described as consisting of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]] coupled with a pan-[[Korean racial nationalism]].&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; This has been criticized by some scholars as being detrimental to South Korean national security as it encourages North Korean provocations against the country in the guise that South Koreans will not adequately defend their country's security as they feel a certain racial and ethnic solidarity with North Korea.&lt;ref name=BRMyers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/war_college/what-north-korea-wants|title=What North Korea Wants|date=2017|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|last=Myers|publisher=Soundcloud|work=Reuters War College|quote=The South needs to retire the conventional civic religion here, which is anti-Japanese pan-Korean nationalism in favor of a collective identification of civic principles.|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argued that South Korea should retire this sort of racialized civil religion for one more rooted in civic principles, like was found in [[West Germany]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Dubna Lenin.JPG|thumb|Statue of Lenin at [[Dubna]], Russia, built in 1937; it is 25 metres tall]]
The Soviet Union made [[Marxism–Leninism]] into a civil religion, with sacred texts and [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|many statues of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.]]{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} Stalin personally supervised the cult of Lenin and his own cult, which took advantage of the historic semi-religious adulation Russian peasants had shown toward the tsars.{{sfn|Plamper|2012}} The Lenin icons were put into storage when [[fall of communism|communism fell in 1991]]. The [[List of statues of Stalin|Stalin statues]] had been [[de-Stalinization|removed]] in the 1950s and mention of him was erased from encyclopedias and history books. However under [[Vladimir Putin]] in the 21st century the memory of Stalin has been partly rehabilitated in search of a strong leader who made the nation powerful.  For example, school textbooks were rewritten to portray "the mass terror of the Stalin years as essential to the country's rapid modernization in the face of growing German and Japanese military threats, and amid the inaction or duplicity of the Western democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sherlock |first=Thomas |year=2011 |title=Confronting the Stalinist Past: The Politics of Memory in Russia |url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |magazine=The Washington Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=97 |issn=1530-9177 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225034518/https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2018 |access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|American civil religion}}
Civil religion is an important component of public life in America, especially at the national level for its celebration of [[nationalism]]. Sociologists report that its "feast days" are [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[Veterans Day]], and [[Memorial Day]]. Its rituals include salutes to the flag and singing "[[God Bless America]]".{{sfn|Bruce|Yearley|2006|p=34}} Soldiers and veterans play a central role of standing ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. Bellah noted the veneration of veterans.{{sfn|Bellah|1992}} The historian Conrad Cherry called the Memorial Day ceremonies "a modern cult of the dead" and says that it "affirms the civil religious tenets."{{sfn|Wilsey|2015|p=24}}

====American Revolution====
{{Further|Commemoration of the American Revolution}}
The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah:
{{quote|Behind the civil religion at every point lie biblical archetypes: Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. But it is also genuinely American and genuinely new. It has its own prophets and its own martyrs, its own sacred events and sacred places, its own solemn rituals and symbols. It is concerned that America be a society as perfectly in accord with the will of God as men can make it, and a light to all nations.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}}}

Albanese argues that the American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational [[American civil religion]] that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Tom Paine]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]], [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), emblems ([[American flag|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[July 4]]) and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]).{{sfn|Albanese|1977}}

Although "God" is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], mention is specifically made of "[[Deism#Deism in the United States|Nature's God]]" in the opening sentence of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

====Historiography====

In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as [[Robert N. Bellah]] and [[Martin E. Marty]] studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of [[cultural anthropology]].  Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of "religion in general" without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish "priestly" and "prophetic" roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the ''public theology''.{{sfn|Marty|1989|p=295}} In the 1967 essay "Civil Religion in America", Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is "an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation."  Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging "national self-worship" and calling for "the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged."{{sfn|Bellah|1967}} Bellah identified the [[American Revolution]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist [[Robert Bellah]]. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America's unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil religion in the US was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, Civil religion was used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God's will on earth. [[George Washington]] was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the [[Founding Fathers]] have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through [[Memorial Day]] rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}

==Current issues==
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the US and Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of "[[Judeo-Christian ethics]]", a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all share the same values. Alvin J. Schmidt argues that since the 1700s, expressions of civil religion in the United States have shifted from a deistic to a polytheistic stance.{{sfn|Schmidt|2004}}

Some scholars have argued that the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] can be seen as a main [[totem]] of a national cult,&lt;ref&gt;Marvin and Ingle (1996). [http://www.asc.upenn.edu/USR/fcm/jaar.htm "Blood Sacrifice and the Nation: Revisiting Civil Religion"].&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that modern punishment is a form of civil religion.{{sfn|SpearIt|2013}} Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the "political religion" of each American.&lt;ref&gt;Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois January 27, 1838 [http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">'''Cognitive specialization''' suggests that certain behaviors, often in the domain of social communication, are passed on to offspring and refined to be maximally beneficial by the process of natural selection. Specializations serve an [[adaptive]] purpose for an organism by allowing the organism to be better suited for its habitat. Over time, specializations often become essential to the species' continued survival.  Cognitive specialization in humans has been thought to underlie the acquisition, development, and evolution of [[language]], [[theory of mind]], and specific social skills such as [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]]. These specializations are considered to be critical to the survival of the species, even though there are successful individuals who lack certain specializations, including those diagnosed with [[autism spectrum disorder]] or who lack language abilities.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995"&gt;Povinelli D., Preuss T (1995). Theory of mind: evolutionary history of a cognitive specialization, Trends in Neurosciences, Volume 18, Issue 9, Pages 418–424, ISSN 0166-2236, doi:10.1016/0166-2236(95)93939-U. {{PMID|7482808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive specialization is also believed to underlie adaptive behaviors such as [[self-awareness]], [[navigation]], and problem solving skills in several animal species such as [[chimpanzees]] and [[bottlenose dolphins]].

== Background ==
First studied as an adaptive mechanism specific to humans,&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; cognitive specialization has since evolved to encompass many behaviors in the social realm. Organisms have evolved over millions of years to become well-adapted to their [[habitats]]; this requires becoming specialized in behaviors that improve an organism’s likelihood of survival and reproduction. Not to be confused with [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]], which examines the specific parts of the brain that are engaged during specific behaviors or processes,&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z., &amp; Cantlon, J. F. (2011). The specialization of function: Cognitive and neural perspectives. Cognitive neuropsychology, 28(3–4), 147–155. doi:10.1080/02643294.2011.633504 {{PMID|22185234}}&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive specialization is focused on characteristics of the mind (an internal entity), which in turn affects external behaviors. Most of these specializations are thought to have developed in areas of the [[neocortex]] unique to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1994). The language instinct: The new science of language and mind (Vol. 7529). Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant cognitive specializations among humans include theory of mind and language acquisition and production, while non-human animals may specialize in [[foraging]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Toth, A. Robinson, G. (2007). Evo-devo and the evolution of social behavior, Trends in Genetics, Volume 23, Issue 7, Pages 334–341, ISSN 0168-9525 doi: 10.1016/j.tig.2007.05.001 {{PMID|17509723}}&lt;/ref&gt; self-awareness, or other adaptive abilities.

== Social behavior ==
Social communication is critical to effective human interaction, and has evolved over time to support the complex exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., Cosmides, L., &amp; Price, M. E. (2006). Cognitive adaptations for n‐person exchange: the evolutionary roots of organizational behavior. Managerial and Decision Economics, 27(2–3), 103–129. {{PMID|23814325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, S. (2006). Cognition at the heart of human interaction. Discourse Studies, 8(1), 85–93&lt;/ref&gt; Some social behaviors, such as helping and [[wikt:altruism|altruism]], are largely unique to humans and are instrumental in ensuring the survival of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, H. C., Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (2010) Coevolution of cooperation, causal cognition and mindreading. Communicative &amp; integrative biology, 3(6), 522–4. {{PMID|21331228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] argue that the human mind contains "specialized mechanisms" that were designed by natural selection to facilitate social communication and exchange.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992"&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive adaptations for social exchange. The adapted mind, 163–228. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122352999&lt;/ref&gt; Without this specialized "[[algorithm]]",&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt; Cosmides and Tooby claim, social exchange among humans would be closer to that of our closest evolutionary ancestors, the great apes. In addition to humans' broad abilities supporting positive social interaction, Stone et al. (2002) put forth evidence for more specific specializations including "cheater detection" and "precautionary reasoning," both of which appear to serve strong adaptive purposes by allowing humans to share resources with only those who are likely to share with them in the future, and avoid sharing resources with untrustworthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Stone, V. E., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., Kroll, N., &amp; Knight, R. T. (2002) Selective impairment of reasoning about social exchange in a patient with bilateral limbic system damage. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11531–11536. doi  10.1073/pnas.122352699 {{PMID|12177408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the adaptiveness of social communication has been examined in children, adults, and older adults,&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Prince, C. G., &amp; Preuss, T. M. (2005). Parent-Offspring Conﬂict and the Development of Social Understanding. The Innate Mind: Structure and Contents: Structure and Contents, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; across cultures,&lt;ref name="Shiw"&gt;Sugiyama, L. S., Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (2002). Cross-cultural evidence of cognitive adaptations for social exchange among the Shiwiar of Ecuadorian Amazonia. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11537–11542. doi 10.1073/pnas.122352999 {{PMID|12177409}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[neuropsychiatric]] populations.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

=== Evidence for universality ===
If social behavior is to be considered a cognitive specialization unique to human neural architecture, it should be present in every human society.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; To provide cross-cultual evidence that cognitive adaptations specifically support social communication, Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosmides  investigated social reasoning in a tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; The Shiwiar, who are a hunter-horticulturalist group previously unexposed to the presented psychological stimuli, were "as highly proficient" in determining who cheated in a given situation as their counterparts in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; This performance indicates that social communication, at least in the domain of cheater detection, is not determined by one's culture. According to Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosimdes, the social "algorithms" discussed above are present in both Western and non-Western populations, providing strong evidence for the universality of such a skill.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt;

== Theory of mind ==
[[Theory of mind]], or the ability to attribute mental states to other people, is thought to be a cognitive specialization unique to humans, with a few possible exceptions discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C.M. (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101-114. doi 10.1017/s0140525x98000703 {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jellema, T., Baker, C. I., Wicker, B., &amp; Perrett, D. I. (2000). Neural representation for the perception of the intentionality of actions. Brain and cognition, 44(2), 280–302. doi 10.1006/brcg.2000.1231 {{PMID|11041992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind is thought to be critical in social cognition and communication because it allows us to distinguish between [[Vagrancy (biology)|accidental]] and purposeful actions, to make judgments about others' internal states, and to determine how another's thoughts may differ from our own.&lt;ref name ="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; The acquisition of theory of mind in humans mostly takes place during early childhood, and is thought to be fully developed by the early school years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Cross, D., &amp; Watson, J. (2001). Meta‐analysis of theory‐of‐mind development: the truth about false belief. Child development, 72(3), 655–684. {{PMID|11405571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind research in [[chimpanzees]] by social psychologists [[David Premack]] and Guy Woodruff in 1978 brought it to the forefront of psychological inquiry, though true theory of mind is only thought to exist in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, D., and Woodruff, G. (1978). Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind? Behav. Sci. 4: 515–526&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been analyzed in many fields, and it is thought to be among the most beneficial specializations for survival of the human species, due to its facilitation of [[cooperation]] and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). How the mind works. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 882(1), 119–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In autism ===
Theory of mind appears to be lacking in children with [[autism| autism spectrum disorders]], and this deficit is thought to be a major contributor to frequent impairments in some areas of social understanding in people with autism.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a [[developmental delay]] in (or absence of) theory of mind can impair social functioning—a skill imperative in the survival of the human species—is argued to be evidence for theory of mind as an adaptive cognitive specialization.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; Understanding that others may be thinking different thoughts than I am (colloquially, "putting oneself in another person's shoes") allows humans to communicate effectively and to live in large [[social groups]]. This adaptability is what makes theory of mind a cognitive specialization, rather than just another byproduct of [[human evolution]]: humankind has unique and beneficial communication skills, and this is partially due to our ability to recognize that other people may not think or know the same things we do.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt;

== Language ==
Though some (including Bates et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, E., Thal, D., &amp; Marchman, V. (1991). Symbols and syntax: A Darwinian approach to language development. Biological and behavioral determinants of language development, 29, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2003). Language as an adaptation to the cognitive niche. STUDIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE, 3, 16–37.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that language arose as a byproduct of the evolution of humans' general cognitive abilities, [[Steven Pinker]] argues that it is, on its own, an adaptive mechanism. Drawing on existing literature and theory, he proposes several types of evidence for this claim, including the universality and [[ontogeny]] of language. Pinker also uses the [[double dissociation]] between general intelligence and language to argue for language as a specific adaptation. Those who lose language capabilities due to [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]] but maintain many other cognitive abilities exemplify Pinker's idea that language and general cognition are not always perfectly overlapping in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt; Using language "multiplies the benefit of knowledge" in multiple domains, including technology, tool use, and intentions of ourselves and others.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
Arbib puts forth a hypothesis that [[mirror neurons]] in the primate brain were a precursor to language abilities in humans.&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;Arbib, M. A. (2005). From monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28(02), 105–124 {{PMID|16201457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without these neurons in [[Broca's area]] in humans (which is analogous to F5 in monkeys), Arbib claims, we could not have evolved a specialization for language—which is used to explain why non-human animals do not have linguistic capabilities.&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; In addition, Meguerditchian and Vauclair have argued that our evolutionary ancestors' communicative [[gestures]] (such as threat gestures and "food begs" among [[baboons]]) established a foundation on which to build human language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Meguerditchian, A., &amp; Vauclair, J. (2009). Contrast of hand preferences between communicative gestures and non-communicative actions in baboons: Implications for the origins of hemispheric specialization for language. Brain and language, 108(3), 167–174. {{PMID|19091390}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior was selected for, built upon, and modified, leading to the capabilities humans have today. Early theories explained early language as an adaptive way to communicate during a [[hunting|hunt]], but recent research has focused on [[ecological]] theories that incorporate social demands; or, as Flinn et al. put it, a "social [[arms race]]" against non-human primates.&lt;ref name = Flinn&gt;Flinn, M. V., Geary, D. C., &amp; Ward, C. V. (2005). Ecological dominance, social competition, and coalitionary arms races: Why humans evolved extraordinary intelligence. Evolution and Human Behavior, 26(1), 10–46.&lt;/ref&gt; As a behavior selected for over the long term, with many successful "intermediary stages," human language differs from all other social behaviors among chimpanzees, which are thought to be more gradual in their evolutionary development.&lt;ref name="Flinn" /&gt; Further evidence for language as a cognitive specialization includes Ferreira et al.'s finding that some parts of language (for instance, [[syntax]]) can be spared in [[amnesia]], while other abilities (like [[memory]] retention) are drastically reduced.&lt;ref name="Fer"&gt;Ferreira, V. S., Bock, K., Wilson, M. P., &amp; Cohen, N. J. (2008). Memory for syntax despite amnesia. Psychological science, 19(9), 940–946. {{PMID|18947361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar dissociations support the theory that specific neural architecture, which has evolved over time, supports language function.&lt;ref name="Fer" /&gt;

=== Universal Grammar ===
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed a biological component of language, which he termed [[Universal Grammar]].&lt;ref name="Chom"&gt;Chomsky, N. (1972). Language and mind (p. 100). New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chomsky, an essential part of language processing is hard-wired into the human brain. This allows language to be produced with or without specific linguistic instruction (which is closely associated with the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument).&lt;ref name="Chom" /&gt;  All humans—and only humans—have this biological trait, but building blocks of universal grammar have been reported in other species.&lt;ref&gt;Marc D. Hauser; Noam Chomsky; W. Tecumseh Fitch (November 22, 2002). "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?". Science 298 (5598): 1569–1579. doi 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569. {{PMID|12446899}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackendoff argues that Universal Grammar is itself a "pre-existing cognitive specialization":&lt;ref name="Jack"&gt;Jackendoff, R. (2001). Language in the ecology of mind. The Routledge companion to semiotics and linguistics, 52–65.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than needing explicit instruction on how to speak their native language, or having [[vocabulary]] and syntactical rules of a specific language present in their brains from birth, children seem to be [[genetically]] pre-disposed to ''learn'' language.&lt;ref name="Jack" /&gt; Complementary to the connection made between area F5 in macaques' brains,&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; the theory of Universal Grammar allows for an evolutionary perspective on language use as a cognitive specialization. There is some controversy, however, on whether or not Universal Grammar can have evolved by standard Darwinian evolutionary principles, or must be explained using different mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hinzen, Wolfram (September 2012). "The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar". Language Sciences 34 (5): 635–649. doi:10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
According to Nowak and Sigmund, language is essential to human life as we know it.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;Nowak, M. A., &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. Nature, 437(7063), 1291–1298 {{PMID|16251955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the ability to verbally communicate with members of our social group, there would be no [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] (that is, returning of favors), and no way to cooperate with one another for a greater good.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt; Some have argued that unique aspects of human language have evolved for unexpectedly beneficial reasons, besides simply asking for help or sharing information about the world. [[Gossip]], viewed by many &lt;ref name="gossip"&gt;Miller, G. (2011). The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature. Random House LLC. doi:10.1525/aa.2001.103.4.1196&lt;/ref&gt; to be a superfluous aspect of human communication, may even serve an adaptive purpose. The spread of information about other people, even if it is malicious, may serve as an indicator of social intelligence and a way to deter [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] behaviors.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Though gossip likely helps some humans and hinders others' [[social standing]], it appears to be an overall benefit of the ability to produce verbal language.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Without an overall specialization for language (including such sub-specializations as gossip), [[linguists]] argue, humans would not be able to share information efficiently and effectively.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

== Other possible specializations ==
Watson et al. provide support for a specific specialization in language-dependent [[humor]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, K. K., Matthews, B. J., &amp; Allman, J. M. (2007). Brain activation during sight gags and language-dependent humor. Cerebral Cortex, 17(2), 314–324. {{PMID|16514105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[adaptive]] value has both [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] components: humor facilitates social bonding if shared extrinsically, and provides pleasure if enjoyed in one's own mind. In addition, Johnson-Frey (2003) proposed a unique human specialization for tool use.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Frey, S. H. (2003). What's so special about human tool use?. Neuron, 39(2), 201–204. doi:10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00424-0 {{PMID|12873378}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson-Frey, humans' ability to use tools is based on complex cognitive mechanisms, not just advanced [[motor skill|sensorimotor]] skills. Rather than it being considered a purely physical specialization based only in [[motor areas]] of the brain, Johnson-Frey argues that tool use should be classified as a cognitive phenomenon due to its foundation in cognition. On a more [[philosophical]] level, Boyer (2003) argues that "[[religious]] thought and behavior" is a specialization that originally developed as a by-product of brain function, and its adaptive purposes led to its continued evolution by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P. (2003). Religious thought and behavior as by-products of brain function. Trends in cognitive sciences, 7(3), 119–124. {{PMID|12639693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krueger et al. (2007) have argued that trust, which may form the foundation for helping and altruism and thus the basis of human social interaction, is also a cognitive specialization.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, F., McCabe, K., Moll, J., Kriegeskorte, N., Zahn, R., Strenziok, M., &amp; Grafman, J. (2007). Neural correlates of trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(50), 20084–20089. doi 10.1073/pnas.0710103104 {{PMID|18056800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-human specialization ==

=== In non-human primates ===
Humankind’s closest ancestors, the [[great apes]], have evolved a number of specialized behaviors: [[orangutans]] are specialists at climbing trees, while [[chimpanzees]] and [[gorillas]] have evolved to walk on their knuckles.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; However, in considering non-behavioral specializations, Penn et al. (2008) argue that the "profound continuity" [[Charles Darwin]] noted between human and non-human animals in the biological domain is matched by a "profound discontinuity" between human and non-human animal minds.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, D. C., Holyoak, K. J., &amp; Povinelli, D. J. (2008). Darwin's mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31(02), 109–130. {{PMID|18479531}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in addition to cognitive-behavioral adaptations, it is possible that chimpanzees have acquired more socially advanced skills through natural selection, including self-recognition (indicated by chimpanzees' established ability to pass the "[[mirror test]]").&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Heyes (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101–114. {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task—in which a successful trial is simply one in which an animal recognizes itself in a mirror—is thought to be a basic building block of theory of mind development.&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Eddy, T. J., Hobson, R. P., &amp; Tomasello, M. (1996). What young chimpanzees know about seeing. Monographs of the society for research in child development, i–189. doi 10.2307/1166159 {{PMID|8795292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rhesus monkeys]] have also been shown to realize when they remember certain events and items, which is considered to be an instrumental building block in the formation of social relationships, as one must remember who owes him favors, who he can trust, and who he should avoid in order to prosper in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, R. R. (2001). Rhesus monkeys know when they remember. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(9), 5359–5362. doi 10.1073/pnas.071600998 {{PMID|11274360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other animals ===
More recent evidence has shown that cognitive specialization is not just present in [[primates]]: domesticated [[dogs]] may show signs of understanding human behavior and communication, indicating a social-cognitive specialization that is argued to make them more likely to receive food, shelter and love from their human owners. Being receptive to human behavioral indicators and responding accordingly has allowed dogs to survive and thrive as a [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, B., Tomasello, M. (2005) Human-like social skills in dogs?, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Volume 9, Issue 9, pages 439–444, ISSN 1364-6613 {{PMID|16061417}} doi 10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphins]] and [[elephants]] have also been shown to pass the "mirror test" explained above. This indication of some elementary self-awareness provides more evidence for foundational theory of mind skills in organisms throughout the [[Animal|animal kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Marten, K. &amp; Psarakos, S. (1995). "Evidence of self-awareness in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)". In Parker, S.T., Mitchell, R. &amp; Boccia, M. Self-awareness in Animals and Humans: Developmental Perspectives.

'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] ([[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal "systems" (or "families") in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Canon law]], [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, [[economic globalization]], and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence).  Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.

Although every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. [[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/358681/Sir-Henry-Maine|title=Sir Henry Maine|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]]. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kristoffel Grechenig &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295-360''] comparing German style and U.S. style legal scholarship&lt;/ref&gt; and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:
* To attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* To perfect the legal systems in effect
* Possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: 
* How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? 
* Are legal rules comparable? 
* How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==

===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===
Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff&lt;ref&gt;''Traité de droit comparé'' – in French; Paris 1950–1952&lt;/ref&gt; believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the

* [[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, [[Louisiana]], various South American states such as Brazil, [[Quebec]], [[Saint Lucia]], the [[Ionian Islands]], Egypt, and [[Lebanon]]
* [[Law of Germany|German group]]
* Scandinavian group, comprising the laws of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland
* [[Common law|English group]], including, ''inter alia'', England, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
* Russian group
* [[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
* [[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===
[[René David]]&lt;ref&gt;''Traité élémentaire de droit civil comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
* [[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
** [[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] – see [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]])
** [[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
* [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]
* [[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
* [[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
* [[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]
* [[Jewish Law]]
Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
* liberal democracy
* capitalist economy
* Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Konrad Zweigert and [[Hein Kötz]] propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung auf dem Gebiete des Privatrechts'' by Tony Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998. {{ISBN|9780198268598}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman law|Roman family]]
* [[Law of Germany|German family]]
* [[Common law|Common law family]]
* Nordic family
* Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] (China and Japan)
* Religious family (Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu law)

Up to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention [[Socialist law|Soviet or socialist law]] as another family of laws.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Zweigert, Hein Kötz: ''Einführung in die Rechtsvergleichung''. 3rd edition. 1996. Mohr Siebeck. Tübingen. 1996. {{ISBN|3-16-146548-2}} (Hein Kötz mentions in the preface to the third edition on page&amp;nbsp;V that the fall of "soviet communism" also made an end to the "soviet family of laws", which made it possible to save some 60&amp;nbsp;pages as compared to the 2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craquelure''' ({{lang-fr|craquelé}}, {{lang-it|crettatura}}) is the fine pattern of dense cracking formed on the surface of materials and can be induced by drying, aging, intentional patterning, or a combination of all three.  The term is most often used to refer to [[tempera]] or [[oil painting]]s, but it can also develop in old [[ivory carving]]s or painted miniatures on an ivory backing. Recently, craquelure has been proposed as a way to authenticate art.

==Craquelure in painted surfaces==
Painting systems are composed of complex layers with unique mechanical properties that depend on the type of drying oil or paint medium used and the presence of paint additives, such as organic solvents, surfactants, and plasticizers. Understanding the mechanism of craquelure formation in paint and the resulting crack morphology provides information about the methods and materials used by the artists.

=== Characterization of craquelure morphology ===
There are seven key features used to describe craquelure morphology:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucklow|first=Spike|date=1997|title=The Description of Craquelure Patterns|jstor=1506709|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=129–140|doi=10.2307/1506709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Local and global direction of cracks
# Relationship to weave or grain direction of support
# Crack shape
# Crack spacing
# Crack thickness
# Termination of cracks
# Organization of crack network

These seven criteria have been used to identify "styles" of craquelure, which relate crack patterns to various historic schools of art. This links the crack patterns with specific time periods, locations, and painting styles.
* Italian paintings on panel (1300-1500): cracks oriented perpendicular to wood grain with jagged lines and distinct secondary networks of thin cracks&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Flemish paintings on panel (1400-1600): cracks oriented parallel to wood grain with smooth, straight segments; uniform thicknesses and small, square islands observed&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Dutch paintings on canvas (1600s): cracks oriented perpendicular to major axis of painting with jagged lines and square junctions; cracks tend to follow weft and warp of canvas support&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* French paintings on canvas (1700s): non-directional cracks with smooth, curved lines in random distributions; newly-developed, stiffer sublayers tended to delocalize tension from the support and remove the connection between crack direction and canvas weave&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Craquelure during drying ===
During drying, the pictorial layer tends to shrink as volatile solvents evaporate. Non-uniform shrinkage across the painting surface is caused by differential adhesion to the sublayer by different paint species and leads to large tensile stresses in the top paint layer. Crack formation during drying depends strongly on adhesion to the sublayer, paint film thickness, composition, and the mechanical properties of the sublayer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giorgiutti-Dauphine|first=Frederique|date=2016|title=Painting cracks: A way to investigate the pictorial matter|url=https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4960438|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=120|pages=065107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Craquelure formed during the drying process appears within days of painting and is characterized by shallow cracks that are localized to the topmost layers of paint. This localization results from capillary forces, which constrain drying stresses to the free surface of the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Drying cracks are usually isotropic due to the fine dispersion of pigment particles within the evaporating volatile solvents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Crack propagation at a critical strain, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_m&lt;/math&gt;, is opposed by an unfavorable increase in [[surface energy]] as the crack elongates and promoted by a release in the elastic energy of the material near the crack. The condition for the propagation of a drying crack can be evaluated precisely using [[fracture mechanics]].

==== Adhesion to sublayer ====
Crack width is heavily dependent on the ability of the top paint layer to adhere to the sublayer. If poor adhesion between these layers occurs, the pictorial layer can slide over the sublayer and create dramatic, wide cracks in response to uneven tensile strains during solvent evaporation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike aging cracks, the width of drying cracks is highly varying as a result.  Poor adhesion can occur if the painter mixes too much oil or other fatty substance into the sublayer material.

==== Film thickness ====
Below a critical film thickness, &lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt;, the pictorial layer will remain crack-free. Cracks are not able to propagate in thin films because the decrease in elastic energy as the crack elongates is not enough to negate the concurrent increase in surface energy. The critical film thickness is approximated by:

&lt;math&gt;h_c = \frac{E_p\Gamma}{Z\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic modulus of the pictorial layer, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; the surface energy of this layer, Z a dimensionless constant that depends on the cracking pattern, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the stress experienced during drying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Films thicker than this critical value display networks of cracks. The degree of connectivity between nucleation sites increases with film thickness, so that thicknesses near the critical value are characterized by isolated star-shaped crack junctions and thick films show more complete networks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Sublayer properties ====
The spacing of cracks during drying depends strongly on the stiffness of the support, or sublayer. An infinitely stiff sublayer does not contribute to the strain in the pictorial layer, so that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_p=\epsilon_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;is the stiffness of the pictorial layer. The crack spacing for an infinitely stiff support is approximated by:

&lt;math&gt;d \approx \frac{4h\Gamma}{E_pa\epsilon_m^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the thickness of the pictorial layer, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; the surface energy of the pictorial layer, &lt;math&gt;E_p&lt;/math&gt; the elastic modulus of the pictorial layer, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the depth of the crack.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For a less stiff sublayer, an additional strain in the sublayer, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_s&lt;/math&gt;, lessens the strain in the pictorial layer such that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_m - \epsilon_s = \epsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;. If the ratio of the strains between the two layers is approximately the same as the ratio of their elastic moduli, the crack spacing for a support with finite stiffness can be approximated as:

&lt;math&gt;d \approx \frac{4h\Gamma}{E_pa\epsilon_p^2(1+E_p/E_s)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_s&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic modulus of the sublayer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The denominator in this approximation indicates that crack spacing is dependent on the mismatch in the elastic moduli of the two layers; therefore, regions with stiffer paints tend to have cracks that are more spread out.

==== Other effects ====
Changes in the relative humidity during the drying process affect both the ground layer and support of a painting, promoting crack propagation. Paintings involving hygroscopic materials like wood supports or [[gesso]] ground layers are especially susceptible to variations in relative humidity. Gesso is brittle at relative [[Relative humidity|humidities]] (RH) below 75%; as RH increases, gesso becomes less stiff and transitions to a ductile state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krzemien|first=Leszek|date=2016|title=Mechanism of craquelure pattern formation on panel paintings|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00393630.2016.1140428|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=61|pages=324–330|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in RH cause highly non-uniform tensile strains across the gesso surface, and when the material contracts upon drying, it fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aurand|first=Alice|date=18 April 2018|title=Understanding the moisture induced fatigue damage in panel paintings: a methodological approach for quantifying the role of preparatory layers in overall response|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01769628|journal=Physical issues in the conservation of Paintings: Monitoring, Documenting, and Treatment|volume=|pages=|via=HAL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craquelure formed during gesso drying are particularly noticeable.

Similarly, wood supports respond significantly to changes in RH. Wood grains tend to swell perpendicular to the grain axis when they are exposed to moisture.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=David|last2=Uzielli|first2=Luca|last3=Mazzanti|first3=Paola|date=May-June 2017|title=Strains in gesso on painted wood panels during humidity changes and cupping|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1296207416303697|journal=Journal of Cultural Heritage|volume=25|pages=163–169|doi=10.1016/j.culher.2016.11.002|issn=1296-2074}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a wet ground layer is applied to the surface of a wood support, the wood in contact with the layer swells while the back of the panel remains unchanged. This can contribute to cupping, in which the panel of wood starts to bow transverse to the wood grain. The increased strains on the convex side of the cupped wood panel causes further fracture in the ground layer as it dries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Craquelure during aging ===
Compared to their drying counterparts, aging cracks are sharper, deeper, and are developed over the lifetime of the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This type of craquelure is much more difficult to predict and model because it depends on the specific environmental changes and chemical aging reactions the paint is subjected to. Critical processes that contribute to aging craquelure include direct impacts, gradients in temperature and relative humidity, support deformation, restoration processes like canvas reinforcement and stretching, and oxidation reactions that make the surface chalky or more brittle. In general, the pictorial layer becomes more brittle as it ages, which makes it unable to accommodate the stresses induced by environmental factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Induced craquelure===
[[Aged artwork|Induced craquelure]] can be created by a variety of techniques, and in paintings is often used by forgers of [[Old Master]] paintings, which would normally show some.  Art forger [[Eric Hebborn]] developed a technique and [[Tony Tetro]] discovered a way to use [[formaldehyde]] and a special baking process.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Hays, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zAQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;ots=0pMAWWzTCj&amp;dq=tony%20tetro%20trial&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Being Salvador Dali"] ''[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast]]'' (July 2000). Retrieved June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Craquelure is almost impossible to accurately reproduce artificially in a particular pattern, although there are some methods such as baking or finishing of a painting by which this is attempted. These methods, however, generally achieve cracks that are uniform in appearance, while genuine craquelure has cracks with irregular patterns.&lt;ref name="homeinstitute"/&gt;

Craquelure is frequently induced by using zinc white paints as the underlayer in [[pentimento]] techniques. Zinc whites with small zinc oxide particles (~250&amp;nbsp;nm) are more successful at inducing craquelure than larger particles because it does not adhere to the sublayer.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macchia|first=Andrea|date=2015|title=White zinc in linseed oil paintings: chemical, mechanical, and aesthetic aspects|url=|journal=Periodico di Mineralogica|volume=84|pages=483–495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, zinc white paints using linoleic acid-based binders are more successful at producing craquelure than paints with other binders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Craquelure in ceramics==
[[File:425203204 640068f512 o.jpg|thumb|[[Ge ware|Ge-type]] vase, with "gold thread and iron wire" double crackle, dated by the [[Palace Museum]] [[Beijing]] to the [[Song dynasty]]]]
Craquelure affecting the glaze in ceramics may develop with age but has also been used as a deliberate decorative effect, which has a long history in [[Korean pottery|Korean]] and [[Chinese pottery]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Ward, 149"&gt;Ward, 149&lt;/ref&gt; These deliberate glazing effects are usually known as "crackle", with '''crackle[d] glaze''' or "crackle porcelain" being common terms. It is typically distinguished from [[crazing]], which is accidental craquelure arising as a [[glaze defect]], although in some cases, experts have difficulty in deciding whether milder effects are deliberate or not.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 101, 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; Some may also only have developed with age. Leading Chinese wares of the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan dynasties]] with deliberate crackle glazes are [[Guan ware]] and [[Ge ware]]; in [[Ru ware]], the milder crackle may be accidental, though the majority of pieces have it.

Ge ware can have a type of double crackle, known as "gold thread and iron wire", where there are two patterns, one with wide and large crackle and the other with a finer network. Each set of cracks has had the effect heightened by applying a coloured stain, in different colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3179984&amp;partId=1&amp;ware=31241&amp;page=1 British Museum page], PDF.94 (expand two sets of comments); Krahl, Regina: [[Oxford Art Online]], section "Guan and Ge wares" in "China, §VIII, 3: Ceramics: Historical development"&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple layers of glaze, and the wider crackle develops first, with the finer one developing inside those sections. The crackle may take some time to appear after firing and is probably mainly caused by rapid cooling&lt;ref&gt;[[Rose Kerr (art historian)|Kerr, Rose]], [[Joseph Needham|Needham, Joseph]], Wood, Nigel, ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 12, Ceramic Technology'', p. 266, 2004, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521838339}}, 9780521838337, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mabcHwmAD5oC&amp;pg=PA265 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps low [[silica]] in the glaze.

==Modern applications==
[[File:Adcrocuta eximia.jpg|thumb|Craquelure in fossilized hyena tooth]]

=== Acrylic craquelure ===
[[File:French - Pair of Jars - Walters 491860, 491861.jpg|thumb|250px|Pair of Chinese crackled glaze jars with French [[ormolu]] mounts, both 18th century]]
The modern decor industry has used the technique of craquelure to create various objects and materials such as glass, ceramics, iron. This was made possible by the use of marketing kits that react with the colors used in decorative acrylic colors. The extent of craquelure produced varies according to the percentage of reagent and time of use. To highlight the cracks, glitter powder—usually available in copper, bronze and gold—is used. Mixing different brands of ready-made products to mimic craquelure results in various sizes and patterns of cracks.&lt;ref name="homeinstitute"/&gt; Software programs are available for creating craquelure in digital photos.&lt;ref name="digicraq"/&gt;

=== Use in art authentication ===
Methods that utilize craquelure as a means of detecting art forgery have been proposed. Historical craquelure patterns are difficult to reproduce and are therefore a useful tool in authenticating art. Modern detection techniques rely on feature extraction at crack junctions and image matching to verify the authenticity of artwork with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912553886|title=Computational forensics : 5th International Workshop, IWCF 2012, Tsukuba, Japan, November 11, 2012 and 6th International Workshop, IWCF 2014, Stockholm, Sweden, August 24, 2014, Revised selected papers|others=Garain, Utpal,, Shafait, Faisal,, IWCF (Workshop) (6th : 2014 : Stockholm, Sweden)|isbn=9783319201252|location=Cham|oclc=912553886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4763">The '''Diderot effect''' is a social phenomenon related to [[consumer goods]] that comprises two ideas. The first posits that goods purchased by consumers will be cohesive to their sense of identity, and as a result, will be complementary to one another. The second states that the introduction of a new possession that is deviant from the consumer's current complementary goods can result in a process of spiraling consumption. The term was coined by [[anthropologist]] and scholar of consumption patterns [[Grant McCracken]] in 1988, and is named after the French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] (1713–1784), who first described the effect in an [[essay]].

The term has become common in discussions of [[sustainable consumption]] and [[green consumerism]], in regard to the process whereby a purchase or gift creates dissatisfaction with existing possessions and environment, provoking a potentially spiraling pattern of consumption with negative environmental, psychological and social impacts. 

==Origin==
The effect was first described in Diderot's essay "Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown". Here he tells how the gift of a beautiful scarlet dressing gown leads to unexpected results, eventually plunging him into debt. Initially pleased with the gift, Diderot came to rue his new garment. Compared to his elegant new dressing gown, the rest of his possessions began to seem tawdry and he became dissatisfied that they did not live up to the elegance and style of his new possession. He replaced his old straw chair, for example, with an armchair covered in Moroccan leather; his old desk was replaced with an expensive new writing table; his formerly beloved prints were replaced with more costly prints, and so on. "I was absolute master of my old dressing gown", Diderot writes, "but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain".

==Usage==
In McCracken's usage the Diderot effect is the result of the interaction between objects within "product complements", or "Diderot unities", and consumers. A Diderot unity is a group of objects that are considered to be culturally complementary, in relation to one another. For example, items of clothing, furniture, vehicles, etc. McCracken describes that a consumer is less likely to veer from a preferred Diderot unity in order to strive towards unity in appearance and representation of one's social role. However, it can also mean that if an object that is somehow deviant from the preferred Diderot unity is acquired, it may have the effect of causing the consumer to start subscribing to a completely different Diderot unity.

Sociologist and economist [[Juliet Schor]] uses the term in her best selling 1992 book ''The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need'' to describe processes of competitive, status-conscious consumption driven by dissatisfaction. Schor's 2005 essay "Learning Diderot’s Lesson: Stopping the Upward Creep of Desire" describes the effect in contemporary consumer culture in the context of its negative environmental consequences.

'''Ecological engineering''' uses [[ecology]] and [[engineering]] to predict, design, construct or restore, and manage [[ecosystem]]s that integrate "[[human society]] with its [[natural environment]] for the benefit of both".&lt;ref name = "Mi 98"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering", In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins, key concepts, definitions, and applications ==
Ecological engineering emerged as a new idea in the early 1960s, but its definition has taken several decades to refine, its implementation is still undergoing adjustment, and its broader recognition as a new paradigm is relatively recent. Ecological engineering was introduced by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] and others&lt;ref name = "Od 63"&gt;H.T. Odum et al. (1963), ''Experiments with Engineering of Marine Ecosystems'', in: ''Publication of the Institute of Marine Science of the University of Texas'', 9: 374-403.&lt;/ref&gt; as utilizing [[renewable energy|natural energy]] sources as the predominant input to manipulate and control environmental systems. The origins of ecological engineering are in Odum's work with ecological modeling and ecosystem simulation to capture holistic macro-patterns of energy and material flows affecting the efficient use of resources. 

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; summarized five basic concepts that differentiate ecological engineering from other approaches to addressing problems to benefit society and nature: 1) it is based on the self-designing [[carrying capacity|capacity of ecosystems]]; 2) it can be the field (or acid) test of ecological theories; 3) it relies on system approaches; 4) it conserves [[non-renewable energy]] sources; and 5) it supports ecosystem and [[biological conservation]].

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 89"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering" In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to define ecological engineering as designing societal services such that they benefit society and nature, and later noted&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1993), "Ecological Engineering - A Cooperative Role with the Planetary Life Support Systems" in: ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology'', 27: 438-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1996), "Ecological Engineering: a new paradigm for engineers and ecologists", In: P.C. Schulze (Editor), ''Engineering Within Ecological Constraints''. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., pp. 114-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jørgensen (2003), "Ecological engineering: A field whose time has come", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 20(5): 363-377.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = "MJ 04"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (2004), "Ecological Engineering and Ecosystem Restoration". John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the design should be systems based, sustainable, and integrate society with its natural environment.  

Bergen et al.&lt;ref name = "Be 01"&gt;S.D. Bergen et al. (2001), "Design Principles for Ecological Engineering", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 18: 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt; defined ecological engineering as: 1) utilizing ecological science and theory; 2) applying to all types of ecosystems; 3) adapting engineering design methods; and 4) acknowledging a guiding value system.  

Barrett (1999)&lt;ref name = "Ba 99"&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. R. Barrett|year=1999|title=Ecological engineering in water resources: The benefits of collaborating with nature|journal=Water International|volume=24|pages=182–188|doi=10.1080/02508069908692160}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a more literal definition of the term: "the design, construction, operation and management (that is, engineering) of landscape/aquatic structures and associated plant and animal communities (that is, ecosystems) to benefit humanity and, often, nature."  Barrett continues: "other terms with equivalent or similar meanings include [[ecotechnology]] and two terms most often used in the [[erosion control]] field: soil bioengineering and biotechnical engineering.  However, ecological engineering should not be confused with '[[biotechnology]]' when describing genetic engineering at the cellular level, or '[[bioengineering]]' meaning construction of artificial body parts."

The applications in ecological engineering can be classified into 3 spatial scales: 1) mesocosms (~0.1 to 100s of meters); 2) ecosystems (~1 to 10s of km); and 3) regional systems (&gt;10s of km). The complexity of the design likely increases with the spatial scale. Applications are increasing in breadth and depth, and likely impacting the field's definition, as more opportunities to design and use ecosystems as interfaces between society and nature are explored.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Wetlands, ''Ecological Engineering'', webtext 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of ecological engineering has focused on the creation or restoration of ecosystems, from [[Land degradation|degraded]] [[wetlands]] to multi-celled tubs and [[greenhouse]]s that integrate microbial, fish, and plant services to process human [[wastewater]] into products such as fertilizers, flowers, and [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.J Todd &amp; J. Todd|year=1994|title=From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design|location=Berkeley|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1556431500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of ecological engineering in cities have emerged from collaboration with other fields such as [[landscape architecture]], [[urban planning]], and [[urban horticulture]],&lt;ref name = "Be 01"/&gt; to address human health and biodiversity, as targeted by the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]], with holistic projects such as [[stormwater management]]. Applications of ecological engineering in rural landscapes have included wetland treatment&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Nahlik and W.J. Mitsch. (2006), "Tropical Treatment Wetlands Dominated by Free-Floating Macrophytes for Water Quality Improvement in Costa Rica", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 28: 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; and community [[reforestation]] through traditional ecological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;S.A.W. Diemont and others (2006), "Lancandon Maya Forest Management: Restoration of Soil Fertility using Native Tree Species", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 28: 205-212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Permaculture]] is an example of broader applications that have emerged as distinct disciplines from ecological engineering, where [[David Holmgren]] cites the influence of [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] in development of permaculture.

== Design guidelines, functional classes, and design principles ==

Ecological engineering design will combine [[systems ecology]] with the process of [[engineering design]]. [[Engineering design]] typically involves problem formulation (goal), problem analysis (constraints), alternative solutions search, decision among alternatives, and specification of a complete solution.&lt;ref&gt;E.V. Krik&lt;/ref&gt; A temporal design framework is provided by Matlock et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"&gt;M.D. Matlock and others (2001), "Ecological Engineering: A Rationale for Standardized Curriculum and Professional Certification in the United States", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 17: 403-409.&lt;/ref&gt; stating the design solutions are considered in ecological time. In selecting between alternatives, the design should incorporate [[ecological economics]] in design evaluation&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and acknowledge a guiding value system which promotes biological conservation, benefiting society and nature.&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Be 01"/&gt; 

Ecological engineering utilizes [[systems ecology]] with engineering design to obtain a holistic view of the interactions within and between society and nature. Ecosystem simulation with [[Energy Systems Language]] (also known as energy circuit language or energese) by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] is one illustration of this systems ecology approach &lt;ref&gt;Brown, M.T. (2004) A picture is worth a thousand words: energy systems language and simulation. Ecological Modelling 178(1-2), 83-100.&lt;/ref&gt;. This holistic model development and simulation defines the system of interest, identifies the system's boundary, and diagrams how energy and material moves into, within, and out of, a system in order to identify how to use renewable resources through ecosystem processes and increase sustainability. The system it describes is a collection (i.e., group) of components (i.e., parts), connected by some type of interaction or interrelationship, that collectively responds to some stimulus or demand and fulfills some specific purpose or function. By understanding systems ecology the ecological engineer can more efficiently design with ecosystem components and processes within the design, utilize renewable energy and resources, and increase sustainability.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified five Functional Classes for ecological engineering designs:
# Ecosystem utilized to reduce/solve pollution problem. Example: phytoremediation, wastewater wetland, and bioretention of stormwater to filter excess nutrients and metals pollution
# Ecosystem imitated or copied to address resource problem. Example: forest restoration, replacement wetlands, and installing street side rain gardens to extend canopy cover to optimize residential and urban cooling
# Ecosystem recovered after disturbance. Example: mine land restoration, lake restoration, and channel aquatic restoration with mature riparian corridors
# Ecosystem modified in ecologically sound way. Example: selective timber harvest, biomanipulation, and introduction of predator fish to reduce planktivorous fish, increase zooplankton, consume algae or phytoplankton, and clarify the water.
# Ecosystems used for benefit without destroying balance. Example: sustainable agro-ecosystems, multispecies aquaculture, and introducing agroforestry plots into residential property to generate primary production at multiple vertical levels.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified 19 Design Principles for ecological engineering, yet not all are expected to contribute to any single design:
# Ecosystem structure &amp; function are determined by forcing functions of the system;
# Energy inputs to the ecosystems and available storage of the ecosystem is limited;
# Ecosystems are open and dissipative systems (not thermodynamic balance of energy, matter, entropy, but spontaneous appearance of complex, chaotic structure);
# Attention to a limited number of governing/controlling factors is most strategic in preventing pollution or restoring ecosystems;
# Ecosystem have some homeostatic capability that results in smoothing out and depressing the effects of strongly variable inputs;
# Match recycling pathways to the rates of ecosystems and reduce pollution effects;
# Design for pulsing systems wherever possible;
# Ecosystems are self-designing systems;
# Processes of ecosystems have characteristic time and space scales that should be accounted for in environmental management;
# Biodiversity should be championed to maintain an ecosystem's self design capacity;
# Ecotones, transition zones, are as important for ecosystems as membranes for cells; 
# Coupling between ecosystems should be utilized wherever possible;
# The components of an ecosystem are interconnected, interrelated, and form a network; consider direct as well as indirect efforts of ecosystem development;
# An ecosystem has a history of development;
# Ecosystems and species are most vulnerable at their geographical edges;
# Ecosystems are hierarchical systems and are parts of a larger landscape;
# Physical and biological processes are interactive, it is important to know both physical and biological interactions and to interpret them properly;
# Eco-technology requires a holistic approach that integrates all interacting parts and processes as far as possible;
# Information in ecosystems is stored in structures.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified the following considerations prior implementing an ecological engineering design: 
* Create conceptual model of determine the parts of nature connected to the project;
* Implement a computer model to simulate the impacts and uncertainty of the project;
* Optimize the project to reduce uncertainty and increase beneficial impacts. 

== Academic curriculum (colleges)==

An academic curriculum has been proposed for ecological engineering,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and institutions around the world are starting programs. Key elements of this curriculum are: [[environmental engineering]]; [[systems ecology]]; [[restoration ecology]]; [[ecological modeling]]; quantitative ecology; economics of ecological engineering, and technical [[Course (education)#Elective and required courses|electives]]. &lt;ref&gt;Diemont, S.W., T.J. Lawrence, and T.A. Endreny. "Envisioning Ecological Engineering Education: An International Survey of the Educational and Professional Community", Ecological Engineering, 36(4): 570-578, 2010. DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.12.004 &lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing this set of courses are prerequisites courses in physical, biological, and chemical subject areas, and integrated design experiences. According to Matlock et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; the design should identify constraints, characterize solutions in ecological time, and incorporate ecological economics in design evaluation. Economics of ecological engineering has been demonstrated using energy principles for a wetland.,&lt;ref&gt;S. Ton, H.T. Odum &amp; J.J. Delfino (1998),  "Ecological Economic Evaluation of Wetland Management Alternatives", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 11: 291-302.&lt;/ref&gt; and using nutrient valuation for a dairy farm &lt;ref&gt;C. Pizarro and others, ''An Economic Assessment of Algal Turf Scrubber Technology for Treatment of Dairy Manure Effluent. Ecological Engineering, 26(12): 321-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16471">A '''fusion gene''' is a hybrid gene formed from two previously separate genes. It can occur as a result of: [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]], [[Deletion (genetics)|interstitial deletion]], or [[chromosomal inversion]].

[[File:Gene Fusion Types.png|thumb|A schematic showing the ways a fusion gene can occur at a chromosomal level.]]

==History==
The first fusion gene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |first2=B |first3=F}}&lt;/ref&gt; was described in cancer cells in the early 1980s. The finding was based on the discovery in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford in Philadelphia of a small abnormal marker [[chromosome]] in patients with [[chronic myeloid leukemia]]—the first consistent chromosome abnormality detected in a human malignancy, later designated the [[Philadelphia chromosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=PC |last1=Nowell |first2=DA |last2=Hungerford |year=1960 |title=A minute chromosome in chronic granulocytic leukemia |journal=Science | doi = 10.1126/science.132.3438.1488 |pmid=17739576 | volume=132 | issue=3438 | pages=1488–1501 [1497] | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1985/A1985ABM0800002.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode=  1960Sci...132.1488.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[Janet Rowley]] in Chicago showed that the Philadelphia chromosome had originated through a translocation between chromosomes [[Chromosome 9 (human)|9]] and [[chromosome 22 (human)|22]], and not through a simple deletion of chromosome 22 as was previously thought. Several investigators in the early 1980s showed that the Philadelphia [[chromosome translocation]] led to the formation of a new BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, composed of the 3' part of the ABL1 gene in the breakpoint on chromosome 9 and the 5' part of a gene called BCR in the breakpoint in chromosome 22. In 1985 it was clearly established that the fusion gene on chromosome 22 produced an abnormal [[Fusion protein|chimeric]] BCR/ABL1 protein with the capacity to induce chronic myeloid leukemia.

At present, scientists have identified 21,404 gene fusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mitelman F|author2=Johansson B|author3=Mertens F|title=Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer|url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These genes have been found in practically all main subtypes of human neoplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |first2=B |first3=F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of these fusion genes play a prominent role in being a diagnostic and prognostic marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John|last1=Prensner |first2=Arul |last2=Chinnaiya |year=2009 |title= Oncogenic gene fusions in epithelial carcinomas |journal= Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2008.11.008 |pmid=19233641 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=82–91 | pmc=2676581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oncogenes==
It has been known for 30 years that the corresponding gene fusion plays an important role in tumorgenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Edwards  |year=2009 |title= Fusion genes and chromosome translocations in the common epithelial cancers |journal= Journal of Pathology | doi =10.1002/path.2632 |pmid=19921709  | volume=220  |issue=2  | pages=244–254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fusion genes can contribute to tumor formation because fusion genes can produce much more active abnormal protein than non-fusion genes. Often, fusion genes are [[oncogene]]s that cause [[cancer]]; these include [[Philadelphia chromosome|BCR-ABL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=PC |last1=Nowell |first2=DA |last2=Hungerford |year=1960 |title=A minute chromosome in chronic granulocytic leukemia |journal=Science | doi = 10.1126/science.132.3438.1488 |pmid=17739576 | volume=132 | issue=3438 | pages=1488–1501 [1497] | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1985/A1985ABM0800002.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode=  1960Sci...132.1488.}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEL-AML1 ([[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia|ALL]] with t(12 ; 21)), AML1-ETO ([[M2 AML]] with t(8 ; 21)), and [[TMPRSS2]]-[[ERG (gene)|ERG]] with an interstitial deletion on [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome&amp;nbsp;21]], often occurring in prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16254181 |year=2005 |last1=Tomlins |first1=SA |last2=Rhodes |last3=Perner |last4=Dhanasekaran |last5=Mehra |last6=Sun |last7=Varambally |last8=Cao |last9=Tchinda |title=Recurrent fusion of TMPRSS2 and ETS transcription factor genes in prostate cancer |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=644–8 |doi=10.1126/science.1117679 |journal=Science |first2=DR |first3=S |first4=SM |first5=R |first6=XW |first7=S |first8=X |first9=J|last10=Kuefer |first10=R |last11=Lee |first11=C |last12=Montie |first12=J. E. |last13=Shah |first13=R. B. |last14=Pienta |first14=K. J. |last15=Rubin |first15=M. A. |last16=Chinnaiyan |first16=A. M. |display-authors=8 |bibcode=2005Sci...310..644T }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the case of TMPRSS2-ERG, by disrupting androgen receptor (AR) signaling and inhibiting AR expression by oncogenic ETS transcription factor, the fusion product regulates the prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Jindan |last1= Yu | first2=Jianjun |last2= Yu|year=2010|title= An Integrated Network of Androgen Receptor, Polycomb, and TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer Progression Cancer Cell |journal= Cancer Cell| doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.03.018 | volume=17 | issue=5| pages=443–454| pmid=20478527 | pmc=2874722}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most fusion genes are found from [[Hematological malignancy|hematological cancer]]s, [[sarcoma]]s, and [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |first2=B |first3=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17425505 |year=2006 |last1=Teixeira |first1=MR |title=Recurrent fusion oncogenes in carcinomas |volume=12 |issue=3–4 |pages=257–71 |journal=Critical Reviews in Oncogenesis |doi=10.1615/critrevoncog.v12.i3-4.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[BCAM-AKT2]] is a fusion gene that is specific and unique to high-grade [[serous ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/deciphering-the-cancer-transcriptome/5729/ Deciphering the Cancer Transcriptome. 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oncogenic fusion genes may lead to a gene product with a new or different function from the two fusion partners. Alternatively, a proto-oncogene is fused to a strong [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], and thereby the oncogenic function is set to function by an [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulation]] caused by the strong promoter of the upstream fusion partner. The latter is common in [[lymphoma]]s, where oncogenes are juxtaposed to the promoters of the [[immunoglobulin]] genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12946230 |year=2003 |last1=Vega |first1=F |last2=Medeiros |title=Chromosomal translocations involved in non-Hodgkin lymphomas |volume=127 |issue=9 |pages=1148–60 |journal=Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine |first2=LJ |doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2003)127&lt;1148:CTIINL&gt;2.0.CO;2|doi-broken-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oncogenic [[fusion transcript]]s may also be caused by [[trans-splicing]] or [[Conjoined gene|read-through]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21261984 |year=2011 |last1=Nacu |first1=S |last2=Yuan |last3=Kan |last4=Bhatt |last5=Rivers |last6=Stinson |last7=Peters |last8=Modrusan |last9=Jung |title=Deep RNA sequencing analysis of readthrough gene fusions in human prostate adenocarcinoma and reference samples |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=11 |journal=BMC Med. Genom.|first2=W |first3=Z |first4=D |first5=CS |first6=J |first7=BA |first8=Z |first9=K |last10=Seshagiri |first10=Somasekar |last11=Wu |first11=Thomas D |doi=10.1186/1755-8794-4-11 |pmc=3041646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since chromosomal translocations play such a significant role in neoplasia, a specialized database of chromosomal aberrations and gene fusions in cancer has been created.  This database is called Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mitelman F|author2=Johansson B|author3=Mertens F|title=Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer|url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostics==
Presence of certain chromosomal aberrations and their resulting fusion genes is commonly used within cancer diagnostics in order to set a precise diagnosis. Chromosome [[Cytogenetics|banding analysis]], [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|fluorescence ''in situ'' hybridization]] (FISH), and [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) are common methods employed at diagnostic laboratories. These methods all have their distinct shortcomings due to the very complex nature of cancer [[genome]]s. Recent developments such as [[DNA sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19136943 |year=2009 |last1=Maher |first1=CA |last2=Kumar-Sinha |last3=Cao |last4=Kalyana-Sundaram |last5=Han |last6=Jing |last7=Sam |last8=Barrette |last9=Palanisamy |title=Transcriptome Sequencing to Detect Gene Fusions in Cancer |volume=458 |issue=7234 |pages=97–101 |doi=10.1038/nature07638 |journal=Nature |first2=C |first3=X |first4=S |first5=B |first6=X |first7=L |first8=T |first9=N |last10=Chinnaiyan |first10=Arul M. |pmc=2725402|display-authors=8 |bibcode=2009Natur.458...97M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and custom [[DNA microarray]]s bear promise of introduction of more efficient methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19152679 |year=2009 |last1=Skotheim |first1=RI |last2=Thomassen |last3=Eken |last4=Lind |last5=Micci |last6=Ribeiro |last7=Cerveira |last8=Teixeira |last9=Heim |title=A universal assay for detection of oncogenic fusion transcripts by oligo microarray analysis |volume=8 |pages=5 |doi=10.1186/1476-4598-8-5 |journal=Molecular Cancer |first2=GO |first3=M |first4=GE |first5=F |first6=FR |first7=N |first8=MR |first9=S |last10=Rognes |first10=Torbjørn |last11=Lothe |first11=Ragnhild A |pmc=2633275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Gene fusion plays a key role in the evolution of gene architecture. We can observe its effect if gene fusion occurs in coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pascal |last1= Durrens  | first2= Macha |last3= Sherman  |first3= David  |last2= Nikolski |year=2008|title= Fusion and Fission of Genes Define a Metric between Fungal Genomes |journal= PLoS Comput Biol| volume=4 | issue=10| pages=443–454|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000200|pmid= 18949021  |pmc= 2557144  |bibcode= 2008PLSCB...4E0200D  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duplication, sequence divergence, and recombination are the major contributors at work in gene evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Eichler |last1= EE |year=2001|title= Recent duplication, domain accretion and the dynamic mutation of the human genome |journal= Trends in Genetics |volume=17| issue=11| pages=661–669|doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(01)02492-1 |pmid= 11672867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events can probably produce new genes from already existing parts. When gene fusion happens in non-coding sequence region, it can lead to the misregulation of the expression of a gene now under the control of the [[cis-regulatory element|cis-regulatory]] sequence of another gene. If it happens in coding sequences, gene fusion cause the assembly of a new gene, then it allows the appearance of new functions by adding peptide modules into multi domain protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pascal |last1= Durrens  | first2= Macha |last3= Sherman  |first3= David  |last2= Nikolski |year=2008|title= Fusion and Fission of Genes Define a Metric between Fungal Genomes |journal= PLoS Comput Biol| volume=4 | issue=10| pages=443–454|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000200|pmid= 18949021  |pmc= 2557144  |bibcode= 2008PLSCB...4E0200D  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The detecting methods to inventory gene fusion events on a large biological scale can provide insights about the multi modular architecture of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Enright |last1= AJ | first2= Ouzounis |last2= CA |year=2001|title= Functional associations of proteins in entire genomes by means of exhaustive detection of gene fusions |journal= Genome Biology | volume=2| issue=9| pages=341–347|pmid=11820254|doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-9-research0034 | pmc=65099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Yanai |last1= I | first2= DeLisi |last3= Delisi |first3= C. |last2= C |year=2001|title= Genes linked by fusion events are generally of the same functional category: a systematic analysis of 30 microbial genomes |journal= Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume=98|issue= 14 | pages= 7940–7945 |pmc=35447 | pmid=11438739 | doi=10.1073/pnas.141236298|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.7940Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pasek |last1= S| first2= Risler |last3= Delisi|first3= Charles|last2= JL | year=2006|title=  Gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins|journal= Bioinformatics | volume=22|issue= 14| pages= 1418–1423 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl135 | pmid=16601004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
In recent years, next generation sequencing technology has already become available to screen known and novel gene fusion events on a genome wide scale. However, the precondition for large scale detection is a paired-end sequencing of the cell's [[transcriptome]]. The direction of fusion gene detection is mainly towards data analysis and visualization. Some researchers already developed a new tool called Transcriptome Viewer (TViewer) to directly visualize detected gene fusions on the transcript level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Jochen |last1= Supper | first2=Claudia |last2= Gugenmus |year=2013 |title= Detecting and visualizing gene fusions. Methods |journal= Methods| doi =10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.09.013 |pmid= 23036331 | volume=59 | issue=1| pages=24–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Biologists may also deliberately create fusion genes for research purposes. The fusion of [[reporter gene]]s to the regulatory elements of genes of interest allows researches to study gene expression. Reporter gene fusions can be used to measure activity levels of gene regulators, identify the regulatory sites of genes (including the signals required), identify various genes that are regulated in response to the same stimulus, and artificially control the expression of desired genes in particular cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=Leland H. Hartwell ... [et|title=Genetics : from genes to genomes|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0073525266|pages=533–534|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by creating a fusion gene of a protein of interest and [[green fluorescent protein]], the protein of interest may be observed in [[cell (biology)|cells]] or [[biological tissue|tissue]] using fluorescence [[microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=28749 |year=1978 |last1=Prendergast |first1=FG |last2=Mann |title=Chemical and physical properties of aequorin and the green fluorescent protein isolated from Aequorea forskålea |volume=17 |issue=17 |pages=3448–53 |journal=Biochemistry |doi=10.1021/bi00610a004 |first2=KG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein synthesized when a fusion gene is [[gene expression|expressed]] is called a ''[[fusion protein]]''.

The '''''Gallia Christiana''''', a type of work of which there have been several editions, is a documentary catalogue or list, with brief historical notices, of all the Catholic dioceses and abbeys of France from the earliest times, also of their occupants.

== First efforts ==

In 1621 [[Jean Chenu]], an ''[[avocat]]'' at the [[Parlement of Paris]], published ''Archiepiscoporum et episcoporum Galliæ chronologica historia''. Nearly a third of the bishops are missing, and the episcopal succession as given by Chenu was very incomplete. In 1626, Claude Robert, a priest of [[Langres]], published with the approbation of [[André Fremiot]], Archbishop of Bourges, a ''Gallia Christiana''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gallia christiana, in qua regni Franciae ditionumque vicinarum dioeceses et in iis praesules describuntur''; cura et labore Claudii Roberti,.... Felicibus auspiciis illustrissimi et reverendissimi D. Andreae Fremyot, archiepiscopi, patriarchae bituricensis, Aquitanarium primatis. Lutetiae, 1626 (BnF catalogue general)&lt;/ref&gt; He entered a large number of churches outside of [[Gaul]], and gave a short history of the [[metropolitan see]]s, cathedrals, and abbeys.

== The Samarthani ==

Two brothers de Sainte-Marthe, Scévole (1571–1650) and Louis (1571–1656), appointed [[historiographer royal|royal historiographers]] of France in 1620, had assisted Chenu and Robert. At the [[assembly of the French Clergy]] in 1626, a number of prelates commissioned these brothers to compile a more definitive work. They died before the completion of their work, and it was issued in 1656 by the sons of [[Scévole de Sainte-Marthe (1571–1650)|Scévole de Sainte-Marthe]], [[Pierre de Sainte-Marthe]] (1618–90), himself historiographer of France, [[Abel de Sainte-Marthe]] (1620–71), theologian, and later general of the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]], and [[Nicolas-Charles de Sainte-Marthe]] (1623–62), prior of [[Claunay]]. On 13 September 1656, the Sainte-Marthe brothers were presented to the assembly of the French Clergy, who accepted the dedication of the work on condition that a passage suspected of [[Jansenism]] be suppressed. The work formed four volumes [[in folio]], the first for the [[archdiocese]]s, the second and third for the dioceses, and the fourth for the abbeys, all in alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;The title was ''Gallia Christiana, qua series omnia archiepiscoporum, episcoporum et abbatum Franciæ vicinarumque ditionum ab origine ecclesiarum ad nostra tempora per quattor tomos deducitur, et probator ex antiquæ fidei manuscriptis Vaticani, regnum, principum tabulariis omnium Galliæ cathedralium et abbatarium''.&lt;/ref&gt; It reproduced a large number of manuscripts. Defects and omissions, however, were obvious. The Sainte-Marthe brothers themselves announced in their preface the early appearance of a second edition corrected and enlarged. 

As early as 1660 the Jesuit [[Jean Colomb]] published at Lyons the ''Noctes Blancalandanæ'', which contains certain additions to the work of the Samarthani, as the brothers and their successors are often called. "The name of Sainte-Marthe", wrote Voltaire, "is one of those of which the country has most reason to be proud." The edition promised by the Sainte-Marthe brothers did not appear.

== Revision by the Maurists ==

In 1710 the Assembly of the French Clergy offered four thousand livres to [[Denys de Sainte-Marthe]] (1650–1725), a Benedictine monk of the [[Congregation of Saint-Maur]], renowned for his polemics against the Trappist [[Abbé de Rancé]] on the subject of monastic studies, on condition that he should bring the revision of the ''Gallia Christiana'' to a successful conclusion, that the first volume should appear at the end of four years, and that his Congregation should continue the undertaking after his death. Through his efforts the first volume appeared in 1715, devoted to the ecclesiastical provinces of Albi, Aix, Arles, Avignon, and Auch. In 1720 he produced the second volume dealing with the provinces of Bourges and Bordeaux; and in 1725 the third, which treated Cambrai, Cologne, and Embrun. 

After his death the Benedictines issued the fourth volume (1728) on Lyons, and the fifth volume (1731) on Mechelen and Mainz. Between 1731 and 1740, on account of the controversies over the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]'', Dom [[Félix Hodin]] and Dom [[Etienne Brice]], who were preparing the latter volumes of the ''Gallia Christiana'', were expelled from [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]. They returned to Paris in 1739 and issued the sixth volume, dealing with Narbonne, also (1744) the seventh and eighth volumes on Paris and its [[suffragan see]]s. [[Père Duplessis]] united his efforts with theirs, and the ninth and tenth volumes, both on the [[province of Reims]], appeared in 1751. The eleventh volume (1759) dealing with the [[province of Rouen]] was issued by Père [[Pierre Henri]] and Dom [[Jacques Taschereau]]. In 1770 the twelfth volume on the [[province of Sens]] and [[province of Tarentaise]] appeared, and in 1785 the thirteenth, on the provinces of Toulouse and Trier. 

At the outbreak of the revolution, four volumes were lacking: Tours, Besançon, Utrecht, and Vienne. Barthélemy Hauréau published (in 1856, 1860 and 1865), for the provinces of Tours, Besançon and Vienne, respectively, and according to the Benedictine method, the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth volumes of the ''Gallia Christiana''. 

The province of Utrecht alone has no place in this great collection, but this defect has been remedied in part by the ''Bullarium Trajectense'', edited by [[Gisbert Brom]], and extending from the earliest times to 1378 (The Hague, 1891–96). 

The new ''Gallia Christiana'', of which volumes I to V and XI to XIII were reprinted by Dom [[Paul Piolin]] between 1870 and 1877, and volumes VI to IX and XII by the publisher H. Welter, places after each metropolitan see its suffragan sees, and after each see the abbeys belonging to it. The original documents, instead of encumbering the body of the articles, are inserted at the end of each diocese under in a section titled ''Instrumenta''. This colossal work does great honour to the Benedictines and to the Sainte-Marthe family. "The name of Sainte-Marthe", wrote Voltaire, "is one of those of which the country has most reason to be proud."

== Later works ==

In 1774 the Abbé [[Hugues du Temps]], vicar-general of Bordeaux, undertook in seven volumes an abridgement of the ''Gallia'' under the title "Le clergé de France" of which only four volumes appeared. About 1867 [[Honoré Fisquet]] undertook the publication of an episcopal history of France ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/Catalogue/noticesInd/FRBNF34044240.htm]''La France Pontificale''), in which, for the early period, he utilized the ''Gallia'', at the same time bringing the history of each diocese down to modern times. Twenty-two volumes appeared. 

[[Canon Albanès]] projected a complete revision of the ''Gallia Christiana'', each ecclesiastical province to form a volume. Albanès, who was one of the first scholars to search the Lateran and Vatican libraries, in his efforts to determine the initial years of some episcopal reigns, found occasionally either the acts of election or the Bulls of provision. He hoped in this way to remove certain suppositious bishops who had been introduced to fill gaps in the catalogues, but died in 1897 before the first volume appeared. Through the use of his notes and the efforts of Canon [[Ulysse Chevalier]] three addition volumes of this "Gallia Christiana (novissima)", treating Arles, Aix, and Marseilles, appeared at Montbéliard.

The '''Harrington Research Centre''' is a government-run facility that is part of the AAFC umbrella of the agricultural sector. Located in [[Harrington, Prince Edward Island|Harrington, PEI]],  the centre has a vast wealth of resources all focused on the advancements of Canadian agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/research-centres/atlantic-provinces/charlottetown-research-and-development-centre/?id=1180557429228|title=Charlottetown Research and Development Centre|last=Canada|first=Crops and Livestock Research Centre - Charlottetown;Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada;Government of|website=www.agr.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potato research ==
PEI has long been an area of Canada that is known for growing quality island-grown potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.peipotato.org/why-pei-potatoes|title=Why PEI Potatoes?|newspaper=PEI Potatoes|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the potato industry investing in methods in which potatoes can grow better, and without disease. One disease in particular that was hampered the PEI potato producers in the past decade is the [[Click beetle|wire-worm]]. This spurred scientist Dr. Noronha to create a wireworm trap which severely deterred the pest from affecting nearby potato crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-wireworm-pest-problem-trap-invention-1.3487351|title=New wireworm trap for $6M P.E.I. pest problem ''could be a major breakthrough'|newspaper=CBC News|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organic research ==
Acreage at the facility has been certified organic, becoming the only center in Canada to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-harrington-organic-agriculture-canada-1.3644158|title=Agriculture Canada first: 10 hectares at Harrington certified organic|newspaper=CBC News|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/news/science-of-agricultural-innovation/harrington-research-farm-gets-certified-organic-for-organic-research-plots/?id=1465307019073|title=Harrington Research Farm gets certified organic for organic research plots|last=Canada|first=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada;Government of|website=www.agr.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

Hybrid growth disorders may be referred to as a '''growth dysplasia''', especially when resulting in overgrowth, although this terminology may be confusing since the term [[dysplasia]] is commonly used to imply an impending cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706780870|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary.|date=2012|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|others=Dorland, W.

Hybrid growth disorders are exhibited among a variety organisms, including [[liger]]s, [[tigon]]s, hybrid mice, and hybrid [[dwarf hamster]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/532895|title=Mammalian hybrids: a check-list with bibliography,|last=P.|first=Gray, Annie|date=1972|publisher=Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux|isbn=0851981704|edition=2d [rev.]|location=Slough,|oclc=532895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul B.

A study on hybrid mice which investigated the possible causes for hybrid growth disorders reveals [[Imprinting (genetics)|genomic imprinting]] to have a major effect.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Paternal imprinting may increase growth to maximize maternal resources allocated to his progeny, while maternal imprinting may suppress growth in favor of ensuring her own survival and equal allocation of resources between offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/imprinting/|title=Genomic Imprinting|website=learn.genetics.utah.edu|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the extent of a disorder depends on the combination of parental species and their respective sexes, as demonstrated by the Vrana study.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The study concludes that hybrid growth disorders most commonly affect the [[Heterozygote|heterozygous]] sex, as expected by [[Haldane's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haldane|first1=J.B.S.|title=Sex ratio and unisexual sterility in hybrid animals|journal=Journal of Genetics|date=October 1922|volume=12|issue=2|pages=101–109|doi=10.1007/BF02983075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delph|first1=Lynda F.|last2=Demuth|first2=Jeffery P.|title=Haldane's Rule: Genetic Bases and Their Empirical Support|journal=Journal of Heredity|date=September 2016|volume=107|issue=5|pages=383–391|doi=10.1093/jhered/esw026}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also explain why hybrid growth disorders often appear to affect one sex more than the other.

Similarly, a study of hybrids between dwarf hamster species [[Campbell's dwarf hamster|''Phodopus campbelli'']] and [[Djungarian hamster|''Phodopus sungorus'']] suggests that gene imprinting causes abnormal interactions between growth-promoting and growth-repressing genes which regulate placental and embryonic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] in Central China is the [[List of largest power stations in the world#Top 20 largest power producing facilities|world's largest]] power producing facility of any kind.]]
{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Hydroelectricity''' is [[Electricity generation|electricity produced]] from [[hydropower]]. In 2015, hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all [[renewable energy|renewable electricity]],&lt;ref name="ren21.net"&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the [[Asia-Pacific]] region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013. [[China]] is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 920 TWh of production in 2013, representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use.

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 [[megawatt]]s is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per [[kilowatt-hour]].&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and in many cases, has a considerably lower output level of [[greenhouse gas]]es than [[fossil fuel]] powered energy plants.&lt;ref name="REN21-2011"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR2011_FINAL.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower], ''[[REN21]]'', published 2011, accessed 2016-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks. In the mid-1770s, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late 19th century, the [[electrical generator]] was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]], England by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]]. It was used to power a single [[arc lamp]] in his art gallery.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The old [[Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station#Origins|Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1]] near [[Niagara Falls]] in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first [[Thomas Alva Edison|Edison]] hydroelectric power station, the [[Vulcan Street Plant]], began operating September 30, 1882, in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/darvill/altenerg/hydro.htm|title= Hydroelectric power - energy from falling water|publisher=Clara.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the U.S. and Canada. By 1889 there were 200 in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="doehis"/&gt;

[[File:Warwick Castle - Engine House, Waterwheel, Weir, and Old Castle Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Warwick Castle]] water-powered generator house, used for the generation of electricity for the castle from 1894 until 1940]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas. [[Grenoble]], France held the [[International Exhibition of Hydropower and Tourism]] with over one million visitors. By 1920 as 40% of the power produced in the United States was hydroelectric, the [[Federal Power Act]] was enacted into law. The Act created the [[Federal Power Commission]] to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water. As the power stations became larger, their associated dams developed additional purposes to include [[flood control]], [[irrigation]] and [[navigable|navigation]]. Federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations, such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (1933) and the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] (1937) were created.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] which had begun a series of western U.S. irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 [[Boulder Canyon Project Act|Hoover Dam]].&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder Canyon Project Act|url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|date=December 21, 1928|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613142851/http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/g1000/pdfiles/bcpact.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] was also involved in hydroelectric development, completing the [[Bonneville Dam]] in 1937 and being recognized by the [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] as the premier federal flood control agency.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;[http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936, Joseph L.

Hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower was referred to as ''white coal'' for its power and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Book of Knowledge|volume=Vol. 9|page=3220|edition=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoover Dam]]'s initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2zlasvegas.com/otherside/sights/hoover.html|title=Hoover Dam and Lake Mead|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Reclamation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Itaipu Dam]] opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including [[Norway]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Brazil]], with over 85% of their electricity. The United States currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4% of its total electrical production output, which is 49% of its renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="watenc"/&gt;

==Future potential==
The technical potential for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. 
The political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A few countries are highly developed and have very little room for growth, Switzerland 12% and Mexico 20%.

==Generating methods==

[[File:Hydroelectric dam.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Cross section of a conventional hydroelectric dam.]]

[[File:Water turbine - edit1.svg|thumb|A typical [[Water turbine|turbine]] and [[electrical generator|generator]]]]

===Conventional (dams)===
{{See also|List of conventional hydroelectric power stations}}

Most hydroelectric power comes from the [[potential energy]] of [[dam]]med water driving a [[water turbine]] and [[electric generator|generator]]. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow. This height difference is called the [[head (hydraulic)|head]]. A large pipe (the "[[penstock]]") delivers water from the [[reservoir]] to the turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricityforum.com/hydroelectricity.html|title=hydro electricity - explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pumped-storage===
{{Main article|Pumped-storage hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations}}

This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between [[reservoir]]s at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine. Pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale [[grid energy storage]] and improve the daily [[capacity factor]] of the generation system. Pumped storage is not an energy source, and appears as a negative number in listings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained Pumped Storage, Explained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231233454/http://thesouthslope.com/content/pumped-storage-explained |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Run-of-the-river===
{{Main article|Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity}}
{{See also|List of run-of-the-river hydroelectric power stations}}

Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, and any oversupply must pass unused. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river. In the United States, run of the river hydropower could potentially provide {{convert|60000|MW}} (about 13.7% of total use in 2011 if continuously available).&lt;!--total use in 2011 was 3841 billion kWh from Annual Energy Outlook http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/er/ --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/run-of-the-river-hydropower-goes-with-the-flow|title=Run-of-the-River Hydropower Goes With the Flow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tide===
{{Main article|Tide power}}
{{See also|List of tidal power stations}}

A [[tidal power]] station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides; such sources are highly predictable, and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs, can also be [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] to generate power during high demand periods. Less common types of hydro schemes use water's [[kinetic energy]] or undammed sources such as undershot [[water wheel]]s. Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world. In Great Britain, there are eight sites that could be developed, which 
have the potential to generate 20% of the electricity used in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darvill.clara.net/altenerg/tidal.htm|title=Energy Resources: Tidal power|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes, types and capacities of hydroelectric facilities==

=== Large facilities ===
{{See also|List of largest power stations in the world|List of largest hydroelectric power stations}}

Large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world, with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current [[List of nuclear power stations|largest nuclear power stations]].

Although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations, facilities from over a few hundred [[megawatt]]s are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities.

Currently, only four facilities over {{nowrap|10 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}} ({{nowrap|10,000 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}) are in operation worldwide, see table below.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small===
{{Main article|Small hydro}}

Small hydro is the development of [[hydroelectric power]] on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant. The definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro. This may be stretched to 25 MW and 30 MW in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 29% from 2005 to 2008, raising the total world small-hydro capacity to {{nowrap|85 [[Gigawatt|GW]]}}. Over 70% of this was in [[China]] ({{nowrap|65 GW}}), followed by [[Japan]] ({{nowrap|3.5 GW}}), the United States ({{nowrap|3 GW}}), and [[India]] ({{nowrap|2 GW}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=July 18, 2011 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nw vietnam hydro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A micro-hydro facility in [[Vietnam]]]]
[[File:Amateur Hydroelectricity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pico hydroelectricity in [[Mondulkiri]], [[Cambodia]]]]
Small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy. Alternatively, small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network, or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network. Since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. This decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production.

===Micro===
{{Main article|Micro hydro}}

Micro hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|100 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}} of power. These installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks. There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |title=Micro Hydro in the fight against poverty |publisher=Tve.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426092643/http://tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro hydro systems complement [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] solar energy systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum.

===Pico===
{{Main article|Pico hydro}}

Pico hydro is a term used for [[hydroelectric power]] generation of under {{nowrap|5 [[Kilowatt|kW]]}}. It is useful in small, remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity. For example, to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a TV or radio for a few homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|title=Pico Hydro Power|publisher=T4cd.org|accessdate=2010-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731064419/http://www.t4cd.org/Resources/ICT_Resources/Projects/Pages/ICTProject_287.aspx|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even smaller turbines of 200-300W may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only {{Convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. A Pico-hydro setup is typically [[#Run-of-the-river|run-of-the-river]], meaning that dams are not used, but rather pipes divert some of the flow, drop this down a gradient, and through the turbine before returning it to the stream.

===Underground===
{{Main article|Underground power station}}

An [[underground power station]] is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways, such as a waterfall or mountain lake. An underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway.[[File:Tailrace-Forebay-Limestone.JPG|thumb|Measurement of the tailrace and forebay rates at the [[Limestone Generating Station]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]].]]

===Calculating available power===
{{Main article|Hydropower}}
A simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is: &lt;math&gt; P = \rho hrgk &lt;/math&gt;, where
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is Power in watts,
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water (~1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is height in meters,
*&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is flow rate in cubic meters per second,
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration due to [[gravity]] of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1. Efficiency is often higher (that is, closer to 1) with larger and more modern turbines.

Annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply. In some installations, the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year.

==Properties==

===Advantages===
[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] can generate {{nowrap|360 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} of electricity within 60 seconds of the demand arising.]]

====Flexibility====
Hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Huggins2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert A. Huggins|title=Energy Storage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn5y9gQeIlwC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants.&lt;ref name="SusskindRaseman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herbert Susskind|author2=Chad J. Raseman|title=Combined Hydroelectric Pumped Storage and Nuclear Power Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbu5m1Een2sC|year=1970|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bent Sørensen|title=Renewable Energy: Its Physics, Engineering, Use, Environmental Impacts, Economy, and Planning Aspects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y17FoN2VUEwC&amp;pg=PA556|year=2004|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-656153-1|pages=556–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs.&lt;ref name="(U.S.)1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geological Survey (U.S.)|title=Geological Survey Professional Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37dUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=1980|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.&lt;ref name="Sørensen2004" /&gt;

====Low cost/high value power====
The major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch later]] as high value clean electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to [[intermittent energy source]]s.

Hydroelectric stations have long economic lives, with some plants still in service after 50–100 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf Hydropower – A Way of Becoming Independent of Fossil Energy?]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528070938/http://reme.epfl.ch/webdav/site/reme/users/106542/public/SHS4/Gr01.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating labor cost is also usually low, as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation.

Where a dam serves multiple purposes, a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the [[Three Gorges Dam]] will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |title=Beyond Three Gorges in China |publisher=Waterpowermagazine.com |date=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614050746/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2041318 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.&lt;ref&gt;(http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2406852), Should We Build More Large Dams? The Actual Costs of Hydropower Megaproject Development, Energy Policy, March 2014, pp. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suitability for industrial applications====
While many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks, some are created to serve specific [[industry|industrial]] enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for [[aluminium]] electrolytic plants, for example. The [[Grand Coulee Dam]] switched to support [[Alcoa]] aluminium in [[Bellingham, Washington]], [[United States]] for American [[World War II]] airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In [[Suriname]], the [[Brokopondo Reservoir]] was constructed to provide electricity for the [[Alcoa]] aluminium industry. [[New Zealand]]'s [[Manapouri Power Station]] was constructed to supply electricity to the [[aluminium]] [[smelter]] at [[Comalco|Tiwai Point]].

====Reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions====
Since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel, power generation does not produce [[carbon dioxide]].  While carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project, and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs, hydro in specific nordic cases, has the lowest [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions]] for power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions pg19&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to fossil fuels generating an equivalent amount of electricity, hydro displaced three billion tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/subtopics/hydropower/&lt;/ref&gt; One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] and the [[University of Stuttgart]] which was funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="ExternEFTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |title=Final Technical Report, Version 2 |author=Rabl A. et. al. |date=August 2005 |work=Externalities of Energy: Extension of Accounting Framework and Policy Applications |publisher=European Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307120342/http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study, hydroelectricity in Europe produces the least amount of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[externality]] of any energy source.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format)|year=2005|publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]])|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101201452/http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html|archive-date=1 November 2013|dead-url=|work=ExternE-Pol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming in second place was [[wind energy|wind]], third was [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], and fourth was [[solar energy|solar]] [[photovoltaic]].&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"/&gt; The low [[greenhouse gas]] impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in [[temperate climate]]s. The above study was for local energy in [[Europe]]; presumably similar conditions prevail in North America and Northern Asia, which all see a regular, natural freeze/thaw cycle (with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth). Greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of [[methane]] than those in temperate areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n9/full/ngeo1226.html|title=Climate science: Renewable but not carbon-free|first=Bernhard|last=Wehrli|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=4|issue=9|pages=585–586|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/ngeo1226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other uses of the reservoir====
Reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for [[List of water sports|water sports]], and become tourist attractions themselves. In some countries, [[aquaculture]] in reservoirs is common. [[Multipurpose reservoir|Multi-use dams]] installed for [[irrigation]] support [[agriculture]] with a relatively constant water supply. Large hydro dams can control floods, which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project.&lt;ref name="Water: Science and Issues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atkins|first=William|title=Hydroelectric Power|journal=Water: Science and Issues|year=2003|volume=2|pages=187–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
{{see also|Renewable energy debate#Disadvantages of hydroelectricity}}

====Ecosystem damage and loss of land====
[[File:MeroweDam01.jpg|thumb|[[Merowe Dam]] in [[Sudan]]. Hydroelectric power stations that use [[dam]]s submerge large areas of land due to the requirement of a [[reservoir]]. These changes to land color or [[albedo]], alongside certain projects that concurrently submerge rainforests, can in these specific cases, result in the global warming impact, or equivalent [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse gases]] of hydroelectricity projects, to exceed that of coal power stations.]]

Large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams, sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests, marshland and grasslands. Damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; The loss of land is often exacerbated by [[habitat fragmentation]] of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Paul|title=Hydropower|journal=Encyclopedia of Environment and Society|year=2007|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic [[ecosystem]]s both upstream and downstream of the plant site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/node/1476|title=Sedimentation Problems with Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since turbine gates are often opened intermittently, rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed.

====Water loss by evaporation====
A 2011 study by the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that hydroelectric plants in the U.S. consumed between 1,425 and 18,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour (gal/MWh) of electricity generated, through evaporation losses in the reservoir. The median loss was 4,491 gal/MWh, which is higher than the loss for generation technologies that use cooling towers, including concentrating solar power (865 gal/MWh for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWh for CSP tower), coal (687 gal/MWh), nuclear (672 gal/MWh), and natural gas (198 gal/MWh). Where there are multiple uses of reservoirs such as water supply, recreation, and flood control,  all reservoir evaporation is attributed to power production.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies], National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siltation and flow shortage====
When water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. [[Siltation]] can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrick James|first=H Chansen|title=Teaching Case Studies in Reservoir Siltation and Catchment Erosion|url=http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|publisher=TEMPUS Publications|location=Great Britain|pages=265–275|year=1998|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902184753/http://www.ijee.dit.ie/articles/Vol14-4/ijee1012.pdf|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Șentürk|first=Fuat|title=Hydraulics of dams and reservoirs|year=1994|publisher=Water Resources Publications|location=Highlands Ranch, Colo.|isbn=0-918334-80-2|edition=reference.|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Frauke Urban and Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=September 20, 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; One study from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; [[Brazil]] in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

====Methane emissions (from reservoirs)====
[[File:Hoover Dam Nevada Luftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Dam]] in the [[United States]] is a large conventional dammed-hydro facility, with an installed capacity of {{nowrap|2,080 [[Megawatt|MW]]}}.]]

{{See also|Environmental impacts of reservoirs}}

Lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of [[methane]]. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment, and forming methane, a [[greenhouse gas]]. According to the [[World Commission on Dams]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dams.org/report/|title=WCD Findal Report|publisher=Dams.org|date=2000-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821120709/http://www.dams.org/report/|archivedate=2013-08-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046|title=Hydroelectric power's dirty secret revealed|publisher=Newscientist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Boreal forest|boreal]] reservoirs of Canada and Northern Europe, however, [[Greenhouse gas#Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emissions]] are typically only 2% to 8% of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation. A new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/2006/12/01/rediscovered-wood-the-triton-sawfish/#more-1973|title="Rediscovered" Wood &amp; The Triton Sawfish|publisher=Inhabitat|date=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relocation====
Another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned. In 2000, the World Commission on Dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalrivers.org/en/way-forward/world-commission-dams/world-commission-dams-framework-brief-introduction|title=Briefing of World Commission on Dams|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|date=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Failure risks====
{{See also|Dam failure|List of hydroelectric power station failures}}

Because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water, a failure due to poor construction, natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure.

During Typhoon Nina in 1975 [[Banqiao Dam]] failed in Southern China when more than a year's worth of rain fell within 24 hours. The resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people, and another 145,000 from epidemics. Millions were left homeless.

The creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at [[Vajont Dam]] in Italy, where almost 2,000 people died.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;References may be found in the list of [[Dam failure]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malpasset Dam]] failure in [[Fréjus]] on the [[French Riviera]] (Côte d'Azur), southern France, collapsed on December 2, 1959, killing 423 people in the resulting flood.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_french/malpasset/malpasset.htm retrieved 02sep2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller dams and [[micro hydro]] facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned. For example, the small earthen embankment [[Kelly Barnes Dam]] failed in 1977, twenty years after its power station was decommissioned; causing 39 deaths.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/news/historical-toccoa/ Toccoa Flood] USGS Historical Site, retrieved 02sep2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison and interactions with other methods of power generation===
Hydroelectricity eliminates the [[flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion]], including pollutants such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitric oxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the [[coal]]. Hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of [[coal mining]] and the indirect health effects of coal emissions.

====Nuclear power====

Compared to [[nuclear power]], hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint, and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The creation of [[Garrison Dam]], for example, required Native American land to create Lake Sakakawea, which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles, and caused the inhabitants to sell 94% of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Michael L. (1982). ''Dammed Indians: the Pick-Sloan Plan and the Missouri River Sioux, 1944–1980''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, nuclear power is relatively inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs, the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for [[baseload]]. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for [[load following]]. Country examples were they are paired in a close to 50/50 share include [[Electricity sector in Switzerland|the electric grid in Switzerland]],  the [[Electricity sector in Sweden]] and to a lesser extent, [[Energy in Ukraine#Electricity|Ukraine]] and the [[Electricity sector in Finland]].

====Wind power====

[[Wind power]] goes through predictable [[Variable renewable energy|variation]] by season, but is [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] on a daily basis. Maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption, the wind may peak at night when power isn't needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest. Occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time, a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid. Peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower. In this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power. Conversely, in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons.

In areas that do not have hydropower, [[pumped storage]] serves a similar role, but at a much higher cost and 20% lower efficiency. An example of this is [[Electricity sector in Norway|Norway's trading]] with [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and possibly [[Germany]] or the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sintef.no/en/latest-news/norway-is-europes-cheapest-battery/&lt;/ref&gt; Norway is 98% hydropower, while it's flatland neighbors are installing wind power.

The ranking of hydro-electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity.&lt;ref name="ren21.net"/&gt;
Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generated 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Paraguay]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Venezuela]] have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power. [[Paraguay]] produces 100% of its electricity from hydroelectric dams, and exports 90% of its production to Brazil and to Argentina. [[Norway]] produces 98–99% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources.&lt;ref name=norway/&gt;

A hydro-electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year; the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the [[capacity factor]]. The installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2009/STAGING/local_assets/downloads/spreadsheets/statistical_review_full_report_workbook_2009.xls Consumption BP.com]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">'''Legal consciousness''' is a ''collection'' of understood and/or imagined to have understood, [[legal awareness]] of ideas, views, feelings and traditions imbibed through [[legal socialization]]; which reflects as [[legal culture]] among given individual, or a group, or a given society at large. The legal consciousness evaluates the existing [[law]] and also bears in mind an image of the desired or ideal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12433&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legal Consciousness Among Youth at the Red Hook Community Justice Center By Aviad Lael Brisman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is not an individual trait nor solely ideational; legal consciousness is a type of [[Social Practice|social practice]] reflecting and forming [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref name="Silbey Susan 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan|title=legal consciousness|journal=New Oxford Companion to Law|date=2008|pages=2|url=http://web.mit.edu/~ssilbey/www/pdf/Legal_consciousness.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015|ref=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of legal Consciousness documents the forms of participation and interpretation through which act or sustain, reproduce, or amend the circulating contested or hegemonic structures of meanings concerning [[law]]. Legal consciousness is the way in which [[law]] is experienced and interpreted by specific individuals as they engage, avoid, resist or just assume the [[law]] and legal meanings.

Legal consciousness is a state of being, [[legal socialisation]] is the process to Legal consciousness; where as [[legal awareness]] &amp; [[legal mobilisation]] are means to achieve  the same.

==Definition==
The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (1979) defined legal consciousness as " ''the sum of views and ideas expressing the attitude of people toward law, legality, and justice and their concept of what is lawful and unlawful. Legal consciousness is a form of social consciousness. Legal ideology, the system of legal views based on certain social and scientific viewpoints, is a concentrated expression of legal consciousness. The customs and feelings of people in relation to legal phenomena constitute the psychological aspect of legal consciousness; among these are a sense of justice and a loathing of crimes and illegal actions'' "

Legal consciousness is defined by Ewick and Silbey as the process by which people make sense of their experiences by relying on legal categories and concepts. People do this even when they are not familiar with the details and minutia of law or the legal system. They explain that there are cultural schemas provided by law that people use to make sense of their experiences. They refer to this as legality. The concept of legality includes "the meanings, sources, authority and cultural practices that are commonly recognized as legal, regardless of who employs them or for what ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewick; Silbey|first1=Patricia; Susan|title=The Common Place of Law: Stories from Everyday Life|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These meanings and sources and different ways of knowing and understanding enable people to make sense of what happens to them and what that might mean in terms of their rights and options. This process of understanding legal experiences occurs within a larger ecosystem in which there are disputes over meaning and values. Seron and Munger explain that ""in addition, class may affect legal consciousness: Law may mean different things depending on an individual's location in the various hierarchies of status, prestige, and knowledge associated with membership in a social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seron; Munger|first1=Carroll; Frank|last2=Munger|first2=Frank|title=Law and Inequality: Race, Gender... and of Course, Class|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=1996|volume=22|pages=187–212|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational linguistics]], '''lexical density''' constitutes the estimated measure of content per functional (grammatical) and lexical units ([[lexeme]]s) in total. It is used in [[discourse analysis]] as a descriptive parameter which varies with register and genre.  Spoken texts tend to have a lower lexical density than written ones, for example.

Lexical density may be determined thus:

&lt;math&gt; L_d = (N_{\mathrm{lex}}/N)  \times  100 &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;L_d&lt;/math&gt; = the analysed text's lexical density

&lt;math&gt;N_{\mathrm{lex}}&lt;/math&gt; = the number of lexical word tokens (nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs) in the analysed text

&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = the number of all tokens (total number of words) in the analysed text

&lt;small&gt;(The variable symbols applied herein are by no means conventional; they were arbitrarily chosen for the nonce to illustrate the example in question.)&lt;/small&gt;

A '''list of antibiotic resistant bacteria''' is provided below. These bacteria have shown antibiotic resistance (or [[antimicrobial resistance]]).

== Enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) ==
{{Main|New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1}}
[[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1|NDM-1]] is an [[enzyme]] that makes [[bacteria]] resistant to a broad range of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as ''C. difficile''.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN|year=1999|title=Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=341|issue=23|pages=1645–1651|doi=10.1056/NEJM199911253412203|pmid=10572152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name="Loo_2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A|year=2005|title=A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2442–9|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051639|pmid=16322602|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J.

TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible.

Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. ''M. tuberculosis'' develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug.

===''Mycoplasma genitalium''===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''M. genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suneta|first1=Soni|last2=Parkhouse|first2=Andy|last3=Gillian|first3=Dean|date=24 April 2017|title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg?|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2017/04/24/sextrans-2016-053077|deadurl=no|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|pages=sextrans-2016-053077|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azithromycin]] is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

===''Streptococcus''  ===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S|year=2004|title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes|journal=Emerg.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426" /&gt;

Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and [[Water pollution|polluted water]].

The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in ''E. coli'' developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt; [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[histone]] modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt;

Most of these showed [[multidrug resistance]] (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.&lt;ref name="pmid15549020"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC).|year=2004|title=Acinetobacter baumannii infections among patients at military medical facilities treating injured U.S. service members, 2002–2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5345a1.htm|journal=MMWR Morb.

=====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''=====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name="Poole2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poole K |title=Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2004 |pmid=14706082 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the ''P. aeruginosa'' [[biofilms]] and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen D, Joshi-Datar A, Lepine F, Bauerle E, Olakanmi O, Beer K, McKay G, Siehnel R, Schafhauser J, Wang Y, Britigan BE, Singh PK |title=Active Starvation Responses Mediate Antibiotic Tolerance in Biofilms and Nutrient-Limited Bacteria |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6058 |pages=982–6 |year=2011 |pmid=22096200 |doi=10.1126/science.1211037 |bibcode=2011Sci...334..982N |pmc=4046891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of '''data breaches''',  using data compiled from various sources, including press reports, government news releases and mainstream news articles. The list includes those involving the theft or compromise of 30,000 or more records, although many more smaller breaches occur continually. Breaches of large organizations where the number of records is still unknown are also listed. The various methods used in the breaches are also listed, with [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] being the most common.

Most breaches occur in North America. It is estimated that the average cost of a data breach will be over $150 million by 2020, with the global annual cost forecast to be $2.1 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cuna.org/articles/105948-data-breach-costs-will-soar-to-2t-juniper "Data breach costs will soar to $2T: Juniper"], CUNA, May 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.experian.com/assets/data-breach/white-papers/2015-industry-forecast-experian.pdf "Data Breach Industry Forecast"], ''[[Experian]]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in first half of 2018 alone, about 4.5 billion records were exposed as a result of data breaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecitizenng.com/analysis-data-breaches-compromised-4-5bn-records-in-half-year-2018-gemalto/ "Data breaches compromised 4.5bn records in half year 2018 – Gemalto"], [https://thecitizenng.com The Citizen], October 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [https://vigilante.pw/ Vigilante.pw] lists over 2,100 websites which have had their databases breached, containing over 2 billion user entries in total.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">This is a list of organizations and institutions of professional sexologists, sex researchers, and sexual behavior scientists.  These do not include organizations of non-professionals, political advocacy or activist groups (although some organizations may engage in some advocacy as one of their activities), self-help or social groups, groups of enthusiasts for a topic in sexology, or websites unassociated with any actual organization or institution.  These organizations and institutions are recognized by their local governments (such as by incorporation) or are administrative units within a larger organization that is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1052">'''Marking time''' is a [[military step]] in which soldiers march in place, moving their legs as in [[marching]], but without stepping forward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/usapa/index.html US Army Field Manual] FM 22-5  DRILL AND CEREMONIES&lt;/ref&gt;

The military [[drill command]] is "Mark Time!”  to change from standing at attention to 'Marking Time' or to change from marching at 'Quick Time' to 'Marking Time'.  The resulting action is to march in the same place, not to move in any direction. Also used during Color Guard maneuvers to make minor adjustments in a single file presentation of the colors. 

The term can also be used to refer to doing a minor job or task while waiting for an opportunity to arise, thus the casual usage in slang as describing motion without progress - not getting anywhere.  As with other [[military jargon]] it entered civilian use when a large portion of the population had military experience and understood the context.

{{History of war}}

'''Military organization''' or '''military organisation''' is the structuring of the armed forces of a [[State (polity)|state]] so as to offer such [[military capability]] as a [[national defense policy]] may require. In some countries [[paramilitary]] forces are included in a nation's armed forces, though not considered military{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}. Armed forces that are not a part of military or paramilitary organizations, such as [[Insurgency|insurgent]] forces, often [[mimic]] military organizations, or use ''[[ad hoc]]'' structures, while formal military organization tends to use [[hierarchical]] forms.

== History ==
{{sectstub|date=July 2018}}
The use of formalized [[Military rank#Roman ranks|ranks]] in a hierarchical structure came into widespread use with the [[Roman Army]].

In modern times, executive control, management and administration of military organization is typically undertaken by governments through a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] within the structure of [[public administration]], often known as a [[Ministry of Defense]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], or [[Department of War]]. These in turn manage [[Armed Services]] that themselves command formations and units specialising in combat, [[combat support]] and [[combat service support | combat-service support]].

==Executive control, management and administration==
The usually civilian or partly civilian executive control over the national military organization is exercised in [[democracy|democracies]] by an elected political leader as a member of the government's [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], usually known as a Minister of Defense. (In presidential systems, such as the United States, the president is the commander-in-chief, and the cabinet-level defense minister is second in command.) Subordinated to that position are often Secretaries for specific major operational divisions of the armed forces as a whole, such as those that provide general support services to the Armed Services, including their dependants.

Then there are the heads of specific departmental agencies responsible for the provision and management of specific skill- and knowledge-based service such as [[Strategy]] advice, [[Military capability|Capability Development]] assessment, or [[Military science|Defense Science]] provision of research, and design and development of technologies. Within each departmental agency will be found administrative branches responsible for further agency [[business|business specialization]] work.

==Armed services==

In most countries the ''armed forces'' are divided into three or four [[Armed services]] (also: ''service, military service, or military branch''): [[army]], [[navy]], and [[air force]].

Many countries have a variation on the standard model of three or four basic [[Armed Services]]. Some nations also organize their [[Marines (military)|marines]], [[special forces]] or [[ballistic missile|strategic missile]] forces as independent armed services. A nation's [[coast guard]] may also be an independent [[military branch]] of its military, although in many nations the coast guard is a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] or civil agency. A number of countries have no navy, for geographical reasons. Some other variations include:

In larger armed forces the culture between the different [[Armed Services]] of the armed forces can be quite different.

Most smaller countries have a single organization that encompasses all armed forces employed by the country in question. Third-world armies tend to consist primarily of infantry, while first-world armies tend to have larger units manning expensive equipment and only a fraction of personnel in infantry units.

It is worthwhile to make mention of the term ''[[Joint warfare|joint]]''.  In western militaries, a [[joint warfare|joint force]] is defined as a unit or formation comprising representation of combat power from two or more branches of the military.

===Internal security forces===
[[Gendarmerie]]s, including equivalents such as [[Internal Troops]], [[Paramilitary|Paramilitary Forces]] and similar, are an internal security service common in most of the world, but uncommon in Anglo-Saxon countries where civil police are employed to enforce the law, and there are tight restrictions on how the armed forces may be used to assist.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States it is a common misunderstanding that their armed forces are totally prohibited from doing so by the [[Posse Comitatus Act]]. This Act, which reserves to Congress the power to employ Federal military force to enforce law and order, refers specifically only to the [[US Army]] and [[US Air Force]]. The [[US Marines]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] are separately regulated, and the [[US Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] has a clear law enforcement role in its peacetime status. The state-controlled [[Army National Guard]] (technically a branch of the US Army) is also excluded from the Posse Comitatus Act. The [[Insurrection Act]] specifically permits the President to use Federal military force to restore public order in extreme emergency situations: this Act was implemented during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|"Rodney King Riots"]] in Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Commands.2C_formations.2C_and_units}}

==Commands, formations and units==
{{Redirect|Military formation|the arrangement or deployment of moving military forces|Tactical formation}}

It is common, at least in the European and North American militaries, to refer to the building blocks of a military as commands, formations and units.

In a military context, a [[Command (military formation)|command]] is a collection of units and formations under the control of a single officer. Although during the [[Second World War]] a Command was also a name given to a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the [[US Army]], in general it is an administrative and executive [[military strategy|strategic]] [[headquarters]] which is responsible to the national government or the national military headquarters. It is not uncommon for a nation's services to each consist of their own command (such as Land Component, Air Component, Naval Component, and Medical Component in the [[Belgian Army]]), but this does not preclude the existence of commands which are not service-based.

{{Anchor|Formation}}A formation is defined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] as "two or more aircraft, ships, or units proceeding together under a commander".&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Defense]], [http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html DOD Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223235143/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/f/02222.html |date=2008-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formin in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] emphasised its combined-arms nature: "Formations are those military organisations which are formed from different speciality Arms and Services troop units to create a balanced, combined combat force. The formations only differ in their ability to achieve different scales of application of force to achieve different strategic, operational and tactical goals and mission objectives."&lt;ref&gt;Fomin, N.N., Great Soviet Encyclopaedia ({{lang-ru|Большая Советская Энциклопедия}}), Moscow, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; It is a composite military organization that includes a mixture of integrated and operationally attached sub-units, and is usually combat-capable. Example of formations include: [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, [[battalion]]s, [[Wing (air force unit)|wings]], etc. Formation may also refer to [[tactical formation]], the physical arrangement or disposition of troops and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of formation in such usage include: [[pakfront]], [[panzerkeil]], [[testudo formation]], etc.

A typical unit is a homogeneous military organization (either combat, [[Combat support|combat-support]] or non-combat in capability) that includes service personnel predominantly from a single arm of service, or a branch of service, and its administrative and command functions are self-contained. Any unit subordinate to another unit is considered its sub-unit or minor unit. It is not uncommon for unit and formation to be used synonymously in the United States. In Commonwealth practice, formation is not used for smaller organizations like battalions which are instead called "units", and their constituent [[platoon]]s or [[Company (military unit)|companies]] are referred to as sub-units. In the Commonwealth, formations are [[Division (military)|division]]s, [[brigade]]s, etc.

Different [[armed forces]], and even different branches of service of the armed forces, may use the same name to denote different types of organizations. An example is the "squadron". In most navies a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] is a formation of several ships; in most air forces it is a unit; in the U.S. Army it is a battalion-sized [[cavalry]] unit; and in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armies a squadron is a company-sized sub-unit.

==Table of organization and equipment==
A [[table of organization and equipment]] (TOE or TO&amp;E) is a document published by the U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency that prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of Corps and Armies.

It also provides information on the mission and capabilities of a unit as well as the unit's current status. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as infantry) follow the same structural guidelines.

==Modern hierarchy==

{{Military units}}

=== Army hierarchy ===
{{Army units}}

The following table gives an overview of some of the terms used to describe army hierarchy in armed forces across the world. Whilst it is recognized that there are differences between armies of different nations, many are modeled on the [[British Army|British]] or [[United States Armed Forces|American]] models, or both. However, many military units and formations go back in history for a long time, and were devised by various military thinkers throughout European history.

For example, the modern ''Corps'' was first introduced in France about 1805 by Napoleon as a more flexible tactical grouping of two or more divisions during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

They have become part of the organization of most armies around the world.

Rungs may be skipped in this ladder: for example, typically NATO forces skip from battalion to brigade. Likewise, only large military powers may have organizations at the top levels and different armies and countries may also use traditional names, creating considerable confusion: for example, a British or Canadian armored regiment (battalion) is divided into [[Squadron (army)|squadron]]s (companies) and [[troop]]s (platoons), whereas an American cavalry squadron (battalion) is divided into troops (companies) and platoons.

[[Army]], [[army group]], [[region]], and [[theater (military)|theatre]] are all large formations that vary significantly between armed forces in size and hierarchy position.  While [[Division (military)|division]]s were the traditional level at which support elements (field artillery, hospital, logistics and maintenance, etc.) were added to the unit structure, since World War II, many brigades now have such support units, and since the 1980s, regiments also have been receiving support elements.  A regiment with such support elements is called a [[regimental combat team]] in US military parlance, or a [[Battlegroup (army)|battle group]] in the UK and other forces.

During [[World War II]] the [[Red Army]] used the same basic organizational structure.  However, in the beginning many units were greatly underpowered and their size was actually one level below on the ladder that is usually used elsewhere; for example, a division in the early-WWII Red Army would have been about the size of most nations' regiments or brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armor.kiev.ua/army/hist/doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |title=Доклад НКО август 1939. doklad-nko-8-39.shtml |publisher=Armor.kiev.ua |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=121&amp;sid=92105 |script-title=ru:Центральный государственный архив Советской армии (с июня 1992 г.

Путеводитель. 1993 |language=ru |publisher=Guides.rusarchives.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of the ladder, what other nations would call an army group, the Red Army called a [[Front (Soviet Army)|front]]. By contrast, during the same period the German [[Wehrmacht]] Army Groups, particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], such as [[Army Group Centre]] significantly exceeded the above numbers, and were more cognate with the Soviet [[Strategic Direction]]s.

=== Naval hierarchy ===
Naval organization at the flotilla level and higher is less commonly abided by, as ships operate in smaller or larger groups in various situations that may change at a moment's notice.  However, there is some common terminology used throughout navies to communicate the general concept of how many vessels might be in a unit.

Navies are generally organized into groups for a specific purpose, usually strategic, and these organizational groupings appear and disappear frequently based on the conditions and demands placed upon a navy.  This contrasts with army organization where units remain static, with the same men and equipment, over long periods of time.

The five-star ranks of Admiral of the Fleet and Fleet Admiral have largely been out of regular use since the 1990s, with the exception of ceremonial or honorary appointments. Currently, all major navies are commanded by an admiral (four-star rank) or vice-admiral (three-star rank) depending on relative size. Smaller naval forces, such as the RNZN, or those navies that are effectively coastguards, are commanded by a rear-admiral (two-star rank), commodore (one-star rank) or even a captain.

Aircraft carriers are typically commanded by a captain. Submarines and destroyers are typically commanded by a captain or commander.  Some destroyers, particularly smaller destroyers such as [[frigate]]s (formerly known as [[destroyer escort]]s) are usually commanded by officers with the rank of commander.  [[Corvette]]s, the smallest class of warship, are commanded by officers with the rank of commander or lieutenant-commander. Auxiliary ships, including [[gunboat]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], [[patrol boat]]s, military [[riverboat|riverine craft]], [[Ship's tender|tenders]] and [[torpedo boat]]s are usually commanded by lieutenants, sub-lieutenants or warrant officers.  Usually, the smaller the vessel, the lower the rank of the ship's commander.  For example, patrol boats are often commanded by [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]s, while frigates are rarely commanded by an officer below the rank of commander.

Historical navies were far more rigid in structure.  Ships were collected in divisions, which in turn were collected in numbered squadrons, which comprised a numbered fleet.  Permission for a vessel to leave one unit and join another would have to be approved on paper.

The modern U.S. Navy is primarily based on a number of standard groupings of vessels, including the [[carrier strike group]] and the [[Expeditionary Strike Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/ US Navy]. GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 2009-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Naval organization continues aboard a single ship. The complement forms three or four departments (such as tactical and engineering), each of which has a number of divisions, followed by work centers.

=== Air Force hierarchy ===
The organizational structures of air forces vary between nations: some air forces (such as the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]) are divided into commands, groups and squadrons; others (such as the [[Soviet Air Force]]) have an Army-style organizational structure.  The modern [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] uses [[Air Division (disambiguation)|Air Division]] as the formation between wings and the entire air command.  Like the RAF, Canadian wings consist of squadrons.

==Task force==
A [[task force]] is a unit or formation created as a temporary grouping for a specific operational purpose.  Aside from administrative hierarchical forms of organization that have evolved since the early 17th century in Europe, fighting forces have been grouped for specific operational purposes into mission-related organizations such as the German [[Kampfgruppe]] or the U.S. Combat Team (Army) and Task Force (Navy) during the Second World War, or the Soviet [[Operational manoeuvre group]] during the Cold War. In the British and Commonwealth armies the [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]] became the usual grouping of companies during the [[Second World War]] and the Cold War.

Within NATO, a [[Joint Task Force]] (JTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one armed service, a Combined Task Force (CTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements from more than one nation, and a Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) would be such a temporary grouping that includes elements of more than one armed service and more than one nation.

'''Monocoque''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|ə|ˌ|k|ɒ|k|,_|-|ˌ|k|oʊ|k}}), also '''structural skin''', is a structural system where loads are supported through an object's external skin, similar to an egg shell. The word ''monocoque'' is a [[French language|French]] term for "single shell" or (of boats) "single hull".&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
First used in boats,&lt;ref

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a true monocoque carries both tensile and compressive forces within the skin and can be recognised by the absence of a load-carrying internal frame.

Few metal aircraft can strictly be regarded as pure monocoques, as they use a metal shell or sheeting reinforced with frames riveted to the skin, but most of the wooden aircraft are described as monocoques, even though they also incorporate frames.

By contrast, a [[semi-monocoque]] is a hybrid combining a tensile [[stressed skin]] and a compressive structure made up of [[longeron|longerons and ribs or frames]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Airframe and Powerplant Mechanics Airframe Handbook (Publication AC65-15A) |year=1976 |publisher=US Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration Standards Division |location=Washington, DC |page=4 |isbn=0-16-036209-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other semi-monocoques, not to be confused with true monocoques, include vehicle [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unibodies]], which tend to be composites, and [[inflatable|inflatable shells]] or [[balloon tank]]s, both of which are pressure stabilised. The term is frequently misused, particularly as a marketing term for structures built up from hollow components.

== Aircraft ==
[[File:LFG Roland C.II LRQ.jpg|thumb|LFG Roland C.II with wooden ''Wickelrumpf'' monocoque fuselage]]
[[File:Zeppelin-Lindau (Do) D.I.jpg|thumb|Zeppelin D.I, the first production all-metal monocoque aircraft]]
Early aircraft were constructed using frames, typically of [[wood]] or [[steel]] tubing, which could then be covered (or ''skinned'') with fabric&lt;ref&gt;Megson, 1972, p.198&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Irish linen]] or [[cotton]].&lt;ref name="WWI Brit"&gt;Robertson, 1996, pp.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric made a minor structural contribution in tension but none in compression and was there for aerodynamic reasons only. By considering the structure as a whole and not just the sum of its parts, monocoque construction integrated the skin and frame into a single load-bearing shell with significant improvements to strength and weight.

To make the shell, thin strips of wood were laminated into a three dimensional shape; a technique adopted from boat hull construction. One of the earliest examples was the [[Deperdussin Monocoque]] racer in 1912, which used a laminated fuselage made up of three layers of glued poplar veneer, which provided both the external skin and the main load-bearing structure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Aeronautics, 1912, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; This also produced a smoother surface and reduced drag so effectively that it was able to win most of the races it was entered into.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This style of construction was further developed in Germany by [[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft|LFG Roland]] using the patented ''Wickelrumpf'' (wrapped body) form later licensed by them to [[Pfalz Flugzeugwerke]] who used it on several fighter aircraft.  Each half of the fuselage shell was formed over a male mold using two layers of plywood strips with fabric wrapping between them. The early plywood used was prone to damage from moisture and delamination.&lt;ref&gt;FAA, 2001, p.1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

While all-metal aircraft such as the [[Junkers J 1]] had appeared as early as 1915, these were not monocoques but added a metal skin to an underlying framework.

The first metal monocoques were built by [[Claudius Dornier]], while working for Zeppelin-Lindau.&lt;ref name="Terry, 1981, pp.97–117"&gt;Terry, 1981, pp.97–117&lt;/ref&gt; He had to overcome a number of problems, not least was the quality of aluminium alloys strong enough to use as structural materials, which frequently formed layers instead of presenting a uniform material.&lt;ref name="Terry, 1981, pp.97–117"/&gt; After failed attempts with several large flying boats in which a few components were monocoques, he built the [[Zeppelin-Lindau V1]] to test out a monocoque fuselage. Although it crashed, he learned a lot from its construction. The [[Dornier-Zeppelin D.I]] was built in 1918 and although too late for operational service during the war was the first all metal monocoque aircraft to enter production.&lt;ref name="Terry, 1981, pp.97–117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grosz, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel to Dornier, Zeppelin also employed [[Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau|Adolf Rohrbach]], who built the [[Zeppelin-Staaken E-4/20]], which when it flew in 1920&lt;ref&gt;Haddow, Grosz, 1988 pp. 289–293&lt;/ref&gt; became the first multi-engined monocoque airliner, before being destroyed under orders of the Inter-Allied Commission. At the end of WWI, the Inter-Allied Technical Commission published details of the last [[Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.IV|Zeppelin-Lindau flying boat]] showing its monocoque construction. In the UK, [[Oswald Short]] built a number of experimental aircraft with metal monocoque fuselages starting with the 1920 [[Short Silver Streak]] in an attempt to convince the air ministry of its superiority over wood. Despite advantages, aluminium alloy monocoques would not become common until the mid 1930s as a result of a number of factors, including design conservatism and production setup costs. Short would eventually prove the merits of the construction method with a series of flying boats, whose metal hulls didn't absorb water as the wooden hulls did, greatly improving performance. In the United States, Northrop was a major pioneer, introducing techniques used by his own company and Douglas with the [[Northrop Alpha]].

==Road vehicles==
[[File:McLaren MP4.jpg|thumb|1981 McLaren MP4/1, with a [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber composite]] monocoque]]

In motor racing, the safety of the driver depends on the car body which must meet stringent regulations and only a few cars have been built with monocoque structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/monocoque.html] Monocoque – Survival Cell, Technical F1 dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f1technical.net/features/2313] Passive car safety, Steven De Groote, 26 Mar 2006&lt;/ref&gt; An [[aluminum alloy]] monocoque chassis was first used in the 1962 [[Lotus 25]] Formula 1 race car and [[McLaren]] was the first to use carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers to construct the monocoque of the 1981 [[McLaren MP4/1]]. In 1992 the [[McLaren F1]] became the first production car with a carbon-fiber monocoque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1994 McLaren F1|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/vehicle/z648/McLaren_F1.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term monocoque is frequently misapplied to unibody cars. Commercial car bodies are almost never true monocoques but instead use the [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unibody]] system (also referred to as unitary construction, unitary body-chassis or body frame integral construction),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naaamap.com/NAAA/documents/NAAAStructuralDamagePolicy_Jan2011.pdf NAAA Structural Damage Policy] dated 1 January 2011, retrieved 29 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which uses box sections, bulkheads and tubes to provide most of the strength of the vehicle, while the skin adds relatively little strength or stiffness. &lt;ref&gt;Allan, Rob. [http://tardis.dl.ac.uk/Mercia/killeen_book/node3.html The Killeen Cars] Accessdate:October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armoured vehicles ===
Some [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s use a monocoque structure with a body shell built up from [[armour]] plates, rather than attaching them to a frame. This reduces weight for a given amount of armour. Examples include the German [[TPz Fuchs]] and [[RG-33]].

=== Two-wheeled vehicles ===
French industrialist and engineer Georges Roy attempted in the 1920s to improve on the bicycle-inspired motorcycle frames of the day, which lacked rigidity.  This limited their handling and therefore performance.  He applied for a patent in 1926, and in 1929 at the Paris Automotive Show unveiled his new motorcycle, Art-Deco styled: the 1930 Majestic. Its new type of monocoque body solved the problems he had addressed, and along with better rigidity it did double-duty, as frame and bodywork provided some protection from the elements.  Strictly considered, it was more of a semi-monocoque, as it utilized a box-section pressed-steel frame with twin side rails riveted together via crossmembers, along with floor pans and rear and front bulkheads.&lt;ref name=french/&gt;

A monocoque-framed [[motorcycle]] was developed by the Spanish motorcycle manufacturer, [[Ossa (motorcycle)|Ossa]], for the [[1967 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season]].&lt;ref name="Santiago Herrero - Spanish Flyer"&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Santiago Herrero – Spanish Flyer |last=Robinson |first=James |volume= |issue=91 |pages=35–40 |date=September 2001 |magazine=Classic Racer|ISSN=1470-4463}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:OSSA 250cc Monohull 1968 Santi Herrero c.JPG|thumb|1968 Ossa 250&amp;nbsp;cc Grand Prix racer]] Although the single-cylinder Ossa had {{convert|20|hp|kW}} less than its rivals, it was {{convert|45|lb}} lighter and its monocoque frame was much stiffer than conventional [[motorcycle frame]]s, giving it superior agility on the racetrack.&lt;ref name="Santiago Herrero - Spanish Flyer"/&gt; Ossa won four Grand Prix races with the monocoque bike before their rider was killed during the [[1970 Isle of Man TT]], causing the Ossa factory to withdraw from [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] competition.&lt;ref name="Santiago Herrero - Spanish Flyer"/&gt;

Notable designers such as Eric Offenstadt and Dan Hanebrink created unique monocoque designs in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/offenstadt.html |title=8W – Who? – Eric Offenstadt |publisher=Forix.autosport.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1973 Isle of Man TT]] was won by [[Peter Williams (motorcyclist)|Peter Williams]] on the monocoque-framed [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] John Player Special that he helped design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/features/122_0801_motorcycle_chassis_technology/index.html |title=Motorcycle Technology – Future Perfect – Up To Speed |publisher=motorcyclistonline.com |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Honda]] also experimented with a monocoque Grand Prix racing motorcycle named the [[NR500]] in [[1979 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1979]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1979grandprix/text/07.html | title=The Unconventional: Adopting a "Shrimp Shell" Frame | work=Challenging Spirits of Honda | publisher=Honda Motor Co., Ltd | accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bike also featured other innovative features, including an engine with oval shaped cylinders, and eventually succumbed to the problems associated with attempting to develop too many new technologies at once. In 1987 [[John Britten]] developed the Aero-D One, featuring a composite monocoque chassis that weighed only 12&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britten.co.nz/history/aerobike.html | title=The Aero Bike | publisher=Britten Motorcycle Company | accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time an aluminium monocoque frame appeared on a mass-produced production motorcycle was the 2000 [[Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R]].&lt;ref name=frame&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kawasaki-cp.khi.co.jp/technology/chassis/tech_monocoque_e.html//|title=Kawasaki Technology|publisher=[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle &amp; Engine]]|accessdate=December 18, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112185328/http://www.kawasaki-cp.khi.co.jp/technology/chassis/tech_monocoque_e.html|archivedate=January 12, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Kawasakis flagship production sportbike aimed at being the [[fastest production motorcycle]].

Single-piece [[carbon fiber]] [[bicycle frame]]s are sometimes described as monocoques however as most use the components to form a frame structure (even if molded in a single piece),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velocite-bikes.com/carbon-fiber.html?sl=EN|title=Carbon Fiber|accessdate=February 16, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224095756/http://www.velocite-bikes.com/carbon-fiber.html?sl=EN|archivedate=February 24, 2013|df=}}, Velocite-bikes.com&lt;/ref&gt; these are frames and not monocoques, and the bike industry continues to refer to them as framesets.

== Rockets ==
[[File:SpaceX falcon in warehouse.jpg|thumb|Falcon 1 rocket first-stage]]
Various [[rocket]]s have used pressure-stabilized monocoque designs, such as [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wade | first = Mark | title = Encyclopedia Astronautica – Atlas | url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/atlas.htm | accessdate = 14 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Falcon 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wade | first = Mark | title = Encyclopedia Astronautica – Falcon 1 | url = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/falcon1.htm | accessdate = 14 November 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111111225911/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/falcon1.htm | archivedate = 11 November 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlas was very light since a major portion of its structural support was provided by its single-wall steel [[balloon tank|balloon fuel tanks]], which hold their shape while under acceleration by internal pressure.  Balloon tanks are not true monocoques but act in the same way as [[inflatable|inflatable shells]].  A balloon tank skin only handles tensile forces while compression is resisted by internal liquid pressure in a way similar to semi-monocoques braced by a solid frame.  This becomes obvious when internal pressure is lost and the structure collapses.

'''MultiSeat Desktop Virtualization''' is a method by which a common desktop [[Personal computer|PC]], with extra [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]]s, mice, and video screens directly attached to it, can be used to install, load, and concurrently run multiple operating systems.  These operating systems can be the same across all "seats" or they can be different.  It is similar to server based computing only in the fact that one [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] is supporting multiple users. On the other hand, it is different because the "terminals" (or seats, as they are known in multiseat jargon) are composed of nothing more than the regular keyboard, monitor and mouse, and these devices are plugged directly into the PC. USB hubs can be used for cable management of the keyboards and mice, and extra video cards (typically dual or quad output) may need to be installed.

==Introduction==
It is commonly known that modern day PC's are extremely powerful and have substantial excess CPU processing power. In fact, most desktop applications do not use the multi-core capabilities of today's CPUs. When an application is launched it runs on the first core, and when a second application is launched, it continues to run on the first core. That process continues (with the second and subsequent cores basically idling) until the original core gets very busy. At that point, the operating system tells the new applications to run on the second and subsequent cores.

===Server based computing===

Server based computing has been around for a long time specifically to take advantage of this excess CPU power and allow multiple users to share it. It started in the 50's and 60's with batch processing and has taken its current day form with [[Citrix]] and [[Terminal Services]]. [[nComputing]] and [[Microsoft Multipoint]] are current iterations of the same thin client technology. The typical problem with this type of system is that it is dependent upon one operating system and one set of applications and there are many software titles that are not allowed to be shared among multiple users. That means that the first user of a program will get access but subsequent users will not. Another problem is that the video is not delivered via native means. It is usually delivered via network traffic and must rely upon the "packetizing" methods employed using TCP-IP. This means that video does not run very well, especially if the network traffic is busy.

===Server Virtualization===

[[Virtualization]] can solve some of these problems. Virtualization is a method by which the "guest" operating system runs on top of, while being separated from the "bare metal" hardware. This means that multiple "guest" operating systems can be run, solving the problem of single user applications not being able to be launched for multiple, concurrent users. [[Xen]] used in conjunction with Citrix, or [[VMware]] used in conjunction with Microsoft Terminal Services are examples of this technology. Although it is still server based computing and relies upon a "thin" or a "fat" client to display the video output of the session, it allows multiple users to launch the same application because they are launching totally different instances of the same application, in different "guest" operating systems. But the issue still remains that video does not run very well because it still relies upon the network to delivery video. It is also extremely complicated to install and maintain, require extra training and knowledge.

===Multiseat desktop virtualization differences===

Multiseat desktop virtualization is an entirely new methodology which combines the cost saving benefits and ease of maintenance of server based computing, the time savings of hardware agnostic cloning, and the capabilities of [[desktop virtualization]], with the performance capabilities of real PC functionality. It takes advantage of this fact to enable ordinary users to install a multiseat PC giving 2 "seats" with a dual-core CPU or 4 "seats" with a quad-core CPU. The operating system of this PC is initially installed just like a regular PC. Regular PC users can install and use this type of product without having to install servers, or know how to manage complicated, server based computing or server based virtualization products. It has the combined benefits of a Type 1 hypervisor and a Type 2 hypervisor [[virtual machine]]. It does this with the efficiency of a Type 1 hypervisor while maintaining the portability of a Type II hypervisor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2268">'''Music Medals''' are [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|QCA]]-accredited music assessments and teaching resources offered by the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]] and aimed at younger learners. They are available to all schools and Music Services that register as Music Medals Partners.

There are five progressive levels available - Copper, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. 
 
Music Medals are distinct from [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music#Graded_Exams|Graded Music Exams]] in that there are no external examiners involved and the initial assessment is made by the teacher. All assessments are video recorded and submitted to the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]] for moderation.

==Assessment==

A Music Medals assessment is divided into three sections which are performed consecutively by the candidate. Each component of the assessment focuses on different aspects of the candidate's skills.

===Components===

* '''Ensemble'''. The candidate plays an individual line in an [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] piece for two, three or four players. Ensemble playing provides experience of the skills of leading, interaction, listening and blending with others.
* '''Solo'''. The candidate plays one piece from the [[solo (music)|solo]] repertoire list for his or her instrument and Medal.
* '''Option'''. The candidate selects and undertakes one Option test from a choice of four (Call &amp; Response, Make a Tune, Question &amp; Answer or Sight-Reading). The tests are aimed at helping candidates develop sound musicianship skills.

Candidates are awarded one of three attainment categories - '''Excellent''', '''Pass''' or '''Working Towards''' - depending on the quality of their performances across all three Music Medal components.

==Publications==

The Music Medals scheme is supported by specifically commissioned [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] repertoire and group-teaching publications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38377">{{redirect|Nucleogenesis|the song by Vangelis|Albedo 0.39}}'''Nucleosynthesis''' is the process that creates new [[atomic nuclei]] from pre-existing [[nucleon]]s, primarily protons and neutrons. The first nuclei were formed about three minutes after the [[Big Bang]], through the process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]. Seventeen minutes later the universe had cooled to a point at which these processes ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75% [[hydrogen]], 24% [[helium]], and traces of other elements such as [[lithium]] and the hydrogen [[isotope]] [[deuterium]]. The universe still has approximately the same composition today.

Heavier nuclei were created from these, by several processes. Stars formed, and began to [[stellar fusion|fuse]] light elements to heavier ones in their [[stellar core|cores]], giving off energy in the process, known as [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Fusion processes create many of the lighter elements up to and including [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and these elements are ejected into space (the [[interstellar medium]]) when smaller stars shed their outer envelopes and become smaller stars known as [[white dwarfs]]. The remains of their ejected mass form the [[planetary nebula]]e observable throughout our galaxy.

[[Supernova nucleosynthesis]] within exploding stars by fusing carbon and oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between [[magnesium]] (atomic number 12) and [[nickel]] (atomic number 28).&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |year=2003 |title=Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0-521-82381-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a [[type II supernova]] event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy ([[endothermic process]]) as they are created, from the energy produced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption of multiple neutrons (the [[R process]]) in the period of a few seconds during the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.

[[Neutron star merger]]s and collisions are also responsible for many heavy elements, via the [[r-process]] ("r" stands for "rapid"). Neutron stars are extremely dense remnants of [[supernova]]e, and as their name suggests, they consist of a complex state of matter, predominantly made of tightly packed [[neutron]]s. When two such dense stars collide, a large amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected at extremely high temperatures and under exotic conditions, and heavy elements may form as the ejecta begins to cool. In 2017, the merger of [[GW170817]] led to the detection of substantial signatures of [[gold]], [[platinum]] and other heavy elements over an extended period.

[[Cosmic ray spallation]], caused when [[cosmic rays]] impact the interstellar medium and fragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the lighter nuclei, particularly &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;10,11&lt;/sup&gt;B, that are not created by stellar nucleosynthesis.

In addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of elements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides contribute little to their abundances, but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei. These nuclides are produced via [[radiogenesis]] (decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium. Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on Earth also contribute to the presence of rare, short-lived atomic species called [[cosmogenic nuclide]]s.

==Timeline==
[[File:Nucleosynthesis periodic table.svg|thumb|600px|Periodic table showing the cosmogenic origin of each element. Elements from carbon up to sulfur may be made in small stars by the [[alpha process]]. Elements beyond iron are made in large stars with slow neutron capture ([[s-process]]), followed by expulsion to space in gas ejections (see [[planetary nebulae]]). Elements heavier than iron may be made in neutron star mergers or supernovae after the [[r-process]], involving a dense burst of neutrons and rapid capture by the element.]]

It is thought that the primordial nucleons themselves were formed from the [[quark–gluon plasma]] during the [[Big Bang]] as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes afterward, starting with only [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, nuclei up to [[lithium]] and [[beryllium]] (both with mass number 7) were formed, but the abundances of other elements dropped sharply with growing atomic mass. Some [[boron]] may have been formed at this time, but the process stopped before significant [[carbon]] could be formed, as this element requires a far higher product of helium density and time than were present in the short nucleosynthesis period of the Big Bang. That fusion process essentially shut down at about 20 minutes, due to drops in temperature and density as the universe continued to expand. This first process, [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], was the first type of nucleogenesis to occur in the universe.

The subsequent nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements requires the extreme temperatures and pressures found within [[star]]s and [[supernova]]s. These processes began as hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang collapsed into the first stars at 500 million years. Star formation has occurred continuously in galaxies since that time. Among the elements found naturally on Earth (the so-called [[primordial element]]s), those heavier than boron were created by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and by [[supernova nucleosynthesis]]. They range in [[atomic number]]s from Z=6 ([[carbon]]) to Z=94 ([[plutonium]]). Synthesis of these elements occurred either by [[nuclear fusion]] (including both [[r-process|rapid]] and [[s-process|slow]] multiple neutron capture) or to a lesser degree by [[nuclear fission]] followed by [[beta decay]].

A star gains heavier elements by combining its lighter nuclei, [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]], [[beryllium]], [[lithium]], and [[boron]], which were found in the initial composition of the interstellar medium and hence the star. Interstellar gas therefore contains declining abundances of these light elements, which are present only by virtue of their nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang. Larger quantities of these lighter elements in the present universe are therefore thought to have been restored through billions of years of [[cosmic ray]] (mostly high-energy proton) mediated breakup of heavier elements in interstellar gas and dust. The fragments of these cosmic-ray collisions include the light elements Li, Be and B.

==History of nucleosynthesis theory==
The first ideas on nucleosynthesis were simply that the [[chemical elements]] were created at the beginning of the universe, but no rational physical scenario for this could be identified. Gradually it became clear that hydrogen and helium are much more abundant than any of the other elements. All the rest constitute less than 2% of the mass of the Solar System, and of other star systems as well. At the same time it was clear that oxygen and carbon were the next two most common elements, and also that there was a general trend toward high abundance of the light elements, especially those composed of whole numbers of helium-4 nuclei.

[[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] first suggested in 1920, that stars obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen into helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements may also form in stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eddington |first1=A. S. |date=1920 |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |journal=[[The Observatory (journal)|The Observatory]] |volume=43 |issue= |page=341 |bibcode=1920Obs....43..341E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eddington |first1=A. S. |date=1920 |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=106 |issue=2653 |pages=14–20 |bibcode=1920Natur.106...14E |doi=10.1038/106014a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was not generally accepted, as the nuclear mechanism was not understood. In the years immediately before World War II, [[Hans Bethe]] first elucidated those nuclear mechanisms by which hydrogen is fused into helium.

[[Fred Hoyle]]'s original work on nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in stars, occurred just after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Actually, before the war ended, he learned about the problem of spherical implosion of [[plutonium]] in the [[Manhattan project]]. He saw an analogy between the plutonium fission reaction and the newly discovered supernovae, and he was able to show that exploding super novae produced all of the elements in the same proportion as existed on Earth. He felt that he had accidentally fallen into a subject that would make his career. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1983/fowler-autobio.html Autobiography William A. Fowler]&lt;/ref&gt; His work explained the production of all heavier elements, starting from hydrogen. Hoyle proposed that hydrogen is continuously created in the universe from vacuum and energy, without need for universal beginning.

Hoyle's work explained how the abundances of the elements increased with time as the galaxy aged. Subsequently, Hoyle's picture was expanded during the 1960s by contributions from [[William A. Fowler]], [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]], and [[Donald D. Clayton]], followed by many others. The [[B2FH paper|seminal 1957 review paper]] by [[Margaret Burbidge|E. M. Burbidge]], [[Geoffrey Burbidge|G. R. Burbidge]], Fowler and Hoyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burbidge |first1=E. M. |last2=Burbidge |first2=G. R. |last3=Fowler |first3=W. A. |last4=Hoyle |first4=F. |year=1957 |title=Synthesis of the Elements in Stars |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=547–650 |bibcode=1957RvMP...29..547B |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a well-known summary of the state of the field in 1957. That paper defined new processes for the transformation of one heavy nucleus into others within stars, processes that could be documented by astronomers.

The Big Bang itself had been proposed in 1931, long before this period, by [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian physicist, who suggested that the evident expansion of the Universe in time required that the Universe, if contracted backwards in time, would continue to do so until it could contract no further. This would bring all the mass of the Universe to a single point, a "primeval atom", to a state before which time and space did not exist. Hoyle later gave Lemaître's model the derisive term of Big Bang, not realizing that Lemaître's model was needed to explain the existence of deuterium and nuclides between helium and carbon, as well as the fundamentally high amount of helium present, not only in stars but also in interstellar space. As it happened, both Lemaître and Hoyle's models of nucleosynthesis would be needed to explain the elemental abundances in the universe.

The goal of the theory of nucleosynthesis is to explain the vastly differing abundances of the chemical elements and their several isotopes from the perspective of natural processes. The primary stimulus to the development of this theory was the shape of a plot of the abundances versus the atomic number of the elements. Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number, have a jagged sawtooth structure that varies by factors up to ten million. A very influential stimulus to nucleosynthesis research was an abundance table created by [[Hans Suess]] and [[Harold Urey]] that was based on the unfractionated abundances of the non-volatile elements found within unevolved meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suess |first1=Hans E. |last2=Urey |first2=Harold C. |title=Abundances of the Elements |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |date=1956 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=53–74 |bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a graph of the abundances is displayed on a logarithmic scale below, where the dramatically jagged structure is visually suppressed by the many powers of ten spanned in the vertical scale of this graph. See ''Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos'' for more data and discussion of abundances of the isotopes.&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes/&gt;

[[Image:SolarSystemAbundances.svg|thumb|center|800px|Abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar System. Hydrogen and helium are most common, residuals within the paradigm of the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stiavelli |first1=Massimo |year=2009 |title=From First Light to Reionization the End of the Dark Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCLNBElRTS4C&amp;pg=PA8 |page=8 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location=Weinheim, Germany |isbn=9783527627370}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next three elements (Li, Be, B) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance of elements according to whether they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Within this trend is a peak at abundances of iron and nickel, which is especially visible on a logarithmic graph spanning fewer powers of ten, say between logA=2 (A=100) and logA=6 (A=1,000,000).]]

==Processes==
There are a number of [[astrophysical]] processes which are believed to be responsible for nucleosynthesis. The majority of these occur in within stars, and the chain of those [[nuclear fusion]] processes are known as hydrogen burning (via the [[proton-proton chain]] or the [[CNO cycle]]), [[Helium fusion|helium burning]], [[Carbon burning process|carbon burning]], [[Neon burning process|neon burning]], [[Oxygen burning process|oxygen burning]] and [[silicon burning process|silicon burning]]. These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and nickel. This is the region of nucleosynthesis within which the isotopes with the highest [[binding energy]] per nucleon are created. Heavier elements can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the [[s-process]] or in explosive environments, such as [[supernova]]e and [[neutron star merger]]s, by a number of other processes. Some of those others include the [[r-process]], which involves rapid neutron captures, the [[rp-process]], and the [[p-process]] (sometimes known as the gamma process), which results in the [[photodisintegration]] of existing nuclei.

==The major types of nucleosynthesis==

===Big Bang nucleosynthesis===
{{main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Big Bang nucleosynthesis&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pdg.lbl.gov/2017/mobile/reviews/pdf/rpp2016-rev-bbang-nucleosynthesis-m.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; occurred within the first three minutes of the beginning of the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[hydrogen-1|protium]]), &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H (D, [[deuterium]]), &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He ([[helium-3]]), and &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He ([[helium-4]]). Although &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and [[alpha decay]]s and trace amounts of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H continue to be produced by [[spallation]] and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the [[Big Bang]]. The nuclei of these elements, along with some &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial [[quark–gluon plasma]] froze out to form [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than [[beryllium]] (or possibly [[boron]]) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Stellar nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Stellar nucleosynthesis|Proton-proton chain|Triple-alpha process|CNO cycle|s-process|p-process|photodisintegration}}

Stellar nucleosynthesis is the nuclear process by which new nuclei are produced. It occurs in stars during [[stellar evolution]]. It is responsible for the galactic abundances of elements from [[carbon]] to [[iron]]. Stars are thermonuclear furnaces in which H and He are fused into heavier nuclei by increasingly high temperatures as the composition of the core evolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |year=1983 |title=Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis |at=Chapter 5 |edition=Reprint |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago, USA |isbn=978-0-226-10952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance is carbon because its formation from He is a bottleneck in the entire process. Carbon is produced by the [[triple-alpha process]] in all stars. Carbon is also the main element that causes the release of free neutrons within stars, giving rise to the [[s-process]], in which the slow absorption of neutrons converts iron into elements heavier than iron and nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D.

The products of stellar nucleosynthesis are generally dispersed into the interstellar gas through mass loss episodes and the stellar winds of low mass stars. The mass loss events can be witnessed today in the [[planetary nebula]]e phase of low-mass star evolution, and the explosive ending of stars, called [[supernova]]e, of those with more than eight times the mass of the Sun.

The first direct proof that nucleosynthesis occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it late in the galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of [[technetium]] in the atmosphere of a [[red giant]] star in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merrill |first1=S. P. W. |date=1952 |title=Spectroscopic Observations of Stars of Class |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=116 |issue= |pages=21 |bibcode=1952ApJ...116...21M |doi=10.1086/145589}}&lt;/ref&gt; by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars. Because [[technetium]] is radioactive, with a half-life much less than the age of the star, its abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements is the large overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20-50 times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of the [[s-process]] within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar nucleosynthesis are provided by the [[isotopes|isotopic]] compositions of [[Cosmic dust#Stardust|stardust]], solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of [[cosmic dust]] and is frequently called [[presolar grains]]. The measured isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the star's late-life mass-loss episodes.&lt;ref name=Clayton2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D.

===Explosive nucleosynthesis===

{{Main|r-process|rp-process|Supernova nucleosynthesis}}

[[Supernova nucleosynthesis]] occurs in the energetic environment in supernovae, in which the elements between silicon and nickel are synthesized in quasiequilibrium&lt;ref name=Bodansky1968&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bodansky |first1=D. |last2=Clayton |first2=D. D. |last3=Fowler |first3=W. A. |date=1968 |title=Nuclear Quasi-Equilibrium during Silicon Burning |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=16 |issue= |pages=299 |bibcode=1968ApJS...16..299B |doi=10.1086/190176}}&lt;/ref&gt; established during fast fusion that attaches by reciprocating balanced nuclear reactions to &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si. Quasiequilibrium can be thought of as ''almost equilibrium'' except for a high abundance of the &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;Si nuclei in the feverishly burning mix. This concept&lt;ref name=ClaytonIsotopes7/&gt; was the most important discovery in nucleosynthesis theory of the intermediate-mass elements since Hoyle's 1954 paper because it provided an overarching understanding of the abundant and chemically important elements between silicon (A=28) and nickel (A=60). It replaced the incorrect although much cited [[alpha process]] of the [[B2FH paper|B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper]], which inadvertently obscured Hoyle's 1954 theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |title=Hoyle's Equation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=2007 |volume=318 |issue=5858 |pages=1876–1877 |bibcode=|doi=10.1126/science.1151167|pmid=18096793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further nucleosynthesis processes can occur, in particular the [[r-process]] (rapid process) described by the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH paper and first calculated by Seeger, Fowler and Clayton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seeger |first1=P. A. |last2=Fowler |first2=W. A. |last3=Clayton |first3=D. D. |date=1965 |title=Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]] |volume=11 |issue= |pages=121 |bibcode=1965ApJS...11..121S |doi=10.1086/190111}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced by rapid absorption of free [[neutron]]s. The creation of free neutrons by [[electron capture]] during the rapid compression of the supernova core along with the assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the r-process a ''primary process'', and one that can occur even in a star of pure H and He. This is in contrast to the B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FH designation of the process as a ''secondary process''. This promising scenario, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a satisfactory calculation of r-process abundances. The primary r-process has been confirmed by astronomers who had observed old stars born when galactic [[metallicity]] was still small, that nonetheless contain their complement of r-process nuclei; thereby demonstrating that the metallicity is a product of an internal process. The r-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.

The [[rp-process]] (rapid proton) involves the rapid absorption of free [[proton]]s as well as neutrons, but its role and its existence are less certain.

Explosive nucleosynthesis occurs too rapidly for radioactive decay to decrease the number of neutrons, so that many abundant isotopes with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are synthesized by the silicon quasi-equilibrium process.&lt;ref name=Bodansky1968/&gt; During this process, the burning of oxygen and silicon fuses nuclei that themselves have equal numbers of protons and neutrons to produce nuclides which consist of whole numbers of helium nuclei, up to 15 (representing &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Ni). Such multiple-alpha-particle nuclides are totally stable up to &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca (made of 10 helium nuclei), but heavier nuclei with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are tightly bound but unstable. The quasi-equilibrium produces radioactive [[isobar (nuclide)|isobars]] &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, and &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, which (except &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti) are created in abundance but decay after the explosion and leave the most stable isotope of the corresponding element at the same atomic weight. The most abundant and extant isotopes of elements produced in this way are &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ti, &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, and &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe. These decays are accompanied by the emission of gamma-rays (radiation from the nucleus), whose [[spectroscopic lines]] can be used to identify the isotope created by the decay. The detection of these emission lines were an important early product of gamma-ray astronomy.&lt;ref name=Clayton1969&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clayton |first1=D. D. |last2=Colgate |first2=S. A. |last3=Fishman |first3=G. J. |date=1969 |title=Gamma-Ray Lines from Young Supernova Remnants |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=155 |issue= |pages=75 |bibcode=1969ApJ...155...75C |doi=10.1086/149849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most convincing proof of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae occurred in 1987 when those gamma-ray lines were detected emerging from supernova 1987A. Gamma-ray lines identifying &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co and &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Co nuclei, whose radioactive half-lives limit their age to about a year, proved that their radioactive cobalt parents created them. This nuclear astronomy observation was predicted in 1969&lt;ref name=Clayton1969/&gt; as a way to confirm explosive nucleosynthesis of the elements, and that prediction played an important role in the planning for NASA's [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory|Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]].

Other proofs of explosive nucleosynthesis are found within the stardust grains that condensed within the interiors of supernovae as they expanded and cooled. Stardust grains are one component of [[cosmic dust]]. In particular, radioactive &lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ti was measured to be very abundant within supernova stardust grains at the time they condensed during the supernova expansion.&lt;ref name=Clayton2004/&gt; This confirmed a 1975 prediction of the identification of supernova stardust (SUNOCONs), which became part of the pantheon of [[presolar grains]]. Other unusual isotopic ratios within these grains reveal many specific aspects of explosive nucleosynthesis.

===Neutron star collision===
[[Neutron star collision]]s are believed to be the main source of r-process elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stromberg |first=Joseph |date=16 July 2013 |title=All the Gold in the Universe Could Come from the Collisions of Neutron Stars |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/all-the-gold-in-the-universe-could-come-from-the-collisions-of-neutron-stars-13474145/?page=1 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine) |Smithsonian]] |accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being neutron-rich by definition, this has been suspected of being a source of such elements, but definitive evidence was difficult to obtain. In 2017 strong evidence emerged, when [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] and [[INTEGRAL]], along with a collaboration of many observatories around the world, detected both [[gravitational wave]] and electromagnetic signatures of a likely neutron star collision, [[GW170817]], and subsequently detected signals of numerous heavy elements such as gold as the ejected material began to cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chu |first=J. |date=n.d. |url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/press-release-gw170817 |title=GW170817 Press Release |publisher=[[LIGO]]/[[Caltech]] |accessdate=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic ray spallation===
{{main|Cosmic ray spallation}}
Cosmic ray spallation process reduces the atomic weight of interstellar matter by the impact with cosmic rays, to produce some of the lightest elements present in the universe (though not a significant amount of [[deuterium]]). Most notably spallation is believed to be responsible for the generation of almost all of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He and the elements [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], and [[boron]], although some {{SimpleNuclide|Lithium|7}} and {{SimpleNuclide|Beryllium|7}} are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The spallation process results from the impact of [[cosmic rays]] (mostly fast protons) against the [[interstellar medium]]. These impacts fragment carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei present. The process results in the light elements beryllium, boron, and lithium in the cosmos at much greater abundances than they are found within solar atmospheres. The quantities of the light elements &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He produced by spallation are negligible relative to their primordial abundance.

Beryllium and boron are not significantly produced by stellar fusion processes, since &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be is not particle-bound.

==Empirical evidence==

Theories of nucleosynthesis are tested by calculating [[isotope]] abundances and comparing those results with observed abundances. Isotope abundances are typically calculated from the transition rates between isotopes in a network. Often these calculations can be simplified as a few key reactions control the rate of other reactions.

==Minor mechanisms and processes==

Tiny amounts of certain nuclides are produced on Earth by artificial means. Those are our primary source, for example, of [[technetium]]. However, some nuclides are also produced by a number of natural means that have continued after primordial elements were in place. These often act to create new elements in ways that can be used to date rocks or to trace the source of geological processes. Although these processes do not produce the nuclides in abundance, they are assumed to be the entire source of the existing natural supply of those nuclides.

These mechanisms include:
* [[Radioactive decay]] may lead to [[radiogenic]] [[daughter nuclide]]s. The nuclear decay of many long-lived primordial isotopes, especially [[uranium-235]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]] produce many intermediate daughter nuclides before they too finally decay to isotopes of lead. The Earth's natural supply of elements like [[radon]] and [[polonium]] is via this mechanism. The atmosphere's supply of [[argon-40]] is due mostly to the radioactive decay of [[potassium-40]] in the time since the formation of the Earth. Little of the atmospheric argon is primordial. [[Helium-4]] is produced by alpha-decay, and the helium trapped in Earth's crust is also mostly non-primordial. In other types of radioactive decay, such as [[cluster decay]], larger species of nuclei are ejected (for example, neon-20), and these eventually become newly formed stable atoms.
* [[Radioactive decay]] may lead to [[spontaneous fission]]. This is not cluster decay, as the fission products may be split among nearly any type of atom. Thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 are primordial isotopes that undergo spontaneous fission. Natural technetium and [[promethium]] are produced in this manner.
* [[Nuclear reactions]]. Naturally-occurring nuclear reactions powered by [[radioactive decay]] give rise to so-called [[nucleogenic]] nuclides. This process happens when an energetic particle from radioactive decay, often an alpha particle, reacts with a nucleus of another atom to change the nucleus into another nuclide. This process may also cause the production of further subatomic particles, such as neutrons. Neutrons can also be produced in spontaneous fission and by [[neutron emission]]. These neutrons can then go on to produce other nuclides via neutron-induced fission, or by [[neutron capture]]. For example, some stable isotopes such as neon-21 and neon-22 are produced by several routes of nucleogenic synthesis, and thus only part of their abundance is primordial.
* Nuclear reactions due to cosmic rays. By convention, these reaction-products are not termed "nucleogenic" nuclides, but rather [[cosmogenic]] nuclides. Cosmic rays continue to produce new elements on Earth by the same cosmogenic processes discussed above that produce primordial beryllium and boron. One important example is [[carbon-14]], produced from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. [[Iodine-129]] is another example.

'''Oral tradition''', or '''oral lore''', is a form of human [[communication]] wherein knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from one generation to another.&lt;ref name = "Vansina"&gt;[[Jan Vansina|Vansina, Jan]]: ''Oral Tradition as History'' (1985), reported statements from present generation which "specifies that the message must be oral statements spoken, sung or called out on musical instruments only"; "There must be transmission by word of mouth over at least a generation". He points out, "Our definition is a working definition for the use of historians. Sociologists, linguists or scholars of the verbal arts propose their own, which in, e.g., sociology, stresses common knowledge. In linguistics, features that distinguish the language from common dialogue (linguists), and in the verbal arts features of form and content that define art (folklorists)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannicaot/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ki-Zerbo"&gt;Ki-Zerbo, Joseph: "Methodology and African Prehistory", 1990, ''UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa''; James Currey Publishers, {{ISBN|0-85255-091-X}}, 9780852550915; see Ch. 7; "Oral tradition and its methodology" at pages 54-61; at page 54: "Oral tradition may be defined as being a testimony transmitted verbally from one generation to another.  Its special characteristics are that it is verbal and the manner in which it is transmitted."&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission is through speech or song and may include folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit [[oral history]], [[oral literature]], [[oral law]] and other knowledge across generations without a [[writing system]], or in parallel to a writing system. Religions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], for example, have used an oral tradition, in parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical scriptures, secular knowledge such as [[Sushruta Samhita]], hymns and mythologies from one generation to the next.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0-521-33794-6 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;&lt;ref name=lopez1995p21&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S.

==History==
According to John Foley, oral tradition has been an ancient human tradition found in "all corners of the world".&lt;ref name="MacKay1999p1"/&gt; Modern archaeology has been unveiling evidence of the human efforts to preserve and transmit arts and knowledge that depended completely or partially on an oral tradition, across various cultures:

{{Quote|
The Judeo-Christian Bible reveals its oral traditional roots; medieval European manuscripts are penned by performing scribes; geometric vases from archaic Greece mirror Homer's oral style. (...) Indeed, if these final decades of the millennium have taught us anything, it must be that oral tradition never was the other we accused it of being; it never was the primitive, preliminary technology of communication we thought it to be. Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality.

In Asia, the transmission of folklore, mythologies as well as scriptures in ancient India, in different Indian religions, was by oral tradition, preserved with precision with the help of elaborate [[Vedic chant|mnemonic techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donald S.

==Transmission==
[[File:Helsinki-Folk-singer-statue-1750.JPG|thumb|The legendary Finnish storyteller [[Väinämöinen]] with his [[kantele]]]]
Oral traditions face the challenge of accurate transmission and verifiability of the accurate version, particularly when the culture lacks written language or has limited access to writing tools. Oral cultures have employed various strategies that achieve this without writing. For example, a heavily rhythmic speech filled with [[mnemonic device]]s enhances memory and recall. A few useful mnemonic devices include [[alliteration]], repetition, [[assonance]], and proverbial sayings. In addition, the verse is often metrically composed with an exact number of syllables or [[morae]] - such as with Greek and Latin prosody and in [[Sanskrit prosody|Chandas]] found in Hindu and Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan2013p228"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Scharf|editor=Keith Allan|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-164344-6|pages=228–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses of the epic or text are typically designed wherein the long and short syllables are repeated by certain rules, so that if an error or inadvertent change is made, an internal examination of the verse reveals the problem.&lt;ref name="TElizarenkova1995p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tatyana J.

| The law itself in oral cultures is enshrined in formulaic sayings, proverbs, which are not mere jurisprudential decorations, but themselves constitute the law. A judge in an oral culture is often called on to articulate sets of relevant proverbs out of which he can produce equitable decisions in the cases under formal litigation before him.&lt;ref name="Longman Publishers USA"/&gt;
|}

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[The Jungle Book]] provides an excellent demonstration of oral governance in the [[Law of the Jungle]]. Not only does grounding rules in oral proverbs allow for simple transmission and understanding, but it also legitimizes new rulings by allowing extrapolation. These stories, traditions, and proverbs are not static, but are often altered upon each transmission barring the overall meaning remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Erin|title=Oral Traditions|url=http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|website=Indigenous Foundations|accessdate=5 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082618/http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/culture/oral-traditions.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the rules that govern the people are modified by the whole and not authored by a single entity.

===Indian religions===
Ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] were preserved and transmitted by an oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[śruti]]s of Hinduism called the [[Veda]]s, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE. [[Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:&lt;ref name=witzel68/&gt;

{{quote|The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.|Michael Witzel&lt;ref name=witzel68&gt;M Witzel, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1-4051-3251-5}}, pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of their knowledge, in schools called [[Guru]]kul, while maintaining exceptional accuracy of their knowledge across the generations.&lt;ref name=scharfe28&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of recitation or ''paths'' were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the ''[[Veda]]s'' and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the [[Principal Upanishads]], as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;
* ''Samhita-patha'': continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* ''Pada-patha'': a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* ''Krama-patha'': a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn "word1 word2 word3 word4...", would be recited as "word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...."; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakarya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* ''Krama-patha'' modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* ''{{IAST|Jata-pāṭha}}'', ''{{IAST|dhvaja-pāṭha}}'' and ''{{IAST|ghana-pāṭha}}'' are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound.&lt;ref name=scharfe28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Annette and Moebus, Oliver.

===Chronology===
[[File:Filip Visnjic guslar.jpg|thumb|right|[[Filip Višnjić]] (1767&amp;ndash;1834), [[Serbia]]n blind [[gusle|guslar]]]]
The following overview draws upon ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985, 1986, 1989); additional material is summarized from the overlapping prefaces to the following volumes: ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology'', (Indiana University Press, 1988, 1992); ''Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1995) and ''Comparative Research on Oral Traditions: A Memorial for Milman Parry'' (Columbus, Ohio: Slavica Publishers, 1987). in the work of the Serb scholar [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864), a contemporary and friend of the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Vuk pursued similar projects of "salvage folklore" (similar to [[rescue archaeology]]) in the [[cognate]] traditions of the Southern [[Slavs|Slavic]] regions which would later be gathered into [[Yugoslavia]], and with the same admixture of [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[nationalistic]] interests (he considered all those speaking the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] as Serbs). Somewhat later, but as part of the same scholarly enterprise of nationalist studies in folklore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf "Early Scholarship on Oral Traditions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529035828/http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/5i/5_radloff.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}: Radloff, Jousse and Murko ''Oral Tradition'' 5:1 (1990) 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; the [[turcology|turcologist]] [[Vasily Radlov]] (1837–1918) would study the songs of the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast|Kara-Kirghiz]] in what would later become the Soviet Union; Karadzic and Radloff would provide models for the work of Parry.

===Walter Ong===
In a separate development, the [[media theory|media theorist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1911–1980) would begin to focus attention on the ways that [[communication|communicative]] [[Mass media|media]] shape the nature of the content conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Marshall McLuhan, ''The Gutenberg Galaxy:  The Making of Typographic Man''.  University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve as mentor to the [[Jesuit]], [[Walter Ong]] (1912–2003), whose interests in [[cultural history]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]] would result in ''Orality and Literacy'' (Methuen, 1980) and the important but less-known ''Fighting for Life: Contest, Sexuality and Consciousness'' (Cornell, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Fighting for Life:  Context, Sexuality, and Consciousness''.  Cornell University Press, Ithaca &amp; London, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; These two works articulated the contrasts between cultures defined by [[Orality#Primary orality|primary orality]], writing, print, and the [[secondary orality]] of the electronic age.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 57 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

| I style the morality of a culture totally untouched by any knowledge of writing or print, 'primary orality'.  It is 'primary' by contrast with the 'secondary orality' of present-day high technology culture, in which a new orality is sustained by telephone, radio, television and other electronic devices that depend for their existence and functioning on writing and print.  Today primary culture in the strict sense hardly exists, since every culture knows of writing and has some experience of its effects.  Still, to varying degrees many cultures and sub-cultures, even in a high-technology ambiance, preserve much of the mind-set of primary orality.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and Literacy'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Ong's works also made possible an integrated theory of oral tradition which accounted for both production of content (the chief concern of Parry-Lord theory) and its reception.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; This approach, like McLuhan's, kept the field open not just to the study of aesthetic culture but to the way physical and behavioral artifacts of oral societies are used to store, manage and transmit knowledge, so that oral tradition provides methods for investigation of cultural differences, other than the purely verbal, between oral and literate societies.

The most-often studied section of ''Orality and Literacy'' concerns the "[[psychodynamics]] of orality" This chapter seeks to define the fundamental characteristics of 'primary' orality and summarizes a series of descriptors (including but not limited to verbal aspects of culture) which might be used to index the relative orality or literacy of a given text or society.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Ong.  ''Orality and literacy:  the technologizing of the word'', pp. 31-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Miles Foley===
In advance of Ong's synthesis, [[John Miles Foley]] began a series of papers based on his own fieldwork on South Slavic oral genres, emphasizing the dynamics of performers and audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Foley effectively consolidated oral tradition as an academic field [http://illumination.missouri.edu/spr05/fol1.htm] when he compiled ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research'' in 1985. The bibliography gives a summary of the progress scholars made in evaluating the oral tradition up to that point, and includes a list of all relevant scholarly articles relating to the theory of [[Oral-Formulaic Composition]]. He also both established both the journal ''Oral Tradition'' and founded the ''Center for Studies in Oral Tradition'' (1986) at the [[University of Missouri]]. Foley developed Oral Theory beyond the somewhat mechanistic notions presented in earlier versions of Oral-Formulaic Theory, by extending Ong's interest in cultural features of oral societies beyond the verbal, by drawing attention to the agency of the [[bard]] and by describing how oral traditions bear meaning.

The bibliography  would establish a clear underlying methodology which accounted for the findings of scholars working in the separate [[Linguistics]] fields (primarily [[Ancient Greek]], Anglo-Saxon and Serbo-Croatian).  Perhaps more importantly, it would stimulate conversation among these specialties, so that a network of independent but allied investigations and investigators could be established.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foley's key works include ''The Theory of Oral Composition'' (1988);&lt;ref&gt;John Miles Foley.  ''The Theory of Oral Composition:  History and Methodology''.  Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Immanent Art'' (1991); ''Traditional Oral Epic: The Odyssey, Beowulf and the Serbo-Croatian Return-Song'' (1993); ''The Singer of Tales in Performance'' (1995); ''Teaching Oral Traditions'' (1998); ''How to Read an Oral Poem'' (2002). His [http://www.pathwaysproject.org/pathways/show/HomePage Pathways Project] (2005-2012) draws parallels between the media dynamics of oral traditions and the [[Internet]].

===Acceptance and further elaboration===
The theory of oral tradition would undergo elaboration and development as it grew in acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "Oral Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography." NY: Garland, 1985. ''The Theory of Oral Composition''. Bloomington: IUP, 1991, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; While the number of formulas documented for various traditions proliferated,&lt;ref&gt;A. Orchard, 'Oral Tradition', ''Reading Old English Texts'', ed. K O'Brien O'Keeffe (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 101-23&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of the formula remained lexically-bound. However, numerous innovations appeared, such as the "formulaic system"&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "Old English Formulas and Systems" ''English Studies'' 48 (1967):193-204. responds to what was known, pejoratively, in Greek studies as the "hard Parryist" position, in which the formula was defined in terms of verbatim lexical repetition (see Rosenmyer, Thomas G. "The Formula in Early Greek Poetry" ''Arion'' 4 (1965):295-311). Fry's model proposes underlying generative templates which provide for variation and even artistic creativity within the constraints of strict metrical requirements and extempore composition-in-performance&lt;/ref&gt; with structural "substitution slots" for [[syntax|syntactic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[narrative]] necessity (as well as for artistic invention).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Adam Brooke "Verba volent, scripta manent: Oral Tradition and the Non-Narrative Genres of Old English Poetry."  Diss. Univ. of Missouri at Columbia.  DAI 52A (1991), 2137  pp. 202, 205&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated models such as Foley's "word-type placement rules" followed.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. Immanent Art: From Structure to Meaning in Traditional Oral Epic. Bloomington: IUP, 1991. 30, 31, 202n22, 207 n36, 211n43&lt;/ref&gt; Higher levels of formulaic composition were defined over the years, such as "[[ring composition]]",&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. "The Singer of Tales in Performance. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 55, 60, 89 108, 122n40&lt;/ref&gt; "responsion"&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Alexandra Hennessey. "Oral -Formulaic Research in Old English Studies:II" ''Oral Tradition'' 3:1-2 (1988) 138-90, p. 165) Olsen cites Foley's "Hybrid Prosody and Old English Half-Lines" in ''Neophilologus'' 64:284-89 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and the "[[type-scene]]" (also called a "theme" or "typical scene"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Singer of Tales in Performance''. Bloomington: IUP, 1995. 2, 7, 8n15, 17 et passim.&lt;/ref&gt;). Examples include the "Beasts of Battle"&lt;ref&gt;Magoun, Francis P.  "The Oral-Formulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poetry."  ''Speculum'' 28 (1953):  446-67&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Cliffs of Death".&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Donald K. "The Cliff of Death in Old English Poetry." In ''Comparative Research in Oral Traditions:  A Memorial for Milman Parry'', ed. John Miles Foley.  Columbus:  Slavica, 1987, 213-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these characteristic patterns of narrative details, (like "the arming sequence;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Zumthor|Zumthor, Paul]] "The Text and the Voice." Transl. Marilyn C. Englehardt. ''New Literary History'' 16 (1984):67-92&lt;/ref&gt; "the hero on the beach";&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Crowne, "The Hero on the Beach: An Example of Composition by Theme in Anglo-Saxon Poetry", ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 61 (1960), 371.&lt;/ref&gt; "the traveler recognizes his goal")&lt;ref&gt;Clark, George. "The Traveller Recognizes His Goal." ''Journal of English and Germanic Philolog''y, 64 (1965):645-59.&lt;/ref&gt; would show evidence of global distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, James I.  "The Arming Motif in the Iliad".  ''The American Journal of Philology'', Vol. 79, No. 4. (1958), pp. 337-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the fairly rigid division between oral and literate was replaced by recognition of transitional and compartmentalized texts and societies, including models of [[diglossia]] ([[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]].

A study of the AG oral mentality that assumes (1) the existence of composition and thinking that took shape under the aegis of oral patterns, (2) the educational apparatus as an oral system, and (3) the origins of philosophy as we know it in the abstract intellectual reaction against the oral mentality. The opening section on historical background covers developments in archaeology and textual criticism (including Parry's work) since the late nineteenth century, with descriptions of and comments on formulaic and thematic structure. In "The Technique of the Oral Poet" (14-22), he sketches both a synchronic picture of the singer weaving his narrative and a diachronic view of the tradition developing over time. In the third part, on the psychology of performance, he discusses "the prevalence of rhythmic speech over prose; the prevalence of the event' over the abstraction'; and the prevalence of the paratactic arrangement of parts... over alternative schema possible in other styles" (23). In sympathy with Havelock (1963), he interprets Plato's reaction against the poets as one against the oral mentality and its educative process.&lt;/ref&gt; [[communication theory]],&lt;ref&gt;"Review: Communication Studies as American Studies" Daniel Czitrom  ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 42, No. 4 (Dec., 1990), pp. 678-683&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semiotics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nimis, Stephen A.

Within this framework, this paper examines the legacies of imperialism and colonization within the Nigerian educational system––particularly in reference to the teaching of folklore and oral tradition––including the destruction of indigenous knowledge systems and the continuing lack of adequate resources in African universities. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for a more fully synthesized indigenous and formal Nigerian educational system as a method of addressing postcolonial rupture.

==Criticism and debates==
The theory of oral tradition encountered early resistance from scholars who perceived it as potentially supporting either one side or another in the controversy between what were known as [[Homeric question|"unitarians" and "analysts"]]&amp;nbsp;– that is, scholars who believed [[Homer]] to have been a single, historical figure, and those who saw him as a conceptual "author function," a convenient name to assign to what was essentially a repertoire of traditional narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick M. Combellack]],  "Milman Parry and Homeric Artistry" ''Comparative Literature'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer, 1959), pp. 193-208 . p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; A much more general dismissal of the theory and its implications simply described it as "unprovable"&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R.B. Homer: Odyssey Books XIX &amp; XX,, Cambridge UP 1992 remarks on oral-formulaic diction, pp. 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, mainly outside the field of oral tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Botstein, Leon. "Hearing Is Seeing: Thoughts on the History of Music and the Imagination." ''The Musical Quarterly'' 1995 79(4):581-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_folklore_research/v043/43.3oring.html Elliot Oring cites Bruchac, Joe Storytelling: Oral History or Game of 'Telephone'?"] ''American Folklore Society Newsletter'' 19/2:3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |title=Christopher Butler cites Bart Ehrman, ‘Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why’ |publisher=Christopherbutler.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105051417/http://christopherbutler.wordpress.com/2006/04/28/scriptural-transmission-inspiration-and-inerrancy/ |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |title=chapter4.DOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213082630/http://www.valdosta.edu/folkwriting/pdf/chapter4.PDF |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represent (either dismissively or with approval) this body of theoretical work as reducing the great [[Epic poetry|epics]] to children's party games like "[[telephone (game)|telephone]]" or "[[Chinese whispers]]".  While games provide amusement by showing how messages distort content via uncontextualized transmission, Parry's supporters argue that the theory of oral tradition reveals how oral methods optimized the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and thus improved the quality, stability and [[integrity]] of content transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The God Delusion''. Great Britain: Bantam, 2006 p. 118 -- Dawkins contradicts this view, however, on p. 227)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were disputes concerning particular findings of the theory. For example, those trying to support or refute Crowne's hypothesis found the "Hero on the Beach" formula in numerous Old English poems. Similarly, it was also discovered in other works of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin, [[Middle English poetry]], and even an [[Iceland]]ic prose [[saga]]. J.A. Dane, in an article&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J.A. "Finnsburh and Iliad IX: A Greek Survival of the Medieval Germanic Oral-Formulaic Theme  The Hero on the Beach." ''Neophilologus'' 66:443-449&lt;/ref&gt; characterized as "polemics without rigor"&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography'', (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the appearance of the theme in [[Ancient Greek]] poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of "an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet."

Within Homeric studies specifically, Lord's ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'', which focused on problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'', and even ''[[Beowulf]]'', influenced nearly all of the articles written on [[Homer]] and oral-formulaic composition thereafter. However, in response to Lord, Geoffrey Kirk published ''The Songs of Homer'', questioning Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian and Croatian literature (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. Kirk argues that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their "metrical strictness", "formular system[s]", and creativity. In other words, Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to get to the same end than the Serbo-Croatian poet, who was merely "reproductive".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Geoffrey S. ''The Songs of Homer.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. pp88 - 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Eric Havelock's ''Preface to Plato'' revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition, but also that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Parry]], in his 1966 work "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?", theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually create nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story. In fact, he discounted the Serbo-Croatian tradition to an "unfortunate" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 36, 505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Adam. "Have we Homer's ''Iliad''?"''Yale Classical Studies.''20 (1966), pp.. 177-216.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord reacted to Kirk's and Parry's essays with "Homer as Oral Poet", published in 1968, which reaffirmed Lord's belief in the relevance of Yugoslav poetry and its similarities to Homer and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography.'' New York: Garland Publishing, Inc, 1985. pp. 40, 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the criticisms of the theory have been absorbed into the evolving field as useful refinements and modifications. For example, in what Foley called a "pivotal" contribution, [[Larry Benson]] introduced the concept of "written-formulaic" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John M. ''Oral-Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography''. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc. 1985. p. 42.; Foley cites "The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry" Publications of the Modern Language Association 81 (1966):, 334-41&lt;/ref&gt; A number of individual scholars in many areas continue to have misgivings about the applicability of the theory or the aptness of the South Slavic comparison,&lt;ref&gt;George E. Dimock. "From Homer to Novi Pazar and B ack." ''Arion'', 2, iv:40-57. Reacts against the Parry-Lord hypothesis of an oral Homer, claiming that, although Lord demonstrated that the oral poet thinks in verse and offered many explanations of the various facets of the Homeric Question by recourse to the Yugoslav analogy, the difference between Homer and other, literate poets is one of degree rather than kind. Wants to rescue Homer's art from what he sees as the dangers inherent in the oral theory model.&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly what they regard as its implications for the creativity which may legitimately be attributed to the individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the most prominent and steadfast opponent of oral traditional theory on these grounds was [[Arthur Brodeur]], in, e.g., ''The Art of Beowulf''. Berkeley: University of California Press. 3rd printing 1969; "A Study of Diction and Style in Three Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poems." In ''Nordica et Anglica''. Ed. Allan H. Orrick. The Hague: Mouton. pp. 97-114; "Beowulf: One Poem or Three?" In ''Medieval Literature and Folklore Studies in Honor of Francis Lee Utley''. Ed. Jerome Mandel and Bruce A. Rosenberg. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press. pp. 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at present, there seems to be little systematic or theoretically coordinated challenge to the fundamental tenets of the theory; as Foley put it, ""there have been numerous suggestions for revisions or modifications of the theory, but the majority of controversies have generated further understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, John Miles. ''The Theory of Oral Composition: History and Methodology''. Bloomington:IUP, 1988." p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10692">'''Persistent current''' is a perpetual [[electric current]], not requiring an external power source.

== In magnetized objects ==

In electromagnetism, all magnetizations can be seen as microscopic persistent currents.
By definition a [[magnetization]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by its corresponding microscopic form, which is an electric current density:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J_m} = \nabla\times\mathbf{M} &lt;/math&gt;
This current is a bound current, not having any charge accumulation associated with it since it is [[divergenceless]].
What this means is that any permanently magnetized object, for example a piece of [[lodestone]], can be considered to have persistent electric currents running throughout it (the persistent currents are generally concentrated near the surface).

The converse is also true: any persistent electric current is divergence-free, and can therefore be represented instead by a magnetization.
Therefore, in the macroscopic [[Maxwell's equations]], it is purely a choice of mathematical convenience, whether to represent persistent currents as magnetization or vice versa.
In the microscopic formulation of Maxwell's equations, however, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; does not appear and so any magnetizations must be instead represented by bound currents.

== In superconductors ==

{{expand section|date=October 2013}}

In [[superconductor]]s, charge can flow without any resistance. It is possible to make pieces of superconductor with a large built-in persistent current, either by creating the superconducting state (cooling the material) while charge is flowing through it, or by changing the magnetic field around the superconductor after creating the superconducting state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond.|year = 2013|title = Induced Currents in Closed-Ended Type-II Superconducting Coils|first1 = F. |last1 = Yen|first2 = X. |last2 = Chen|first3 = R. B.|last3 = Wang|first4 = J.

The persistent current was first identified by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|Onnes]], and attempts to set a lower bound on their duration have reached values of over 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.10.93 File J, Mills, R ''Physical Review Letters'' 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In resistive conductors ==

[[Image:Persistent Current Ring.png|250px|thumb|right|Persistent current schematic. The green arrow indicates the direction of static applied [[magnetic field]] B which allows a net current I (blue arrow) to flow and create a [[magnetization]] M (black arrow) by breaking the [[symmetry]] between [[clockwise]] and counterclockwise currents. The yellow dot represents an [[electron]] traversing the disordered material of the ring (green stars) without [[dissipation]]. A typical ring current is 1 [[nanoampere]] for a ring diameter of 0.6 [[micrometre|micrometer]] at a [[temperature]] below 0.5 [[kelvin]].&lt;ref name=shanks/&gt;]]

Surprisingly, it is also possible to have tiny persistent currents inside resistive metals that are placed in a magnetic field, even in metals that are nominally "non-magnetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rdmag.com/News/2009/10/General-Sciences-Measuring-Elusive-Persistent-Current-That-Flows-Forever|title=Measuring elusive "persistent current" that flows forever|date=October 12, 2009|publisher=R&amp;D Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current is the result of a [[quantum mechanical]] effect that influences how [[electrons]] travel through metals, and arises from the same kind of motion that allows the electrons inside an [[atom]] to orbit the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] forever.

This type of persistent current is a [[mesoscopic physics|mesoscopic]] low temperature effect: the magnitude of the current becomes appreciable when the size of the metallic system is reduced to the scale of the electron quantum phase [[coherence length]] and the thermal length. Persistent currents decrease with increasing temperature and will vanish exponentially above a temperature known as the Thouless temperature. This temperature scales as the inverse of the circuit diameter squared.&lt;ref name="shanks" /&gt; Consequently, it has been suggested that persistent currents could flow up to room temperature and above in nanometric metal structures such as metal (Au, Ag,...) nanoparticles. This hypothesis has been offered for explaining the singular magnetic properties of nanoparticles made of gold and other metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cphc.201200394/full|title = Magnetic Properties of Gold Nanoparticles: A Room-Temperature Quantum Effect|last = Gréget|first = Romain|date = 2012|journal = ChemPhysChem|doi = 10.1002/cphc.201200394|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unlike with superconductors, these persistent currents do not appear at zero magnetic field, as the current fluctuates symmetrically between positive and negative values; the magnetic field breaks that symmetry and allows a nonzero average current.
Although the persistent current in an individual ring is largely unpredictable due to uncontrolled factors like the disorder configuration, it has a slight bias so that an average persistent current appears even for an [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of conductors with different disorder configurations.&lt;ref name="akmo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akkermans |first1=Eric |last2=Montambaux |first2=Gilles|title=Mesoscopic Physics of Electrons and Photons|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-85512-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of persistent current was first predicted to be experimentally observable in micrometer-scale rings in 1983 by Markus Büttiker, [[Yoseph Imry]], and [[Rolf Landauer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In fact, all metals exhibit some magnetization in magnetic fields due a combination of [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]], core [[diamagnetism]], [[Landau diamagnetism]], [[Pauli paramagnetism]], which all appear regardless of the shape of the metal.
The additional magnetization from persistent current becomes strong with a connected ring shape, and for example would disappear if the ring were cut.&lt;ref name="akmo"/&gt;

Experimental evidence of the observation of persistent currents were first reported in 1990 by a research group at [[Bell Laboratories]] using a superconducting resonator to study an array of [[copper]] rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Phys.

{{quote|"These are ordinary, non-superconducting metal rings, which we typically think of as resistors, yet these currents will flow forever, even in the absence of an applied voltage."|Jack Harris, Associate Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Yale.}}

The 2009 measurements both reported greater sensitivity to persistent currents than previous measurements and made several other improvements to persistent current detection. The scanning SQUID's ability to change the position of the SQUID detector relative to the ring sample allowed for a number of rings to be measured on one sample chip and better extraction of the current signal from [[background noise]]. The cantilever detector's mechanical detection technique made it possible to measure the rings in a clean [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] environment over a large range of [[magnetic field]] and also to measure a number of rings on one sample chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Science|year = 2009|title = Sensing a Small But Persistent Current|first1 = Norman O. |last1 = Birge|pmid = 19815766|volume = 326|issue = 5950|pages = 244–5|doi = 10.1126/science.1180577|bibcode = 2009Sci...326..244B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant stem cells are characterized by two distinctive properties, which are: the ability to create all [[differentiated cell]] types and the ability to self-renew such that the number of stem cells is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheres B | title = Stem cells: a plant biology perspective | journal = Cell | volume = 122 | issue = 4 | pages = 499–504 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16145811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant stem cells never undergo [[aging process]] but immortally give rise to new specialized and unspecialized cells, and they have the potential to grow into any organ, tissue, or cell in the body.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} Thus they are [[totipotent]] cells equipped with regenerative powers that facilitate [[plant growth]] and production of new organs throughout lifetime.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}}

Unlike animals, plants are immobile. As plants cannot escape from danger by taking motion, they need a special mechanism to withstand various and sometimes unforeseen [[environmental stress]]. Here, what empowers them to withstand harsh external influence and preserve life is stem cells. In fact, plants comprise the oldest and the largest living organisms on earth, including [[Bristlecone pine|Bristlecone Pines]] in [[California]], U.S. (4,842 years old), and the [[Giant sequoia|Giant Sequoia]] in mountainous regions of California, U.S. (87 meters in height and 2,000 tons in weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gymnosperm Database | date = 15 March 2007 | work = Pinus longaeva | url = http://www.conifers.org/pi/pin/longaeva.htm. | access-date = 2006-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible because they have a modular body plan that enables them to survive substantial damage by initiating continuous and repetitive formation of new structures and organs such as [[Leaf|leaves]] and [[flower]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002" /&gt;

Plant stem cells are also characterized by their location in specialized structures called meristematic tissues, which are located in [[root apical meristem]] (RAM), [[shoot apical meristem]] (SAM), and [[vascular system]] ([[Procambium|(pro)cambium]] or vascular meristem.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirakawa Y, Shinohara H, Kondo Y, Inoue A, Nakanomyo I, Ogawa M, Sawa S, Ohashi-Ito K, Matsubayashi Y, Fukuda H | title = Non-cell-autonomous control of vascular stem cell fate by a CLE peptide/receptor system | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 39 | pages = 15208–13 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18812507 | pmc = 2567516 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0808444105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
Traditionally, plant stem cells were thought to only exist in SAM and RAM and studies were conducted based on this assumption. However, recent studies have indicated that (pro)cambium also serves as a niche for plant stem cells: "Procambium cells fulfill the criteria for being stem cells since they have the capacity for long-term self renewal and being able to differentiate into one or more specialized cell types."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alison MR, Poulsom R, Forbes S, Wright NA | title = An introduction to stem cells | journal = The Journal of Pathology | volume = 197 | issue = 4 | pages = 419–23 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12115858 | doi = 10.1002/path.1187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2018}}

'''Cambium''' is a type of meristem with thin walls which minutely exist in small populations within a plant. Due to this structural characteristic, once physical force is applied to it, it is easily damaged in the very process of isolation, losing its stem cell characteristics. Despite 160 years of biological effort to isolate and retrieve plant stem cells, none succeeded in the isolation due to the distinct structural characteristics of plant stem cell: "[t]he cambium consists of a few layers of narrow elongated, thin-walled cells, easily damaged during sampling." This highly vulnerable feature has made studies on cambial structure and [[ultrastructure]] difficult to achieve with conventional methods. Thus failure to isolate plant stem cells from meristematic tissues prompted scientists to administer plant cell culture by using [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] (dedifferentiated cells) as an alternative to plant stem cells.

'''Callus''', or dedifferentiated cells, are [[somatic cell]]s that undergo [[dedifferentiation]] to give rise to totipotent [[Embryogenesis|embryogenic]] cells, which temporarily gains the ability to proliferate and/or regenerate an [[embryo]]. Since embryogenic cells were considered totipotent cells based on their ability to regenerate or develop into an embryo under given conditions, dedifferentiated cells were generally regarded as stem cells of plant: "…we propose to extend the concept of stem cells to include embryogenic stem cells that arise from plant somatic cells. We examine the cellular, physiological and molecular similarities and differences between plant meristematic stem cells and embryogenic stem cells originating directly from single somatic cells."

==Plant stem cell vs. callus==
Despite that callus exhibits a number of stem cell-like properties for a temporary period and that it has been cultured for useful plant compounds as an alternative source of plant stem cell, callus and plant stem cell are fundamentally different from each other. Callus is similar to plant stem cell in its ability to differentiate, but the two are different in their origin. While plant stem cell exists in the meristematic tissues of plant, callus is obtained as a temporary response to cure wounds in somatic cell.

Moreover, callus undergoes dedifferentiation as differentiated cells acquire ability to differentiate; but [[genetic variation]] is inevitable in the process because the cells consist of somatic undifferentiated cells from an adult subject plant. Unlike true stem cells, callus is [[heterogeneous]]. Due to this reason, continuous and stable cell division of callus is difficult. Hence a plant stem cell originated from cambium is an immortal cell while that from callus is a temporarily dediffertiated cell obtained from stimulating the somatic cell.

Furthermore, the ability to differentiate and proliferate is different that differences between plant stem cell and callus are prevalent in culture and research. Only plant stem cells embedded in meristems can divide and give rise to cells that differentiate while giving rise to new stem cells. These immortal cells divide infinitely.

==Bioprocess innovation==
Plant cells are cultured to acquire plant useful compounds. However [[cell culture]]s are often hindered by various factors especially if cell culture continues long-term. However, strong vitality and structural characteristics of plant stem cell overcome previous drawbacks to plant cell culture. Thus plant stem cell culture is the most ideal and productive method of cell culture and phytochemical production as cells are successfully mass cultured while maintaining quality.

==Further applications==
Numerous [[medicine]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[pigment]]s, [[antimicrobial]]s, and [[insecticide]]s are derived from plant natural products. Cultured '''C'''ambial '''M'''eristematic '''C'''ells (CMC)  may provide a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable source of important natural products, including [[paclitaxel]]. Unlike plant cultivation, this approach is not subject to the unpredictability caused by variation in climatic conditions or political instability in certain part of the world. Also, CMCs from reference specifies may also provide an important biological tool to explore plant stem cell function.

In 2010, researchers from the Plant Stem Cell Institute (formerly Unhwa Institute of Science and Technology) presented their data to the world via Nature Biotechnology.  Their research demonstrated the world's first cambial meristematic cell isolation. Due to the valuable and beneficial compounds for human health (i.e. paclitaxel) which are secreted by the CMC's, this technology is considered a serious breakthrough in plant biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee EK, Jin YW, Park JH, Yoo YM, Hong SM, Amir R, Yan Z, Kwon E, Elfick A, Tomlinson S, Halbritter F, Waibel T, Yun BW, Loake GJ | title = Cultured cambial meristematic cells as a source of plant natural products | language = En | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 28 | issue = 11 | pages = 1213–7 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20972422 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2018}}

'''Post-structuralism''', sometimes referred as the '''French theory''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17409292.2014.882655?journalCode=gsit20 "French Theory Revisited"].&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the works of a series of mid-[[20th-century French philosophy|20th-century French]] [[continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] and [[critical theory|critical theorists]] who came to international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="Bensmaia05"&gt;Bensmaïa, Réda ''Poststructuralism'', article published in [[Lawrence D.

(1987). Foucault ([[Fontana Modern Masters]] series), University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06062-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is defined by its relationship to the system before it—[[structuralism]] (an intellectual movement developed in Europe from the early to mid-20th century). Structuralism proposes that one may understand human [[culture]] by means of a [[structure]]—modeled on language (i.e., [[structural linguistics]])—that differs from concrete [[reality]] and from abstract [[idea]]s—a "third order" that mediates between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze| Deleuze, Gilles]]. 2002. "How Do We Recognise Structuralism?" In ''Desert Islands and Other Texts 1953-1974.'' Trans. David Lapoujade. Ed. Michael Taormina. Semiotext(e) Foreign Agents ser. Los Angeles and New York: Semiotext(e), 2004. 170-192. {{ISBN|1-58435-018-0}}. p.171-173.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Post-structuralist authors all present different critiques of structuralism, but common themes include the rejection of the self-sufficiency of structuralism and an interrogation of the [[binary opposition]]s that constitute its structures.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Edward, ed. 1998. ''Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.'' Vol. 7 (Nihilism to Quantum mechanics). London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN| 0-415-18712-5}}. p.597.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers whose works are often characterised as post-structuralist include: [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Judith Butler]],  [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Julia Kristeva]], although many theorists who have been called "post-structuralist" have rejected the label.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Paul; 2006; "Post-structuralist Theories"; pp122-135 in Aitken, S. and Valentine, G. (eds); 2006; ''Approaches to Human Geography''; Sage, London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existential phenomenology]] is a significant influence; [[Colin Davis (philosopher) |Colin Davis]] has argued that post-structuralists might just as accurately be called "post-[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, Colin; "Levinas: An Introduction"; p8; 2006; Continuum, London.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Post-structuralist philosophers such as Derrida and Foucault did not form a self-conscious group, but each responded to the traditions of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[structuralism]]. The idea that knowledge could be centred on the beholder is rejected by structuralism, which claims to be a more secure foundation for knowledge.&lt;ref name="Colebrook"&gt;Colebrook 2002, pp. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt; In phenomenology, this foundation is experiential in itself. In Structuralism, knowledge is founded on the "structures" that make experience possible: concepts, and language or signs. By contrast, Post-structuralism argues that founding knowledge either on pure experience (phenomenology) or systematic structures (Structuralism) is impossible. This impossibility was not meant as a failure or loss, but rather as a cause for "celebration and liberation".&lt;ref name="Colebrook" /&gt;

A major theory associated with structuralism is [[binary opposition]]. This theory proposes that there are frequently used pairs of opposite but related words (concepts), often arranged in a hierarchy. Examples of common binary pairs include: Enlightenment/Romantic, male/female, speech/writing, rational/emotional, signifier/signified, symbolic/imaginary. Post-structuralism rejects the notion of the dominant word in the pair being dependent on its [[:wikt:subservient|subservient]] counterpart. The only way to properly understand the purpose of these pairings is to assess each term individually, and then its relationship to the related term.{{clarify|date=June 2012}}

== Post-structuralism and structuralism ==
[[Structuralism]] was an intellectual movement in France in the 1950s and 1960s that studied the underlying structures in cultural products (such as texts) and used analytical concepts from linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and other fields to interpret those structures. It emphasized the logical and scientific nature of its results.

Post-structuralism offers a way of studying how knowledge is produced and critiques structuralist premises. It argues that because history and culture condition the study of underlying structures, both are subject to biases and misinterpretations. A post-structuralist approach argues that to understand an object (e.g., a text), it is necessary to study both the object itself and the systems of knowledge that produced the object.

=== Historical vs. descriptive view ===
Post-structuralists generally assert that post-structuralism is the historical context surrounding the arts, while structuralism is considered descriptive of the present.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} This terminology is derived from [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s distinction between the views of [[historical linguistics|historical (diachronic)]] and [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive (synchronic)]] reading. From this basic distinction, Post-structuralist studies often emphasize history to analyze descriptive concepts.  By studying how cultural concepts have changed over time, Post-structuralists seek to understand how the same concepts are understood by readers in the present. For example, Michel Foucault's ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' is both an observation of history and an inspection of cultural attitudes about madness. The theme of history in modern [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] thought can be linked to such influences as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]].

=== Scholars between both movements ===
The uncertain distance between structuralism and post-structuralism is further blurred by the fact that scholars rarely label themselves as Post-structuralists. Some scholars associated with structuralism, such as [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel_Foucault|Foucault]], also became noteworthy in Post-structuralism.

===Controversy===
Some observers from outside the post-structuralist camp have questioned the rigor and legitimacy of the field. American philosopher [[John Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John. (1990). "[http://www.ditext.com/searle/searle1.html The Storm Over the University]," in The [[New York Times Review of Books]], 6 December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; argued in 1990 that "The spread of 'poststructuralist' literary theory is perhaps the best known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon." Similarly, physicist [[Alan Sokal]]&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. (1997) "[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/le_monde_english.html Professor Latour's Philosophical Mystifications]," originally published in French in ''[[Le Monde]]'', 31 January 1997; translated by the author.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997 criticized "the postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now [[hegemonic]] in some sectors of the American academy." Literature scholar Norman Holland argued that Post-structuralism was flawed due to reliance on Saussure's linguistic model, which was seriously challenged by the 1950s and was soon abandoned by linguists: "Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to [[Chomsky]]."&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The deconstructionists ("deconstructionist" and "poststructuralist" mean the same thing, by the way: "poststructuralist" is what you call a deconstructionist who doesn't want to be called a deconstructionist)&amp;nbsp;... see the debate over the ownership of meaning as a skirmish in a larger war in Western philosophy over the idea that presence and unity are ontologically prior to expression. There’s been this longstanding deluded presumption, they think, that if there is an utterance then there must exist a unified, efficacious presence that causes and owns that utterance. The poststructuralists attack what they see as a post-Platonic prejudice in favor of presence over absence and speech over writing. We tend to trust speech over writing because of the immediacy of the speaker: he's right there, and we can grab him by the lapels and look into his face and figure out just exactly what one single thing he means. But the reason why poststructuralists are in the literary theory business at all is that they see writing, not speech, as more faithful to the metaphysics of true expression. For Barthes, Derrida, and Foucault, writing is a better animal than speech because it is iterable; it is iterable because it is abstract; and it is abstract because it is a function not of presence but of absence: the reader’s absent when the writer’s writing, and the writer's absent when the reader's reading. 

For a deconstructionist, then, a writer's circumstances and intentions are indeed a part of the "context" of a text, but context imposes no real cinctures on the text's meaning, because meaning in language requires a cultivation of absence rather than presence, involves not the imposition but the erasure of consciousness. This is so because these guys–Derrida following Heidegger and Barthes Mallarme and Foucault God knows who–see literary language as not a tool but an environment. A writer does not wield language; he is subsumed in it. Language speaks us; writing writes; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biblioklept.org/2010/12/22/david-foster-wallace-defines-poststructuralism/|title=David Foster Wallace Describes Poststructuralism|last=Biblioklept|date=2010-12-22|website=Biblioklept|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
Post-structuralism emerged in [[France]] during the 1960s as a movement critiquing [[structuralism]]. According to [[José Guilherme Merquior|J.&amp;nbsp;G. Merquior]]&lt;ref name="Merquior1987"/&gt; a [[love–hate relationship]] with structuralism developed among many leading French thinkers in the 1960s.

In a 1966 lecture "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]", Jacques Derrida presented a thesis on an apparent rupture in intellectual life. Derrida interpreted this event as a "decentering" of the former intellectual cosmos. Instead of progress or divergence from an identified centre, Derrida described this "event" as a kind of "play."

In 1967, Barthes published [[Death of the author|"The Death of the Author"]] in which he announced a metaphorical event: the "death" of the author as an authentic source of meaning for a given text. Barthes argued that any literary text has multiple meanings, and that the author was not the prime source of the work's semantic content.  The "Death of the Author," Barthes maintained, was the "Birth of the Reader," as the source of the proliferation of meanings of the text.
 
The period was marked by the rebellion of students and workers against the state in May 1968.

== Major works ==

===Barthes and the need for metalanguage===
Barthes in his work, ''Elements of Semiology'' (1967), advanced the concept of the "[[metalanguage]]". A metalanguage is a systematized way of talking about concepts like meaning and grammar beyond the constraints of a traditional (first-order) language; in a metalanguage, symbols replace words and phrases. Insofar as one metalanguage is required for one explanation of first-order language, another may be required, so metalanguages may actually replace first-order languages.  Barthes exposes how this structuralist system is regressive; orders of language rely upon a metalanguage by which it is explained, and therefore [[deconstruction]] itself is in danger of becoming a metalanguage, thus exposing all languages and discourse to scrutiny. Barthes' other works contributed deconstructive theories about texts.

=== Derrida's lecture at Johns Hopkins ===
The occasional designation of Post-structuralism as a movement can be tied to the fact that mounting criticism of Structuralism became evident at approximately the same time that Structuralism became a topic of interest in universities in the United States. This interest led to a colloquium at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1966 titled "The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man", to which such French philosophers as Derrida, Barthes, and Lacan were invited to speak.

Derrida's lecture at that conference, "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences]]", was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to Structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist.

The element of "play" in the title of Derrida's essay is often erroneously interpreted in a linguistic sense, based on a general tendency towards puns and humour, while [[social constructionism]] as developed in the later work of Michel Foucault is said to create play in the sense of strategic agency by laying bare the levers of historical change&lt;!--what are the "levers of historical change" specifically?--&gt;. Many see the importance of Foucault's work to be in its synthesis of this social/historical account of the operation of power (see [[governmentality]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In [[Library science|library]] and [[archival science]], '''preservation''' is a set of activities aimed at prolonging the life of a record while making as few changes as possible. Relevant [[metadata]], enhancement of cultural value, and improvement of access are also important aspects of preservation work. Actions taken to influence record creators prior to selection and acquisition must be avoided for proper preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/preservation|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists|website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Technical statement|date=September 2018}} Preservation, in this definition, is practiced in a [[library]] or an [[archive]] by a [[librarian]], [[archivist]], or other professional when they perceive a record is in need of care.

Preservation should be distinguished from [[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage]], which refers to the treatment and repair of individual items to slow the process of decay, or restore them to a usable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/conservation |title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists |website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|title=Preservation of Cultural Artifacts|accessdate=2007-05-11|publisher=Southern Polytechnic State University|website=wiki.spsu.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611203338/http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|archive-date=2007-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

===Standard functions of preservation programs===
*[[Collections care]] is the general maintenance and preventive care of a collection as a whole. This can include activities such as [[security]], [[environmental monitoring]], [[preservation surveys]] and more specialized activities such as [[mass deacidification]].
*[[Art conservation|Conservation]] is the treatment and repair of individual items to slow decay or restore them to a usable state. Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.
*[[Digital preservation]] is the maintenance of digitally stored information. Some means of digital preservation include refreshing, migration, replication and emulation. This should not be confused with [[digitization]], which is a process of creating digital information which must then itself be preserved digitally.
*[[Emergency management|Disaster preparedness]] (RT: Disaster Plan / [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuation]] / [[Disaster Recovery]] / Disaster Mitigation Plan) is the practice of arranging for the necessary resources and planning the best course of action to prevent or minimize damage to a collection in the event of a disaster of any level of magnitude, whether natural or man-made.
*Reformatting is the practice of creating copies of an object in another type of [[data storage device|data-storage device]]. Reformatting processes include [[microform|microfilming]] and digitization.

===Digitization===
{{Main|Digitizing}}

A relatively new concept, [[digitization]], has been hailed as a way to preserve historical items for future use. "Digitizing refers to the process of converting analog materials into digital form."&lt;ref&gt;Oya Y. Rieger, ''Preservation in the Age of Large-Scale Digitization: A White Paper'', (Washington, D.C.: Council on Library and Information Resources, 2008): 10, http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919051600/http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf |date=2015-09-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts, digitization is achieved through scanning an item and saving it to a digital format. For example, the Google Book Search program has partnered with over forty libraries around the world to digitize books. The goal of this library partnership project is to "make it easier for people to find relevant books – specifically, books they wouldn't find any other way such as those that are out of print – while carefully respecting authors' and publishers' copyrights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/googlebooks/library/|title=Google Books Library Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although digitization seems to be a promising area for future preservation, there are also problems. The main problems are that digital space costs money, formats change, and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-quality images take a longer time to scan, but are often more valuable for future use. Fragile items are often more difficult or more expensive to scan, which creates a selection problem for preservationists. Other problems include scan quality, redundancy of digitized books among different libraries, and copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these problems are being solved through educational initiatives. Educational programs are tailoring themselves to fit preservation needs and help new students understand preservation practices. Programs teaching graduate students about digital librarianship are especially important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Paul|year=2010|title=Preservation in the Age of Google: Digitization, Digital Preservation, and Dilemmas|url=|journal=Library Quarterly|volume=80|issue=1|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as the Digital Preservation Network strive to ensure that "the complete scholarly record is preserved for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpn.org/|title=Digital Preservation Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress maintains a Sustainability of Digital Formats web site that educates institutions on various aspects of preservation: most notably, on approximately 200 digital format types and which are most likely to last into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/intro/format_eval_rel.shtml|title=Library of Congress: Sustainability of Digital Formats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital preservation|Digital Preservation]] is another name for digitization, and is the term more commonly used in archival courses. The main goal of digital preservation is to guarantee that people will have access to the digitally preserved materials long into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/defdigpres0408|title=Definitions of Digital Preservation|last=admin|date=2008-02-21|work=Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services (ALCTS)|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
When practicing preservation one has several factors to consider to properly preserve a record: 1) the environment the record is store in, 2) the criteria to determine when preservation is necessary, 3) what standard practices will be laid down for preservation in an individual institution, 4) research and testing, and 5) vendor services needed for preservation. 

===Storage environment===
Environmental controls are necessary to facilitate the preservation of organic materials and are especially important to monitor in rare and [[special collections]]. Key environmental factors to watch include [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]], pests, pollutants, and [[light]] exposure.

In general, the lower the temperature is, the better it is for the collection. However, since books and other materials are often housed in areas with people, a compromise must be struck to accommodate human comfort. A reasonable temperature to accomplish both goals is 65-68˚F however, if possible, film and photography collections should be kept in a segregated area at 55˚F.&lt;ref&gt;Lull, W.P. (1990). ''Conservation environment guidelines for libraries and archives; with the assistance of Paul N. Banks.'' Albany, NY:  The University of the State of New York, The State Education Dept., The New York State Library, Division of Library Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books and other materials take up and give off moisture making them sensitive to relative humidity. Very high humidity encourages mold growth and insect infestations. Low humidity causes materials to lose their flexibility. Fluctuations in relative humidity are more damaging than a constant humidity in the middle or low range. Generally, the relative humidity should be between 30-50% with as little variation as possible, however recommendations on specific levels to maintain vary depending on the type of material, i.e. paper-based, film, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|title=Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193142/http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|archive-date=2007-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A specialized dew point calculator for book preservation is available.&lt;ref&gt;"Dew Point Calculator."

&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Pests, such as insects and vermin, eat and destroy paper and the adhesive that secures book bindings. Food and drink in libraries, archives, and museums can increase the attraction of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |title=UCSD Libraries Preservation Department. "Why is Eating and Drinking in the Library Discouraged?" 2006. UCSD. 18 June 2008 |access-date=2008-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830091329/http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |archive-date=2006-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Integrated Pest Management]] system is one way to control pests in libraries.

Particulate and gaseous pollutants, such as soot, [[ozone]], [[sulfur dioxide]], oxides of nitrogen, can cause dust, soiling, and irreversible molecular damage to materials. Pollutants are exceedingly small and not easily detectable or removable. A special filtration system in the building's [[HVAC]] is a helpful defense.

Exposure to light also has a significant effect on materials. It is not only the light visible to humans that can cause damage, but also [[ultraviolet]] light and [[infrared]] radiation. Measured in [[lux]] or the amount of lumens/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the generally accepted level of illumination with sensitive materials is limited to 50 lux per day. Materials receiving more lux than recommended can be placed in dark storage periodically to prolong the original appearance of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, G. ''The Museum Environment''. 2nd ed. London: Butterworths, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent concerns about the impact of climate change on the management of cultural heritage objects as well as the historic environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/2082/ |title=Climate change and the historic environment |publisher=Centre for Sustainable Heritage, University College London |accessdate=2008-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504150330/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/2082/ |archive-date=2008-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has prompted research efforts to investigate alternative climate control methods and strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_1/index.html|title=From the Outside in: Preventive conservation, sustainability, and environmental conservation|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that include the implementation of alternative climate control systems to replace or supplement traditional high-energy consuming HVAC systems as well as the introduction of passive preservation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_1/index.html|title=Collections care, human comfort, and climate control: A case study at the Casa de Rui Barbosa Museum|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than maintaining a flat line, consistent 24/7 condition for a collection's environment, fluctuation can occur within acceptable limits to create a preservation environment while also thinking of energy efficiency and taking advantage of the outside environment.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Herzog, "Energy Savings and Collection Management," Accessed on May 16, 2011, https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/resources/newsletter-archive/v2/energy-savings&lt;/ref&gt;

Bound materials are sensitive to rapid temperature or humidity cycling due to differential expansion of the binding and pages, which may cause the binding to crack and/or the pages to warp. Changes in temperature and humidity should be done slowly so as to minimize the difference in expansion rates. However, an accelerated aging study on the effects of fluctuating temperature and humidity on paper color and strength showed no evidence that cycling of one temperature to another or one RH to another caused a different mechanism of decay.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis Bigourdan and James M. Reilly. "Effects of Fluctuating Environments on Paper Materials--Stability and Practical Significance for Preservation."

===Preservation criteria===
Making a proper decision is an important factor before starting preservation practices. [[Decision making]] for preservation should be made considering significance and value of materials. Significance is considered to have two major components: importance and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf|title=A Significance Recognition Scheme for Non-National Museums and Galleries in Scotland|publisher=Scottish Museums Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106213355/http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2007-11-06|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Importance" relates to the collection's role as a record, and "quality" covers comprehensiveness, depth, uniqueness, authenticity and reputation of the collection. Moreover, analyzing the significance of materials can be used to uncover more about their meaning.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|title=A Regional Approach to Identifying Items of National Significance Held by Small Cultural Institutions in New Zealand|last=Dorner|first=Daniel|last2=Young|first2=Sophie|publication-date=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328010251/http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|archivedate=2007-03-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment of significance can also aid in documenting the provenance and context to argue the case for grant funding for the object and collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/sector_info_item/5|title=Significance - A Guide to Assessing the Significance of Cultural Heritage Objects and Collections|publisher=Heritage Collections Council (Australia)|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of significance can be historically, culturally, socially, or spiritually significant. In the preservation context, libraries and archives make decisions in different ways. In libraries, decision-making likely targets existing holding materials, whereas in archives, decisions for preservation are often made when they acquire materials. Therefore, different criteria might be needed on different occasions. In general, for archive criteria, the points include:

# the characteristics of a record (purpose, creator, etc.);
# the quality of the information in the record;
# the record in context (part of a series or not);
# potential use and possible limitations; and
# the cost against the benefits from its existence.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach" /&gt; 

[[File:Old book bindings.jpg|thumb|Worn books at the library of [[Merton College]], Oxford.|300x300px]]For archival criteria, the following are evidence of significance:

# uniqueness,
# irreplaceability,
# high level of impact – over time or place,

===Standards===
Since the 1970s, the [[Northeast Document Conservation Center]] has stated that the study of understanding the needs of the archive/library is inherently important to the survival of archives and libraries. In order for the preservation of a collection to survive for a long time it is important that a systematic preservation plan is in place. The first step in planning a preservation program is to assess the institution's existing preservation needs. This process entails identifying the general and specific needs of the collection, establishing priorities, and gathering the resources to execute the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patkus|first=Beth|title=Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|publication-place=Andover|publication-date=2003|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because budget and time limitations require priorities to be set, standards have been established by the profession to determine what should be preserved in a collection.  Considerations include existing condition, rarity, and evidentiary and market values.  With non-paper formats, the availability of equipment to access the information will be a factor (for example, playback equipment for audio-visual materials, or microform readers).  An institution should determine how many, if any, other repositories hold the material, and consider coordinating efforts with those that do.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub103abst.html|title=The Evidence in Hand: Report of the Task Force on the Artifact in Library Collections|last=Nichols|first=Stephen G.|last2=Smith|first2=Abby|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|year=2001|isbn=1-887334-88-2|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=2001|oclc=48623491|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions should establish an environment conducive to preservation changes, involve staff, and create an understanding among administration and staff. The first steps an institution should implement, according to the NEDCC, are to establish a policy that defines and charts the course of action and create a framework for carrying out goals and priorities.

There are three methods for carrying out a preservation survey: general preservation assessment, collection condition surveys, and an item-by-item survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Graham|title=Surveying Collections: The importance of Condition Assessment for Preservation Management|publisher=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science 27, no. 4|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=1995|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; General condition surveys can be part of a library [[inventory (library)|inventory]].

Selection for treatment determines the survival of materials and should be done by a specialist, whether in relation to an established collection development policy or on an item by item basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preservation: Issues and Planning |last=Harris |first=Carolyn |publisher=American Library Association |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-585-37626-4 &lt;!-- |ISBN=0-585-37626-3 --&gt;|editor-last=Banks |editor-first=Paul N. |place=Chicago |pages=206–224 |contribution=Selection for Preservation |oclc=48139650 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author-link=Carolyn_Harris |editor2-last=Pilette |editor2-first=Roberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an object or collection has been chosen for preservation, the treatment must be determined that is most appropriate to the material and its repository. If the information is most important, reformatting or creation of a surrogate is a likely option. If the artifact itself is of value, it will receive conservation treatment, ideally of a reversible nature.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

===Research and testing===
With old media deteriorating or showing their vulnerabilities and new media becoming available, research remains active in the field of conservation and preservation. Everything from how to preserve paper media to creating and maintaining electronic resources and gauging their [[digital permanence]] is being explored by students and professionals in archives/libraries. The two main issues that most institutions tend to face are the rapid disintegration of acidic paper and water damage (due to flooding, plumbing problems, etc.). Therefore, these areas of preservation, as well as new digital technologies, receive much of the research attention.

The [[American Library Association]] has many scholarly journals that publish articles on preservation topics, such as ''College and Research Libraries, Information Technology and Libraries,'' and ''Library Resources and Technical Services''. Scholarly periodicals in this field from other publishers include ''International Preservation News, Journal of the American Institute for Conservation'', and ''Collection Management'' among many others.

===Vendor services===
Many private entities provide preservation and conservation services and supplies. One of the most well known companies in preservation is Hollinger Metal Edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollingermetaledge.com/|title=Hollinger Metal Edge - Since 1945!|website=www.hollingermetaledge.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sell [[Hollinger box]]es, folders, AV preservation tools, archival paper, exhibit material, and even furniture. Another company that produces many preservation tools is University Products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityproducts.com/|title=University Products - Thinking in and out of the box since 1968.|website=www.universityproducts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Globalize section|date=May 2018}}

Learning the proper methods of preservation is important and most archivists are educated on the subject at academic institutions that specifically cover archives and preservation. In the United States most repositories require archivists to have a degree from an ALA-accredited library school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-preservation-rankings|title=Best Archives and Preservation Programs|last=|first=|date=2017|website=US News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar institutions exist in countries outside the US.

Since 2010, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has enhanced funding for library and archives conservation education in three major conservation programs.&lt;ref&gt;https://mellon.org/programs/scholarly-communications/preservation-and-conservation/&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are all part of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~anagpic/|title=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property|publisher=University of Texas School of Information|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another educational resource available to preservationists is the Northeast Document Conservation Center or  NEDCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/home.php|title=NEDCC|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preservation, Planning and Publications Committee of the Preservation and Reformatting Section (PARS) in the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services has created a Preservation Education Directory of ALA Accredited schools in the U.S. and Canada offering courses in preservation. The directory is updated approximately every three years. The 10th Edition was made available on the ALCTS web site in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preservation/educationdirectory|title=Preservation Education Directory 10th Edition|publisher=ALCTS|accessdate=2015-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Information science}}Additional preservation education is available to librarians through various professional organizations, such as:

==Preservation in non-academic facilities==

===Public libraries===
Limited, tax-driven funding can often interfere with the ability for public libraries to engage in extensive preservation activities. Materials, particularly books, are often much easier to replace than to repair when damaged or worn. Public libraries usually try to tailor their services to meet the needs and desires of their local communities, which could cause an emphasis on acquiring new materials over preserving old ones. Librarians working in public facilities frequently have to make complicated decisions about how to best serve their patrons. Commonly, public library systems work  with each other and sometimes with more academic libraries through interlibrary loan programs. By sharing resources, they are able to expand upon what might be available to their own patrons and share the burdens of preservation across a greater array of systems.

===Archival repositories and special collections===
Archival facilities focus specifically on rare and fragile materials. With staff trained in appropriate techniques, archives are often available to many public and private library facilities as an alternative to destroying older materials. Items that are unique, such as photographs, or items that are out of print, can be preserved in archival facilities more easily than in many library settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|website=www.clir.org|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===
Because so many museum holdings are unique, including print materials, art, and other objects, preservationists are often most active in this setting; however, since most holdings are usually much more fragile, or possibly corrupted, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] may be more necessary than preservation. This is especially common in [[Art museum|art museums]]. Museums typically hold to the same practices lead by archival institutions.

==History==

===Antecedents===
Preservation as a formal profession in libraries and archives dates from the twentieth century, but its philosophy and practice has roots in many earlier traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Lynn |last=Ritzenthaler |year=1993 |title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts |chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |location=Chicago |publisher=Society of American Archivists |url= |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ancient societies, appeals to heavenly protectors were used to preserve books, scrolls and manuscripts from insects, fire and decay. 
* To the ancient Egyptians, the scarab or dung beetle (see: [[Scarab (artifact)]]) was a protector of written products. 
* In ancient [[Babylon]], [[Nabu]] is the heavenly patron of books and protector of clay tablets. Nabu is the Babylonian god of wisdom and writing, and is the patron of the scribes, librarians and archivists. 
* In Arabic and other eastern societies, sometimes a traditional method to protect books and scrolls was a metaphysical appeal to "Kabi:Kaj", the "King of the Cockroaches".&lt;ref&gt;Gacek, Adam. "The Use of Kabikaj in Arabic Manuscripts." Manuscripts of the Middle East. Volume I, 1986. Page 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are three saints in the Christian church that are closely associated with libraries as patrons: [[Saint Lawrence]], [[Saint Jerome]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaschins, Elizabeth and Jane Kemp. "Saint Jerome, the Patron Saint of Librarians." Library Journal. September 1, 1988, pages 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Saint Catharine of Alexandria or [[Catherine of Alexandria]].
* In some Christian monasteries, prayers and curses were placed at the end of books to prevent theft, or to damn the thieves. Frequently called a "[[book curse]]", these were placed in the book to deter theft. 
* The ancient Chinese god Wei T'O is the patron god of libraries and books. Many examples of appeals to Wei T'O can be found in Chinese manuscripts dated five hundred or more years ago. &lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.weito.com/ accessed July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wei T'O is especially invoked for the protection of books and libraries against fire. Since the modern books are suffering from acid decomposition ([[slow fires]]), Wei T'O is especially relevant to modern librarianship. A modern product to de-acidify paper is named in his honor.
* Sri Lankan symbols or images of the Sinhalese "Fire Demons" are hung in the corners of libraries and other buildings to appease the incendiary demons and to avert fire, lightning and cataclysm, according to Sinhalese mythology. Since fire and acid decomposition (also known as "slow fires") are a special problem for libraries because of the concentration of paper products, the "Fire Demons" are also included when used to assuage these destroyers of libraries and books.
* The Aztec and Mayan Indians of Latin America also had deities concerned with libraries. The major god, [[Quetzalcoatl]], is credited with the discoveries of the arts, the calendar, and of writing. A single feather or plume at the beginning or at the end of a document or stone carving would indicate a dedication to the "Feathered Serpent." This symbol degenerated over time to a single fringed line.
Human record-keeping arguably dates back to the [[cave painting]] boom of the [[upper paleolithic]], some 32,000-40,000 years ago. More direct antecedents are the [[History of writing|writing systems]] that developed in the 4th millennium B.C. Written record keeping and information sharing practices, along with [[oral tradition]], sustain and transmit information from one group to another. This level of preservation has been supplemented over the last century with the professional practice of preservation and conservation in the cultural heritage community.

#[[Oral tradition]] or [[oral culture]], the transmission of information from one generation to the next without a writing system.
#Antiquarian practices, including [[Scribe|scribal practice]], [[Burial| burial practice]], the libraries at [[Library of Pergamum|Pergamum]], [[Library of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and other ancient archives.
#Medieval practices, including the [[scriptorium]] and [[relic]] collection
#[[Renaissance]] and the changing conception of artists and works of art
#[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[Encyclopedists]]
#[[Romanticism|Romantic movement]]'s imperative to preserve

===Significant events===
*1933: [[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] introduces the field of conservation to paper deacidification when he publishes a paper on the [[acid paper]] problem. In later studies, Barrow tested paper from American books made between 1900 and 1949, and learned that after forty years the books had lost on average 96 percent of their original strength; after less than ten years, they had already lost 64 percent. Barrow determined that this rapid deterioration was not the direct result of using wood-pulp fibers, since rag papers of this period were also aging rapidly, but rather due to the residual [[sulfuric acid]] produced in both [[Cotton paper|rag]] and wood pulp papers. Manufacturing methods used after 1870 employed sulfuric acid for [[sizing]] and bleaching the paper. Earlier papermaking methods left the final product only mildly alkaline or even neutral.  Such paper has maintained its strength for 300 to 800 years, despite [[sulfur dioxide]] and other air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stevens |first=Rolland E. |date=October 1968 |title=The Library |journal=The Journal of Higher Education |pages=407–409|doi=10.2307/1980093 |volume=39 |issue=7 |jstor=1980093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow's 1933 article on the fragile state of wood pulp paper predicted the life expectancy, or "LE", of this paper was approximately 40–50 years. At that point the paper would begin to show signs of natural decay, and he concluded that research for a new media on which to write and print was needed.
*1966: [[The Flood of the River Arno in Florence, Italy]] damaged or destroyed millions of rare books and led to the development of restoration laboratories and new methods in conservation. Instrumental in this process was conservationist [[Peter Waters]], who led a group of volunteers, called "mud angels", in restoring thousands of books and papers. This event awakened many historians, librarians, and other professionals to the importance of having a preservation plan. Many consider this flood to be one of the worst disasters since the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|burning of the Library of Alexandria]]. It spurred a resurgence in the profession of preservation and conservation worldwide.
*1987: Terry Saunders releases the film [[Slow fire|Slow Fires: On the Preservation of the Human Record]] which examines paper embrittlement resulting from acid decay
*1989: March 7 ["[[Commitment Day]]"] Major US print publishers convene at NYPL to endorse a community-wide commitment to utilizing [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 9706 certified permanent durable paper in order to combat the acid paper epidemic.

===Significant people===
*[[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] (1904–1967) was an American chemist and paper conservator, and a pioneer of library and archives conservation. He introduced the field of conservation to paper deacidification through alkalization.
*[[Paul N.

Specifically, Dean has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East.

The [[Paul Banks and Carolyn Harris Preservation Award]] for outstanding preservation specialists in library and archival science, is given annually by the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214195255/http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm |date=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subdivision of the [[American Library Association]]. It is awarded in recognition of professional preservation specialists who have made significant contributions to the field.

==Legal &amp; Ethical Issues==
Reformatting, or in any other way copying an item's contents, raises obvious [[copyright]] issues. In many cases, a library is allowed to make a limited number of copies of an item for preservation purposes. In the United States, certain exceptions have been made for libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108- |title=U.S. Code: Title 17,108. Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=Legal Information Institute |website=www.law.cornell.edu]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics will play an important role in many aspects of the conservator's activities. When choosing which objects are in need of treatment, the conservator should do what is best for the object in question and not yield to pressure or opinion from outside sources. Conservators should refer to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice,&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|title=AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304161903/http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|archivedate=March 4, 2000|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that the conservation professional must "strive to attain the highest possible standards in all aspects of conservation."

One instance in which these decisions may get tricky is when the conservator is dealing with cultural objects. The AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt; has addressed such concerns, stating "All actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for cultural property, its unique character and significance and the people or person who created it." This can be applied in both the care and long-term storage of objects in archives and institutions.

It is important that preservation specialists to be respectful of cultural property and the societies that created it, it is also important for them to be aware of international and national laws pertaining to stolen items. In recent years there has been a rise in nations seeking out artifacts that have been stolen and are now in museums. In many cases museums are working with the nations to find a compromise to balance the need for reliable supervision as well as access for both the public and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;"Rightful Owners." ''Nature'', Vol. 440 (6) 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservators are not just bound by ethics to treat cultural and religious objects with respect, but also in some cases by law. For example, in the United States, conservators must comply with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ([[NAGPRA]]). The [http://www.firstarchivistscircle.org/ First Archivists Circle], a group of Native American archivists, has also created [http://www2.nau.edu/libnap-p/index.html Protocols for Native American Archival Materials]. The non-binding guidelines are suggestions for libraries and archives with Native American archival materials.

The care of cultural and sacred objects often affects the physical storage or the object. For example, sacred objects of the native peoples of the Western United States are supposed to be stored with sage to ensure their spiritual well being. The idea of storing an object with plant material is inherently problematic to an archival collection because of the possibility of insect infestation. When conservators have faced this problem, they have addressed it by using freeze-dried sage, thereby meeting both conservation and cultural needs.

Some individuals in the archival community have explored the possible moral responsibility to preserve all cultural phenomena, in regards to the concept of monumental preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Cloonan, Michele V. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1387/is_3_55/ai_n19311179 "The Moral Imperative to Preserve"], "[[Library Trends]]", Winter 2007. Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates argue that such an undertaking is something that the indigenous or native communities that produce such cultural objects are better suited to perform. Currently, however, many indigenous communities are not financially able to support their own archives and museums. Still, indigenous archives are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Amy|year=2002|title=Issues in Native American Archives|url=|journal=Collection Management|volume=27|issue=2|pages=43–54|doi=10.1300/j105v27n02_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is a longstanding tension between preservation of and access to library materials, particularly in the area of [[special collections]]. Handling materials promotes their progression to an unusable state, especially if they are handled carelessly. On the other hand, materials must be used in order to gain any benefit from them. In a collection with valuable materials, this conflict is often resolved by a number of measures which can include heightened security, requiring the use of gloves for photographs, restricting the materials researchers may bring with them into a reading room, and restricting use of materials to patrons who are not able to satisfy their research needs with less valuable copies of an item. These restrictions are annoyances to researchers who feel that these measures are in place solely to keep materials out of the hands of the public.

There is also controversy surrounding preservation methods. A major controversy at the end of the twentieth century centered on the practice of discarding items that had been microfilmed. This was the subject of novelist [[Nicholson Baker]]'s book ''Double Fold'', which chronicled his efforts to save many old runs of American newspapers (formerly owned by the British Library) from being sold to dealers or pulped. A similar concern persists over the retention of original documents reformatted by any means, analog or digital. Concerns include scholarly needs and legal requirements for authentic or original records as well as questions about the longevity, quality and completeness of reformatted materials.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert B. Townsend, {{cite web |url=http://blog.historians.org/articles/204/google-books-whats-not-to-like |title=Google Books: What’s Not to Like? |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=American Historical Association |website=www.historians.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Paul Duguid, {{cite web |url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_8/duguid/ |title=Inheritance and loss? A brief survey of Google Books |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=First Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retention of originals as a source or fail-safe copy is now a fairly common practice. Another controversy revolving around different preservation methods is that of digitization of original material to maintain the intellectual content of the material while ignoring the physical nature of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle, G.T. (1998). Texts and artifacts in the electronic era. 21stC, 3.2. 
[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-3.2/tanselle.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Future of the Print Record structured its "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records" on the inherent theoretical ideology that there is a need to preserve as many copies of a printed edition as is possible as texts and their textual settings are, quite simply, not separable, just as the artifactual characteristics of texts are as relevant and varied as the texts themselves (in the report mentioned herewith, [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] suggests that presently existing book stacks need not be abandoned with emerging technologies; rather they serve as vitally important original (primary) sources for future study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|title=Statement on the Significance of Primary Records|accessdate=2008-07-27|publisher=Modern Language Association|website=www.mla.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701014009/http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|archive-date=2008-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many digitized items, such as back issues of periodicals, are provided by publishers and databases on a subscription basis. If these companies were to cease providing access to their digital information, facilities that elected to discard paper copies of these periodicals could face significant difficulties in providing access to these items. Discussion as to the best ways to utilize digital technologies is therefore ongoing, and the practice continues to evolve. Of course, the issues surrounding digital objects and their care in libraries and archives continues to expand as more and more of contemporary culture is created, stored, and used digitally. These [[born-digital]] materials raise their own new kinds of preservation challenges and in some cases they may even require use new kinds of tools and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Ross |first =Seamus |last2 =Gow |first2 =Ann |publication-date = 1999 |title = Digital archaeology?

===The library as a sacred institution===
In her book "Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship", Nancy Kalikow Maxwell discusses how libraries are capable of performing some of the same functions as religion.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship|last=Maxwell|first=Nancy Kalikow|publisher=American Library Association|year=2006|isbn=0-8389-0917-5|place=Chicago|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many librarians feel that their work is done for some higher purpose.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;  The same can be said for preservation librarians. One instance of the library's role as sacred is to provide a sense of [[immortality]]: with the ever-changing world outside, the library will remain stable and dependable.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; Preservation is a great help in this regard. Through digitization and reformatting, preservation librarians are able to retain material while at the same time adapting to new methods. In this way, libraries can adapt to the changes in user needs without changing the quality of the material itself. Through preservation efforts, patrons can rest assured that although materials are constantly deteriorating over time, the library itself will remain a stable, reliable environment for their information needs. Another sacred ability of the library is to provide information and a connection to the past.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; By working to slow down the processes of deterioration and decay of library materials, preservation practices help keep this link to the past alive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5915">[[File:Gastrolobium minus.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Gastrolobium minus]]'', a prostrate shrub native to [[Western Australia]], popular in horticulture]]
A '''prostrate shrub''' is a [[woody plant]], most of the branches of which lie upon or just above the ground, rather than being held erect as are the branches of most trees and shrubs.

Prostration may occur because the supporting tissues in stems are not strong enough to support the weight of the plant, causing the plant to bend until it reaches the ground. Alternatively, it may occur because of a genetic disposition for branches to grow horizontally on or just under the ground; for example, as a strategy to avoid overly strong sunlight. Finally, environmental factors such as strong winds laden with sand or salt may tend to prune away erect branches, thereby creating a prostrate habit in plants that may not be predisposed to prostration.

Prostrate shrubs are used in [[horticulture]] as [[groundcover]]s and in [[hanging basket]]s, and to bind soils and prevent [[soil erosion|erosion]] in remedial [[Landscape architecture|landscaping]]. They are also important components of [[Garden design#Rock garden|rock gardens]]. The shrinking size of [[urban horticulture|urban gardens]] has meant an increase in demand for and desirability of dwarf and prostrate forms of many garden plants. More recently, prostrate shrubs have received attention for their usefulness in planting [[green roof]]s and [[green wall]]s, where they can contribute to [[Environmental engineering|environmental conservation]].

Prostrate plant forms may arise from deliberate breeding and hybridisation, such as the groundcover [[grevillea]]s, including ''Grevillea'' "Poorinda Royal Mantle",&lt;ref name=Stewart114&gt;Stewart, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; and ''G.'' "Bronze Rambler",&lt;ref name=Stewart110&gt;Stewart, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; or by selection of forms of plants growing in exposed areas. The windswept coastal heathlands and cliffs of far southeastern New South Wales have yielded [[Banksia 'Roller Coaster'|''Banksia'' 'Roller Coaster']] and [[Banksia 'Pygmy Possum'|''Banksia'' 'Pygmy Possum']].&lt;ref name=Stewart102&gt;Stewart, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; These are flattened varieties of less than 0.5 m in height of the species ''[[Banksia integrifolia]]'' and ''[[Banksia serrata]]'', respectively, both of which grow to sizeable trees of 10&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft) or more in height.&lt;ref name=Stewart102/&gt; The origin of others is unclear; Cootamundra Wattle (''[[Acacia baileyana]]'') is a popular and widely used garden plant in Australia, a prostrate form of which is also in cultivation. Its origin is unknown, possibly a chance seedling in cultivation. It itself is a popular garden plant, its cascading horizontal branches good for rockeries.&lt;ref name=Stewart156&gt;Stewart, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[List of Rosa species|species of roses]] grow as long canes that can spread prostrate on the ground, and some of these have been hybridized to form [[Rose#Climbing and rambling|climbing and rambling roses]] that can be allowed to grow on the ground without support, as well as varieties known as "[[Rose#Carpet Roses|carpet roses]]" that are intended to be grown as ground covers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509710/rose&lt;/ref&gt; Prostrate juniper, [[Juniperus communis|''Juniperus communis'' subsp.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11419">{{about|a feature of jokes}}

A '''punch line''' ('''punch-line''' or '''punchline''') concludes a [[joke]]; it is intended to make people laugh. It is the third and final part of the [[Joke#Telling jokes|typical joke structure]]. It follows the introductory framing of the joke and the narrative which sets up for the punch line.

In a broader sense, punch line can also refer to the unexpected and funny conclusion of any performance, situation or story.

== Etymology ==
{{weasel|section|date=March 2018}}
The origin of the term is unknown. Even though the comedic formula using the classic "set-up, premise, punch line" format was well-established in [[Vaudeville]] by the beginning of the 20th century, the actual term "punch line" is first documented in the 1920s; the Merriam-Webster dictionary pegs the first use in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punch%20line|title=Definition of PUNCH LINE|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people{{who|date=March 2018}} argue the term's origin is related to the British weekly magazine ''[[Punch_(magazine)|Punch]]''.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

M-Husler was the first person to come with a punch line in 1986.

== Linguistic analysis ==
A linguistic interpretation of the mechanics of the punch line response is posited by [[Victor Raskin]] in his [[Theories of humor#Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor|Script-based Semantic Theory of Humor]]. Humor is evoked when a trigger, contained in the punch line, causes the audience to abruptly shift its understanding of the story from the primary (or more obvious) interpretation to a secondary, opposing interpretation. "The punch line is the pivot on which the joke text turns as it signals the shift between the [semantic] scripts necessary to interpret [re-interpret] the joke text."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carrell|2008|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; To produce the humor in the verbal joke, the two interpretations (i.e. scripts) need to be both compatible with the joke text ''and'' opposite or incompatible with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Raskin|1985 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas R. Shultz, a psychologist, independently expands Raskin’s linguistic theory to include "two stages of incongruity: perception and resolution." He explains that "… incongruity alone is insufficient to account for the structure of humour. […] Within this framework, humour appreciation is conceptualized as a biphasic sequence involving first the discovery of incongruity followed by a resolution of the incongruity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Shultz|1976|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Carrell|2008|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resolution generates laughter.

=== Prosodic features ===
There are many folk theories of how people deliver punchlines, such as punchlines being [[Loudness|louder]] and of a higher [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] than the speech preceding it, and a dramatic pause before the punchline is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory settings, however, none of these changes are employed at a statistically significant level in the production of [[Joke|humorous narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the pitch and loudness of the punchline are comparable to those of the ending of any narrative, humorous or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Lucy|last2=Corduas|first2=Marcella|last3=Eisterhold|first3=Jodi|last4=Seifried|first4=Brenna|last5=Eggleston|first5=Alyson|title=Prosidic Markers of Saliency in Humorous Narratives|journal=Discourse Processes|date=November 2009|volume=46|issue=6|pages=517–540|doi=10.1080/01638530902959604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jokes without a punch line ===
In order to better elucidate the structure and function of the punch line it is useful to look at some joke forms which purposely remove or avoid the punch line in their narrative. [[Shaggy dog story|Shaggy dog stories]] are long-winded [[Anti-humor|anti-jokes]] in which the punch line is deliberately anti-climactic. The humor here lies in fooling the audience into expecting a typical joke with a punch line. Instead they listen and listen to nothing funny, and end up themselves as the butt of the joke.

Another type of anti-joke is the nonsense joke, defined as having "a surprising or incongruous punch line" which provides either no resolution at all, or only a partial, unsatisfactory resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ruch|2008|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is the [[no soap radio]] punch line. Here the anticipated resolution to the joke is absent and the audience becomes the butt of the joke.

== Jab lines ==

A joke contains a single story with a single punch line at the end. In the analysis of longer humorous texts, an expanded model is needed to map the [[Narratology|narratological structure]]. With this in mind, the [[Theories of humor#General Theory of Verbal Humor|General Theory of Verbal Humor]] (GTVH) was expanded to include longer humorous texts together with jokes, using the GTVH narrative structure to categorize them. A new term, "jab line", was introduced to designate humor within the body of a text, as opposed to the punch line, which is always placed at the end. The jab line is functionally identical to the punch line except it can be positioned anywhere within the text, not just at the end. "Jab and punch lines are semantically indistinguishable (…), but they differ at a narratological level."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Attardo|2008|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, "jab lines are humorous elements fully integrated in the narrative in which they appear (i.e. they do not disrupt the flow of the narrative, because they either are indispensable to the development of the 'plot' or of the text, or they are not antagonistic to it)".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Attardo|2001 |pages=82–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also https://books.google.com/books?id=ZT4MBxNnYA8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=jab+lines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WHo4ydQlYT&amp;sig=7Ma6QTiosOAL-YUqoDTwJI9Fd8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HDSbVeTqBNLWoATGxYDwDA&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jab%20lines&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the expanded narrative structure of the GTVH and this new terminology of jab lines, literature and humor researchers now have a single theoretical framework with which they can analyze and map any kind of verbal humor, including novels, short stories, TV sitcoms, plays, movies as well as jokes.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of this type of humor text analysis, see &gt;{{harv|Attardo|2008|page=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three part structure ==
Felicitous jokes are often formatted in a style called AAB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a joke is made up of a set of three, the first two of which share some common attribute, and the third represents a deviation from that attribute. Under these conditions, the third item in the set— the B— is the punchline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozin gives the following example as exemplifying this structure:

{{quote|
'''A''' Some men are about to be executed. The guard brings the first man forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" Suddenly the man yells, "Earthquake!" Everyone is startled and looks around. In all the confusion, the first man escapes.

'''A''' The guard brings the second man forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" Suddenly the man yells, "Tornado!" In the confusion, the second man escapes.

'''B''' By now the last man has it all figured out. The guard brings him forward, and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, "Ready! Aim!" and the last man yells, "Fire!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this theory, the punchline is always the deviation, and it does not matter how many instances of A occur for there to be a punchline. However, jokes following the AAB structure are consistently rated as being funnier than their AB or AAAB counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rozin|first1=Paul|last2=Rozin|first2=Alexander|last3=Appel|first3=Brian|last4=Wachtel|first4=Charles|title=Documenting and Explaining the common AAB pattern in music and humor: Establishing and breaking expectations|journal=Emotion|date=August 2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=349–355|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types are used to cut and form metal, initiate [[nuclear weapon]]s, penetrate [[armor]], and [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|"complete" wells]] in the [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas industry]].

A typical modern shaped charge, with a metal liner on the charge cavity, can penetrate armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10&amp;nbsp;CD and above&lt;ref&gt;https://www.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/06_98.3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://str.llnl.gov/str/pdfs/06_98.3.pdf|title=Shaped Charges Pierce the Toughest Targets|last=Post|first=Richard|date=June 1, 1998|website=|publisher=Science &amp; Technology Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been achieved. Contrary to a widespread misconception (possibly resulting from the acronym [[HEAT]]) the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the jet from a shaped charge does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2007/ARL-SR-150.pdf Introduction to Shaped Charges, Walters, Army Research Laboratory, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Munroe effect==
The Munroe or Neumann effect is the focusing of blast energy by a hollow or void cut on a surface of an explosive. The earliest mention of hollow charges occurred in 1792. [[Franz Xaver von Baader]] (1765–1841) was a German mining engineer at that time; in a mining journal, he advocated a conical space at the forward end of a blasting charge to increase the explosive's effect and thereby save powder.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Baader (March 1792) [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10704955_00275.html "Versuch einer Theorie der Sprengarbeit"] (Investigation of a theory of blasting), ''Bergmännisches Journal'' (Miners' Journal), vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 193–212.  Reprinted in:  Franz Hoffmann et al. ed.s, ''Franz von Baader's sämtliche Werke …'' [Franz von Baader's complete works …] (Leipzig (Germany):  Herrmann Bethmann, 1854), Part I, vol. 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vS4CAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 153–166.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea was adopted, for a time, in Norway and in the mines of the [[Harz]] mountains of Germany, although the only available explosive at the time was gunpowder, which is not a [[high explosive]] and hence incapable of producing the [[shock wave]] that the shaped-charge effect requires.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Kennedy, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA220095 ''History of the Shaped Charge Effect:  The First 100 Years''] (Los Alamos, New Mexico:  Los Alamos National Laboratory, 1990),  pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true hollow charge effect was achieved in 1883, by Max von Foerster (1845–1905),&lt;ref&gt;For a brief biography of [[:de:Max von Foerster|Max von Foerster]], see the German Wikipedia article on him.&lt;/ref&gt; chief of the nitrocellulose factory of Wolff &amp; Co. in [[Walsrode]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), pp. 5 and 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

By 1886, Gustav Bloem of [[Düsseldorf]], Germany had filed {{US patent|342423}} for hemispherical cavity metal detonators to concentrate the effect of the explosion in an axial direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|inventor=Gustav Bloem|number=342423|title=Shell for detonating caps|y=1886|m=05|d=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Munroe effect is named after [[Charles E. Munroe]], who discovered it in 1888.  As a civilian chemist working at the U.S. [[Naval Torpedo Station]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], he noticed that when a block of explosive [[guncotton]] with the manufacturer's name stamped into it was detonated next to a metal plate, the lettering was cut into the plate. Conversely, if letters were raised in relief above the surface of the explosive, then the letters on the plate would also be raised above its surface.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Although Munroe's discovery of the shaped charge was widely publicized in 1900 in ''Popular Science Monthly'', the importance of the tin can "liner" of the hollow charge remained unrecognized for another 44&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of that 1900 article was reprinted in the February 1945 issue of ''[[Popular Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AyEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PAA65&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "It makes steel flow like mud" ''Popular Science'', February 1945, pp. 65–69]&lt;/ref&gt; describing how shaped-charge warheads worked.  It was this article that at last revealed to the general public how the fabled ''[[Bazooka]]'' actually worked against armored vehicles during WWII.

In 1910, Egon Neumann of Germany discovered that a block of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], which would normally dent a steel plate, punched a hole through it if the explosive had a conical indentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Big Bang: A history of explosives | author = G.I.

However, it was not until 1932 that Franz Rudolf Thomanek, a student of physics at Vienna's ''Technische Hochschule'', conceived an anti-tank round that was based on the hollow charge effect.  When the Austrian government showed no interest in pursuing the idea, Thomanek moved to [[Technical University of Berlin|Berlin's ''Technische Hochschule'']], where he continued his studies under the ballistics expert Carl Julius Cranz.&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of Carl Julius Cranz (1858–1945), see:

*  [[:de:Carl Cranz|German Wikipedia: Carl Cranz]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There in 1935, he and Hellmuth von Huttern developed a prototype anti-tank round.  Although the weapon's performance proved disappointing, Thomanek continued his developmental work, collaborating with [[Hubert Schardin]] at the ''Waffeninstitut der Luftwaffe'' (Air Force Weapons Institute) in Braunschweig.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut W.

By 1937, Schardin believed that hollow-charge effects were due to the interactions of shock waves.  It was during the testing of this idea that, on February 4, 1938, Thomanek conceived the shaped-charge explosive (or ''Hohlladungs-Auskleidungseffekt'' (hollow-charge liner effect)).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1990), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  (It was Gustav Adolf Thomer who in 1938 first visualized, by flash radiography, the metallic jet produced by a shaped-charge explosion.&lt;ref&gt;See:

During World War II, shaped-charge munitions were developed by Germany ([[Panzerschreck]], [[Panzerfaust]], [[Panzerwurfmine]], [[Mistel]]), Britain ([[PIAT]], Beehive charge), the Soviet Union ([[RPG-43]], [[RPG-6]]), and the U.S. ([[bazooka]]).&lt;ref&gt;Donald R.

Tanks faced a serious vulnerability from a weapon that could be carried by an [[infantryman]] or aircraft.

One of the earliest uses of shaped charges was by German glider-borne troops against the Belgian [[Battle of Fort Eben-Emael|Fort Eben-Emael]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Col. James E.

Due to the lack of metal liner they shook the turrets but they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb on the turrets and smash the gun barrels.&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lucas|first1=James|title=Storming eagles : German airborne forces in World War Two|date=1988|publisher=Arms and Armour|location=London|isbn=9780853688792|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Modern military===
{{further|High explosive anti-tank warhead}}
The common term in military terminology for shaped charge [[warhead]]s is [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT). HEAT warheads are frequently used in [[anti-tank guided missile]]s, unguided [[rocket]]s, gun-fired projectiles (both spun and unspun&lt;!--needs def of terms or wikilink to ??--&gt;), [[rifle grenade]]s, [[land mine]]s, [[bomblet]]s, [[torpedo]]es, and various other weapons.

===Non-military===
In non-military applications shaped charges are used in [[building implosion|explosive demolition of buildings and structures]], in particular for cutting through metal piles, columns and beams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/parkersburg-belpre-bridge | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =Parkersburg-Belpre Bridge |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.controlled-demolition.com/500-wood-street-building | work= Controlled Demolition, Inc | title =500 Wood Street Building|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mondial-defence.com/2011/Products/RAZOR.html | work= Mondial Defence Systems | title =Semtex RAZOR |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for boring holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | title =An Overview of the Shaped Charge Concept | first =William | last =Walters | access-date =2011-08-27 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110819124915/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Shaped%20Charge%20Concept,%20An%20Overview%20-%20Walters.pdf | archive-date =2011-08-19 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[steelmaking]], small shaped charges are often used to pierce [[Tap (steelmaking)|taps]] that have become plugged with slag.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt; They are also used in quarrying, breaking up ice, breaking log jams, felling trees, and drilling post holes.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Shaped charges are used most extensively in the [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] industries, in particular in the [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion of oil and gas wells]], in which they are detonated to [[perforation (oil well)|perforate the metal casing]] of the well at intervals to admit the influx of oil and gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm |title=Shaped Charge |publisher=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 110715-N-KG738-278.jpg|thumb|right|A {{Convert|40|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} [[Composition B]] 'formed projectile' used by combat engineers. The shaped charge is used to bore a hole for a cratering charge.]]
A typical device consists of a solid cylinder of explosive with a metal-lined [[conical]] hollow in one end and a central [[detonator]], array of detonators, or [[detonation]] wave guide at the other end. Explosive energy is released directly away from ([[Normal (geometry)|normal to]]) the surface of an explosive, so shaping the explosive will concentrate the explosive energy in the void. If the hollow is properly shaped (usually conically), the enormous [[pressure]] generated by the detonation of the explosive drives the liner in the hollow cavity inward to collapse upon its central axis. The resulting collision forms and projects a high-velocity jet of metal particles forward along the axis. Most of the jet material originates from the innermost part of the liner, a layer of about 10% to 20% of the thickness. The rest of the liner forms a slower-moving slug of material, which, because of its appearance, is sometimes called a "carrot".

Because of the variation along the liner in its collapse velocity, the jet's velocity also varies along its length, decreasing from the front. This variation in jet velocity stretches it and eventually leads to its break-up into particles. Over time, the particles tend to fall out of alignment, which reduces the depth of penetration at long standoffs.

Also, at the apex of the cone, which forms the very front of the jet, the liner does not have time to be fully accelerated before it forms its part of the jet. This results in its small part of jet being projected at a lower velocity than jet formed later behind it. As a result, the initial parts of the jet coalesce to form a pronounced wider tip portion.

Most of the jet travels at [[hypersonic]] speed. The tip moves at 7 to 14&amp;nbsp;km/s, the jet tail at a lower velocity (1 to 3&amp;nbsp;km/s), and the slug at a still lower velocity (less than 1&amp;nbsp;km/s). The exact velocities depend on the charge's configuration and confinement, explosive type, materials used, and the explosive-initiation mode. At typical velocities, the penetration process generates such enormous pressures that it may be considered [[hydrodynamic]]; to a good approximation, the jet and armor may be treated as [[inviscid flow|inviscid]], [[compressible flow|compressible]] fluids (see, for example,&lt;ref&gt;[[Garrett Birkhoff|G. Birkhoff]], D.P. MacDougall, E.M. Pugh, and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G.I. Taylor]], "[https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1698173]," ''J. Appl. Phys.'', vol. 19, pp. 563–582, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;), with their material strengths ignored.

A recent technique using magnetic diffusion analysis showed that the temperature of the outer 50% by volume of a copper jet tip while in flight was between 1100K and 1200K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uhlig |first1=W. Casey |last2=Hummer |first2=Charles |title=In-flight conductivity and temperature measurements of hypervelocity projectiles |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2013 |volume=58 |pages=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; much closer to the melting point of copper (1358 K) than previously assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=William|title=Fundamentals of Shaped Charges|date=1998|publisher=CMCPress|location=Baltimore Maryland|isbn=0-471-62172-2|page=192|edition=softcover edition with corrections}}&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature is consistent with a hydrodynamic calculation that simulated the entire experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sable |first1=P. |title=Characterization In-Flight Temperature of Shaped Charge Penetrators in CTH |journal=Procedia Engineering |date=2017 |volume=204 |pages=375–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, two-color radiometry measurements from the late 1970s indicate lower temperatures for various shaped charge liner material, cone construction and type of explosive filler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Holle |first1=W.G. |last2=Trimble |first2=J.J. |title=Temperature Measurement of Copper and Eutectic Metal Shaped Charge Jets |journal=U.S. Army Ballistic Research Laboratory |date=1977 |issue=BRL-R-2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Comp-B loaded shaped charge with a copper liner and pointed cone apex had a jet tip temperature ranging from 668 K to 863 K over a five shot sampling. Octol-loaded charges with a rounded cone apex generally had higher surface temperatures with an average of 810 K, and the temperature of a tin-lead liner with Comp-B fill averaged 842 K. While the tin-lead jet was determined to be liquid, the copper jets are well below the melting point of copper. However, these temperatures are not completely consistent with evidence that soft recovered copper jet particles show signs of melting at the core while the outer portion remains solid and cannot be equated with bulk temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lassila |first1=D. H. |last2=Walters |first2=W. P. |title=Analysis of "Soft" Recovered Shaped Charge Jet Particles |date=1996 |issue=UCRL-JC-123850 |doi=10.2172/251380 |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:167531/metadc665285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the charge relative to its target is critical for optimum penetration for two reasons. If the charge is detonated too close there is not enough time for the jet to fully develop. But the jet disintegrates and disperses after a relatively short distance, usually well under two meters. At such standoffs, it breaks into particles which tend to tumble and drift off the axis of penetration, so that the successive particles tend to widen rather than deepen the hole. At very long standoffs, velocity is lost to [[air drag]], further degrading penetration.

The key to the effectiveness of the hollow charge is its diameter. As the penetration continues through the target, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic "fist to finger" action, where the size of the eventual "finger" is based on the size of the original "fist". In general, shaped charges can penetrate a steel plate as thick as 150% to 700%&lt;ref&gt;''Jane's Ammunition Handbook 1994'', pp. 140–141, addresses the reported ≈700 mm penetration of the Swedish 106 3A-HEAT-T and Austrian RAT 700 HEAT projectiles for the 106&amp;nbsp;mm M40A1 recoilless rifle.&lt;/ref&gt; of their diameter, depending on the charge quality. The figure is for basic steel plate, not for the [[composite armor]], [[reactive armor]], or other types of modern armor.

===Liner===
The most common shape of the liner is [[cone (geometry)|conical]], with an internal apex angle of 40 to 90 degrees. Different apex angles yield different distributions of jet mass and velocity. Small apex angles can result in jet [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcation]], or even in the failure of the jet to form at all; this is attributed to the collapse velocity being above a certain threshold, normally slightly higher than the liner material's bulk sound speed. Other widely used shapes include hemispheres, tulips, trumpets, [[ellipse]]s, and bi-conics; the various shapes yield jets with different velocity and mass distributions.

Liners have been made from many materials, including various metals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a278191.pdf|title=Shaped Charge Liner Materials: Resources, Processes, Properties, Costs, and Applications, 1991|author=|date=|website=dtic.mil|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and glass. The deepest penetrations are achieved with a dense, [[ductile]] metal, and a very common choice has been [[copper]]. For some modern anti-armor weapons, [[molybdenum]] and pseudo-alloys of [[copper-tungsten|tungsten filler and copper binder]] (9:1, thus density is ≈18&amp;nbsp;Mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) have been adopted. Nearly every common metallic element has been tried, including [[aluminum]], [[tungsten]], [[tantalum]], [[depleted uranium]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], [[zinc]], [[zirconium]], [[molybdenum]], [[beryllium]], [[nickel]], [[silver]], and even [[gold]] and [[platinum]]. The selection of the material depends on the target to be penetrated; for example, aluminum has been found advantageous for [[concrete]] targets.&lt;!--List of liner materials supplemented from Kennedy, 1983--&gt;

In early antitank weapons, copper was used as a liner material. Later, in the 1970s, it was found [[tantalum]] is superior to copper, due to its much higher [[density]] and very high ductility at high strain rates. Other high-density metals and alloys tend to have drawbacks in terms of price, toxicity, radioactivity, or lack of ductility.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Russell and Kok Loong Lee, ''Structure-Property Relations in Nonferrous Metals'' (Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 218].&lt;/ref&gt;

For the deepest penetrations, pure metals yield the best results, because they display the greatest ductility, which delays the breakup of the jet into particles as it stretches. In charges for [[oil well completion]], however, it is essential that a solid slug or "carrot" not be formed, since it would plug the hole just penetrated and interfere with the influx of oil. In the petroleum industry, therefore, liners are generally fabricated by [[powder metallurgy]], often of [[pseudo-alloy]]s which, if [[sintering|unsintered]], yield jets that are composed mainly of dispersed fine metal particles.

Unsintered [[Powder metallurgy#Powder compaction|cold pressed]] liners, however, are not waterproof and tend to be [[brittle]], which makes them easy to damage during handling. [[binary alloy|Bimetallic]] liners, usually zinc-lined copper, can be used; during jet formation the zinc layer vaporizes and a slug is not formed; the disadvantage is an increased cost and dependency of jet formation on the quality of bonding the two layers. Low-melting-point (below 500&amp;nbsp;°C) [[solder]]/[[braze]]-like alloys (e.g., Sn&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, Zn&lt;sub&gt;97.6&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;, or pure metals like lead, zinc or cadmium) can be used; these melt before reaching the well casing, and the molten metal does not obstruct the hole. Other alloys, binary [[eutectic]]s (e.g. Pb&lt;sub&gt;88.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;11.1&lt;/sub&gt;, Sn&lt;sub&gt;61.9&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;38.1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!-- Pb??? --&gt;, or Ag&lt;sub&gt;71.9&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;28.1&lt;/sub&gt;), form a metal-matrix composite material with ductile matrix with brittle [[dendrite (metal)|dendrites]]; such materials reduce slug formation but are difficult to shape.

A metal-matrix composite with discrete inclusions of low-melting material is another option; the inclusions either melt before the jet reaches the well casing, weakening the material, or serve as crack [[nucleation]] sites, and the slug breaks up on impact. The dispersion of the second phase can be achieved also with castable alloys (e.g., copper) with a low-melting-point metal insoluble in copper, such as bismuth, 1–5% lithium, or up to 50% (usually 15–30%) lead; the size of inclusions can be adjusted by thermal treatment. Non-homogeneous distribution of the inclusions can also be achieved. Other additives can modify the alloy properties; tin (4–8%), nickel (up to 30% and often together with tin), up to 8% aluminium, [[phosphorus]] (forming brittle phosphides) or 1–5% [[silicon]] form brittle inclusions serving as crack initiation sites. Up to 30% zinc can be added to lower the material cost and to form additional brittle phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5098487.html|title=Copper alloys for shaped charge liners - Olin Corporation|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxide glass liners produce jets of low density, therefore yielding less penetration depth. Double-layer liners, with one layer of a less dense but [[pyrophoric]] metal (e.g. [[aluminum]] or [[magnesium]]), can be used to enhance [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] effects following the armor-piercing action; [[explosive welding]] can be used for making those, as then the metal-metal interface is homogeneous, does not contain significant amount of [[intermetallics]], and does not have adverse effects to the formation of the jet.&lt;ref&gt;"Method of making a bimetallic shaped-charge liner" {{US patent|4807795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penetration depth is proportional to the maximum length of the jet, which is a product of the jet tip velocity and time to particulation. The jet tip velocity depends on bulk sound velocity in the liner material, the time to particulation is dependent on the ductility of the material. The maximum achievable jet velocity is roughly 2.34 times the sound velocity in the material.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Held. "[http://www.argospress.com/jbt/Volume4/4-3-1.pdf Liners for shaped charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707161507/http://www.argospress.com/jbt/Volume4/4-3-1.pdf |date=2011-07-07 }}", ''Journal of Battlefield Technology'', vol. 4, no. 3, November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed can reach 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, peaking some 40 microseconds after detonation; the cone tip is subjected to acceleration of about 25 million g. The jet tail reaches about 2–5&amp;nbsp;km/s. The pressure between the jet tip and the target can reach one terapascal. The immense pressure makes the metal flow like a liquid, though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid; one of the theories explaining this behavior proposes molten core and solid sheath of the jet. The best materials are [[face-centered cubic]] metals, as they are the most ductile, but even [[graphite]] and zero-ductility [[ceramic]] cones show significant penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Doig, "[http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf Some metallurgical aspects of shaped charge liners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724081452/http://knygos.sprogmenys.net/knygos-2/Explosives/Shaped%20Charges,%20Penetrators/Some_metalurgical_aspects_of_shaped_charge_liners.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}", ''Journal of Battlefield Technology'', vol. 1, no. 1, March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explosive charge===
For optimal penetration, a high explosive with a high detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is [[HMX]] (octogen), although never in its pure form, as it would be too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], with which it forms [[Octol]]. Other common high-performance explosives are [[RDX]]-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form [[Composition B]] and the [[Cyclotol]]s) or wax (Cyclonites). Some explosives incorporate powdered [[aluminum]] to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the very high-performance but sensitive explosive [[CL-20]] in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been in the form of the PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).

===Other features===
A 'waveshaper' is a body (typically a disc or cylindrical block) of an inert material (typically solid or foamed plastic, but sometimes metal, perhaps hollow) inserted within the explosive for the purpose of changing the path of the detonation wave. The effect is to modify the collapse of the cone and resulting jet formation, with the intent of increasing penetration performance. Waveshapers are often used to save space; a shorter charge with a waveshaper can achieve the same performance as a longer charge without a waveshaper.&lt;!--See U.S. Patent 2,809,585, Oct. 15, 1957--&gt;

Another useful design feature is ''sub-calibration'', the use of a liner having a smaller diameter (caliber) than the explosive charge. In an ordinary charge, the explosive near the base of the cone is so thin that it is unable to accelerate the adjacent liner to sufficient velocity to form an effective jet. In a sub-calibrated charge, this part of the device is effectively cut off, resulting in a shorter charge with the same performance.

==Defences==
During [[World War II]], the precision of the charge's construction and its detonation mode were both inferior to modern warheads. This lower precision caused the jet to curve and to break up at an earlier time and hence at a shorter distance. The resulting dispersion decreased the penetration depth for a given cone diameter and also shortened the optimum standoff distance. Since the charges were less effective at larger standoffs, [[spaced armour|side and turret skirts]] (known as ''Schürzen'') fitted to some German tanks to protect against ordinary [[anti-tank rifle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7rrMe15jhwC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=when+was+schurzen+introduced%3F%3F |title= Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf.G, H and J 1942–45 |author1=Hilary L. Doyle |author2=Thomas L. Jentz |author3=Tony Bryan  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were fortuitously found to give the jet room to disperse and hence also reduce HEAT penetration.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The use of add-on [[spaced armor]] skirts on armored vehicles may have the opposite effect and actually ''increase'' the penetration of some shaped charge warheads. Due to constraints in the length of the projectile/missile, the built-in stand-off on many warheads is less than the optimum distance. In such cases, the skirting effectively increases the distance between the armor and the target, and the warhead detonates closer to its optimum standoff.&lt;ref&gt;WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim (1999) - Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics 24 - Effectiveness Factors for Explosive Reactive Armour Systems - page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Skirting should not be confused with [[cage armor]] which is used to damage the fusing system of [[RPG-7]] projectiles. The armor works by deforming the inner and outer [[ogive]]s and shorting the firing circuit between the rocket's [[piezoelectric]] nose probe and rear [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] assembly. Cage armor can also cause the projectile to pitch up or down on impact, lengthening the penetration path for the shaped charge's penetration stream.  If the nose probe strikes one of the cage armor slats, the warhead will function as normal.

==Variants==
There are several different forms of shaped charge.

===Linear shaped charges===
[[File:LinearShapedCharge.png|thumb|upright|Linear shaped charge]]
A linear shaped charge (LSC) has a lining with V-shaped profile and varying length. The lining is surrounded with explosive, the explosive then encased within a suitable material that serves to protect the explosive and to confine (tamp) it on detonation. "At detonation, the focusing of the explosive high pressure wave as it becomes incident to the side wall causes the metal liner of the LSC to collapse–creating the cutting force."&lt;ref&gt;Accurate Energetic Systems LLC [http://www.aesys.biz/wp-content/uploads/14-102_liner-shaped-charge.pdf]" Linear Shape Charge&lt;/ref&gt;  The detonation projects into the lining, to form a continuous, knife-like (planar) jet. The jet cuts any material in its path, to a depth depending on the size and materials used in the charge. For the cutting of complex geometries, there are also flexible versions of the linear shaped charge, these with a lead or high-density foam sheathing and a ductile/flexible lining material, which also is often lead. LSCs are commonly used in the cutting of rolled steel joists (RSJ) and other structural targets, such as in the [[Building implosion|controlled demolition]] of buildings. LSCs are also used to separate the stages of [[multistage rocket]]s.

===Explosively formed penetrator===
{{Main|Explosively formed penetrator}}

[[File:explosively formed penetrator.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Formation of an EFP warhead. [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Research Laboratory]]

The explosively formed penetrator (EFP) is also known as the self-forging fragment (SFF), explosively formed projectile (EFP), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, and [[Misznay-Schardin effect|Misznay-Schardin]] (MS) charge. An EFP uses the action of the explosive's detonation wave (and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of its detonation products) to project and deform a plate or dish of ductile metal (such as copper, iron, or tantalum) into a compact high-velocity projectile, commonly called the slug. This slug is projected toward the target at about two kilometers per second. The chief advantage of the EFP over a conventional (e.g., conical) shaped charge is its effectiveness at very great standoffs, equal to hundreds of times the charge's diameter (perhaps a hundred meters for a practical device).

The EFP is relatively unaffected by first-generation [[reactive armor]] and can travel up to perhaps 1000 charge diameters (CD)s before its velocity becomes ineffective at penetrating armor due to aerodynamic drag, or successfully hitting the target becomes a problem. The impact of a ball or slug EFP normally causes a large-diameter but relatively shallow hole, of, at most, a couple of CDs. If the EFP perforates the armor, [[spalling]] and extensive behind armor effects (BAE, also called behind armor damage, BAD) will occur. The BAE is mainly caused by the high-temperature and high-velocity armor and slug fragments being injected into the interior space and the blast [[overpressure]] caused by this debris. More modern EFP warhead versions, through the use of advanced initiation modes, can also produce long-rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned rod/slug projectiles. The long-rods are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAE, multi-slugs are better at defeating light or area targets and the finned projectiles are much more accurate.

The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of main battle tanks (MBT) such as the top, belly and rear armored areas. It is well suited for the attack of other less heavily protected armored fighting vehicles (AFV) and in the breaching of material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs. Weapons using the EFP principle have already been used in combat; the "[[smart weapon|smart]]" submunitions in the [[CBU-97]] [[cluster bomb]] used by the US Air Force and Navy in the 2003 Iraq war employed this principle, and the US Army is reportedly experimenting with precision-guided [[artillery shell]]s under Project [[SADARM]] (Seek And Destroy ARMor). There are also various other projectile (BONUS, DM 642) and rocket submunitions (Motiv-3M, DM 642) and mines (MIFF, TMRP-6) that use EFP principle. Examples of EFP warheads are US patents 5038683&lt;ref&gt;Ernest L.Baker, Pai-Lien Lu, Brian Fuchs and Barry Fishburn(1991)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/High_explosive_assembly_for_projecting_h.pdf?id=2dkbAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U1uJ8lS6CfmjJo1JKILjvWDC9sCSg High explosive assembly for projecting high velocity long rods]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US6606951.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold S.Klein (2003) "[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Bounding_anti_tank_anti_vehicle_weapon.pdf?id=oOoMAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3WM4xBQ5f0d23uQdUeF1unjyGE9Q Bounding Anti-tank/Anti-vehicle weapon]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem warhead===
Some modern anti-tank rockets ([[RPG-27]], [[RPG-29]]) and missiles ([[BGM-71 TOW|TOW 2B]], [[ERYX]], [[Euromissile HOT|HOT]], [[MILAN]]) use a [[tandem warhead]] shaped charge, consisting of two separate shaped charges, one in front of the other, typically with some distance between them. TOW-2A was the first to use tandem warheads in the mid-1980s, an aspect of the weapon which the US Army had to reveal under news media and Congressional pressure resulting from the concern that NATO antitank missiles were ineffective against Soviet tanks that were fitted with the new [[Reactive armour|ERA boxes]].  The Army revealed that a 40&amp;nbsp;mm precursor shaped charge warhead was fitted on the tip of the TOW-2B collapsible probe.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman A. "ARMY ANTITANK CANDIDATES PROLIFERATE" Armed Forces Journal International/December 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the front charge is somewhat smaller than the rear one, as it is intended primarily to disrupt ERA boxes or tiles. Examples of tandem warheads are US patents 7363862&lt;ref&gt;Jason C.Gilliam and Darin L.Kielsmeier(2008)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Multi_purpose_single_initiated_tandem_wa.pdf?id=Nt-qAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U0l5gTdL-TqxXkvATTpIYTVLeAg2g Multi-purpose single initiated tandem warhead]"&lt;/ref&gt; and US 5561261.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Lindstadt and Manfred Klare(1996)"[http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Tandem_warhead_with_a_secondary_projecti.pdf?id=icslAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U3nqrCamThCu2bvHpqBNleeq4ssfQ Tandem warhead with a secondary projectile]"&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] antiarmor missile is one of the few that have accomplished the complex engineering feat of having two shaped charges of the same diameter stacked in one warhead.  Recently, a Russian arms firm revealed a 125mm tank cannon round with two same diameter shaped charges one behind the other, but with the back one offset so its penetration stream will not interfere with the front shaped charge's penetration stream.  The reasoning behind both the Hellfire and the Russian 125&amp;nbsp;mm munitions having tandem same diameter warheads is not to increase penetration, but to increase the [[beyond-armour effect|beyond-armor effect]].

===Voitenko compressor===
{{Main|Voitenko compressor}}
In 1964 a Russian scientist proposed that a shaped charge originally developed for piercing thick steel armor be adapted to the task of accelerating shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;Войтенко (Voitenko), А.Е. (1964) "Получение газовых струй большой скорости" (Obtaining high speed gas jets), ''Доклады Академии Наук СССР'' (Reports of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR), '''158''' : 1278-1280.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting device, looking a little like a wind tunnel, is called a Voitenko compressor.&lt;ref&gt;NASA, "[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-440/ch6-15.htm The Suicidal Wind Tunnel]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Voitenko compressor initially separates a test gas from a shaped charge with a malleable [[steel]] plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A 66-pound shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was 220,000 feet per second (67&amp;nbsp;km/s). The apparatus exposed to the detonation was completely destroyed, but not before useful data was extracted.&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSecurity"[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/bullets2-shaped-charge.htm Shaped Charge History]"&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates [[hydrogen]] gas which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosive Accelerators"[http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SPBI134.HTM Voitenko Implosion Gun]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.I.

===Nuclear shaped charges===
The proposed [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion nuclear propulsion]] system would have required the development of [[nuclear shaped charge]]s for reaction acceleration of spacecraft. Shaped charge effects driven by nuclear explosions have been discussed speculatively, but are not known to have been produced in fact.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gsponer (2008) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0510071v5 Fourth Generation Nuclear Weapons: Military Effectiveness and Collateral Effects]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, George, ''Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965'', p. 113. {{ISBN|0-14-027732-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, ''Project Orion'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the early nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Ted Taylor]] was quoted as saying, in the context of shaped charges, ''"A one-kiloton fission device, shaped properly, could make a hole ten feet in diameter a thousand feet into solid rock."''&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, John, ''The Curve of Binding Energy'', p.159 {{ISBN|0-374-51598-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a nuclear driven [[explosively formed penetrator]] was apparently proposed for terminal ballistic missile defense in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Explosively Produced Flechettes; JASON report 66-121, Institute for Defense Analysis, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Dr. Richard Blankenbecler http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5196.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biological classification]], '''taxonomic rank''' is the relative level of a group of organisms (a [[taxon]]) in a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[hierarchy]]. Examples of taxonomic ranks are [[species]], [[genus]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[phylum (biology)|phylum]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], etc.

A given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] or features from common ancestors. The rank of any ''species'' and the description of its ''genus'' is ''basic''; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art2 |at=Articles 2 and 3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a particular species, the [[red fox]], ''Vulpes vulpes'': the next rank above, the genus ''[[Vulpes]]'', comprises all the "true" foxes. Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank, the family [[Canidae]], which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher rank, the order [[Carnivora]], includes [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and [[Feliformia|feliforms]] (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class [[Mammalia]], which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum [[Chordata]], and with them among all animals in the kingdom [[Animalia]]. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing [[cell nuclei]] in the domain [[Eukarya]].

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' defines ''rank'' as: "The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a [[taxon]] in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily)."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Fourth Edition |publisher=International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |url=http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main ranks ==
In his landmark publications, such as the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', [[Carl Linnaeus]] used a ranking scale limited to: kingdom, class, order, genus, species, and one rank below species. Today, nomenclature is regulated by the [[nomenclature codes]]. There are seven main taxonomic ranks: kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus, species. In addition, ''domain'' (proposed by [[Carl Woese]]) is now widely used as a fundamental rank, although it is not mentioned in any of the nomenclature codes, and is a synonym for dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974.&lt;ref name=Moore1974&gt; {{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=R.

A taxon is usually assigned a rank when it is given its formal name. The basic ranks are species and genus. When an organism is given a species name it is assigned to a genus, and the genus name is part of the species name.

The species name is also called a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]], that is, a two-term name. For example, the zoological name for the human species is ''Homo sapiens''. This is usually italicized in print and underlined when italics are not available. In this case, ''Homo'' is the generic name and it is capitalized; ''sapiens'' indicates the species and it is not capitalized.

==Ranks in zoology==
There are definitions of the following taxonomic ranks in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]: superfamily, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, subgenus, species, subspecies.

The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature divides names into "family-group names", "genus-group names" and "species-group names". The Code explicitly mentions the following ranks for these categories:

----
:Superfamily

''[[Family (biology)|Family]]''
:[[Subfamily]]
:[[Tribe (biology)|Tribe]]
:[[Subtribe]]

----

''[[Genus]]''
:[[Subgenus]]

----
''[[Species]]''
:[[Subspecies]]

----

The rules in the Code apply to the ranks of superfamily to subspecies, and only to some extent to those above the rank of superfamily. Among "genus-group names" and "species-group names" no further ranks are officially allowed. Zoologists sometimes use additional terms such as ''species group'', ''species subgroup'', ''species complex'' and ''superspecies'' for convenience as extra, but unofficial, ranks between the subgenus and species levels in [[taxa]] with many species, e.g. the genus ''[[Drosophila]]''. (Note the potentially confusing use of "species group" as both a category of ranks as well as an unofficial rank itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}})

At higher ranks (family and above) a lower level may be denoted by adding the prefix "''infra''", meaning ''lower'', to the rank.  For example, ''infra''order (below suborder) or ''infra''family (below subfamily).

===Names of zoological taxa===
* A taxon above the rank of species has a scientific name in one part (a uninominal name).
* A species has a name composed of two parts (a binomial name or [[binomen]]): [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] + [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus''.
* A subspecies has a name composed of three parts (a trinomial name or [[trinomen]]): generic name + specific name + [[subspecific name]]; for example ''Canis lupus familiaris''. As there is only one possible rank below that of species, no connecting term to indicate rank is needed or used.

==Ranks in botany==
According to Art 3.1 of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) the most important ranks of taxa are: kingdom, division or phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. According to Art 4.1 the secondary ranks of taxa are tribe, section, series, variety and form. There is an indeterminate number of ranks. The ICN explicitly mentions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Articles 3 and 4 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----
'''''primary ranks'''''
:'''''secondary ranks'''''
::'''''further ranks'''''

----
'''''kingdom''''' (''regnum'')
::''subregnum''

'''''division''''' or '''phylum''' (''divisio'', ''phylum'')
::''subdivisio'' or ''subphylum''

'''''class''''' (''classis'')
::''subclassis''

'''''order''''' (''ordo'')
::''subordo''

----

::''subseries''

'''''species''''' (''species'')
::''subspecies''
:'''variety''' (''varietas'')
::''subvarietas''
:'''form''' (''forma'')
::''subforma''

----

There are definitions of the following taxonomic categories in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]: [[cultivar group]], [[cultivar]], [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]].

The rules in the ICN apply primarily to the ranks of family and below, and only to some extent to those above the rank of family. Also see [[descriptive botanical names]].

===Names of botanical taxa===&lt;!-- [[Nothotaxon]] redirects here --&gt;
Taxa at the rank of genus and above have a [[botanical name]] in one part (unitary name); those at the rank of species and above (but below genus) have a botanical name in two parts ([[binary name]]); all taxa below the rank of species have a botanical name in three parts (an [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]]). To indicate the rank of the infraspecific name, a "connecting term" is needed. Thus ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'', where "subsp." is an abbreviation for "subspecies", is the name of a subspecies of ''[[Poa secunda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art4 |at=Articles 4.2 and 24.1 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids can be specified either by a "hybrid formula" that specifies the parentage, or may be given a name. For hybrids receiving a [[hybrid name (botany)|hybrid name]], the same ranks apply, prefixed with ''notho'' (Greek: 'bastard'), with nothogenus as the highest permitted rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art3 |at=Article 3.2, and Appendix 1, Articles H.1–3 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants – Melbourne Code |date=2012 |website=IAPT-Taxon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outdated names for botanical ranks ====
If a different term for the rank was used in an old publication, but the intention is clear, botanical nomenclature specifies certain substitutions:{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* If names were "intended as names of orders, but published with their rank denoted by a term such as": "cohors" [Latin for "cohort";&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W.T. 1992. ''Botanical Latin: History, grammar, syntax, terminology and vocabulary, Fourth edition''. David and Charles.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cohort (taxonomy) redirects here, so...--&gt;see also [[cohort study]] for the use of the term in ecology], "nixus", "alliance", or "Reihe" instead of "order" (Article 17.2), they are treated as names of orders.
* "Family" is substituted for "order" (ordo) or "natural order" (ordo naturalis) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "order" was not intended. (Article 18.2)
* "Subfamily is substituted for "suborder" (subordo) under certain conditions where the modern meaning of "suborder" was not intended. (Article 19.2)
* In a publication prior to 1 January 1890, if only one infraspecific rank is used, it is considered to be that of variety. (Article 37.4) This commonly applies to publications that labelled infraspecific taxa with Greek letters, α, β, γ, ...

==Examples==
Classifications of five species follow: the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] familiar in genetics laboratories (''Drosophila melanogaster''), [[human]]s (''Homo sapiens''), the [[pea]]s used by [[Gregor Mendel]] in his discovery of [[genetics]] (''Pisum sativum''), the "fly agaric" mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', and the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. The eight major ranks are given in bold; a selection of minor ranks are given as well.

;Table notes:
*The ranks of higher taxa, especially intermediate ranks, are prone to revision as new information about relationships is discovered. For example, the [[flowering plant]]s have been downgraded from a division (Magnoliophyta) to a subclass (Magnoliidae), and the superorder has become the rank that distinguishes the major groups of flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Chase, M.W. |author2=Reveal, J.L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional classification of primates (class Mammalia—subclass Theria—infraclass Eutheria—order Primates) has been modified by new classifications such as McKenna and Bell (class Mammalia—subclass Theriformes—infraclass Holotheria) with Theria and Eutheria assigned lower ranks between infraclass and the order Primates. See [[mammal classification]] for a discussion. These differences arise because there are only a small number of ranks available and a large number of branching points in the fossil record.
*Within species further units may be recognised. Animals may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Homo sapiens sapiens'', modern humans) or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]]s (for example ''Corvus corax varius'' morpha ''leucophaeus'', the pied raven). Plants may be classified into subspecies (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' subsp. ''sativum'', the garden pea) or varieties (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'', snow pea), with cultivated plants getting a [[cultivar]] name (for example, ''Pisum sativum'' var. ''macrocarpon'' 'Snowbird'). Bacteria may be classified by [[strain (biology)|strains]] (for example [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]], a strain that can cause [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]).
*[[Mnemonic]]s are available at [http://www.mnemonic-device.eu/biology mnemonic-device.eu] and [http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/KPCOFGS thefreedictionary.com].

==Terminations of names==
[[Taxon|Taxa]] above the genus level are often given names based on the [[type genus]], with a standard termination. The terminations used in forming these names depend on the kingdom (and sometimes the phylum and class) as set out in the table below.

Pronunciations given are the [[Traditional English pronunciation of Latin|most Anglicized]]. More Latinate pronunciations are also common, particularly {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} rather than {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} for stressed ''a''.

;Table notes:
* In botany and mycology names at the rank of family and below are based on the name of a genus, sometimes called the [[type genus]] of that taxon, with a standard ending. For example, the rose family, [[Rosaceae]], is named after the genus ''Rosa'', with the standard ending "-aceae" for a family. Names above the rank of family are also formed from a generic name, or are descriptive (like [[Gymnosperm]]ae or [[Fungus|Fungi]]).
* For animals, there are standard suffixes for taxa only up to the rank of superfamily.&lt;ref&gt;ICZN article 29.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Forming a name based on a generic name may be not straightforward. For example, the [[Latin]] ''homo'' has the genitive ''hominis'', thus the genus ''Homo'' (human) is in the [[Great ape|Hominidae]], not "Homidae".
* The ranks of epifamily, infrafamily and infratribe (in animals) are used where the complexities of phyletic branching require finer-than-usual distinctions. Although they fall below the rank of superfamily, they are not regulated under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and hence do not have formal standard endings. The suffixes listed here are regular, but informal.&lt;ref&gt;As supplied by Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many animal orders have the informal suffix ''-ida'' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|d|ə}}, e.g. [[Hyolithida]] and [[Naraoiida|Nectaspida (Naraoiida)]]

==All ranks== 
There is an indeterminate number of ranks, as a taxonomist may invent a new rank at will, at any time, if they feel this is necessary. In doing so, there are some restrictions, which will vary with the [[Nomenclature codes|nomenclature code]] which applies.

The following is an artificial synthesis, solely for purposes of demonstration of relative rank (but see notes), from most general to most specific:&lt;ref&gt;For the general usage and coordination of zoological ranks between the phylum and family levels, including many intercalary ranks, see Carroll (1988). For additional intercalary ranks in zoology, see especially Gaffney &amp; Meylan (1988); McKenna &amp; Bell (1997); Milner (1988); Novacek (1986, cit. in Carroll 1988: 499, 629); and [[Paul Sereno]]'s 1986 classification of [[ornithischia]]n dinosaurs as reported in Lambert (1990: 149, 159). For botanical ranks, including many intercalary ranks, see Willis &amp; McElwain (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cohort has also been used between infraorder and family in [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs ([http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/benton/vertclass.html Benton] 2005). In botanical classification, the cohort group has sometimes been inserted between the division (phylum) group and the class group: see Willis &amp; McElwain (2002: 100–101), or has sometimes been used at the rank of order, and is now considered to be an obsolete name for order: See International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, Melbourne Code 2012, Article 17.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear from the sources how these two sequences are to be coordinated (or interwoven) within a unitary zoological hierarchy of ranks. Previously, Novacek (1986) and McKenna-Bell (1997) had inserted mirorders and grandorders between the order and superorder, but Benton (2005) now positions both of these ranks above the superorder.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance and problems ==
Ranks are assigned based on subjective dissimilarity, and do not fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists.&lt;ref name="Gingerich1987"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gingerich | first1 = P. D. | doi = 10.1139/z87-169 | title = Evolution and the fossil record: patterns, rates, and processes | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1060 | year = 1987 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some groups have many described species not because they are more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Of these many ranks, the most basic is species. However, this is not to say that a taxon at any other rank may not be sharply defined, or that any species is guaranteed to be sharply defined. It varies from case to case. Ideally, a taxon is intended to represent a [[clade]], that is, the [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] of the organisms under discussion, but this is not a requirement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Classification, in which all taxa have formal ranks, cannot adequately reflect knowledge about phylogeny; at the same time, if taxon names are dependent on ranks, rank-free taxa can't be supplied with names. This problem is dissolved in cladoendesis, where the specially elaborated rank-free nomenclatures are used.&lt;ref&gt;Kluge N.J. 1999. A system of alternative nomenclatures of supra-species taxa. Linnaean and post-Linnaean principles of systematics. // Entomological Review 79(2): 133-147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kluge N.J. 2010. Circumscriptional names of higher taxa in Hexapoda. // Bionomina 1: 15–55&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no rules for how many species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a category above the species level).&lt;ref&gt;Stuessy, T.F. (2009). ''Plant Taxonomy: The Systematic Evaluation of Comparative Data.'' 2nd ed. Columbia University Press, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brusca"&gt;Brusca, R.C. &amp; Brusca, G.J. (2003). ''Invertebrates''. 2nd ed. Sunderland, Massachusetts: Sinauer Associates, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-[[polyphyletic]]), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks).&lt;ref name="Brusca" /&gt; For animals, at least the [[phylum]] rank is usually associated with a certain [[body plan]], which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">The '''Department of Applied Science at the University of California, Davis''' was a cooperative academic program involving the [[University of California, Davis]] and the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). It was established in the fall of 1963 by [[Edward Teller]], director of LLNL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial champion for defense, nuclear research Edward Teller dies|publisher=UC Davis Dateline|date=September 19, 2003|url=http://www-dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id=6668|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roy Bainer, then dean of the [[UC Davis College of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="Bookless1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

==History==
Teller's push for an educational institution associated with the LLNL was part of a general movement championed by [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] to use the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories]] to educate scientists, since at the time the department employed roughly 10% of the scientists in the United States.&lt;ref name=westwick/&gt;  Teller first approached the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with his idea,&lt;ref name=state/&gt; but the faculty there opposed the idea because of the military focus of the program and the administration wasn't receptive. So he turned, reluctantly,&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Teller|author2=Judith L. Shoolery|title=Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey in Science and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n82xMo-BI8QC&amp;pg=PA479|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=16 October 2002|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5170-9|pages=479–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; to UC Davis instead.  There Bainer and [[Emil M. Mrak]], then [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of UCD, were more receptive to Teller's plan,&lt;ref name=kerr&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark Kerr|title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949-1967|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&amp;pg=PA304|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=1 September 2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22367-7|page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some faculty of the College of Engineering were unhappy with the idea of outsiders teaching their students.&lt;ref name=memoir/&gt;

The lab at first shared the facilities at Lawrence Livermore, although the students conducted non-classified research.&lt;ref name=westwick&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Westwick|title=The National Labs: Science in an American System, 1947-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpXQtHWGghcC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=10 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00948-6|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teller intended the DAS to educate advanced students in nuclear physics and other subjects applicable to defense industries.&lt;ref name=teller/&gt;  The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], which administered LLNL,  was worried about allowing DAS to use its facilities if foreign students would be enrolled.  To meet this objection Teller agreed to limit the number of foreign students attending and to require prospective students to undergo [[FBI]] background checks.&lt;ref name=westwick/&gt;

Teller, who had been director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory beginning in 1958, was named the first chairman of the Department of Applied Science.&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hargittai|title=Judging Edward Teller: A Closer Look at One of the Most Influential Scientists of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlkmmIHiS9UC&amp;pg=PT273|accessdate=11 January 2013|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-269-8|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main location, built in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=%28%2013D8CA13EFC95A48%20%29&amp;p_docid=13D8CA13EFC95A48&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=13D8CA13EFC95A48&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=F60E56PUMTM1NzkxNjk1NS4yNzE3NDk6MToxMzoxOTIuMTYwLjIxNi4w&amp;&amp;p_multi=DVEB|publisher=Davis Enterprise|author=Derrick Bang|date=March 15, 2012|title=UCD College of Engineering celebrates 50 years|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was on the grounds of the LLNL in a building paid for with a matching grant of $1,000,000 from the [[Hertz Foundation]] and thus called Hertz Hall.&lt;ref name="Broad1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=William J Broad|title=Star Warriors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMmCmxmWSJYC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=15 October 1986|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-62820-8|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Applied Science later became more centered at the UC Davis campus.  Many of the department's faculty had joint appointments with LLNL or other national laboratories, so that students in the department had access to facilities in both locations.

The UC Davis College of Engineering closed the Department of Applied Science in July 2011 for budgetary reasons after 48 years of operation.&lt;ref name = "closed"&gt;{{cite news|title=UCD department shuttered as more budget cuts loom|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ucd/ucd-department-shuttered-as-more-budget-cuts-loom/|publisher=Davis Enterprise|date=July 2, 2011|author=Cory Golden|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Web design''' encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; [[interface design]]; authoring, including standardised code and [[proprietary software]]; [[user experience design]]; and [[search engine optimization]]. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.&lt;ref name="different jobs" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps [[web engineering]] in the broader scope of [[web development]]. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of [[Web usability|usability]] and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with [[web accessibility]] guidelines.

==History==
[[File:WebDesignBooks.JPG|thumb|Web design books in a store]]

===1988–2001===
Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, and music.

====The start of the web and web design====
In 1989, whilst working at [[CERN]] [[Tim Berners-Lee]] proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the [[World Wide Web]]. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.&lt;ref name="World Wide Web" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Longer Biography
  |url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Longer.html
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 [[Marc Andreessen]] and [[Eric Bina]], created the [[Mosaic browser]]. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Mosaic Browser
  |url=http://www.techopedia.com/images/pdfs/history-of-the-internet.pdf
  |accessdate=2012-03-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[W3C]] was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |isbn=1-56592-871-7
  |page=804
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp. that later became known as [[Netscape Communications]], the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the [[browser wars]] began, as [[Microsoft]] and [[Netscape]] fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably [[Cascading Style Sheets]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Dynamic HTML]]. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.&lt;ref name=Browsers &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolution of web design ====
In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique.&lt;ref name=Browsers/&gt;  The [[HTML markup]] for [[HTML element#Tables|tables]] was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and [[web accessibility]]. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank [[spacer .GIF]] images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" &gt;{{citation |last=Chapman  |first=Cameron  |title=The Evolution of Web Design  |url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/|publisher=Six Revisions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030030802/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/ |archivedate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CSS]] was introduced in December 1996 by the [[W3C]] to support presentation and layout. This allowed [[HTML]] code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see [[tableless web design]].

In 1996, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to [[ActionScript]], and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, [[Graphics Interchange Format#Animated GIF|animated GIFs]] and [[JavaScript]]. However, because Flash required a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using [[motion graphics]] altogether) and JavaScript for [[software widget|widgets]]. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Evolution" /&gt;

====End of the first browser wars====
During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an [[Open-source license|open source licence]], enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  The [[Web Standards Project]] was formed and promoted browser compliance with [[Comparison of layout engines (HTML)|HTML]] and [[Comparison of layout engines (Cascading Style Sheets)|CSS]] standards by creating [[Acid1]], [[Acid2]], and [[Acid3]] tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image format.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;  During this time Netscape was sold to [[AOL]] and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.&lt;ref name="Browsers"/&gt;

===2001–2012===
Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.

Since the end of the [[Browser wars|browsers wars]]{{when|date=May 2016}} new browsers have been released. Many of these are [[open-source software|open source]] meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are considered by many{{Weasel inline|date=May 2016}} to be better than Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]].

The [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] has released new standards for HTML ([[HTML5]]) and CSS ([[CSS3]]), as well as new [[JavaScript]] [[Application programming interface|API's]], each as a new but individual standard.{{when|date=May 2016}} While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and ''some'' of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).

== Tools and technologies ==
Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both [[Vector graphics editor|vector]] and [[Raster graphics editor|raster]] graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by [[Website builder|WYSIWYG editing software]]. Other tools web designers might use include mark up [[HTML validator|validators]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator"&gt;{{cite web|title=W3C Markup Validation Service|url=http://validator.w3.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skills and techniques ==

=== Marketing and communication design ===
Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) [[business-to-business]] website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a [[retail]] or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of [[web navigation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=THORLACIUS|first=LISBETH|title=The Role of Aesthetics in Web Design|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2007|issue=28|pages=63–76|url=http://www.nordicom.gu.se/en/tidskrifter/nordicom-review-12007/role-aesthetics-web-design|accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.

=== User experience design and interactive design ===
User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works. This is part of the [[user experience design]]. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the [[interactive design]] of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less [[usability|user-friendly]] website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castañeda|first=J.A Francisco |last2=Muñoz-Leiva|first2=Teodoro Luque|title=Web Acceptance Model (WAM): Moderating effects of user experience|journal=Information &amp; Management |year=2007 |volume=44 |pages=384–396|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the [[user interface design]].

Advanced interactive functions may require [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.

=== Page layout ===
Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the [[page layout]].  For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout.  Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of [[aesthetics]] on larger screens.

'''Fluid layouts''' increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and [[Grid (page layout)|grid-based design]] in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-based markup and [[spacer .GIF]] images&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to considerations of [[Screen reader|screen reading devices]] and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, [[Web banner|embedded advertising]] areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below [[body text]] rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.

[[Responsive Web Design]] is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS &lt;code&gt;@media&lt;/code&gt; rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html|title=Rolling out mobile-first indexing|work=Official Google Webmaster Central Blog|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.

===Typography===
Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of [[typeface]]s or [[Typeface#Style of typefaces|type styles]]. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.

Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in [[web typography]], as well as the usage of font downloading.

Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=John|title=20 Do’s and Don’ts of Effective Web Typography| url=http://webdesignledger.com/tips/20-dos-and-donts-of-effective-web-typography|accessdate=2012-03-19|date=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion graphics===
The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, [[motion graphic design]] may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.

Motion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html World Wide Web Consortium: Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality of code ===
Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called [[tag soup]]. [[W3C Markup Validation Service|Validating via W3C]]&lt;ref name="W3C_validator" /&gt; can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C QA|title=My Web site is standard! And yours?| url=http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generated content ===
There are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.

==== Static websites ====
{{Main|Static web page}}
A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as [[Jekyll (software)|Jekyll]] and [[Adobe Muse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and [[virtual machine|virtual server]]s offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.

Almost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.

==== Dynamic websites ====
{{Main|Dynamic web page}}
Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use a [[document database]] such as [[MongoDB]] or [[NoSQL]] to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.

In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or [[website wireframe|wireframe]]d using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.

When dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]] or [[Active Server Pages|ASP]]. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.

Both of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as [[content management system]]s.  These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such as a time-sequenced [[blog]], a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.

Editing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is [[Wikipedia]].

==Homepage design==
Usability experts, including [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php|first=Kyle|last=Soucy|archivedate=8 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608071219/http://www.usableinterface.com/articles/homepage.php |title=Is Your Homepage Doing What It Should?|publisher=Usable Interface}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nielsen|Tahir|2001}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/|title=The Ten Most Violated Homepage Design Guidelines|date=10 November 2003|first=Jakob|last=Nielsen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005150112/http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/ |archivedate=5 October 2013|publisher=Nielsen Norman Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821151637/http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/essential-tips-for-designing-an-effective-homepage/ |archivedate=21 August 2013|date=20 August 2009|first=Kayla|last=Knight|publisher=Six Revisions|title=Essential Tips for Designing an Effective Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/|publisher=User Interface Engineering|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=29 September 2005|archivedate=16 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916092857/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2005/09/29/is-home-page-design-relevant-anymore/ |title=Is Home Page Design Relevant Anymore?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=10 Usability Tips Based on Research Studies|url=http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/|first=Cameron|last=Chapman|date=15 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902031226/http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/10-usability-tips-based-on-research-studies/ |archivedate=2 September 2013|publisher=Six Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page|title=Myth #17: The homepage is your most important page|first=Zoltán|last=Gócza|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602172028/http://uxmyths.com/post/717779908/myth-the-homepage-is-your-most-important-page |archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524221238/http://giraffeforum.com/wordpress/2010/04/18/the-decline-of-the-homepage/ |archivedate=24 May 2013|title=The decline of the homepage|first=Gerry|last=McGovern|date=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prioritizing Design Time: A Long Tail Approach|first=Joshua|last=Porter|date=24 April 2006|publisher=User Interface Engineering|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514075119/http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/ |archivedate=14 May 2013|url=http://www.uie.com/articles/prioritizing_design_time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429113949/http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/08/06/usability-tools-podcast-home-page-design/ |archivedate=29 April 2013|first=Jared|last=Spool|date=6 August 2007|title=Usability Tools Podcast: Home Page Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best practices in carousel design for effective web marketing|first=Chris|last=Bates|date=9 October 2012|publisher=Smart Insights|url=http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403013507/http://www.smartinsights.com/conversion-optimisation/home-page-optimisation/carousels-design-best-practice/ |archivedate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Messner2013&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |title=Image Carousels: Getting Control of the Merry-Go-Round|first=Katie|last=Messner|publisher=Usability.gov|date=22 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010094459/http://www.usability.gov/get-involved/blog/2013/04/image-carousels.html |archivedate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website's search engine optimisation and usability.&lt;ref name=Messner2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496|archivedate=22 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031942/http://searchengineland.com/homepage-sliders-are-bad-for-seo-usability-163496 |title=Homepage Sliders: Bad For SEO, Bad For Usability|first=Harrison|last=Jones|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/|title=Don’t Use Automatic Image Sliders or Carousels, Ignore the Fad|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125013642/http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/ |archivedate=25 November 2013|first=Peep|last=Laja|date=27 September 2012|publisher=ConversionXL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and [[web developer]], who often work closely together on a website.&lt;ref name ="careersinwebdesign"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oleksy|first=Walter|title=Careers in Web Design| year=2001|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9780823931910 |pages=9–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OJSA5wS7kQC&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of [[markup language]]s such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.  Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Designer|url=http://www.myjobsearch.com/careers/web-designer.html|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include:  
*[[Graphic designers]] to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts and buttons
*Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet
*SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines
*Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of the site&lt;ref name="different jobs" /&gt;
*User experience [[User experience design|(UX) designer]] incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which include information architecture, user centered design, user testing, interaction design, and occasionally visual design.
