'''Academic authorship''' of [[academic journal|journal]] [[manuscript|articles]], books, and other original works is a means by which [[academia|academics]] communicate the results of their [[list of academic disciplines|scholarly work]], establish [[scientific priority|priority]] for their discoveries, and build their reputation among their peers.

Authorship is a primary basis that employers use to evaluate academic personnel for employment, promotion, and [[tenure]]. In [[academic publishing]], authorship of a work is claimed by those making intellectual contributions to the completion of the [[research]] described in the work. In simple cases, a solitary scholar carries out a research project and writes the subsequent article or book. In many [[list of academic disciplines|disciplines]], however, [[collaboration]] is the norm and issues of authorship can be controversial. In these contexts, authorship can encompass activities other than writing the article; a researcher who comes up with an experimental design and analyzes the data may be considered an author, even if she or he had little role in composing the text describing the results. According to some standards, even writing the entire article would not constitute authorship unless the writer was also involved in at least one other phase of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dickson |year= 1978 | journal=Wildl. Soc. Bull. |volume= 6 | first1=J. G.| issue=4 |pages= 260–261 | last2=Conner | jstor=3781489 | first2=R. N. | last3=Adair | first3=K. T. | title=Guidelines for Authorship of Scientific Articles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Guidelines for assigning authorship vary between [[institution]]s and disciplines. They may be formally defined or simply cultural custom. Incorrect application of authorship rules occasionally leads to charges of [[academic dishonesty|academic misconduct]] and sanctions for the violator. A 2002&lt;!--published in 2005--&gt; survey of a large sample of researchers who had received funding from the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] revealed that 10% of respondents claimed to have inappropriately assigned authorship credit within the last three years.&lt;ref name=Martinson2005&gt;{{Cite journal

| issue = 7043
| bibcode = 2005Natur.435..737M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first large scale survey concerning such issues. In other fields only limited or no empirical data is available.

===Authorship in the natural sciences===
The natural sciences have no universal standard for authorship, but some major multi-disciplinary [[academic journal|journals]] and institutions have established guidelines for work that they publish. The journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' (''PNAS'') has an editorial policy that specifies "authorship should be limited to those who have contributed substantially to the work" and furthermore, "authors are strongly encouraged to indicate their specific contributions" as a [[footnote]]. The [[American Chemical Society]] further specifies that authors are those who also "share responsibility and accountability for the results"&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/ethics/ethics.pdf Editors of the Publications Division of the American Chemical Society. 2006. Ethical Guidelines to Publication of Chemical Research.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2018}} and the U.S. [[United States National Academies|National Academies]] specify "an author who is willing to take credit for a paper must also bear responsibility for its contents. Thus, unless a footnote or the text of the paper explicitly assigns responsibility for different parts of the paper to different authors, the authors whose names appear on a paper must share responsibility for all of it."&lt;ref name="National"/&gt;

===Authorship in mathematics, theoretical computer science and high energy physics===
In mathematics, the authors are usually listed in alphabetical order (this is the so-called Hardy-Littlewood Rule). This usage is described in the "Information Statements on the Culture of Research and Scholarship in Mathematics" section of the [[American Mathematical Society]] website,&lt;ref name="ams culture"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/committees/cprof-home#culture|title = Information Statements|website =  Committee on the Profession|publisher = American Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically the 2004 statement: ''[http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf Joint Research and Its Publication]''.

In other branches of knowledge such as economics, business, finance or [[particle physics]], it is also usual to sort the authors alphabetically.&lt;ref name="author listing"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waltman | first1 = L | year = 2012 | title = An empirical analysis of the use  of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing | url = | journal = Journal of Informetrics | volume = 4 | issue = 6| pages = 700–711 | doi = 10.1016/j.joi.2012.07.008 | arxiv = 1206.4863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in medicine===
The medical field defines authorship very narrowly. According to the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]], designation as an author must satisfy four conditions. The author must have:
# Contributed substantially to the conception and design of the study, the acquisition of data, or the analysis and interpretation
# Drafted or provided critical revision of the article
# Provided final approval of the version to publish
# Agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved

Acquisition of funding, or general supervision of the research group alone does not constitute authorship. Many authors - especially those in the middle of the byline - do not fulfill these authorship criteria.&lt;ref name="advances.sciencemag.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauermann|first1=Henry|last2=Haeussler|first2=Carolin|title=Authorship and contribution disclosures|journal=Science Advances|volume=3|issue=11|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/11/e1700404.full|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1700404|year=2017|page=e1700404|bibcode=2017SciA....3E0404S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical journals have abandoned the strict notion of author, with the flexible notion of ''contributor''.&lt;ref name=Rennie1997&gt;{{Cite journal

| pages = 579–85
| doi = 10.1001/jama.278.7.579
| pmid = 9268280
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between about 1980-2010 the average number of authors in medical papers increased, and perhaps tripled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsao|first1=CI|last2=Roberts|first2=LW|title=Authorship in scholarly manuscripts: practical considerations for resident and early career physicians.|journal=Academic Psychiatry |date= |volume=33|issue=1|pages=76–9|pmid=19349451|doi=10.1176/appi.ap.33.1.76|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorship in the social sciences===
The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) has similar guidelines as medicine for authorship. The APA acknowledge that authorship is not limited to the writing of manuscripts, but must include those who have made substantial contributions to a study such as "formulating the problem or hypothesis, structuring the experimental design, organizing and conducting the statistical analysis, interpreting the results, or writing a major portion of the paper".&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association. (2001). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (5th ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; While the APA guidelines list many other forms of contributions to a study that do not constitute authorship, it does state that combinations of these and other tasks may justify authorship. Like medicine, the APA considers institutional position, such as Department Chair, insufficient for attributing authorship.

===Authorship in the humanities===
Neither the Modern Languages Association&lt;ref&gt;Gibaldi, J. (1998). ''MLA style manual and guide to scholarly publishing'' (2nd ed.). New York: Modern Language Association of America.&lt;/ref&gt; nor the Chicago Manual of Style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]|edition = 15th|date =2006|location = Chicago|publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn =  978-0226104041}}&lt;/ref&gt; define requirements for authorship (because usually humanities works are single-authored and the author is responsible for the entire work).

==Growing number of authors per paper==
From the late 17th century to the 1920s, sole authorship was the norm, and the one-paper-one-author model worked well for distributing credit.&lt;ref name="Greene2007"/&gt; Today, shared authorship is common in most academic disciplines, with the exception of the humanities, where sole authorship is still the predominant model. In particular types of research, including particle physics, genome sequencing and clinical trials, a paper's author list can run into the hundreds. In 1998, the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab]] (CDF) adopted a (at that time) highly unorthodox policy for assigning authorship. CDF maintains a ''standard author list''. All scientists and engineers working at CDF are added to the standard author list after one year of full-time work; names stay on the list until one year after the worker leaves CDF. Every publication coming out of CDF uses the entire standard author list, in alphabetical order. Other big collaborations, including most particle physics experiments, followed this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/newsletter/2012/201207/multiauthor_papers/|title=Multiauthor Papers: Onward and Upward|author=Christopher King|date=July 2012|accessdate=6 December 2017|work = ScienceWatch Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large, multi-center clinical trials authorship is often used as a reward for recruiting patients.&lt;ref name="Regalado1995"/&gt;

A paper published in the [[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]] in 1993 reported on a clinical trial conducted in 1,081 hospitals in 15 different countries, involving a total of 41,021 patients. There were 972 authors listed in an appendix and authorship was assigned to a group.&lt;ref name="Investigators1993"/&gt; In 2015, an article in high-energy physics was published describing the measurement of the mass of the [[Higgs boson]] based on collisions in the [[Large Hadron Collider]]; the article boasted 5,154 authors, the printed author list needed 24 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/news/physics-paper-sets-record-with-more-than-5-000-authors-1.17567|title=Physics paper sets record with more than 5,000 authors|author=Davide Castelvecchi|date=15 May 2015|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large authors lists have attracted some criticism. They strain guidelines that insist that each author's role be described and that each author is responsible for the validity of the whole work. Such a system treats authorship more as ''credit'' for scientific service at the facility in general rather that as an identification of specific contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, M. Rights or rewards? Changing frameworks of scientific authorship. In ''Scientific Authorship'', Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 253–280.&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator wrote, "In more than 25 years working as a scientific editor ... I have not been aware of any valid argument for more than three authors per paper, although I recognize that this may not be true for every field."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/37855 | pmid = 9288957 | year = 1997 | last1 = Van Loon | first1 = A. J. | title = Pseudo-authorship | journal = Nature | volume = 389 | issue = 6646 | pages = 11 |bibcode = 1997Natur.389...11V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of shared authorship has been attributed to [[Big Science]]—scientific experiments that require collaboration and specialization of many individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Price|first= Derek John de Solla |date = 1986|chapter = Collaboration in an Invisible College|title = Little science, big science...and beyond |pages = 119–134|location= New York|publisher = Columbia University Press|url = http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/Little_science_big_science_and_beyond.pdf |isbn = 0-231-04956-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the increase in multi-authorship might be a consequence of the way scientists are evaluated. Traditionally, scientists were judged by the number of papers they published, and later by the impact of those papers. The former is an estimate of quantity and the latter of quality. Both methods were adequate when single authorship was the norm, but vastly inflate individual contribution when papers are multi-authored. When each author claims each paper and each citation as his/her own, papers and citations are magically multiplied by the number of authors. Furthermore, there is no cost to giving authorship to individuals who made only minor contribution and, actually, there is an incentive to do so. Hence, the system rewards heavily multi-authored papers. This problem is openly acknowledged, and it could easily be "corrected" by dividing each paper and its citations by the number of authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Põder E | year = 2010 | title = Let's correct that small mistake | url = | journal = J. Am. Soc. Inform. Sci. Tech | volume = 61 | issue = 12| pages = 2593–2594 | doi = 10.1002/asi.21438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lozano | first1 = G. A. | year = 2013 | title = The elephant in the room: multi-authorship and the assessment of individual researchers | url = | journal = Current Science | volume = 105 | issue = 4| pages = 443–445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the rise in shared authorship may also reflect increased acknowledgment of the contributions of lower level workers, including graduate students and technicians, as well as honorary authorship, while allowing for such collaborations to make an independent statement about the quality and integrity of a scientific work.

==Honorary authorship==
''Honorary authorship'' is sometimes granted to those who played no significant role in the work, for a variety of reasons. Until recently, it was standard to list the head of a German department or institution as an author on a paper regardless of input.&lt;ref name="Pearson, H 2006"/&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], however, warns that such practices "dilute the credit due the people who actually did the work, inflate the credentials of those so 'honored,' and make the proper attribution of credit more difficult."&lt;ref name=National/&gt; The extent to which honorary authorship still occurs is not empirically known. However, it is plausible to expect that it is still widespread, because senior scientists leading large research groups can receive much of their reputation from a long publication list and thus have little motivation to give up honorary authorships.

A possible measure against honorary authorships has been implemented by some scientific journals, in particular by the ''Nature'' journals. They demand&lt;ref name="NaturePolicies"/&gt; that each new manuscript must include a statement of responsibility that specifies the contribution of every author. The level of detail varies between the disciplines. Senior persons may still make some vague claim to have "supervised the project", for example, even if they were only in the formal position of a supervisor without having delivered concrete contributions. (The truth content of such statements is usually not checked by independent persons.) However, the need to describe contributions can at least be expected to somewhat reduce honorary authorships. In addition, it may help to identify the perpetrator in a case of scientific fraud.

==Ghost authorship==
''Ghost authorship'' occurs when an individual makes a substantial contribution to the research or the writing of the report, but is not listed as an author.&lt;ref name="Ghost authorship in industry-initiated randomised trials"/&gt; Researchers, statisticians and writers (e.g. [[medical writer]]s or [[technical writers]]) become ''ghost authors'' when they meet authorship criteria but are not named as an author. Writers who work in this capacity are called [[Ghostwriting#Academic|ghostwriters]].

Ghost authorship has been linked to partnerships between industry and higher education. Two-thirds of industry-initiated [[randomized controlled trial|randomized trials]] may have evidence of ghost authorship.&lt;ref name="Ghost authorship in industry-initiated randomised trials"/&gt;
Ghost authorship is considered problematic because it may be used to obscure the participation of researchers with conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="Handling of scientific dishonesty in the Nordic countries. National Committees on Scientific Dishonesty in the Nordic Countries"/&gt;

Litigation against the pharmaceutical company, [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] over health concerns related to use of their drug, [[Rofecoxib]] (brand name Vioxx), revealed examples of ghost authorship.&lt;ref name=Ross2008&gt;{{Cite journal
| last1 = Ross | first1 = Joseph S.
| last2 = Hill | first2 = Kevin P.
| last3 = Egilman | first3 = David S.
| last4 = Krumholz | first4 = Harlan M.
| year = 2008
| title = Guest Authorship and Ghostwriting in Publications Related to Rofecoxib: A Case Study of Industry Documents from Rofecoxib Litigation
| journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association
| volume = 299
| issue = 15
| pages = 1800–12
| doi = 10.1001/jama.299.15.1800
| pmid = 18413874
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Merck routinely paid medical writing companies to prepare journal manuscripts, and subsequently recruited external, academically affiliated researchers to pose as the authors.

Authors are sometimes included in a list without their permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat1264 | title = Authorship without authorization | pmid = 15516947 | year = 2004 | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | page = 743|bibcode = 2004NatMa...3..743. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even if this is done with the benign intention to acknowledge some contributions, it is problematic since authors carry responsibility for correctness and thus need to have the opportunity to check the manuscript and possibly demand changes.

==Order of authors in a list==
Rules for the order of multiple authors in a list have historically varied significantly between fields of research.&lt;ref name="On Academic Authorship (RPH 2.8)"/&gt; Some fields list authors in order of their degree of involvement in the work, with the most active contributors listed first;&lt;ref name="advances.sciencemag.org"/&gt; other fields, such as mathematics or engineering (e.g., [[control theory]]), sometimes list them alphabetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/40958 | pmid = 9237742 | year = 1997 | last1 = Stubbs | first1 = C. | title = The serious business of listing authors. | journal = Nature | volume = 388 | issue = 6640 | page = 320 |bibcode = 1997Natur.388Q.320. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPAC96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICALEPCS99"/&gt; Historically biologists tended to place a [[principal investigator]] (supervisor or lab head) last in an author list whereas organic chemists might have put him or her first.&lt;ref name="Pearson, H 2006"/&gt; Research articles in high energy physics, where the author lists can number in the tens to hundreds, often list authors alphabetically.  In Computer Science in general the principal contributor is the first in the author list. However, the practice of putting the principal investigator last in the author list has increasingly become an accepted standard across most areas in science and engineering.{{Citation needed|reason=Is there data to back this up?|date=September 2017}}

Although listing authors in order of the involvement in the project seems straightforward, it often leads to conflict. A study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that more than two-thirds of 919 corresponding authors disagreed with their coauthors regarding contributions of each author.&lt;ref name="Reliability of disclosure forms of authors' contributions"/&gt;

==Responsibilities of authors==
Authors' reputations can be damaged if their names appear on a paper that they do not completely understand or with which they were not intimately involved.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Numerous guidelines and customs specify that all co-authors must be able to understand and support a paper's major points.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In a notable case, American stem-cell researcher [[Gerald Schatten]] had his name listed on a paper co-authored with [[Hwang Woo-suk]]. The paper was later exposed as fraudulent and, though Schatten was not accused of participating in the fraud, a panel at his university found that "his failure to more closely oversee research with his name on it does make him guilty of 'research misbehavior.'"&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Constance. (2006.) Schatten: Pitt Panel Finds "Misbehavior" but Not Misconduct. ''Science'', '''311''':928.&lt;/ref&gt;

All authors, including co-authors, are usually expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted for publication. In some cases, co-authors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor. Examples include the case of Professor Geoffrey Chamberlain named as guest author of  papers fabricated by Malcolm Pearce,&lt;ref name="Lessons from the Pearce affair: handling scientific fraud"/&gt; (Chamberlain was exonerated from collusion in Pearce's deception)&lt;ref name="Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Independent Committee of Inquiry into the publication of articles in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1994-1995) |url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cats/7/4972.htm |accessdate=2011-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and the co-authors of [[Jan Hendrik Schön]] at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]]. More recent cases include [[Charles Nemeroff]],&lt;ref name="Journal editor quits in conflict scandal - The Scientist - Magazine of the Life Sciences"/&gt; former editor-in-chief of ''[[Neuropsychopharmacology]]'', and the so-called Sheffield Actonel affair.&lt;ref name="Actonel_Case_Media_Reports"/&gt;

Additionally, authors are expected to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. Both scientific and academic censure can result from a failure to keep primary data; the case of [[Ranjit Chandra]] of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] provides an example of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Memorial University to re-examine Chandra case|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/memorial-university-to-re-examine-chandra-case-1.575308|website = www.cbc.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scientific journals also require that authors provide information to allow readers to determine whether the authors may have commercial or non-commercial [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. Outlined in the author disclosure statement for the ''[[American Journal of Human Biology]]'',&lt;ref name="American Journal of Human Biology - Wiley InterScience"/&gt; this is a policy more common in scientific fields where funding often comes from corporate sources. Authors are also commonly required to provide information about [[research ethics|ethical]] aspects of research, particularly where research involves human or animal participants or use of biological material. Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct. The majority of recent cases of alleged misconduct involving undisclosed conflicts of interest or failure of the authors to have seen scientific data involve collaborative research between scientists and biotechnology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2133061/ |title=Did a British university sell out to P&amp;G? - By Jennifer Washburn - Slate Magazine |work= |accessdate=2010-04-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100323070938/http://www.slate.com/id/2133061/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anonymous and unclaimed authorship==
Authors occasionally forgo claiming authorship, for a number of reasons. Historically some authors have published anonymously to shield themselves when presenting controversial claims. A key example is [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' anonymous publication of [[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]], a speculative, pre-Darwinian work on the origins of life and the cosmos. The book argued for an evolutionary view of life in the same spirit as the late Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Lamarck had long been discredited among intellectuals by this time and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among the political radicals, materialists, and atheists - Chambers hoped to avoid Lamarck's fate.

In the 18th century, [[Émilie du Châtelet]] began her career as a scientific author by submitting a paper in an annual competition held by the [[French Academy of Sciences]]; papers in this competition were submitted anonymously. Initially presenting her work without claiming authorship allowed her to have her work judged by established scientists while avoiding the bias against women in the sciences. She did not win the competition, but eventually her paper was published alongside the winning submissions, under her real name.&lt;ref&gt;Terrall, M. The uses of anonymity in the age of reason. In ''Scientific Authorship'' Biagioli, M. and Galison, P. eds. Routledge, New York, 2003, pp. 91–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists and engineers working in corporate and military organizations are often restricted from publishing and claiming authorship of their work because their results are considered secret property of the organization that employs them. One notable example is that of [[William Gosset]], who was forced to publish his work in statistics under the pseudonym “Student” due to his employment at the [[Guinness]] brewery. Another account describes the frustration of physicists working in nuclear weapons programs at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]] – years after making a discovery they would read of the same phenomenon being "discovered" by a physicist unaware of the original, secret discovery of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Gusterson, H.

==Scope==
APFO regulations are typically applied to a jurisdiction which has legislative control of a given area. In America, this can be at a state, county, or city level. A conflict can occur when APFO regulations differ in scope between jurisdictions where there is shared funding and legislative authority (such as a city located inside a county that funds schools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Gazette|title= Calvert County finds northern school populations inadequate Multiple schools closed to future district development|author =Sara Newman|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While APFOs are intended to mitigate infrastructure shortcomings for a particular area, the mitigation may apply to areas offsite of the development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Driveway Regulation Practices|author =Kristine Williams|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; APFO regulations usually apply to individual projects on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Land Use Law|author =Daniel R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21025">'''Agroscope''' is the Swiss Confederation’s centre of excellence for agricultural research, and is affiliated with the Federal Office for Agriculture, which in turn is subordinate to the [[Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research]]. Agroscope makes an important contribution to a sustainable agriculture and food sector as well as to an intact environment, thereby contributing to an improved quality of life.

== Goals ==

Agroscope researches along the entire value chain of the agriculture and food sector. Its aims are a competitive and multifunctional agricultural sector, high-quality food for a healthy diet, and an intact environment. The Research Station gears its work to the needs of the recipients of its services.

== History ==

'''History until 1850'''

The importance in many regions of the Swiss Plateau was dominated for centuries by the three-field technique. This three-span rotation was divided as follows:

**1st Year: Winter wheat
**2nd Year: Summer grain (usually oats or barley)
**3rd Year: fallow

In each field possessed the farmer his individual acre. It was not a working association of farmers, but of a village community. The three-field did not let an intensive livestock. The common grazing on the fallow, the unfertilized Allmend and the stubble fields, and the lack of winter feeding offered only a meager food. For centuries, forest trees were debranched for winter feed. Agriculture froze in the three-field.

For agriculture, the 18th Century, means the dawn of a new, better era. Young country gentlemen took the management of their estates into their own hands and sought to agriculture, especially livestock raising and promote. The chains of the three-field  technique were broken. They began with the stall-feeding, careful storage of manure, and built on the former fields potatoes and clover. The common land was parceled out and divided among the peasants. A new goal came to the fore, namely, to keep enough cattle to supply their own country with enough manure. In the midst of these developments, the French Revolution broke out. The world was open for innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''First stations for education an controlling (1850–1880)'''

During the second half of the 19th century, humans had to adapt to the requirements of an industrialized community. Completely new technologies changed their lives and natural sciences offered completely different explanations for life procedures and agricultural production than before.

In the 19th century Switzerland therefore starts to install local agricultural institutes. With the new Federal Constitution of 1848 the modern welfare state begins to develop. In the Fifties the first, however very modest [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] were paid to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Till the middle of the 19th century people had to cultivate their bread grain by themselves. For the authorities, the major task of agriculture was the self-sufficiency of states with grain. Only until 1860, larger quantities of grain were imported from the Danube countries and from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The birth of the research stations (1874–1914)'''

The Federal Government's first step towards agricultural research stations was the development of ETH Zurich, where the first two federal agricultural experimental stations were established in 1878: the Swiss Federal Seed Control Station and the Swiss Federal Agricultural Chemistry Experimental Station. Both stations grew very quickly. The Seed Control Station in particular developed into a world-renowned institute. Its founder, Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler led it expertly and successfully for 42 years. The topics studied included fertilisers and feedstuffs, soils, milk, wines, farm fertilisers etc.. A focal point was the further development of analysis methods.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lehmann, Josef 2003:29&lt;/ref&gt; This provided the starting point for the subsequent founding of the Reckenholz location of the present-day Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon Research Station (ART). However, the second location, Tänikon TG, was only opened in 1970, at that time as a research station for rural economics and agricultural engineering.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the vines of West Switzerland were devastated by disease. This marked the establishment of the Vaud Vine Research Station in 1886 and ultimately also the Swiss Federal Research Station in Changins, which resulted from the amalgamation of the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agricultural Chemistry (founded in 1886), the Swiss Federal Seed Control Laboratory (founded in 1898) and the Swiss Federal Vine Research Station (founded in 1915). The Experimental Station for Fruit Production, Viticulture and Horticulture in Wädenswil had already existed since 1890. The Federal Government took over this station in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt;  These two locations, Changins and Wädenswil, merged more than a hundred years later to form the Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW).

At the end of the 19th century the Federal Government built a new experimental station, including a vegetation building and an experimental cheese dairy, in Liebefeld, Bern. The buildings became operational in 1901. Liebefeld thus became the location for the following three stations: the "Experimental Station for Agricultural Chemistry", the "Swiss Dairy Farming Experimental Station" and the estate farm for permits for the sale of agricultural supplies with head office.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Popp, Hans 2001:4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This head office of the Swiss agricultural experimental and test stations resulted in the Farm Animal Research Station. It moved its location to Posieux FR in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sieber, Robert; Rüegg, Max 2002:5&lt;/ref&gt;  The Liebefeld and Posieux locations merged exactly one hundred years after their foundation to form the Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux Research Station (ALP).

In 1874 the Federal Government decided to build the Federal Foal Centre in Thun for breeding Freiberger stallions. In 1927 ten mares were added, and the foal centre became the Swiss Federal Stud. Since 1998 it has been called the Swiss National Stud. Since 2009 it has belonged to the ALP-Haras unit, together with Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux (ALP).&lt;ref&gt;cf. Website Agroscope: Gestüt&lt;/ref&gt;

This laid the foundation for Agroscope's present three agricultural research stations.

'''First World War (1914–1918)'''
 
As on 1 August 1914 the First World War broke out, Switzerland was totally unprepared: inadequate food production in their own country and the supplies from the country interrupted. Switzerland imported at that time about 85% of the cereal demand.

These bottlenecks particularly in the food supply during the First World War broke out in agricultural research, big changes. The priorities of research, more and more placed on agriculture and issues of grassland and livestock took place in the background.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Between the World Wars (1919–1938) '''

After the end of World War  people wanted as soon as possible  return to a free market. This had disastrous consequences for agriculture. During the First World War, the prices of agricultural commodities were increased significantly, later collapsed brutally.

The importance of cereal crops for food security had been detected and forget the bad experiences at the beginning of World War II. Thus, the Federal Council tried shortly after the war to domestic cereal production by an import monopoly, combined with the acquisition of the domestic crop at a guaranteed price to support and protect against the fluctuations of the global market.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1920 the two  research stations "Swiss seed Investigation and Research" and "Swiss agricultural chemistry research institution" were combined. As of this date was also the new name: Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich – Oerlikon (ELVA).&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:53&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second World War (1939–1945)'''
 
In an effort to learn from past mistakes and, if possible not to repeat them, people responded pretty quickly, as the political events of the situation in Europe got worse more and more. In time the war preventions measures were initiated. At the beginning of World War I all wartime measures were taken from case to case out of nothing and had to be put out, one was prepared when the war began in 1939 in various relationships significantly better.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of war, the Laboratory provided primarily in the service of the adaptation and reproduction of the agricultural production. End of September 1943, the federal government acquired the good Reckenholz on the northern border of  Zurich-Affoltern.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-war years and the impact of the growing battle (1946–1960)'''

Thanks to the American Marshall Plan enormous sums of money flowed into the western Europe. This allowed the so-called "post-war economic miracle." The two to three decades after the  war are known as an increasing time of euphoria and increased modernization.  Agriculture also was included in an unprecedented structural change, her face changed dramatically.

In 1947, the force during the war price controls lifted and the free competition replaced the official price control again.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time since 1960'''
 
The Farm Act of 1951 underlined the idea that you can avoid by a generous promotion of agriculture, the overproduction of meat and milk,  but proved to be deceptive. The situation, particularly in the dairy industry, coined the debates and actions of the agricultural policy in those years. In the European Community (EC) was the overproduction a big problem.

During this period, they put the focus of research attention to the development of friendly production methods and improving the quality of the crop.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New concepts in agricultural politics (since 1996)'''

The major problems with the current agricultural policy and the changing values of society in terms of environmental awareness and quality of life called urgently for new approaches in the agricultural policy. On 1 January 1 1999, the new farm bill with the main objectives "more market, more ecology” was put into force. It had become clear that the company long term  was only an environmentally friendly, animal-friendly and tolerant of sustainability-oriented mode of production. The target was clear: a comprehensive, environmentally sound and resource efficient land management, which complies with the care and preservation of our cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

A milestone to this is the so-called Integrated Production (IP). On the basis of different research and development projects at the Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station ACW in the Seventies and Sixties the Integrated Plant Protection – and further on the Integrated Production for Switzerland – was introduced, taking into account integrated pest control. Today, IP in Switzerland equals very often the production after the so-called ÖLN (“ecological performance record”) or SUISSE GARANTIE.

Regarding to a constantly growing world population and a threatening climate change the agricultural research has big challenges to overcome. The Agroscope research for agriculture, nutrition and environment is therefore an investment into our future.

== Famous People ==
'''Jakob Gujer (1716–1785)'''

A simple farmer who came as Kleinjogg from Kazereutihoff to great fame, and so was he probably the most famous Swiss farmer. {{ill|Jakob Gujer|de}} alias "Chlyjogg" became famous by the Zurich city doctor Hans Caspar Hirzel, who published, in 1761, a small book called the "Economy of a peasant philosopher". Chlyjogg was born in 1716 in Wermatswil, where inherited a farm, that managed with great success by new methods devised by him. 1769 he took over the domain “Katzenrütti” near the Reckenholz yards. 
The farm consisted of approximately 68 acres and meadows . Chlyjogg continued testing the methods invented in Wermatswil. 
He tested the application of gypsum and began to stall-feeding, to get more manure. Many important personalities such as Goethe and Duke Karl August of Weimar, visited the Katzenrüttihof. Other famous contemporaries such as Rousseau and Pestalozzi have acknowledged the successful of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler (1842–1935)'''

*Founder of the first Swiss seed and Laboratory Investigation
[[Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler]] was born on 11 August in Safnern, in the Bernese Seeland, as the son of a farmer. In 1870 he joined the agricultural school Rütti. In 1875, he graduated as Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Leipzig. Later he founded a private seed control station in the Mattenhof in Bern. In 1876, he moved to Zurich in order to habilitated in the agricultural department of the Polytechnic. Under Stebler leadership, the seed control station also developed for the international seed trade recognized as a leading institution. 1889 to 1916 he headed the editorial board of the Swiss agricultural newspaper "The Green". On June 3, 1903, he was made an honorary member of the Highland Agricultural Society of Scotland in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst August Grete (1848–1919)'''

*Member of the Board of Directors of the first Swiss agricultural chemistry research station
Ernst August Grete was born 29 September 1848 in Celle (Hannover). He devoted himself to the university in Göttingen to the study of classical philology and later moved into the educational seminar. After his philological studies, he joined the scientific side. In 1878 he was manager of the chemical test station at the agricultural department of the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. There he worked for more than 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Müller-Thurgau (1850–1927)'''

*The first director of Wädenswil and father of the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed
[[Hermann Müller (Thurgau)|Hermann Müller]] was born in Tägerwilen on Lake Constance. He studied natural sciences at ETH Zurich. In 1874 he was awarded a PhD in Würzburg, Germany, and later became director of the Institute for Plant Physiology at the Geisenheim Research Station, Germany. In 1890 he became the first director of Wädenswil, the present-day Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW), and was a pioneer in the field of vine cultivation. He is considered the father of the Müller-Thurgau vine, which was crossed in 1882 and is the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed. With its success it displaced the old varieties, such as Elbling and Räuschling, and up until today has remained the most successful specifically cultivated vine variety: More than 41,000 ha are cultivated worldwide, which corresponds to almost three times the total vine area of Switzerland. It is most widespread in Germany; in German-speaking Switzerland it is still the most important white wine variety today. For a long time this vine variety was thought to be a crossing between Riesling and Silvaner. In 1998 an Austrian research team discovered, on the basis of molecular-genetic tests, that the crossing partners were not Riesling x Silvaner, but Riesling x Madeleine Royal. How this «mix-up» could have occurred has never been discovered. However, this fact has given new impetus to the vine variety's second name, Müller-Thurgau.

'''Albert Volkart (1873–1951)'''

*First Director of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon
*The great pioneer of Swiss agriculture {{ill|Albert Volkart|de}} , was born in 1873 in Zurich. In 1891 he began his studies at the agricultural department of the Polytechnic in Zurich. After the final examination in 1894, he joined as an assistant to Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler in this institution, where he was later an assistant and management board, where he worked for 35 years. Volkart dealt extensively with issues of plant protection. In 1917, Volkart replaced the retired CEO of Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler seeds Investigation and Research, and three years later, he became head of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon. In 1925 he became professor of Agronomy at the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Traugott Wahlen (1899–1985)'''

*Director of the Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon
[[Friedrich Traugott Wahlen]] was born in 1899 in Gmeis Mirchel in the Emmental. As a small child he wanted to be a farmer. In 1917 he began his study of agriculture at the Polytechnic in Zurich. He acted in several roles:

**1929-1943: Executive Board of the Swiss agricultural experimental station Zurich-Oerlikon
**1938-1945: Member in the Federal War Food Office
**1942-1949: Council of the Canton of Zurich
**1943-1949: Professor of Agronomy at the agricultural department of the ETH

In 1949 he was appointed to the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization), first to Washington and then in 1951, to Rome, where he presided as director of the Department of Agriculture from 1950 to 1952 and  was chief of the technical assistance program. In 1958 he was appointed Deputy Director-General of  the FAO. On 11 December 1958, the Federal Assembly elected him to the Federal Council, where he first  was the Minister of Justice and Police, later he led the Ministry of the Department of Economic and then was the Foreign Minister by the Political Department. Until the 1965 elections  he was a Federal Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Koblet (1904–1983)'''

*Executive Board of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Institute Zurich-Oerlikon
*A polymath of the agricultural crop
On 13 February 1904 {{ill|Rudolf Koblet|de}} was born in Heiterthal, not far from Kollbrunn in Tösstal. He attended the Industrial School in Winterthur and in 1923 began with his studies at the Department of Agriculture of the ETH. In 1926 he graduated with a diploma as an engineer-agronomist. After a stay in France he went to Canada where he acquired, besides the work as "farm help" in various Canadian farms,  specialized knowledge, as a volunteer in the Seed Branch in Ottawa, in the field of control seeds. In 1929 he joined the line for seed control in Oerlikon. With his work "On the germination Pinus strobus with particular reference to the origin of the seed," he earned his doctorate in 1932 Dr.sc.techn. ETH.  In 1949 he became head of the Department of Agronomy at the ETH.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolf Salzmann (1912–1992)'''

*Director of the Swiss Federal Agricultural Research Station for Agronomy Zurich- Reckenholz
*Planner and builder of the Research Institute Reckenholz
{{ill|Rudolf Salzmann|de}} was born on 2 January 1912 in Bern. In the years 1930 to 1933, he completed his agriculture studies at the ETH. He oversaw the procurement of seed in the war food office under Frederick Traugott elections and then took a slightly later point in agricultural chemistry from the Swiss Federal Institute Liebefeld, where he worked on the agronomic aspects and problems of the institution. In 1944, he was transferred to the agricultural experimental station Oerlikon. His election as successor to Director Koblet took place on November 1, 195, when he took responsibility for both academic work and for the organizational and administrative issues.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Josef 2003:98-99&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics''' (ACPFG) is a research organisation focusing on improving the resistance of [[wheat]] and [[barley]] to hostile [[Natural environment|environmental]] conditions, using functional [[genomics]] technologies.

Scientists at the ACPFG are focusing on stresses that impact [[agriculture in Australia]], including [[drought]], [[Salinity in Australia|salinity]], high or low [[temperatures]] and [[Nitrogen deficiency|mineral deficiencies]] or [[Toxicity|toxicities]]. These stresses, known as [[abiotic stress]]es, are a major cause of [[cereal]] [[crop yield]] and quality loss throughout the [[world]].

The ACPFG was established in December 2002 after being granted $27 million from the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC), the [[Grains Research and Development Corporation]] (GRDC) and the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian Government]].

It also had support of $30 million from the [[University of Adelaide]], [[The University of Melbourne]], the Victorian Department of Primary Industries and the [[University of Queensland]].

ACPFG as a research organisation has an unusual structure because it is a [[company]], but its [[shareholders]] are the research organisations and governments that fund it.

In the second funding cycle the [[University of South Australia]] became a shareholder, increasing ACPFG’s focus on [[bioinformatics]], which is the focus of ACPFG researchers in [[University of Queensland|Queensland]].

Most ACPFG researchers are based on the [[University of Adelaide#Waite|University of Adelaide’s Waite Campus]] in the Plant Genomics Centre.

As well as the core research programs focused on [[abiotic stress|environmental stresses]], ACPFG researchers work with other organisations including [[CSIRO]] and the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]], on nutritional focuses such as [[beta-glucan]] and [[iron]] [[biofortification]].

Though research outcomes are focused on [[wheat]] and [[barley]] for Australian farmers, [[model species]] such as [[Arabidopsis thaliana|arabidopsis]] and [[rice]] are often used in ACPFG research. Researchers also explore the [[genetic diversity]] of less [[Plant breeding|commercially viable]] plant [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], such as those originating from the [[fertile crescent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12958">'''Beth Alpha''' ({{Lang-he|בית אלפא}}; ''Bet Alpha'', ''Bet Alfa'') is a sixth-century AD [[synagogue]] located at the foot of the northern slopes of the [[Mount Gilboa|Gilboa]] mountains near [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190"&gt;Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 190.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now part of '''Bet Alfa Synagogue National Park''' and managed by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Beit Alfa Synagogue National Parks Website, {{cite web|url=http://www.parks.org.il/BuildaGate5/general2/data_card.php?Cat%3D%7E25%7E%7E440441034%7ECard12%7E%26ru%3D%26SiteName%3Dparks%26Clt%3D%26Bur%3D204968785 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601082424/http://www.parks.org.il/BuildaGate5/general2/data_card.php?Cat=~25~~440441034~Card12~&amp;ru=&amp;SiteName=parks&amp;Clt=&amp;Bur=204968785 |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Beit alfa panorama2.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Nave Mosaics|500px]]

==Excavations==
The Beth Alpha synagogue was uncovered in 1928 by members of the nearby [[Kibbutz]] [[Hefzibah]], who stumbled upon the synagogue's extensive mosaic floors during irrigation construction.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; Excavations began in 1929 under the auspices of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and were led by Israeli archaeologist, [[Eleazar Sukenik]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190"/&gt; A secondary round of excavations, sponsored by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] in 1962, further explored the residential structures surrounding the synagogue.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt;

In addition, a [[hoard]] of 36 Byzantine coins were found in a shallow depression in the floor [[apse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winter |first1=Dave |last2=Matthews |first2=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxYEsYsrfGUC |title=Israel Handbook |page=646 |publisher=Footprint Travel Guides |year=1999 |isbn=1-900949-48-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Architectural remains from the Beth Alpha synagogue indicate that the synagogue once stood as two-story basilical building and contained a courtyard, [[vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], and prayer hall.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Jewish Art and Archaeology in Late-Antiquity'', 232–33&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor of the prayer hall consisted of a central [[nave]] measuring 5.4 meters wide, the apse, which served as the resting place for the Torah Ark, the [[bema#Judaism|bimah]], the raised platform upon which the Torah would have been read, and benches.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah Ark within the [[apse]] was aligned southwest, in the direction of [[Jerusalem]].

==Dedicatory inscriptions==
[[File:Beyt-Alfa-50.jpg|thumb|right|Dedicatory Inscriptions]] The northern entryway features two dedicatory inscriptions in [[Aramaic]] and Greek. Although partially destroyed, the Aramaic inscription indicates that the synagogue was built during the reign of Roman Emperor Justinus, probably [[Justin I]] (518–527 CE), and was funded by communal donations.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 192"&gt;Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek inscription thanks artisans "Marianos and his son Hanina", whom were also listed as the artisans of the nearby Beth Shean synagogue.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 192" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions are flanked on either side by a lion and a buffalo, who serve as the synagogue's symbolic guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''The Ancient Synagogue of Beth Alpha'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nave mosaics==

===Northern panel—Binding of Isaac===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumb|Binding of Isaac]] The northern panel depicts the "[[Binding of Isaac]]" (Genesis 22: 1–18). To the right, [[Abraham]] is depicted dangling Isaac over the fiery altar as he raises his hand to perform the sacrifice. In the center, God, symbolized by the small fire- encircled hand appearing in the upper center, instructs Abraham to sacrifice a nearby ram instead of [[Isaac]]. The [[Hand of God (art)|hand of God]] is aptly labeled with "al tishlah" or "do not raise", taken from God's command to the angel that Abraham not "raise his hand against the boy [Isaac]" (Genesis 22:12).&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel'', 288. Translation taken from the 2003 edition of the Jewish Publication Society Tanakah.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lower center of the composition, immediately below the hand of God, the ram that served as Isaac's substitute is positioned standing sideways, trapped in the nearby thicket.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 288.&lt;/ref&gt; The odd positioning of the ram may perhaps be a convention the artists used to convey the distance that the [[Bible]] says separated Abraham and Isaac, from the two servant boys (Genesis 22:5), who accompanied Abraham and Isaac on their journey, and are depicted standing to the left. All the figures in the scene, except for the two servants, are identified with Hebrew labels.

The iconographic significance of the "Binding of Isaac" is unclear. There is a wide variety of opinions, with some scholars seeing this narrative as an affirmation of God's mercy, others as symbolic of his continuing covenant with Israel, and others as embodying the rabbinic notion of "zechut avot" or the merit of the fathers.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of scholarly opinions see Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 287–292; Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco Roman World'', 194–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporaneous Christian church art, where the "Binding of Isaac" was also a popular theme, the narrative was seen as a typological pre-figuration for the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central panel—zodiac wheel===
[[File:Beit Alpha.jpg|thumb|right|Zodiac Wheel with Hebrew Labels]] The central panel features a Jewish adaptation of the Greco-Roman [[zodiac]]. The zodiac consists of two concentric circles, with the twelve zodiac signs appearing in the outer circle, and [[Helios]], the Greco-Roman sun god, appearing in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The outer circle consists of twelve panels, each of which correspond to one of the twelve months of the year and contain the appropriate Greco-Roman zodiac sign. Female busts symbolizing the four seasons appear in the four corners immediately outside the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the center, [[Helios]] appears with his signature Greco-Roman iconographic elements such as the fiery crown of rays adorning his head and the highly stylized [[quadriga]] or four-horse-drawn chariot.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The background is decorated with a crescent shaped moon and stars. As in the "Binding of Isaac" panel, the zodiac symbols and seasonal busts are labeled with their corresponding Hebrew names.

This zodiac wheel, along with other similar examples found in contemporaneous synagogues throughout Israel such as [[Naaran]], [[Susiya]], [[Hamat Tiberias]], Huseifa, and [[Sepphoris]], rest at the center of a scholarly debate regarding the relationship between Judaism and general Greco-Roman culture in late-antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''Art and Judaism'', 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpret the popularity that the zodiac maintains within synagogue floors as evidence for its Judaization and adaptation into the Jewish calendar and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of scholarly views supporting the normative role of the zodiac in Judaism see Fine, ''Art and Judaism'' 184–204 and Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 308–9. Many scholars cite the popularity that the zodiac maintains within late-antique and medieval piyyutim and manuscripts as further support for their views regarding the Judaization of the zodiac.&lt;/ref&gt; Others see it as representing the existence of a "non-Rabbinic" or a mystical and Hellenized form of Judaism that embraced the astral religion of Greco-Roman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman World Vol. 8—Astronomical Symbols, 167–195; Magness identifies Helios with the angel, Metatron, see Magness, "Heaven on Earth: Helios and the Zodiac Cycle in Ancient Palestinian Synagogues", 2, 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern panel—synagogue scene===
The southern panel, which was laid before the synagogue's Torah Shrine, is a liturgically oriented scene that emphasizes the centrality of the Torah Shrine. The Torah Shrine stands at the center of the composition and is depicted with a gabled roof. The Torah Shrine is decorated with ornamented panels featuring diamonds and squares.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 34; Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The floating conch shell seen in the center of the roof, is a stylized representation of the Torah Shrine's inset arch.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 284.&lt;/ref&gt; A hanging lamp is suspended from the gable of the roof.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; As a symbolic marker of its importance, the lower register of the Torah Shrine is flanked by two roaring lions and is surrounded by Jewish ritual objects such as the [[lulav]], [[etrog]], [[shofar]], and incense shovel.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Judaica 190" /&gt; Two birds flank the gabled roof in the upper register of the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 22. Sukenik proposes that the birds are ostriches while Hachlili proposes that the birds are peacocks.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beyt-Alfa-60.jpg|thumb|Synagogue Scene]]
Two large seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorot]] candelabras stand on either of the Torah shrine. The base and branches of the two Menorot are not identical in form; the right-hand Menorah has an upright base, while the left-hand Menorah has two crescent shaped legs and one upright leg.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the entire scene is framed by the two pulled back curtains, which served to demarcate the sacred space of the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 34; Avigad, "Beth Alpha", ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of the Menorah, which originally stood in the [[Jerusalem Temple]], comes to highlight the continuing importance that the Jerusalem Temple occupied in the development of the synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Menorah also maintained a practical function, as the primary light source for the area around the Torah Shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''Art and Judaism'', 154–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Sukenik believed that the two Menorot depicted flanking the Torah Shrine in this scene, likely stood adjacent to the Torah Shrine within the actual Beth Alpha synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Hachlili, ''Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology'', 362; Sukenik, ''Beth Alpha'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guggenheim-bilbao-jan05.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[Bilbao]] is an example of a structure used for city marketing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monclus|Guardia|2006|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''City marketing''' (related to '''city branding''') is the promotion of a [[city]], or a [[district]] within it, with the aim of encouraging certain activities to take place there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1994|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to alter the external perceptions of a city in order to encourage [[tourism]], attract inward migration of residents, or enable business relocation. A significant feature of city marketing is the development of new landmark, or 'flagship', buildings and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smyth|1994|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of cities as a marketable product has led to competition between them for inward investment and government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often manifested in the attempts by cities to attract international sporting events, such as the [[Olympic Games]]. Competition between cities exists at the regional, national and international level; and is an effect of [[globalisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1999|p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some places are associated with certain brands and build on each other, but sometimes the commercial brand is so powerful that eclipses the place brand. An example of this is [[Maranello]], Italy, which uses the Ferrari headquarters as a primary attraction for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maranello.it/en/what-to-do/|title=What To Do|last=|first=|date=April 6, 2017|website=Maranello|archive-url=http://www.maranello.it/en/what-to-do/|archive-date=April 6, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City marketing can occur ''strategically'' or ''organically''. An example of strategic city marketing is  [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Spillman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=LVCVA: What works here, stays here |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/43023617.html |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |publisher= |date= 2009-04-15|accessdate=15 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is promoted through a variety of efforts with the strategic intent of acquiring cultural and economic bonuses. A case of organic city marketing is [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110612234127/http://www.fek.su.se/en/Research/Subdisciplines/Marketing/Stockholm-Program-of-Place-Branding |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is marketed without a grand strategy, as disorganized stakeholders over the course of centuries have glorified the city and encouraged pilgrimage, yielding cultural and economic bonuses. Both cases demonstrate city marketing, each with varying strategic and organic involvement. Generally, organic marketing occurs alongside strategic marketing, as the [[perception]] of the city is impossible to solely construct with strategic efforts. 

According to [[Scott Cutlip]], "one of the first, if not the first, municipal promotion programs" was led by [[Erastus Brainerd]] for the city of [[Seattle]] beginning in 1896. Seattle was in competition with Portland and Victoria as the preferred city in which to get supplied for the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. A Bureau of Public Information was established within the city’s [[Chamber of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Cutlip (1995) ''Public Relations History'', "Seattle shows the way for cities", pp 166,7&lt;/ref&gt;

Like with any successful marketing effort, cities must be willing to commit to a long-term plan in order for their identity and message to be communicated effectively. A shared vision between stakeholders will help develop a cohesive overarching strategy for a city's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City Branding|last=Dinnie|first=Keith|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-230-24185-5|location=New York|pages=150–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embodied cognitive science''' is an interdisciplinary field of research, the aim of which is to explain the mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior.   It comprises three main methodologies: 1) the modeling of psychological and biological systems in a holistic manner that considers the mind and body as a single entity, 2) the formation of a common set of general principles of intelligent behavior, and 3) the experimental use of robotic agents in controlled environments.

Embodied cognitive science borrows heavily from [[embodied philosophy]] and the related research fields of [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. From the perspective of neuroscience, research in this field was led by [[Gerald Edelman]] of the [[Neurosciences Institute]] at La Jolla, the late [[Francisco Varela]] of [[CNRS]] in France, and [[J. A. Scott Kelso]] of [[Florida Atlantic University]].  From the perspective of psychology, research by [[Michael Turvey]], [[Lawrence Barsalou]] and [[Eleanor Rosch]].  From the perspective of language acquisition, [[Eric Lenneberg]] and [[Philip Rubin]] at [[Haskins Laboratories]].  From the perspective of autonomous agent design, early work is sometimes attributed to [[Rodney Brooks]] or [[Valentino Braitenberg]].  From the perspective of artificial intelligence, see ''Understanding Intelligence'' by [[Rolf Pfeifer]] and Christian Scheier or ''How the body shapes the way we think'', also by Rolf Pfeifer and Josh C. Bongard. From the perspective of philosophy see [[Andy Clark]], [[Shaun Gallagher]], and [[Evan Thompson]].

[[Alan Turing|Turing]] proposed that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak:

::''It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again, I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried'' (Turing, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional cognitive theory ==

Embodied cognitive science is an alternative theory to cognition in which it minimizes appeals to [[computational theory of mind]] in favor of greater emphasis on how an organism's body determines how and what it thinks. Traditional cognitive theory is based mainly around symbol manipulation, in which certain inputs are fed into a processing unit that produces an output. These inputs follow certain rules of syntax, from which the processing unit finds semantic meaning. Thus, an appropriate output is produced. For example, a human's sensory organs are its input devices, and the stimuli obtained from the external environment are fed into the nervous system which serves as the processing unit. From here, the nervous system is able to read the sensory information because it follows a syntactic structure, thus an output is created. This output then creates bodily motions and brings forth behavior and cognition. Of particular note is that cognition is sealed away in the brain, meaning that mental cognition is cut off from the external world and is only possible by the input of sensory information.

== The embodied cognitive approach ==

Embodied cognitive science differs from the traditionalist approach in that it denies the input-output system. This is chiefly due to the problems presented by the [[Homunculus argument]], which concluded that semantic meaning could not be derived from symbols without some kind of inner interpretation. If some little man in a person's head interpreted incoming symbols, then who would interpret the little man's inputs? Because of the specter of an infinite regress, the traditionalist model began to seem less plausible. Thus, embodied cognitive science aims to avoid this problem by defining cognition in three ways.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Larry|title=The Embodied Cognition Programme|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=March 2007|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2007.00064.x|url=http://portal.uni-freiburg.de/cognition/lehre/archiv/ss13/mat-prosem/embodiedcognition/Shapiro_EmbodiedCognition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}

=== Physical attributes of the body ===
The first aspect of embodied cognition examines the role of the physical body, particularly how its properties affect its ability to think. This part attempts to overcome the symbol manipulation component that is a feature of the traditionalist model. Depth perception for instance can be better explained under the embodied approach due to the sheer complexity of the action. Depth perception requires that the brain detect the disparate retinal images obtained by the distance of the two eyes. In addition, body and head cues complicate this further. When the head is turned in a given direction, objects in the foreground will appear to move against objects in the background. From this, it is said that some kind of visual processing is occurring without the need of any kind of symbol manipulation. This is because the objects appearing to move the foreground are simply appearing to move. This observation concludes then that depth can be perceived with no intermediate symbol manipulation necessary. 

A more poignant example exists through examining auditory perception. Generally speaking the greater the distance between the ears, the greater the possible auditory acuity. Also relevant is the amount of density in between the ears, for the strength of the frequency wave alters as it passes through a given medium. The brain's auditory system takes these factors into account as it process information, but again without any need for a symbolic manipulation system. This is because the distance between the ears for example does not need symbols to represent it. The distance itself creates the necessary opportunity for greater auditory acuity. The amount of density between the ears is similar, in that it is the actual amount itself that simply forms the opportunity for frequency alteration. Thus under consideration of the physical properties of the body, a symbolic system is unnecessary and an unhelpful metaphor.

=== The body's role in the cognitive process ===

The second aspect draws heavily from [[George Lakoff]]'s and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]'s work on concepts. They argued that humans use metaphors whenever possible to better explain their external world. Humans also have a basic stock of concepts in which other concepts can be derived from. These basic concepts include spatial orientations such as up, down, front, and back. Humans can understand what these concepts mean because they can directly experience them from their own bodies. For example, because human movement revolves around standing erect and moving the body in an up-down motion, humans innately have these concepts of up and down. Lakoff and Johnson contend this is similar with other spatial orientations such as front and back too. As mentioned earlier, these basic stocks of spatial concepts are the basis in which other concepts are constructed. Happy and sad for instance are seen now as being up or down respectively. When someone says they are feeling down, what they are really saying is that they feel sad for example. Thus the point here is that true understanding of these concepts is contingent on whether one can have an understanding of the human body. So the argument goes that if one lacked a human body, they could not possibly know what up or down could mean, or how it could relate to emotional states.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

‘[I]magine a spherical being living outside of any gravitational field, with no
knowledge or imagination of any other kind of experience. What could UP
possibly mean to such a being?'&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

While this does not mean that such beings would be incapable of expressing emotions in other words, it does mean that they would express emotions differently from humans. Human concepts of happiness and sadness would be different because human would have different bodies. So then an organism's body directly affects how it can think, because it uses metaphors related to its body as the basis of concepts.

=== Interaction of local environment ===
A third component of the embodied approach looks at how agents use their immediate environment in cognitive processing. Meaning, the local environment is seen as an actual extension of the body's cognitive process. The example of a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) is used to better imagine this. Echoing [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)]], this point claims that mental states are individuated by their role in a much larger system. So under this premise, the information on a PDA is similar to the information stored in the brain. So then if one thinks information in the brain constitutes mental states, then it must follow that information in the PDA is a cognitive state too. Consider also the role of pen and paper in a complex multiplication problem. The pen and paper are so involved in the cognitive process of solving the problem that it seems ridiculous to say they are somehow different from the process, in very much the same way the PDA is used for information like the brain. Another example examines how humans control and manipulate their environment so that cognitive tasks can be better performed. Leaving one's car keys in a familiar place so they aren't missed for instance, or using landmarks to navigate in an unfamiliar city. Thus, humans incorporate aspects of their environment to aid in their cognitive functioning.

== Examples of the value of embodied approach ==

The value of the embodiment approach in the context of cognitive science is perhaps best explained by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Andy|title=An Embodied Cognitive Science?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=September 1999|volume=3|issue=9|pages=345–351|url=http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Lecture%20Files/AI/Secure/Download/Clark%20Andy%20-%20Embodied%20Cog%20Science%20%281999%20Trends%29.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2011|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345–351}} He makes the claim that the brain alone should not be the single focus for the scientific study of cognition

&lt;blockquote&gt;

It is increasingly clear that, in a wide variety of cases, the individual brain should not be the sole locus of cognitive scientific interest. Cognition is not a phenomenon that can be successfully studied while marginalizing the roles of body, world and action.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|350}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following examples used by Clark will better illustrate how embodied thinking is becoming apparent in scientific thinking.

=== Bluefin tuna ===

''[[Thunnus]]'', or tuna, long baffled conventional biologists with its incredible abilities to accelerate quickly and attain great speeds. A biological examination of the tuna shows it is simply not capable of such feats. However, an answer can be found when taking the tuna's embodied state into account. The [[bluefin tuna]] is able to take advantage of and exploit its local environment by finding naturally occurring currents to increase its speed. The tuna also uses its own physical body for this end as well, by utilizing its tailfin to create the necessary vortices and pressure so it can accelerate and maintain high speeds. Thus, the bluefin tuna is actively using its local environment for its own ends through the attributes of its physical body.

=== Robots ===

Clark uses the example of the hopping [[robot]] constructed by Raibert and Hodgins to demonstrate further the value of the embodiment paradigm. These robots were essentially vertical cylinders with a single hopping foot. The challenge of managing the robot's behavior can be daunting because in addition to the intricacies of the program itself, there were also the mechanical matters regarding how the foot ought to be constructed so that it could hop. An embodied approach makes it easier to see that in order for this robot to function, it must be able to exploit its system to the fullest. That is, the robot's systems should be seen as having dynamic characteristics as opposed to the traditional view that it is merely a command center that just executes actions.

=== Vision ===

Clark distinguishes between two kinds of [[Visual perception|vision]], animate and pure vision. Pure vision is an idea that is typically associated with classical [[artificial intelligence]], in which vision is used to create a rich world model so that thought and reason can be used to fully explore the inner model. In other words, pure vision passively creates the external perceivable world so that the faculties of reason can be better used introspectively. Animate vision, by contrast, sees vision as the means by which real-time action can commence. Animate vision is then more of a vehicle by which visual information is obtained so that actions can be undertaken. Clark points to animate vision as an example of embodiment, because it uses both biological and local environment cues to create an active intelligent process. Consider the Clark's example of going to the drugstore to buy some Kodak film. In one's mind, one is familiar with the Kodak logo and its trademark gold color. Thus, one uses incoming visual stimuli to navigate around the drugstore until one finds the film. Therefore, vision should not be seen as a passive system but rather an active retrieval device that intelligently uses sensory information and local environmental cues to perform specific real-world actions.

=== Affordance ===

Inspired by the work of the American psychologist [[James J. Gibson]], this next example emphasizes the importance of action-relevant sensory information, bodily movement, and local environment cues. These three concepts are unified by the concept of affordances, which are possibilities of action provided by the physical world to a given agent. These are in turn determined by the agent's physical body, capacities, and the overall action-related properties of the local environment as well. Clark uses the example of an outfielder in baseball to better illustrate the concept of affordance. Traditional computational models would claim that an outfielder attempting to catch a fly-ball can be calculated by variables such as the running speed of the outfielder and the arc of the baseball. However, Gibson's work shows that a simpler method is possible. The outfielder can catch the ball so long as they adjust their running speed so that the ball continually moves in a straight line in their field of vision. Note that this strategy uses various affordances that are contingent upon the success of the outfielder, including their physical body composition, the environment of the baseball field, and the sensory information obtained by the outfielder. 

Clark points out here that the latter strategy of catching the ball as opposed to the former has significant implications for perception. The affordance approach proves to be non-linear because it relies upon spontaneous real-time adjustments. On the contrary, the former method of computing the arc of the ball is linear as it follows a sequence of perception, calculation and performing action. Thus, the affordance approach challenges the traditional view of perception by arguing against the notion that computation and introspection are necessary. Instead, it ought to be replaced with the idea that perception constitutes a continuous equilibrium of action adjustment between the agent and the world. Ultimately Clark does not expressly claim this is certain but he does observe the affordance approach can explain adaptive response satisfactorily.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|346}} This is because they utilize environmental cues made possible by perceptual information that is actively used in the real-time by the agent.

== General principles of intelligent behavior ==
In the formation of general principles of intelligent behavior, Pfeifer intended to be contrary to older principles  given in traditional artificial intelligence.  The most dramatic difference is that the principles are applicable only to situated robotic agents in the real world, a domain where traditional artificial intelligence showed the least promise.

Principle of Cheap Design and Redundancy: Pfeifer realized that implicit assumptions made by engineers often substantially influence a control architecture's complexity.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"&gt;Pfeifer, R., Scheier, C.,  ''Understanding Intelligence'' (MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-66125-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|436}}  This insight is reflected in discussions of the scalability problem in robotics.  The internal processing needed for some bad architectures can grow out of proportion to new tasks needed of an agent.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the primary reasons for scalability problems is that the amount of programming and knowledge engineering that the robot designers have to perform grows very rapidly with the complexity of the robot's tasks. There is mounting evidence that pre-programming cannot be the solution to the scalability problem ... The problem is that programmers introduce too many hidden assumptions in the robot's code.&lt;ref&gt;Stoytchev, A. (2006). [http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~alex/papers/NIPS_Workshop_2006.pdf Five Basic Principles of Developmental Robotics] NIPS 2006 Workshop on Grounding Perception, Knowledge and Cognition in Sensori-Motor Experience.  Department of Computer Science, Iowa State U&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proposed solutions are to have the agent exploit the inherent physics of its environment, to exploit the constraints of its niche, and to have agent morphology based on parsimony and the principle of Redundancy. Redundancy reflects the desire for the error-correction of signals afforded by duplicating like channels.  Additionally, it reflects the desire to exploit the associations between sensory modalities. (See [[modality (human-computer interaction)|redundant modalities]]).  In terms of design, this implies that redundancy should be introduced with respect not only to one sensory modality but to several.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"/&gt;{{rp|448}}  It has been suggested that the fusion and transfer of knowledge between modalities can be the basis of reducing the size of the sense data taken from the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Konijn, Paul (2007). [http://www.diracproject.org/workshop-2007/pdf/DIRAC-Summer-Workshop.pdf Summer Workshop on Multi-Sensory Modalities in Cognitive Science] Detection and Identification of Rare Audiovisual Cues. DIRAC EU IP IST project, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;  This again addresses the scalability problem.

Principle of Parallel, Loosely-coupled Processes: An alternative to hierarchical methods of knowledge and [[action selection]]. This design principle differs most importantly from the Sense-Think-Act cycle of traditional AI. Since it does not involve this famous cycle, it is not affected by the [[frame problem]].

Principle of Sensory-Motor Coordination: Ideally, internal mechanisms in an agent should give rise to things like memory and choice-making in an emergent fashion, rather than being prescriptively programmed from the beginning.   These kinds of things are allowed to emerge as the agent interacts with the environment. The motto is, build fewer assumptions into the agent's controller now, so that learning can be more robust and idiosyncratic in the future. 

Principle of Ecological Balance: This is more a theory than a principle, but its implications are widespread.  Its claim is that the internal processing of an agent cannot be made more complex unless there is a corresponding increase in complexity of the motors, limbs, and sensors of the agent. In other words, the extra complexity added to the brain of a simple robot will not create any discernible change in its behavior. The robot's morphology must already contain the complexity in itself to allow enough "breathing room" for more internal processing to develop.

The Value Principle: This was the architecture developed in the Darwin III robot of [[Gerald Edelman]]. It relies heavily on [[connectionism]].

== Critical responses ==

=== Traditionalist response to local environment claim ===
A traditionalist may argue that objects may be used to aid in cognitive processes, but this does not mean they are part of a cognitive system.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|343}} Eyeglasses are used to aid in the visual process, but to say they are a part of a larger system would completely redefine what is meant by a visual system. However, supporters of the embodied approach could make the case that if objects in the environment play the functional role of mental states, then the items themselves should not be counted among the mental states.

Although the term first appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch, it gained popularity in the 1995 book by that title, written by author and science journalist [[Daniel Goleman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Emotional+intelligence&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bemotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20Intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEMOTIONAL%20INTELLIGENCE%3B%2Cc0 | Google Ngram graph&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time, EI, and Goleman's 1995 analysis, have been criticized within the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kevin R.

[[Empathy]] is typically associated with EI, because it relates to an individual connecting their personal experiences with those of others. However, a number of models exist that aim to measure levels of (empathy) EI. There are currently several models of EI. Goleman's original model may now be considered a ''mixed model'' that combines what has since been modeled separately as ''ability EI'' and ''trait EI''. Goleman defined EI as the array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Goleman |first= Daniel |year= 1998 |title= What Makes a Leader? |publisher= Harvard Business Review |location= |page= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''trait model'' was developed by Konstantin Vasily Petrides in 2001.  It "encompasses behavioral dispositions and self perceived abilities and is measured through self report".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Petrides| first1 = Konstantin| author-link =| last2 = Furnham| first2 = Adrian| author2-link =| title = Trait Emotional Intelligence: Psychometric Investigation with Reference to Established Trait Taxonomies| newspaper = European Journal of Personality| pages = 425–448| year = 2001| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ability model'', developed by [[Peter Salovey]] and [[John D. Mayer|John Mayer]] in 2004, focuses on the individual's ability to process emotional information and use it to navigate the [[social environment]].&lt;ref name = "Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications"&gt;{{Citation |last1= Salovey |first1= Peter |last2 = Mayer |first2 =John |last3 = Caruso |first3 = David |year= 2004|title= Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications | newspaper = Psychological Inquiry | pages = 197–215 |publisher= |location= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that people with high EI have greater [[mental health]], [[job performance]], and [[leadership skills]] although no [[causal relationships]] have been shown and such findings are likely to be attributable to [[general intelligence]] and specific [[personality traits]] rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working With Emotional Intelligence. New York, NY.

Criticisms have centered on whether EI is a real [[intelligence]] and whether it has [[incremental validity]] over [[IQ]] and the [[Big Five personality traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harms | first1 = P.

== History ==
The term "emotional intelligence" seems first to have appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch,&lt;ref&gt;Beldoch, M. (1964), Sensitivity to expression of emotional meaning in three modes of communication, in J. R. Davitz et al., The Communication of Emotional Meaning, McGraw-Hill, pp. 31–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sensitivity%20to%20expression%20of%20emotional%20meaning%20in%20three%20modes%20of%20communication%22%20Beldoch&amp;f=false "Contributions to social interactions: Social Encounters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905144115/https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I |date=2017-09-05 }} Editor: Michael Argyle, reprint online on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1966 paper by B. Leuner entitled ''Emotional intelligence and emancipation'' which appeared in the psychotherapeutic journal: ''Practice of child psychology and child psychiatry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leuner | first1 = B | year = 1966 | title = Emotional intelligence and emancipation | url = | journal = Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 193–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Howard Gardner]]'s ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1983). Frames of mind. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the idea that traditional types of intelligence, such as [[IQ]], fail to fully explain cognitive ability. He introduced the idea of [[multiple intelligences]] which included both ''interpersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and ''intrapersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.K. (2002) "Howard Gardner and multiple intelligences", ''The Encyclopedia of Informal Education'', downloaded from {{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102035039/http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |archivedate=2005-11-02 |df= }} on October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term subsequently appeared in Wayne Payne's [[doctoral thesis]], ''A Study of Emotion: Developing Emotional Intelligence'' in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, W.L. (1983/1986). A study of emotion: developing emotional intelligence; self integration; relating to fear, pain and desire" ''Dissertation Abstracts International'' 47, p. 203A (University microfilms No. AAC 8605928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published use of the term 'EQ' (Emotional Quotient) is an article by Keith Beasley in 1987 in the British Mensa magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, K. (1987). The Emotional Quotient. ''Mensa'', May 1987, p25. It should be noted that earlier use of the term E.Q has been found in a [http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1# 1979 Stamford Daily Ad Campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625165121/http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1 |date=2016-06-25 }} but was used to denote something quite different, The Economic Quotient&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2016}}{{verification needed|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1989 [[Stanley Greenspan]] put forward a model to describe EI, followed by another by [[Peter Salovey]] and John Mayer published in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = J.D. | year = 1989 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = http://ei.yale.edu/journal/imagination-cognition-and-personality/ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 185–211 | doi=10.2190/dugg-p24e-52wk-6cdg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term became widely known with the publication of [[Daniel Goleman|Goleman]]'s book: ''Emotional Intelligence – Why it can matter more than IQ''&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D., (1995) Emotional Intelligence, New York, NY, England: Bantam Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (1995). It is to this book's best-selling status that the term can attribute its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |title=Dan Goleman |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304084501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |archivedate=2014-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Schawbel |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104185806/http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archivedate=2012-11-04 |title=Daniel Goleman on Leadership and The Power of Emotional Intelligence – Forbes |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman has followed up with several further popular publications of a similar theme that reinforce use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1998), Working with Emotional Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (2006), Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lantieri, L. and Goleman, D.

(2011), The Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (2011), Leadership: The Power of Emotional Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt;
To date, tests measuring EI have not replaced IQ tests as a standard metric of intelligence. Emotional Intelligence has also received criticism on its role in leadership and business success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128120307/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archivedate=2012-11-28 |title=Why emotional intelligence is just a fad – CBS News |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between trait emotional intelligence and ability emotional intelligence was introduced in 2000.&lt;ref name="pet2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2000a | title = On the dimensional structure of emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 313–320 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00195-6| citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.5285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Emotional intelligence has been defined as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior" by Peter Salovey and John Mayer. This definition was later broken down and refined into four proposed abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. These abilities are distinct yet related.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Psychology" /&gt; Emotional intelligence also reflects abilities to join intelligence, empathy and emotions to enhance thought and understanding of interpersonal dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081|title = Human Abilities: Emotional Intelligence|last = Mayer|first = John D|date = 2008|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646|pmid = 17937602|access-date = |volume = 59|pages = 507–536|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125327/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081_Human_Abilities_Emotional_Intelligence|archivedate = 2015-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, substantial disagreement exists regarding the definition of EI, with respect to both terminology and operationalizations. Currently, there are three main models of EI:
# Ability model
# Mixed model (usually subsumed under trait EI)&lt;ref name="Kluemper, D.H. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kluemper | first1 = D.H. | year = 2008 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: The impact of core-self evaluations and social desirability | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 1402–1412 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.029 | last1 = Martins | first1 = A. | last2 = Ramalho | first2 = N. | last3 = Morin | first3 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 554–564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Trait model

Different models of EI have led to the development of various instruments for the [[psychometrics|assessment]] of the construct. While some of these measures may overlap, most researchers agree that they tap different constructs.

Specific ability models address the ways in which emotions facilitate thought and understanding. For example, emotions may interact with thinking and allow people to be better decision makers (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A  person who is more responsive emotionally to crucial issues will attend to the more crucial aspects of his or her life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aspects of  emotional  facilitation factor is to also know how  to include or exclude emotions from thought depending on context and situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is also related to [[emotional reasoning]] and understanding in response to the people, environment and circumstances one encounters in his or her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ability model ==

Salovey and Mayer's conception of EI strives to define EI within the confines of the standard criteria for a new intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.L. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Emotional intelligence as a standard intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacCann | first1 = C. | last2 = Joseph | first2 = D.L. | last3 = Newman | first3 = D.A. | last4 = Roberts | first4 = R.D. | year = 2014 | title = Emotional intelligence is a second-stratum factor of intelligence: Evidence from hierarchical and bifactor models | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 358–374 | doi=10.1037/a0034755| pmid = 24341786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their continuing research, their initial definition of EI was revised to "The ability to perceive emotion, integrate emotion to facilitate thought, understand emotions and to regulate emotions to promote personal growth." However, after pursuing further research, their definition of EI evolved into "the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth." &lt;ref name="Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications" /&gt;

The ability-based model views emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.D., &amp; Salovey, P. (1997). What is emotional intelligence? In P. Salovey &amp; D. Sluyter (Eds.), Emotional development and emotional intelligence: Implications for educators (pp. 3–31). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grewal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P | last2 = Grewal | first2 = D | year = 2005 | title = The Science of Emotional Intelligence | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 6| page = 6 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00381.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model proposes that individuals vary in their ability to process information of an emotional nature and in their ability to relate emotional processing to a wider cognition. This ability is seen to manifest itself in certain adaptive behaviors. The model claims that EI includes four types of abilities:
# Perceiving emotions – the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts—including the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.
# Using emotions – the ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem solving. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing [[mood (psychology)|moods]] in order to best fit the task at hand.
# Understanding emotions – the ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions. For example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.
# Managing emotions – the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. Therefore, the emotionally intelligent person can harness emotions, even negative ones, and manage them to achieve intended goals.

The ability EI model has been criticized in the research for lacking face and predictive validity in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|author1=Bradberry, T.|author2=Su, L.|date=2003|title=Ability-versus skill-based assessment of emotional intelligence|journal=Psicothema|volume=18|pages=59–66|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-03-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905061723/http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-05|df=|pmid=17295959}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in terms of construct validity, ability EI tests have great advantage over self-report scales of EI because they compare individual maximal performance to standard performance scales and do not rely on individuals' endorsement of descriptive statements about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of competing measures of emotional intelligence|last = Brackett M.A. &amp; J.D.

=== Measurement ===

The current measure of Mayer and Salovey's model of EI, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test]] (MSCEIT) is based on a series of emotion-based problem-solving items.&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.R. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2003 | title = Measuring emotional intelligence with the MSCEIT V2.0 | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 97–105 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.97| pmid = 12899321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the model's claim of EI as a type of intelligence, the test is modeled on ability-based [[IQ tests]]. By testing a person's abilities on each of the four branches of emotional intelligence, it generates scores for each of the branches as well as a total score.

Central to the four-branch model is the idea that EI requires attunement to [[social norms]]. Therefore, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is [[consensus based assessment|scored in a consensus fashion]], with higher scores indicating higher overlap between an individual's answers and those provided by a worldwide sample of respondents. The MSCEIT can also be expert-scored, so that the amount of overlap is calculated between an individual's answers and those provided by a group of 21 [[emotion|emotion researchers]].&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;

Although promoted as an ability test, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is unlike standard IQ tests in that its items do not have objectively correct responses. Among other challenges, the consensus scoring criterion means that it is impossible to create items (questions) that only a minority of respondents can solve, because, by definition, responses are deemed emotionally "intelligent" only if the majority of the sample has endorsed them. This and other similar problems have led some cognitive ability experts to question the definition of EI as a genuine intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In a study by Føllesdal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |title=Emotional Intelligence as Ability: Assessing the Construct Validity of Scores from the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) |author=Hallvard Føllesdal |others=PhD Thesis and accompanying papers – University of Oslo 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216094950/http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |archivedate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test results of 111 business leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was found that there were no correlations between a leader's test results and how he or she was rated by the employees, with regard to [[empathy]], ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove answers to these 19 questions before scoring but without stating this officially.

=== Other measurements ===
Various other specific measures have also been used to assess ability in emotional intelligence. These measures include:
# Diagnostic Analysis of Non-verbal Accuracy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – The Adult Facial version includes  24 photographs of equal amount of happy, sad, angry, and fearful facial expressions of both high and low intensities which are balanced by gender. The tasks of the participants is to answer which of the four emotions is present in the given stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Japanese and Caucasian Brief Affect Recognition test&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants try to identify 56 faces of Caucasian and Japanese individuals expressing seven emotions such happiness, contempt, disgust, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear, which may also trail  off for 0.2 seconds to a different emotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants reads 26 social scenes and answers their anticipated feelings and continuum of low to high emotional awareness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mixed model ==

The model introduced by Daniel Goleman&lt;ref name="goleman98"&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working with emotional intelligence. New York: Bantam Books&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on EI as a wide array of competencies and skills that drive leadership performance. Goleman's model outlines five main EI constructs (for more details see "What Makes A Leader" by Daniel Goleman, best of Harvard Business Review 1998):

# [[Self-awareness]] – the ability to know one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, drives, values and goals and recognize their impact on others while using [[gut feeling]]s to guide decisions.
# [[Emotional self-regulation|Self-regulation]] – involves controlling or redirecting one's disruptive emotions and impulses and adapting to changing circumstances.
# [[Social skill]] – managing relationships to move people in the desired direction
# [[Empathy]] – considering other people's feelings especially when making decisions
# [[Motivation]] – being driven to achieve for the sake of achievement

Goleman includes a set of [[emotional competence|emotional competencies]] within each construct of EI. Emotional competencies are not innate talents, but rather learned capabilities that must be worked on and can be developed to achieve outstanding performance. Goleman posits that individuals are born with a general emotional intelligence that determines their potential for learning emotional competencies.&lt;ref name="boy"&gt;Boyatzis, R., Goleman, D., &amp; Rhee, K. (2000). Clustering competence in emotional intelligence: insights from the emotional competence inventory (ECI). In R. Bar-On &amp; J.D.A. Parker (eds.): Handbook of emotional intelligence (pp. 343–362). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman's model of EI has been criticized in the research literature as mere "[[pop psychology]]" (Mayer, Roberts, &amp; Barsade, 2008).

=== Measurement ===

Two measurement tools are based on the Goleman model:
# The Emotional Competency Inventory (ECI), which was created in 1999, and the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI), a newer edition of the ECI was developed in 2007. The Emotional and Social Competency – University Edition (ESCI-U) is also available. These tools developed by Goleman and [[Richard Boyatzis|Boyatzis]] provide a behavioral measure of the Emotional and Social competencies.
# [[The Emotional Intelligence Appraisal]], which was created in 2001 and which can be taken as a self-report or 360-degree assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Bradberry, Travis and Greaves, Jean. (2009). ''[[Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]''. San Francisco: Publishers Group West. {{ISBN|978-0-9743206-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trait model ==
{{See also|Trait theory}}
Konstantinos Vasilis Petrides ("K. V. Petrides") proposed a conceptual distinction between the ability based model and a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] based model of EI and has been developing the latter over many years in numerous publications.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petrides07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Pita | first2 = R. | last3 = Kokkinaki | first3 = F. | year = 2007 | title = The location of trait emotional intelligence in personality factor space | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 273–289 | doi=10.1348/000712606x120618| pmid = 17456273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trait EI is "a constellation of emotional self-perceptions located at the lower levels of personality."&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; In lay terms, trait EI refers to an individual's self-perceptions of their emotional abilities. This definition of EI encompasses behavioral dispositions and self-perceived abilities and is measured by [[self-report inventory|self report]], as opposed to the ability based model which refers to actual abilities, which have proven highly resistant to scientific measurement. Trait EI should be investigated within a [[personality psychology|personality]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: Psychometric investigation with reference to established trait taxonomies | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 425–448 | doi=10.1002/per.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative label for the same construct is trait emotional [[self-efficacy]].

The trait EI model is general and subsumes the Goleman model discussed above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait leads to a construct that lies outside the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of human cognitive ability. This is an important distinction in as much as it bears directly on the operationalization of the construct and the theories and hypotheses that are formulated about it.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;

=== Measurement ===

There are many self-report measures of EI,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, J.C., Petrides, K.V., &amp; Furnham, A. (2005). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.294&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Measuring trait emotional intelligence]. In R. Schulze and R.D. Roberts (Eds.), International Handbook of Emotional Intelligence (pp.181–201). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Hogrefe &amp; Huber.&lt;/ref&gt; including the EQ-i, the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT), and the Schutte EI model. None of these assess intelligence, abilities, or skills (as their authors often claim), but rather, they are limited measures of trait emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name="petrides07" /&gt; The most widely used and widely researched measure of self-report or self-schema (as it is currently referred to) emotional intelligence is the EQ-i 2.0. Originally known as the [[Reuven Bar-On|BarOn]] EQ-i, it was the first self-report measure of emotional intelligence available, the only measure predating Goleman's best-selling book. There are over 200 studies that have used the EQ-i or EQ-i 2.0. It has the best norms, reliability, and validity of any self-report instrument and was the first one reviewed in Buros Mental Measures Book. The EQ-i 2.0 is available in many different languages as it is used worldwide.

The TEIQue provides an operationalization for the model of Petrides and colleagues, that conceptualizes EI in terms of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: behavioral validation in two studies of emotion recognition and reactivity to mood induction | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 39–75 | doi=10.1002/per.466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test encompasses 15 subscales organized under four factors: [[Quality of life|well-being]], [[self-control]], [[emotionality]], and [[sociability]]. The [[psychometrics|psychometric]] properties of the TEIQue were investigated in a study on a French-speaking population, where it was reported that TEIQue scores were globally [[normally distributed]] and [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = Luminet | last2 = Leroy | last3 = Roy | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric Properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: Factor Structure, Reliability, Construct, and Incremental Validity in a French-Speaking Population | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning ([[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's matrices]]), which they interpreted as support for the personality trait view of EI (as opposed to a form of intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were positively related to some of the [[Big Five personality traits]] ([[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[openness to experience|openness]], [[conscientiousness]]) as well as inversely related to others ([[alexithymia]], [[neuroticism]]). A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0013439 | last1 = Vernon | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Petrides | first2 = K.V. | last3 = Bratko | first3 = D. | last4 = Schermer | first4 = J.A. | year = 2008 | title = A behavioral genetic study of trait emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 635–642 | pmid = 18837613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00049530903312857 | last1 = Gardner | first1 = J.

== General effects ==
A review published in the journal of ''Annual Psychology'' found that higher emotional intelligence is positively correlated with:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for children – Among children and teens, emotional intelligence positively correlates with good social interactions, relationships and negatively correlates with deviance from social norms, anti-social behavior measured both in and out of school as reported by children themselves, their own family members as well as their teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for adults – High emotional intelligence among adults is correlated with better self-perception of social ability and more successful interpersonal relationships while less interpersonal aggression and problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Highly emotionally intelligent individuals are perceived more positively by others – Other individuals perceive those with high EI to be more pleasant, socially skilled and empathic to be around.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better family and intimate relationships – High EI is correlated with better relationships with the family and intimate partners on many aspects.
# Better academic achievement – Emotional intelligence is correlated with greater achievement in academics as reported by teachers but generally not  higher grades once the factor of IQ is taken into account.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations during work performance and in negotiations – Higher emotional intelligence is correlated with better social dynamics at work as well as better negotiating ability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better psychological well-being - Emotional intelligence is positively correlated with higher [[life satisfaction]], self-esteem and lower levels of insecurity or depression. It is also negatively correlated with poor health choices and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Allows for self-compassion - Emotionally intelligent individuals are more likely to have a better understanding of themselves, and to make conscious decisions based on emotion and rationale combined. Overall, it leads a person to [[Self-actualization|self-actualization]].&lt;ref name="Self-compassion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heffernan|first1=Mary|last2=Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=McNulty|first3=Rita|last4=Fitzpatrick|first4=Joyce|date=2010|title=Self-compassion and emotional intelligence in nurses|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c8f7/332816fda3b9f702204718ff69e773f1ed05.pdf|journal=International Journal of Nursing Practice|volume=16|pages=366–373|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of theoretical foundation ==

=== Cannot be recognized as form of intelligence ===
Goleman's early work has been criticized for assuming from the beginning that EI is a type of intelligence or [[cognitive ability]]. Eysenck (2000)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|author-link = Hans Eysenck|last = Eysenck|first = H.J.|title = Intelligence: A New Look|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7658-0707-6|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Goleman's description of EI contains unsubstantiated assumptions about intelligence in general, and that it even runs contrary to what researchers have come to expect when studying types of intelligence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Goleman] exemplifies more clearly than most the fundamental absurdity of the tendency to class almost any type of behavior as an 'intelligence'... If these five 'abilities' define 'emotional intelligence', we would expect some evidence that they are highly correlated; Goleman admits that they might be quite uncorrelated, and in any case if we cannot measure them, how do we know they are related? So the whole theory is built on quicksand: there is no sound scientific basis."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Locke (2005)&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.318 | last1 = Locke | first1 = E.A. | year = 2005 | title = Why emotional intelligence is an invalid concept | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 425–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the concept of EI is in itself a misinterpretation of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp [[abstractions]]—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labeled and referred to as a skill.

The essence of this criticism is that scientific inquiry depends on valid and consistent construct utilization, and that before the introduction of the term EI, psychologists had established theoretical distinctions between factors such as abilities and achievements, skills and habits, attitudes and values, and personality traits and emotional states.&lt;ref name="everydaypsychology"&gt;Mattiuzzi, P.G. (2008) [http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html Emotional Intelligence? I'm not feeling it.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720053237/http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html |date=2009-07-20 }} everydaypsychology.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some scholars believe that the term ''EI'' merges and conflates such accepted concepts and definitions.

=== Confusing skills with moral qualities ===

[[Adam Grant]] warned of the common but mistaken perception of EI as a desirable moral quality rather than a skill, Grant asserting that a well-developed EI is not only an instrumental tool for accomplishing goals, but has a dark side as a weapon for manipulating others by robbing them of their capacity to reason.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic20140102&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |title=The Dark Side of Emotional Intelligence |last=Grant |first=Adam |date=January 2, 2014 |website=The Atlantic |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MsAko357?url=http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Has little predictive value ===

Landy (2005)&lt;ref name="landy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landy | first1 = F.J. | year = 2005 | title = Some historical and scientific issues related to research on emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 411–424 | doi=10.1002/job.317}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the few [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] validity studies conducted on EI have shown that it adds little or nothing to the explanation or prediction of some common outcomes (most notably academic and work success). Landy suggested that the reason why some studies have found a small increase in [[predictive validity]] is a [[methodology|methodological]] fallacy, namely, that alternative explanations have not been completely considered:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"EI is compared and contrasted with a measure of abstract intelligence but not with a personality measure, or with a personality measure but not with a measure of academic intelligence." Landy (2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, other researchers have raised concerns about the extent to which self-report EI measures [[correlation|correlate]] with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures have been said to converge because they both purport to measure personality traits.&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] that stand out as most related to self-report EI&amp;nbsp;– [[neuroticism]] and [[extroversion]]. In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.

The interpretations of the correlations between EI questionnaires and personality have been varied. The prominent view in the scientific literature is the Trait EI view, which re-interprets EI as a collection of personality traits.&lt;ref name="Mikolajczak07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = M. | last2 = Luminet | first2 = O. | last3 = Leroy | first3 = C. | last4 = Roy | first4 = E. | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = L. | last2 = Ciarrochi | first2 = J. | last3 = Heaven | first3 = P.

== Criticisms of measurement ==

=== Ability model ===
[[File:Tom Reed speaks at NAVAIR’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event.jpg|thumb|right|A speaker describes four stages of emotional intelligence: [[self-awareness]], [[social consciousness]], [[self-care]] and relationship management, as part of [[NAVAIR]]’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event]]

====Measures conformity, not ability ====
One criticism of the works of Mayer and Salovey comes from a study by Roberts et al. (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.D. | last2 = Zeidner | first2 = M. | last3 = Matthews | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Does emotional intelligence meet traditional standards for an intelligence? Some new data and conclusions | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 196–231 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.196| pmid = 12934681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the EI, as measured by the MSCEIT, may only be measuring conformity. This argument is rooted in the MSCEIT's use of consensus-based assessment, and in the fact that scores on the MSCEIT are negatively distributed (meaning that its scores differentiate between people with low EI better than people with high EI).

==== Measures knowledge, not ability ====
Further criticism has been leveled by Brody (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brody |first1=N |year=2004 |title=What cognitive intelligence is and what emotional intelligence is not |url=http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=234–238 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1503_03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207093225/http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks that are related to the knowledge that is assessed". The main argument is that even though someone knows how he or she should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.

==== Measures personality and general intelligence ====
New research is surfacing that suggests that ability EI measures might be measuring personality in addition to general intelligence. These studies examined the multivariate effects of personality and intelligence on EI and also corrected estimates for measurement error (which is often not done in some validation studies)[cite source]. For example, a study by Schulte, Ree, Carretta (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schulte | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Ree | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Carretta | first3 = T. R. | year = 2004 | title = Emotional intelligence: Not much more than g and personality | url = | = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 1059–1068 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that general intelligence (measured with the Wonderlic Personnel Test), agreeableness (measured by the NEO-PI), as well as gender could reliably be used to predict the measure of EI ability.

They gave a multiple correlation (R) of .81 with the MSCEIT (perfect prediction would be 1). This result has been replicated by Fiori and Antonakis (2011),;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiori | first1 = M. | last2 = Antonakis | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = The ability model of emotional intelligence: Searching for valid measures | url = https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_B46FDCF00E58| journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 329–334 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.10.010 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; they found a multiple R of .76 using Cattell’s "Culture Fair" intelligence test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI); significant covariates were intelligence (standardized beta = .39), agreeableness (standardized beta = .54), and openness (standardized beta = .46). Antonakis and Dietz (2011a),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Dietz | first2 = J. | year = 2011a | title = Looking for Validity or Testing It?

§

=== Self-report measures susceptible to faking ===
More formally termed socially desirable responding (SDR), faking good is defined as a response pattern in which test-takers systematically represent themselves with an excessive positive bias (Paulhus, 2002). This bias has long been known to contaminate responses on personality inventories (Holtgraves, 2004; McFarland &amp; Ryan, 2000; Peebles &amp; Moore, 1998; Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Zerbe &amp; Paulhus, 1987), acting as a mediator of the relationships between self-report measures (Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Gangster et al., 1983).{{full citation needed|date=July 2012}}

It has been suggested that responding in a desirable way is a response set, which is a situational and temporary response pattern (Pauls &amp; Crost, 2004; Paulhus, 1991). This is contrasted with a response style, which is a more long-term trait-like quality. Considering the contexts some self-report EI inventories are used in (e.g., employment settings), the problems of response sets in high-stakes scenarios become clear (Paulhus &amp; Reid, 2001).

There are a few methods to prevent socially desirable responding on behavior inventories. Some researchers believe it is necessary to warn test-takers not to fake good before taking a personality test (e.g., McFarland, 2003). Some inventories use validity scales in order to determine the likelihood or consistency of the responses across all items.

=== Predictive power unsubstantiated ===
Landy&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; distinguishes between the "commercial wing" and "the academic wing" of the EI movement, basing this distinction on the alleged predictive power of EI as seen by the two currents. According to Landy, the former makes expansive claims on the applied value of EI, while the latter is trying to warn users against these claims. As an example, Goleman (1998) asserts that "the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. ...emotional intelligence is the sine qua non of leadership". In contrast, Mayer (1999) cautions "the popular literature's implication—that highly emotionally intelligent people possess an unqualified advantage in life—appears overly enthusiastic at present and unsubstantiated by reasonable scientific standards." Landy further reinforces this argument by noting that the data upon which these claims are based are held in "proprietary databases", which means they are unavailable to independent researchers for reanalysis, replication, or verification.&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; Thus, the credibility of the findings cannot be substantiated in a scientific way, unless those datasets are made public and available for independent analysis.

In an academic exchange, Antonakis and Ashkanasy/Dasborough mostly agreed that researchers testing whether EI matters for leadership have not done so using robust research designs; therefore, currently there is no strong evidence showing that EI predicts leadership outcomes when accounting for personality and IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Ashkanasy | first2 = N. M. | last3 = Dasborough | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Does leadership need emotional intelligence? | url = https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_F989E68B6F71| journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 247–261 | doi = 10.1016/j.leaqua.2009.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonakis argued that EI might not be needed for leadership effectiveness (he referred to this as the "curse of emotion" phenomenon, because leaders who are too sensitive to their and others' emotional states might have difficulty making decisions that would result in [[emotional labor]] for the leader or followers). A recently published meta-analysis seems to support the Antonakis position: In fact, Harms and Credé found that overall (and using data free from problems of common source and common methods), EI measures correlated only [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|ρ]] = 0.11 with measures of [[transformational leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harms | first1 = P.

Meta-analytic evidence confirms that self-reported emotional intelligence predicting job performance is due to mixed EI and trait EI measures' tapping into self-efficacy and self-rated performance, in addition to the domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and IQ. As such, the predictive ability of mixed EI to job performance drops to nil when controlling for these factors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Joseph | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Jin | first2 = J. | last3 = Newman | first3 = D.A. | last4 = O'Boyle | first4 = E.H. | year = 2015 | title = Why Does Self-Reported Emotional Intelligence Predict Job Performance?

=== NICHD pushes for consensus ===
The [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] has recognized that because there are divisions about the topic of emotional intelligence, the mental health community needs to agree on some guidelines to describe good mental health and positive mental living conditions. In their section, "Positive Psychology and the Concept of Health", they explain. "Currently there are six competing models of positive health, which are based on concepts such as being above normal, character strengths and core virtues, developmental maturity, social-emotional intelligence, subjective well-being, and [[Psychological resilience|resilience]]. But these concepts define health in philosophical rather than empirical terms. Dr. [Lawrence] Becker suggested the need for a consensus on the concept of positive psychological health...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nitkin |first1=Ralph |last2=Harris |first2=Meredith |date=August 29, 2006 |title=National Advisory Board on Medical Rehabilitation Research: Meeting for Minutes for December 2–3, 2004 |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716163703/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |publisher=[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactions with other phenomena ==

=== Bullying ===
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence}}
[[Bullying]] is [[abusive]] [[social interaction]] between peers which can include [[aggression]], [[harassment]], and [[violence]]. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Approach to bullying and victimization|journal = Canadian Family Physician|date = 2009-04-01|issn = 0008-350X|pmc = 2669002|pmid = 19366941|pages = 356–360|volume = 55|issue = 4|first = Jennifer|last = Lamb|first2 = Debra J.|last2 = Pepler|first3 = Wendy|last3 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relationship between bullying, victimization, trait emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and empathy among preadolescents|journal = Social Psychology of Education|date = 2011-07-26|issn = 1381-2890|pages = 41–58|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9|first = Constantinos M.|last = Kokkinos|first2 = Eirini|last2 = Kipritsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brief report: Emotional intelligence, victimisation and bullying in adolescents|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014019711100025X|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2012-02-01|pages = 207–211|volume = 35|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002|pmid = 21470670|first = Justine|last = Lomas|first2 = Con|last2 = Stough|first3 = Karen|last3 = Hansen|first4 = Luke A.|last4 = Downey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have shown that emotional intelligence is a key factor in the analysis of cases of cybervictimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rey|first=Lourdes|last2=Quintana-Orts|first2=Cirenia|last3=Mérida-López|first3=Sergio|last4=Extremera|first4=Natalio|date=2018-07-01|title=Emotional intelligence and peer cybervictimisation in adolescents: Gender as moderator|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|pages=09–18|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-01|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

by demonstrating a relevant impact on health and social adaptation.   Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 | pmid = 17937602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name="Tolegenova"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tolegenova | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Jakupov | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Cheung Chung | first3 = Man | last4 = Saduova | first4 = S. | last5 = Jakupov | first5 = M.S | year = 2012 | title = A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents | journal = Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 1891–1894 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Job performance ===
{{Main|Job performance and emotional intelligence}}
Research of EI and [[job performance]] shows mixed results: a positive relation has been found in some of the studies, while in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006)&lt;ref name="Côté 2006" /&gt; to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and job performance becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, &amp; Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. It has also been observed that there is no significant link between emotional intelligence and work attitude behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relojo|first1=D.|last2=Pilao|first2=S.J.|last3=Dela Rosa|first3=R.|title=From passion to emotion: Emotional quotient as predictor of work attitude behavior among faculty member|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2015|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1–10|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1098164.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study suggests that EI is not necessarily a universally positive trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farh|first=C. C.|author2=Seo, Tesluk|title=Emotional Intelligence, Teamwork Effectiveness, and Job Performance: The Moderating Role of Job Context|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=March 5, 2012|volume=97|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0027377|pages=890–900|pmid=22390388}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmetoglu|first=Gorkan|author2=Leutner, Franziska|author3=Chamorro-Premuzic, Tomas|title=EQ-nomics: Understanding the relationship between individual differences in trait emotional intelligence and entrepreneurship|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=December 2011|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1028–1033|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.016&lt;!--pmid=893295016--&gt;|url=http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101125012/http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although studies between emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance has shown mixed results of high and low correlations, EI is undeniably better predictor than most of the hiring methods commonly used in companies, such as [[Recommendation letter|letter of references]], [[cover letter]], among others. By 2008, 147 companies and consulting firms in U.S had developed programmes that involved EI for training and hiring employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Dana L.|last2=Jin|first2=Jing|last3=Newman|first3=Daniel A.|last4=O’Boyle|first4=Ernest H.|title=Why does self-reported emotional intelligence predict job performance?

These findings may contribute organisations in different ways. For instance, employees high on EI would be more aware of their own emotions and from others, which in turn, could lead companies to better profits and less unnecessary expenses. This is especially important for expatriate managers, who have to deal with mixed emotions and feelings, while adapting to a new working culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, employees high in EI show more confidence in their roles, which allow them to face demanding tasks positively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sy|first=Thomas|last2=Tram|first2=Susanna|last3=O’Hara|first3=Linda A.|date=2006-06-01|title=Relation of employee and manager emotional intelligence to job satisfaction and performance|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879105001260|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=68|issue=3|pages=461–473|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2005.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a popular science book by the journalist Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goleman|first1=Daniel|title=Emotional Intelligence|date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780747526254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI. This measured by self-reports and different work performance indicators, such as wages, promotions and salary increase.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=Kenneth S.|last2=Wong|first2=Chi-Sum|last3=Song|first3=Lynda J.|title=The Construct and Criterion Validity of Emotional Intelligence and Its Potential Utility for Management Studies|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=89|issue=3|pages=483–496|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.3.483|pmid=15161407|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lopes and his colleagues (2006),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Paulo N.|last2=Grewal|first2=Daisy|last3=Kadis|first3=Jessica|last4=Gall|first4=Michelle|last5=Salovey|first5=Peter|date=2006-01-01|title=Evidence that emotional intelligence is related to job performance and affect and attitudes at work|journal=Psicothema|volume=18 Suppl|pages=132–138|issn=0214-9915|pmid=17295970}}&lt;/ref&gt; EI contributes to develop strong and positive relationships with co-workers and perform efficiently in work teams. This benefits performance of workers by providing emotional support and instrumental resources needed to succeed in their roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seibert|first=Scott E.|last2=Kraimer|first2=Maria L.|last3=Liden|first3=Robert C.|date=2001-01-01|title=A Social Capital Theory of Career Success|jstor=3069452|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=219–237|doi=10.2307/3069452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, emotional intelligent employees have better resources to cope with stressing situations and demanding tasks, which enable them to outperform in those situations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For instance, Law et al. (2004)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; found that EI was the best predictor of job performance beyond general cognitive ability among IT scientist in computer company in China. Similarly, Sy, Tram, and O’Hara (2006)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; found that EI was associated positively with job performance in employees from a food service company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vratskikh|first=Ivan|last2=Masa'deh|first2=Ra'ed (Moh’dTaisir)|last3=Al-Lozi|first3=Musa|last4=Maqableh|first4=Mahmoud|date=2016-01-25|title=The Impact of Emotional Intelligence on Job Performance via the Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijbm/article/view/55548|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|volume=11|issue=2|pages=69|doi=10.5539/ijbm.v11n2p69|issn=1833-8119|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416060903/http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijbm/article/view/55548|archivedate=2016-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the job performance – emotional intelligence correlation is important to consider the effects of [[Managing up and managing down|managing up]], which refers to the good and positive relationship between the employee and his/her supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|title=What Everyone Should Know About Managing Up|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-04-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426042345/https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|archivedate=2016-04-26|df=|date=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research found that quality of this relationship could interfere in the results of the subjective rating of job performance evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Onne|last2=Yperen|first2=Nico W. Van|date=2004-06-01|title=Employees' Goal Orientations, the Quality of Leader-Member Exchange, and the Outcomes of Job Performance and Job Satisfaction|url=http://amj.aom.org/content/47/3/368|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=47|issue=3|pages=368–384|doi=10.2307/20159587|issn=0001-4273|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321034021/http://amj.aom.org/content/47/3/368|archivedate=2015-03-21|df=|jstor=20159587|hdl=2066/64290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligent employees devote more of their working time on managing their relationship with supervisors. Hence, the likelihood of  obtaining better results on performance evaluation is greater for employees high in EI than for employees with low EI.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Based on theoretical and methodological approaches, EI measures are categorized in three main streams: (1) stream 1: ability-based measures (e.g. MSCEIT), (2) stream 2: self-reports of abilities measures (e.g. SREIT, SUEIT and WLEIS) and (3) stream 3: mixed-models (e.g. AES, ECI, EI questionnaire, EIS, EQ-I and GENOS), which include measures of EI and traditional social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashkanasy|first=Neal M.|last2=Daus|first2=Catherine S.|date=2005-06-01|title=Rumors of the death of emotional intelligence in organizational behavior are vastly exaggerated|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=26|issue=4|pages=441–452|doi=10.1002/job.320|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O’Boyle Jr. and his colleagues (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle|first=Ernest H.|last2=Humphrey|first2=Ronald H.|last3=Pollack|first3=Jeffrey M.|last4=Hawver|first4=Thomas H.|last5=Story|first5=Paul A.|date=2011-07-01|title=The relation between emotional intelligence and job performance: A meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=32|issue=5|pages=788–818|doi=10.1002/job.714|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the three EI streams together had a positive correlation of 0.28 with job performance. Similarly, each of EI streams independently obtained a positive correlation of 0.24, 0.30 and 0.28, respectively. Stream 2 and 3 showed an incremental validity for predicting job performance over and above personality ([[Big Five personality traits|Five Factor model]]) and [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability]]. Both, stream 2 and 3 were the second most important predictor of job performance below [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability.]] Stream 2 explained 13.6% of the total variance; whereas stream 3, explained 13.2%. In order to examine the reliability of these findings, a publication bias analysis was developed. Results indicated that studies on EI-job performance correlation prior to 2010 do not present substantial evidences to suggest the presence of [[publication bias]].

Despite the validity of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings.&lt;ref name="Côté 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Côté|first=Stéphane|last2=Miners|first2=Christopher T. H.|date=2006-01-01|title=Emotional Intelligence, Cognitive Intelligence, and Job Performance|jstor=20109857|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.2189/asqu.51.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is not as strong as suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farh|first=Crystal I. C.

Moon and Hur (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=Tae Won|last2=Hur|first2=Won-Moo|date=2011-09-01|title=Emotional Intelligence, Emotional Exhaustion, And Job Performance|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2011/00000039/00000008/art00008?token=004e15b5ca926383a4b3b2570507b457a2438383b40664c2a726e2d58464340592f3f3b575b18b|journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal|volume=39|issue=8|pages=1087–1096|doi=10.2224/sbp.2011.39.8.1087|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624215721/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2011/00000039/00000008/art00008?token=004e15b5ca926383a4b3b2570507b457a2438383b40664c2a726e2d58464340592f3f3b575b18b|archivedate=2016-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that [[emotional exhaustion]] (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. [[Emotional exhaustion]] showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high [[emotional exhaustion]] contexts.

=== Health ===
A 2007 meta-analysis of 44 effect sizes by Schutte found that emotional intelligence was associated with better mental and physical health. Particularly, trait EI had the stronger association with mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194|title=A meta-analytic investigation of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health|author=Schutte|date=1 April 2007|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208060534/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194_A_meta-analytic_investigation_of_the_relationship_between_emotional_intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replicated again in 2010 by researcher Alexandra Martin  who found trait EI as a strong predictor for health after conducting a meta-analysis based on 105 effect sizes and 19,815 participants. This meta-analysis also indicated that this line of research reached enough sufficiency and stability in concluding EI as a positive predictor for health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042|title=A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and health|author=Alexandra Martins|date=1 October 2010|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045106/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042_A_comprehensive_meta-analysis_of_the_relationship_between_Emotional_Intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-esteem and drug dependence ===
A 2012 study cross examined emotional intelligence, [[self-esteem]] and [[marijuana]] dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehra|first=D. K.|author2=Sharma, Mushtaq, Sharma, Sharma, Nehra|title=Emotional intelligence and self esteem in cannabis abusers|journal=[[Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology]] |date=July 2012|volume=38|issue=2|pages=385–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a sample of 200, 100 of whom were dependent on cannabis and the other 100 emotionally healthy, the dependent group scored exceptionally low on EI when compared to the control group. They also found that the dependent group also scored low on self-esteem when compared to the control.

Another study in 2010 examined whether or not low levels of EI had a relationship with the degree of [[Substance dependence|drug]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol]] addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Chiu|author2=Chiu, Edmond|author3=Neill, Lloyd|author4=Tobin, Juliet|author5=Reid, John|title=Is low emotional intelligence a primary causal factor in drug and alcohol addiction?|journal=Australian Academic Press (Bowen Hills, QLD, Australia)|date=16 Jan 2012|pages=91–101|url=http://0-search.proquest.com.helin.uri.edu/docview/916528622?accountid=28991}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the assessment of 103 residents in a drug rehabilitation center, they examined their EI along with other psychosocial factors in a one-month interval of treatment. They found that participants' EI scores improved as their levels of addiction lessened as part of their treatment.

== Utilization ==
It has been noted that having EI as a skill can increase one's own [https://eclass.teicrete.gr/modules/document/file.php/IP-ERLSF116/Mayer-Salovey.1993-libre.pdf well being]. In other words, individuals who are conscious of the emotions of themselves and others have the privilege of enhancing relationships. It also allows people to see the multiple perspectives of a given situation, and acknowledge others' feelings about the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1627">Around 2006, the [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] instituted the admission of foreign students to [[China]] for medical instruction using [[English language|English]] as the language of instruction. Students are eligible to earn basic degrees in either Medicine ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]]) or Dentistry ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]]).

To ensure adequate quality control, only a few choice medical schools are allowed specific quotas for admitting international students into these programs. Other Chinese medical institutions are not barred from admitting international students, but the government maintains that these other students would have to be admitted into the medical programs taught in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.205.177.9/english/tongzhi_070810.htm Interim provisions for Quality Control Standards on Undergraduate Medical Education in English for International Students in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

This list of universities is reviewed each year and currently{{when?|date=May 2018}} stands at 50 schools.

These schools are thus officially recognized by the [[Avicenna Directories|WHO]] and the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|MOE]].

::''You are the best community that has been raised up for mankind: '''You enjoin What is right and forbid What is evil''', and You believe in Allah; if the people of the scripture deary it, it had been better for them, some of them believers, but most of them are evil-livers.''&lt;ref name="GFQ" /&gt;

==Hadith examples==
[[Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri]] reported that the prophet [[Muhammad]] said, "Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand. If he is not able to do so, then with his tongue. And if he is not able to do so, then with his heart, and that is the weakest form of faith".&lt;ref name="TKFD" /&gt;

A standard medieval interpretation of this Hadith is, as [[Al-Nawawi]] had explained, that such passages of scripture had to be interpreted in accordance with established Shariah principles, such as the state's sole prerogative in declaring [[jihad]]. 'Changing the reprehensible by hand,' or by compulsion, was the purview of the state alone. 'Changing with the tongue' was the right of the ulama. Ordinary, individual Muslims should only reject the reprehensible with their hearts.&lt;ref name="jacb"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = A.C. Brown|first1 = Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

==Conditions (interpretation)==
A person should have knowledge of what is considered ''[[Fard|wajib]]'' (obligatory or duty) and ''[[haram]]'' (sinful or forbidden) in relation to interpreting the two requisites although in a broad-spectrum.

The '''High Power laser Energy Research facility''' ('''HiPER'''), is a proposed experimental laser-driven [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the [[European Union]]. HiPER is the first experiment designed specifically to study the "fast ignition" approach to generating [[nuclear fusion]], which uses much smaller [[laser]]s than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude. This offers a total "[[fusion gain]]" that is much higher than devices like the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF), and a reduction in construction costs of about ten times.

Theoretical research since the design of HiPER in the early 2000s has cast doubt on fast ignition as a route to practical ICF. A new approach known as ''shock ignition'' has been proposed to address some of these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=LJ |last=Perkins |url=http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/LLNL-LDRD-refs2009/Perkins-PRL09.pdf |title=Shock Ignition: A New Approach to High Gain Inertial Confinement Fusion on the National Ignition Facility |date=2009 |journal=Physical Review Letters|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.103.045004 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103d5004P }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ICF experimental setup in Japan was known as "HIPER", but this is no longer operational.

==Background==
{{main|inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|l1=ICF mechanism}}
[[Inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) devices use "drivers" to rapidly heat the outer layers of a "target" to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. The heat of the laser burns the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inwards due to [[Newton's Third Law]], eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel. When it reaches the center of the fuel and meets the shock from the other side of the target, the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it. If the temperature and density of that small spot can be raised high enough, fusion reactions will occur.&lt;ref name=how&gt;"[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ How NIF works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=27 May 2010 }}", Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on 2 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which (primarily [[alpha particle]]s) collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down. This heats the fuel further, and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel—high enough density and temperature—this heating process can result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as "ignition", which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion, and the release of significant amounts of energy.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;Per F. Peterson, ''[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html Inertial Fusion Energy: A Tutorial on the Technology and Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927140724/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html |date=27 September 2011 }}'', University of California, Berkeley, 1998. Retrieved on 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the targets. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly to compress the core before it disassembles, as well as creating a suitable shock wave. The energy must also be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other "drivers" have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.&lt;ref&gt;Per F. Peterson, ''[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/target.html How IFE Targets Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617120937/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/target.html |date=17 June 2008 }}'', University of California, Berkeley, 1998.

==Description==
In the case of HiPER, the driver laser system is similar to existing systems like NIF, but considerably smaller and less powerful.

The driver consists of a number of "beamlines" containing [[Nd:glass laser]] amplifiers at one end of the building. Just prior to firing, the glass is [[laser pumping|"pumped"]] to a high-energy state with a series of [[xenon flash tube]]s, causing a [[population inversion]] of the [[neodymium]] (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via [[laser|stimulated emission]] when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a [[fibre optic]], is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; When this process is complete, a [[Pockels cell]] "switches" the light out of the cavity.&lt;ref name=d147&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; One problem for the HiPER project is that Nd:glass is no longer being produced commercially, so a number of options need to be studied to ensure supply of the estimated 1,300 disks.&lt;ref name=d147/&gt;

From there, the laser light is fed into a very long [[spatial filter]] to clean up the resulting pulse. The filter is essentially a telescope that focuses the beam into a spot some distance away, where a small pinhole located at the focal point cuts off any "stray" light caused by inhomogeneities in the laser beam. The beam then widens out until a second lens returns it to a straight beam again. It is the use of spatial filters that lead to the long beamlines seen in ICF laser devices. In the case of HiPER, the filters take up about 50% of the overall length. The beam width at exit of the driver system is about 40&amp;nbsp;cm × 40&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems encountered in previous experiments, notably the [[Shiva laser]], was that the [[infrared]] light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054&amp;nbsp;nm in ''vaco'') couples strongly with the [[electron]]s around the target, losing a considerable amount of energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an [[optical frequency multiplier]], which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or [[ultraviolet]], respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.&lt;ref&gt;S. Atzeni, et al., [http://www.hiper-laser.org/pressandpr/journalarticles/atzeni_et_al_april2008.pdf "Fast ignitor target studies for the HiPER project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205144210/http://www.hiper-laser.org/pressandpr/journalarticles/atzeni_et_al_april2008.pdf |date=5 December 2010 }}, ''Physics of Plasmas'', Vol. 15, 056311 (2008), {{doi|10.1063/1.2895447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the amplification process is complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying at one end of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10&amp;nbsp;picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

HiPER differs from most ICF devices in that it also includes a second set of lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as ''[[chirped pulse amplification]]'' (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of [[diffraction grating]]s and optical delays. This "stretches" the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1&amp;nbsp;m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5&amp;nbsp;kJ each to generate a total of 200&amp;nbsp;kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3&amp;nbsp;kJ to generate a total of 70&amp;nbsp;kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Frequency multiplication will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light. As of 2007, the baseline design is based on doubling into the green.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fast Ignition and HiPER==
In traditional ICF devices the driver laser is used to compress the target to very high densities. The shock wave created by this process further heats the compressed fuel when it collides in the center of the sphere. If the compression is symmetrical enough the increase in temperature can create conditions close to the [[Lawson criterion]], leading to significant fusion energy production. If the resulting fusion rate is high enough, the energy released in these reactions will heat the surrounding fuel to similar temperatures, causing them to undergo fusion as well. In this case, known as "ignition", a significant portion of the fuel will undergo fusion and release large amounts of energy. Ignition is the basic goal of any fusion device.

The amount of laser energy needed to effectively compress the targets to ignition conditions has grown rapidly from early estimates. In the "early days" of ICF research in the 1970s it was believed that as little as 1&amp;nbsp;[[kilojoules]] (kJ) would suffice,&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, pp. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of experimental lasers were built to reach these power levels. When they did, a series of problems, typically related to the homogeneity of the collapse, turned out to seriously disrupt the implosion symmetry and lead to much cooler core temperatures than originally expected. Through the 1980s the estimated energy required to reach ignition grew into the megajoule range, which appeared to make ICF impractical for fusion energy production. For instance, the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) uses about 330&amp;nbsp;MJ of electrical power to pump the driver lasers, and in the best case is expected to produce about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of fusion power output.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; Without dramatic gains in output, such a device would never be a practical energy source.

The fast ignition approach attempts to avoid these problems. Instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range, this approach directly heats the fuel. This is far more efficient than the shock wave, which becomes less important. In HiPER, the compression provided by the driver is "good", but not nearly that created by larger devices like NIF; HiPER's driver is about 200&amp;nbsp;kJ and produces densities of about 300&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. That's about one-third that of NIF, and about the same as generated by the earlier [[NOVA laser]] of the 1980s. For comparison, lead is about 11&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so this still represents a considerable amount of compression, notably when one considers the target's interior contained light D-T fuel around 0.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=hiper&gt;Dunne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignition is started by a very-short (~10&amp;nbsp;picoseconds) ultra-high-power (~70&amp;nbsp;kJ, 4&amp;nbsp;PW) laser pulse, aimed through a hole in the plasma at the core. The light from this pulse interacts with the fuel, generating a shower of high-energy (3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV) relativistic electrons that are driven into the fuel. The electrons heat a spot on one side of the dense core, and if this heating is localised enough it is expected to drive the area well beyond ignition energies.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

The overall efficiency of this approach is many times that of the conventional approach. In the case of NIF the laser generates about 4&amp;nbsp;MJ of [[infrared]] power to create ignition that releases about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; This corresponds to a "fusion gain" —the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power— of about 5. If one uses the baseline assumptions for the current HiPER design, the two lasers (driver and heater) produce about 270&amp;nbsp;kJ in total, yet generate 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;MJ, a gain of about 100.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Considering a variety of losses, the actual gain is predicted to be around 72.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Not only does this outperform NIF by a wide margin, the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well. In terms of power-for-cost, HiPER is expected to be about an [[order of magnitude]] less expensive than conventional devices like NIF.

Compression is already a fairly well-understood problem, and HiPER is primarily interested in exploring the precise physics of the rapid heating process. It is not clear how quickly the electrons stop in the fuel load; while this is known for matter under normal pressures, it's not for the ultra-dense conditions of the compressed fuel. To work efficiently, the electrons should stop in as short a distance as possible, to release their energy into a small spot and thus raise the temperature (energy per unit volume) as high as possible.

How to get the laser light onto that spot is also a matter for further research. One approach uses a short pulse from another laser to heat the plasma outside the dense "core", essentially burning a hole through it and exposing the dense fuel inside. This approach will be tested on the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics|OMEGA-EP]] system in the US. Another approach, tested successfully on the [[GEKKO XII]] laser in Japan, uses a small gold cone that cuts through a small area of the target shell; on heating no plasma is created in this area, leaving a hole that can be aimed into by shining the laser into the inner surface of the cone. HiPER is currently planning on using the gold cone approach, but will likely study the burning solution as well.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

==Current status==
{{Update|section|date=December 2013}}
In 2005 HiPER completed a preliminary study outlining possible approaches and arguments for its construction. The report received positive reviews from the EC in July 2007, and moved onto a preparatory design phase in early 2008 with detailed designs for construction beginning in 2011 or 2012.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In parallel, the HiPER project also proposes to build smaller laser systems with higher repetition rates. The high-powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform, and it cannot be fired again until it cools off, which takes as long as a day. Additionally only a very small amount of the flash of white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the Nd:glass and thus lead to amplification, in general only about 1 to 1.5% of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to avoiding these problems is replacing the flash lamps with more efficient pumps, typically based on [[laser diode]]s. These are far more efficient at generating light from electricity, and thus run much cooler. More importantly, the light they do generate is fairly monochromatic and can be tuned to frequencies that can be easily absorbed. This means that much less power needs to be used to produce any particular amount of laser light, further reducing the overall amount of heat being generated. The improvement in efficiency can be dramatic; existing experimental devices operate at about 10% overall efficiency, and it is believed "near term" devices will improve this as high as 20%.&lt;ref name=design&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

HiPER proposes to build a demonstrator diode-pump system producing 10&amp;nbsp;kJ at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz or 1&amp;nbsp;kJ at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz depending on a design choice yet to be made. The best high-repetition lasers currently operating are much smaller; [[Mercury laser|Mercury]] at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]] is about 70&amp;nbsp;J, HALNA in Japan at ~20&amp;nbsp;J, and LUCIA in France at ~100&amp;nbsp;J. HiPER's demonstrator would thus be between 10 and 500 times as powerful as any of these.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

To make a practical commercial power generator, the high-gain of a device like HiPER would have to be combined with a high-repetition rate laser and a target chamber capable of extracting the power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Additional areas of research for post-HiPER devices include practical methods to carry the heat out of the target chamber for power production, protecting the device from the [[neutron]] flux generated by the fusion reactions, and the production of [[tritium]] from this flux to produce more fuel for the reactor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The '''history of condoms''' goes back at least several centuries, and perhaps beyond.  For most of their history, [[condom]]s have been used both as a method of [[birth control]], and as a protective measure against [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.  Condoms have been made from a variety of materials; prior to the 19th century, chemically treated linen and animal tissue (intestine or bladder) are the best documented varieties.  Rubber condoms gained popularity in the mid-19th century, and in the early 20th century major advances were made in manufacturing techniques.  Prior to the introduction of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]], condoms were the most popular birth "control" method in the Western world.  In the second half of the 20th century, the low cost of condoms contributed to their importance in [[family planning]] programs throughout the developing world.  Condoms have also become increasingly important in efforts to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]]. The oldest condoms ever excavated were found in a cesspit located in the grounds of [[Dudley Castle]] and were made from animal membrane, the condoms dated back to as early as 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=James|title=Condoms Cathedrals and Caves - Europe for Visitors|url=http://goeurope.about.com/cs/sex/a/condom.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=21 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205201853/http://goeurope.about.com/cs/sex/a/condom.htm|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity to the Middle Ages for sex==
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aine Collier |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | url=https://books.google.com/?id=53EsAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=The+Humble+Little+Condom:+A+History&amp;dq=The+Humble+Little+Condom:+A+History | page=371 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Buffalo, N.Y |year=2007 |isbn=1-59102-556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}}  Societies in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome preferred small families and are known to have practiced a variety of birth control methods.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|12,16–17,22}}  However, these societies viewed [[birth control]] as a woman's responsibility, and the only well-documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices (both possibly effective, such as [[pessary|pessaries]], and ineffective, such as [[amulet]]s).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} The writings of these societies contain "veiled references" to male-controlled contraceptive methods that might have been condoms, but most historians interpret them as referring to [[coitus interruptus]] or [[anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|21,24}}

The [[loincloth]]s worn by Egyptian and Greek laborers were very spare, sometimes consisting of little more than a covering for the glans of the penis. Records of these types of loincloths being worn by men in higher classes have made some historians speculate they were worn during intercourse;&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|13–15,18–20}} others, however, are doubtful of such interpretations.&lt;ref name="youssef"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Youssef | first = H | date=1 April 1993| title = The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86 | pages = 226–228 | accessdate=| pmid = 7802734| issue = 4| pmc = 1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians may also cite one legend of [[Minos]], related by [[Antoninus Liberalis]] in 150 AD, as suggestive of condom use in ancient societies. This legend describes a curse that caused Minos' semen to contain serpents and scorpions. To protect his sexual partner from these animals, Minos used a goat's bladder as a female condom.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|18}}&lt;ref name="youssef" /&gt;

Contraceptives fell out of use in Europe after the [[decline of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century; the use of contraceptive pessaries, for example, is not documented again until the 15th century. If condoms were used during the Roman Empire, knowledge of them may have been lost during its decline.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|33,42}} In the writings of Muslims and Jews during the Middle Ages, there are some references to attempts at male-controlled contraception, including suggestions to cover the penis in tar or soak it in onion juice. Some of these writings might describe condom use, but they are "oblique", "veiled", and "vague".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|38–41}}

==1500s to the 1800s==

===Renaissance===
[[Image:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (The French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]
Prior to the 15th century, some use of glans condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded in Asia. Glans condoms seem to have been used for birth control, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of [[Condom#Lambskin|lamb intestines]]. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|60–1}}

The first well-documented outbreak of what is now known as [[syphilis]] occurred in 1494 among French troops.&lt;ref name="Scars_of_Venus"&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, J.D. | title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease then swept across Europe. As [[Jared Diamond]] describes it, "when syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its [[pustule]]s often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months." (The disease is less frequently fatal today.&lt;ref name="Diamond1"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York | publisher=W.W. Norton | page=210 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  By 1505, the disease had spread to Asia, and within a few decades had "decimated large areas of China".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|50,60}}

In 16th century Italy, [[Gabriele Falloppio]] authored the earliest uncontested description of condom use.  ''De Morbo Gallico'' ("The French Disease", referring to syphilis) was published in 1564, two years after Falloppio's death. In this tract, he recommended use of a device he claimed to have invented: linen sheaths soaked in a chemical solution and allowed to dry before use. The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans]] of the penis, and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}}&lt;ref name="pai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714101959/http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |archivedate=2007-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fallopio claimed to have performed an experimental trial of the linen sheath on 1100 men, and reported that none of them had contracted the dreaded disease.&lt;ref name="youssef"/&gt;

After the publication of ''De Morbo Gallico'', use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]]: he condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|56}}  The first explicit description that ''un petit linge'' (a small cloth) was used to prevent pregnancy is from 1655: a French novel and play titled ''L'Escole des Filles'' (The Philosophy of Girls). In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|66–8}}

In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. Cleaned and prepared intestine for use in glove making had been sold commercially since at least the 13th century.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|44–5}}  Condoms made from bladder and dating to the 1640s were discovered in an English privy; it is believed they were used by soldiers of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|68–9}}  Dutch traders introduced condoms made from "fine leather" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|61}}

===18th century===
Written references to condom use became much more common during the 18th century. Not all of the attention was positive: in 1708, [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|John Campbell]] unsuccessfully asked Parliament to make the devices illegal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|73}}  Noted English physician Daniel Turner condemned the condom, publishing his arguments against their use in 1717. He disliked condoms because they did not offer full protection against syphilis. He also seems to have argued that belief in the protection condoms offered encouraged men to engage in sex with unsafe partners - but then, because of the loss of sensation caused by condoms, these same men often neglected to actually use the devices. The French medical professor [[Jean Astruc]] wrote his own anti-condom treatise in 1736, citing Turner as the authority in this area. Physicians later in the 18th century also spoke against the condom, but not on medical grounds: rather, they expressed the belief that contraception was immoral.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|86–8,92}}

The condom market grew rapidly, however. 18th century condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or "skin" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulphur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|94–5}}  They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|90–2,97,104}}  The first recorded inspection of condom quality is found in the [[Histoire de ma vie|memoirs of Giacomo Casanova]] (which cover his life until 1774): to test for holes, he would often blow them up before use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|108}}&lt;ref name="youssef" /&gt;

[[Image:Condom 1900.jpg|thumb|left|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900.]]
Couples in colonial America relied on female-controlled methods of contraception, if they used contraceptives at all. The first known documents describing American condom use were written around 1800, two to three decades after the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|116–7}}  Also around 1800, linen condoms lost popularity in the market and their production ceased: they were more expensive and were viewed as less comfortable when compared to skin condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|94–5}}

Up to the 19th century, condoms were generally used only by the middle and upper classes. One reason for the lack of condom use was that the working classes tended to lack education on the dangers of sexually transmitted infections. Perhaps more importantly, condoms were unaffordable for many: for a typical prostitute, a single condom might cost several months' pay.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|119–21}}

===Expanded marketing and introduction of rubber===
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time: birth control advocates in England included [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Richard Carlile]], and noted American advocates included [[Robert Dale Owen]] and [[Charles Knowlton]]. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control, citing both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129–30}}  One group of British contraceptive advocates distributed condom literature in poor neighborhoods, with instructions on how to make the devices at home; in the 1840s, similar tracts were distributed in both cities and rural areas through the United States.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|126,136}}

From the 1820s through the 1870s, popular women and men lecturers traveled around America teaching about physiology and sexual matters. Many of them sold birth control devices, including condoms, after their lectures. They were condemned by many moralists and medical professionals, including America's first female doctor [[Elizabeth Blackwell]]. Blackwell accused the lecturers of spreading doctrines of "abortion and prostitution".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|130–2}}  In the 1840s, advertisements for condoms began to appear in British newspapers, and in 1861 a condom advertisement appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|127,138}}

The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was invented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1839, and patented in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' | title = CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber | journal = Scientific American Supplement | issue = 787 | publisher = Munn &amp; Co.  | location = New York  | date = 1891-01-31 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 | accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;br /&gt;

 --&gt;&lt;ref name="billy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubbers haven't always been made of rubber |work=Billy Boy: The excitingly different condom |url=http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |accessdate=2006-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721104435/http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |archivedate=2006-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 1850s several major rubber companies were mass-producing, among other items, rubber condoms. A main advantage of rubber condoms was their reusability, making them a more economical choice in the long term. Compared to the 19th century rubber condoms, however, skin condoms were initially cheaper and offered better sensitivity. For these reasons, skin condoms remained more popular than the rubber variety. However, by the end of the 19th century "rubber" had become a euphemism for condoms in countries around the world.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|134–5,157,219}}  For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|148}}  The earliest rubber condoms covered only the glans of the penis; a doctor had to measure each man and order the correct size. Even with the medical fittings, however, glans condoms tended to fall off during use. Rubber manufacturers quickly discovered they could sell more devices by manufacturing full-length one-size-fits-all condoms to be sold in pharmacies.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|135}}

===Increased popularity despite legal impediments===
Distribution of condoms in the United States was limited by passage of the [[Comstock laws]], which included a federal act banning the mailing of contraceptive information (passed in 1873) as well as State laws that banned the manufacture and sale of condoms in thirty states.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|144,193}}  In [[Ireland]] the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act made it illegal to advertise condoms, although their manufacture and sale remained legal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|163–4,168}}  Contraceptives were illegal in 19th century Italy and Germany, but condoms were allowed for disease prevention.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169–70}}  Despite legal obstacles, condoms continued to be readily available in both Europe and America, widely advertised under euphemisms such as ''male shield'' and ''rubber good''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|146–7}}  In late 19th century England, condoms were known as "a little something for the weekend".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|165}}  Only in the [[Republic of Ireland]] were condoms effectively outlawed. In Ireland their sale and manufacture remained illegal until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|171}}

Opposition to condoms did not only come from moralists: by the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|152–3}}  Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. Two surveys conducted in New York in 1890 and 1900 found that 45% of the women surveyed were using condoms to prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|173–4}}  A survey in Boston just prior to [[World War I]] concluded that three million condoms were sold in that city every year.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|192–3}}

1870s England saw the founding of the first major condom manufacturing company, E. Lambert and Son of Dalston.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|165}} In 1882, German immigrant [[Julius Schmidt (condoms)|Julius Schmidt]] founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc. (he dropped the 't' from his name in an effort to appear less Jewish). This New York business initially manufactured only skin condoms (in 1890 he was arrested by [[Anthony Comstock]] for having almost seven hundred of the devices in his house).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  In 1912, a German named [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|200}}  In America, Schmid was the first company to use the new technique. Using the new dipping method, French condom manufacturers were the first to add textures to condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169–70}}  Fromm was the first company to sell a branded line of condoms, Fromm's Act, which remains popular in Germany today.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt;  The condom lines manufactured by Schmid, Shieks and Ramses, were sold through the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced Trojans.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}

Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the Comstock laws.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|137–8,159}}  To fight the growing epidemic, sexual education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted. They generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|179–80}}  Condoms were not promoted for disease prevention; the medical community and moral watchdogs considered STDs to be punishment for sexual misbehavior. The stigma on victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|176}}

==1900 to present==

===World War I to the 1920s===
[[Image:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|thumb|A World War I-era U.S. military poster promoting abstinence.]]
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169,181}}  Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|180–3}}  During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|187–90}}  By the end of the war, the American military had diagnosed almost 400,000 cases of syphilis and [[gonorrhea]], a historic high.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}

From just before 1900 to the beginning of World War I, almost all condoms used in Europe were imported from Germany. Germany not only exported condoms to other European countries, but was a major supplier to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. During the war, the American companies Schmid and Youngs became the main suppliers of condoms to the European [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|156,170,191}}  By the early 1920s, however, most of Europe's condoms were once again made in Germany.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199}}

In 1918, just before the end of the war, an American court overturned a conviction against [[Margaret Sanger]]. In this case, the judge ruled that condoms could be legally advertised and sold for the prevention of disease.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web | title = Biographical Note | work = The Margaret Sanger Papers | publisher = Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. | year = 1995 | url = http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html | accessdate = 2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=September 2016}}  There were still a few state laws against buying and selling contraceptives, and advertising condoms as birth control devices remained illegal in over thirty states.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|266}}  But condoms began to be publicly, legally sold to Americans for the first time in forty-five years.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|192–3}}  Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|197}}  Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure. Several American companies sold their rejects under cheaper brand names rather than discarding them.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221–2}}  Consumers were advised to perform similar tests themselves before use, although few actually did so.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|223}}  Worldwide, condoms sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|210}}

Still, there were many prominent opponents of condoms. Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. Many moralists and medical professionals opposed all methods of contraception. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all "unnatural means of conception avoidance."  London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the ''huge'' number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|211–2}}

In the U.S., condom advertising was legally restricted to their use as disease preventatives. They could be openly marketed as birth control devices in Britain, but purchasing condoms in Britain was socially awkward compared to the U.S. They were generally requested with the euphemism "a little something for the weekend." [[Boots Group|Boots]], the largest pharmacy chain in Britain, stopped selling condoms altogether in the 1920s, a policy that was not reversed until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|208–10}}  In post-World War I France, the government was concerned about falling birth rates. In response, it outlawed all contraceptives, including condoms. Contraception was also illegal in Spain. European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|213–4}}

===Invention of latex and manufacturing automation===
[[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to manufacture a latex condom, an improved version of their Trojan brand. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. Because it used water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene, it eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). Europe's first latex condom was an export from Youngs Rubber Company in 1929. In 1932 the London Rubber Company, which had previously served as a wholesaler for German-manufactured condoms, became Europe's first manufacturer of latex condoms, the Durex.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semiskilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in automation of condom assembly line were made. Fred Killian patented the first fully automated line in 1930 and installed it in his manufacturing plant in Akron, Ohio. Killian charged $20,000 for his conveyor system - as much as $2 million in today's dollars. Automated lines dramatically lowered the price of condoms. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|201–3}}  The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|220}}

===Great Depression===
In 1927, senior medical officers in the American military began promoting condom distribution and educational programs to members of the army and navy. By 1931, condoms were standard issue to all members of the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|213–4}}  This coincided with a steep decline in U.S. military cases of sexually transmitted disease.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|217–9}}  The U.S. military was not the only large organization that changed its moral stance on condoms: in 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|227}}

The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.  [[Semen analysis]] was first performed in the 1930s. Samples were typically collected by masturbation, another action opposed by the Catholic Church. In 1930s Spain, the first use of [[collection condoms]] was documented; holes put in the condom allowed the user to collect a sample without violating the prohibitions on contraception and masturbation.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|228–9}}

In 1932, Margaret Sanger arranged for a shipment of [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]] to be mailed from Japan to a sympathetic doctor in New York City. When U.S. customs confiscated the package as illegal contraceptive devices, Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, a federal appeals court ruled in [[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries]] that the federal government could not interfere with doctors providing contraception to their patients.&lt;ref name="note" /&gt;  In 1938, over three hundred birth control clinics opened in America, supplying reproductive care (including condoms) to poor women all over the country.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|216,226}}  Programs led by U.S. [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] Thoman Parran included heavy promotion of condoms. These programs are credited with a steep drop in the U.S. STD rate by 1940.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|234}}

Two of the few places where condoms became more restricted during this period were [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Because of government concern about low birth rates, contraceptives were made illegal in Italy in the late 1920s. Although limited and highly controlled sales as disease preventatives were still allowed, there was a brisk black market trade in condoms as birth control.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|254–5}}  In Germany, laws passed in 1933 mandated that condoms could only be sold in plain brown wrappers, and only at pharmacies. Despite these restrictions, when [[World War II]] began Germans were using 72 million condoms every year.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|252}}  The elimination of moral and legal barriers, and the introduction of condom programs by the U.S. government helped condom sales. However, these factors alone are not considered to explain the [[Great Depression]]'s booming condom industry. In the U.S. alone, more than 1.5 million condoms were used every day during the Depression, at a cost of over $33 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). One historian explains these statistics this way: "Condoms were cheaper than children."  During the Depression condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity: that company still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture. Unlike the latex variety, these condoms could be safely used with oil-based lubricants. And while less comfortable, older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|217–9}}

More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s. In 1935, a biochemist tested 2000 condoms by filling each one with air and then water: he found that 60% of them leaked. The condom industry estimated that only 25% of condoms were tested for quality before packaging. The media attention led the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] to classify condoms as a drug in 1937 and mandate that every condom be tested before packaging. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to institute quality testing of every condom they made, installing automatic testing equipment designed by Arthur Youngs (the owner's brother) in 1938. The [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] authorized the FDA to seize defective products; the first month the Act took effect in 1940, the FDA seized 864,000 condoms. While these actions improved the quality of condoms in the United States, American condom manufacturers continued to export their rejects for sale in foreign markets.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|223–5}}

===World War II to 1980===
During [[World War II]] condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but enlisted men were also subject to significant contraception propaganda in the form of films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|236–8,259}}  A number of slogans were coined by the military, with one film exhorting ''"Don't forget — put it on before you put it in."''&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;  African-American soldiers, who served in segregated units, were exposed to less of the condom promotion programs, had lower rates of condom usage, and much higher rates of STDs.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|246}} America's female military units, the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WACs and WAACs]], were still engaged with abstinence programs.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|240}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|252–4,257–8}}  Despite the rubber shortages that occurred during this period, condom manufacturing was never restricted.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|231–3}}  In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[Condom#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to be utilized to this day.

Post-war American troops in Germany continued to receive condoms and materials promoting their use. Nevertheless, rates of STDs in this population began to rise, reaching the highest levels since World War I. One explanation is that the success of newer penicillin treatments led soldiers to take syphilis and gonorrhea much less seriously. A similar casual attitude toward STDs appeared in the general American population; one historian states that condoms "were almost obsolete as prophylaxis by 1960".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|234,259–61}}  By 1947, the U.S. military was again promoting abstinence as the only method of disease control for its members, a policy that continued through the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|261–2,281–4}}

But condom sales continued to grow. From 1955 to 1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950 to 1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. For the more economical-minded, cement-dipped condoms continued to be available long after the war. In 1957, Durex introduced the world's first lubricated condom. Beginning in the 1960s, the Japanese used more condoms per capita than any other nation in the world. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 debut, but condoms remained a strong second. A survey of British women between 1966 and 1970 found that the condom was the most popular birth control method with single women. New manufacturers appeared in the Soviet Union, which had never restricted condom sales. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the "world population crises": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}}

In the 1960s and 1970s quality regulations tightened,&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|267,285}} and legal barriers to condom use were removed. In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' struck down one of the remaining [[Comstock laws]], the bans of contraception in Connecticut and Massachusetts. France repealed its anti-birth control laws in 1967. Similar laws in Italy were declared unconstitutional in 1971.  [[Beate Uhse-Rotermund|Captain Beate Uhse]] in Germany founded a birth control business, and fought a series of legal battles continue her sales.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|276–9}}  In Ireland, legal condom sales (only to people over 18, and only in clinics and pharmacies) were allowed for the first time in 1978.  (All restrictions on Irish condom sales were lifted in 1993.)&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|329–30}}

Advertising was one area that continued to have legal restrictions. In the late 1950s, the American [[National Association of Broadcasters]] banned condom advertisements from national television. This policy remained in place until 1979, when the U.S. Justice department had it overturned in court.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|273–4,285}}  In the U.S., advertisements for condoms were mostly limited to men's magazines such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|285–6}}  The first television ad, on the California station [[KNTV]], aired in 1975: it was quickly pulled after it attracted national attention.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|274}}  And in over 30 states, advertising condoms as birth control devices was still illegal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|266}}

===After the discovery of AIDS===
The first ''[[New York Times]]'' story on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]) was published on July 3, 1981.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|294}}  In 1982 it was first suggested that the disease was sexually transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Cluster of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia among Homosexual Male Residents of Los Angeles and range Counties, California | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 31 | issue = 23 | pages = 305–7 | publisher =  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 1982-06-18 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001114.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-15 | pmid = 6811844 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control (CDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to these findings, and to fight the spread of AIDS, the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]] supported condom promotion programs.  However, President [[Ronald Reagan]] preferred an approach of concentrating only on abstinence programs.  Some opponents of condom programs stated that AIDS was a disease of homosexuals and illicit drug users, who were just getting what they deserved.  In 1990, North Carolina senator [[Jesse Helms]] argued that the best way to fight AIDS would be to enforce state sodomy laws.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|296–7}}

Nevertheless, major advertising campaigns were put in print media, promoting condoms as a way to protect against AIDS.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|299,301}}  Youngs Rubber mailed educational pamphlets to American households, although the postal service forced them to go to court to do so, citing a section of Title 39 that "prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives."  In 1983 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the postal service's actions violated the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|303}}  Beginning in 1985 through 1987, national condom promotion campaigns occurred in U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|299,301,306–7,312–8}} Over the 10 years of the Swiss campaign, Swiss condom use increased by 80%.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|314–7}} The year after the British campaign began, condom sales in the UK increased by 20%.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|309}}  In 1988 Britain, condoms were the most popular birth control choice for married couples, for the first time since the introduction of the pill.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|311}}  The first [[condom]] commercial on U.S. television aired during an episode of ''[[Herman's Head]]'' on November 17, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20614F63C5D0C7A8DDDA80994D9494D81&amp;showabstract=1| title = The Sponsor Is the Surprise In Fox's First Condom Ad | first = Stuart | last = Elliott | date = November 19, 1991 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. in the 1990s, condoms ranked third in popularity among married couples, and were a strong second among single women.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|305}}

Condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets, including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|305}}  In this environment of more open sales, the British euphemism of "a little something for the weekend" fell out of use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|322}}  In June 1991 America's first condom store, Condomania, opened on Bleecker Street in New York City.  Condomania was the first store of its kind in North America dedicated to the sale and promotion of condoms in an upbeat, upscale and fun atmosphere.  Condomania was also one of the very first retailers to offer condoms online when it launched its [https://www.condomania.com/ website] in December 1995.

Condom sales increased every year until 1994, when media attention to the AIDS pandemic began to decline.  In response, manufacturers have changed the tone of their advertisements from scary to humorous.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|303–4}}  New developments continue to occur in the condom market, with the first polyurethane condom—branded Avanti and produced by the manufacturer of Durex—introduced in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|324–5}}  Durex was also the first condom brand to have a website, launched in 1997.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|319}}  Worldwide condom use is expected to continue to grow: one study predicted that developing nations would need 18.6 billion condoms in 2015.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|342}}

==Etymology and other terms==
Etymological theories for the word "condom" abound. By the early 18th century, the invention and naming of the condom was attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], and this explanation persisted for several centuries. However, the "Dr. Condom" or "Earl of Condom" described in these stories has never been proved to exist, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

A variety of Latin etymologies have been proposed, including ''condon'' (receptacle),&lt;!--

==Major manufacturers==
One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|322,328}}  Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations.

In 1882, German immigrant Julius Schmidt founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc., based in New York City (he dropped the 't' from his name in an effort to appear less Jewish). The condom lines manufactured by Schmid included Sheiks and Ramses.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  In 1932, the London Rubber Company (which had previously been a wholesale business importing German condoms) began to produce latex condoms, under the Durex brand.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199,201,218}}  In 1962 Schmid was purchased by London Rubber. In 1987, London Rubber began acquiring other condom manufacturers, and within a few years became an important international company. In the late 1990s, London Rubber (by then London International Limited) merged all the Schmid brands into its European brand, Durex.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|324–6}}  Soon after, London International was purchased by Seton Scholl Healthcare (manufacturer of Dr. Scholl's footcare products), forming [[SSL International|Seton Scholl Limited]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|327}}

Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced the [[Trojan (condoms)|Trojan]] line of condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}  In 1985, Youngs Rubber Company was sold to Carter-Wallace. The Trojan name switched hands yet again in 2000 when Carter-Wallace was sold to [[Church and Dwight]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|323–4}}

The Australian division of [[Dunlop Rubber]] began manufacturing condoms in the 1890s. In 1905, Dunlop sold its condom-making equipment to one of its employees, Eric Ansell, who founded [[Ansell Limited|Ansell Rubber]]. In 1969, Ansell was sold back to Dunlop.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|327}}  In 1987, English business magnate [[Richard Branson]] contracted with Ansell to help in a campaign against HIV and AIDS. Ansell agreed to manufacture the Mates brand of condom, to be sold at little or no profit in order to encourage condom use. Branson soon sold the Mates brand to Ansell, with royalty payments made annually to the charity [[Virgin Unite]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|309,311}}&lt;!-- The ref says "Healthcare Foundation"; the name was changed to "Virgin Unite" in 2004--&gt;  In addition to its Mates brand, Ansell currently manufactures Lifestyles and Lifesan for the U.S. market.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|333}}

In 1934 the Kokusia Rubber Company was founded in Japan. It is now known as the Okamoto Rubber Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|257}}

In 1970 Tim Black and [[Phil Harvey|Philip Harvey]] founded Population Planning Associates (now known as [[Adam &amp; Eve (business)|Adam &amp; Eve]]). Population Planning Associates was a mail-order business that marketed condoms to American college students, despite U.S. laws against sending contraceptives through the mail. Black and Harvey used the profits from their company to start a non-profit organization [[Population Services International]]. By 1975, PSI was marketing condoms in Kenya and Bangladesh,&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|286–7,337–9}} and today operates programs in over sixty countries.&lt;!--

By selling the condoms instead of giving them away, DKT intends to make its customers invested in using the devices. One of DKT's more notable programs is its work in Ethiopia, where soldiers are required to carry a condom every time they leave base. The rate of HIV infection in the Ethiopian military, about 5%, is believed to be the lowest among African militaries.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|286–7,337–9}}

In 1987, Tufts University students Davin Wedel and Adam Glickman started Global Protection Corp. in response to C. Everett Koop's statement that "a condoms can save your life." Since that time, Global Protection Corp. has become known for its innovative approach to condom marketing and its support of more than 3500 non-profit organizations worldwide. The company has numerous patents and trademarks to its name, including the only FDA-approved glow-in-the-dark condom, the Pleasure Plus condom and the original condom keychain. In 2005 the company introduced its newest product, One Condoms. One represents a complete reinvention of retail condom brands, combining sleek metal packaging, innovative condom wrappers and innovative marketing programs. One is also the first condom brand to donate 5% of sales to the development of sexual health outreach and educational programs. In South Africa, some manufacturers have considered introducing an extra-large variety of condoms after several complaints from South African men claiming the condoms were too small and causing [[discomfort]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4155390.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iriss''' is a Scottish charitable company, based in Glasgow, Scotland which acts to make improvements to how the social services workforce in Scotland makes use of knowledge and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iriss.org.uk/about-us |title=About us | publisher= Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services (IRISS) |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2003, the '''Scottish Institute for Excellence in Social Work Education''' (SIESWE) was established as a sector-wide collaboration of the nine Scottish universities teaching social work with the objective of bringing about transformational change in the education and training of Scotland's future [[social work]]ers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2003/07/3858 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170424232051/http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2003/07/3858 |archivedate=24 April 2017 |title=New Institute to promote social work education |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=30 July 2003 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stated goals were:

* Achieving the policy objectives of the then new social work honours degree
* Strengthening the evidence-base for practice and education for practice
* Supporting the implementation of an employee development framework for the whole social services workforce

One of the first projects was the creation of the Learning Exchange, a digital repository, or library of bite sized chunks of learning or [[learning object]]s.

In 2007, SIESWE changed its name to Iriss which reflected an extension of the scope to include the social care workforce.

==Work Programmes==
Iriss's work is based on three inter-related programmes:
* Evidence-informed practice&lt;ref name="Evidence &amp; Policy"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tpp/ep/2014/00000010/00000004/art00006 |title=Embedding research into practice through innovation and creativity: a case study from social services |first1=Alison |last1=Petch |first2=Claire |last2=Lightowler |first3=Lisa |last3=Pattoni |first4=Ian |last4=Watson |journal=Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice |volume=10 |number=4 |date=November 2014 |pages=555–564}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation and improvement
* Knowledge media

Projects are organised under a number of themes.

==Principles==
The principles on which Iriss operates are set out in the strategy for 2012-15.&lt;ref&gt;Designs for the future: Iriss strategy 2012-2015 - http://www.iriss.org.uk/sites/default/files/iriss-designs-for-the-future.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In summary:
* The work of Iriss will complement rather than duplicate the work of other agencies
* The work will be responsive to a wide range of stakeholders, including Scottish Government, the Iriss Board, people who use services, unpaid careers, local authority social services staff, provider agencies, national bodies, universities, colleges and the wider community
* Iriss will capture stakeholder feedback and make that feedback visible
* The three programme areas will be interlocking
* Work will focus on the core business of the social services community
* Approaches will be varied and selected by appropriateness for the task
* Iriss will monitor impact of its projects
* Activities should create a high profile for the organisation
* All Iriss staff should feel a sense of ownership of Iriss activities
* There should be a focus on cost-effectiveness
* A range of funding streams will be accessed
* Iriss will promote the effective and appropriate use of technology, demystify it and advocate the removal barriers than prevent effective use of web-based tools and services
* Iriss will communicate effectively using a variety of social media

==Learning Exchange==

In 2005, the [http://lx.iriss.org.uk Learning Exchange] was launched as the world's first interactive library of digital learning resources for social work education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/chalkface-1-1109524 |title=Chalkface |work=[[The Scotsman]] |publisher=[[Johnston Press]] |date=15 November 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This repository is catalogued in accordance with international [[metadata standards]] and [[Learning object metadata]], allowing interoperability with other systems. In particular the intention was that multimedia learning objects could be downloaded as IMS&lt;ref&gt;IMS is a non-profit standards organisation concerned with establishing interoperability for learning systems and learning content - http://www.imsglobal.org&lt;/ref&gt; packages and uploaded into virtual learning environments in higher education institutions.

Originally the Learning Exchange was built on IntraLibrary software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://app.dundee.ac.uk/pressreleases/prnov05/learnexchange.html |title=Scottish Institute Launches 'The Learning Exchange' |publisher=[[University of Dundee]] |date=14 November 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and access restricted to students and staff of the higher educational institutions in Scotland engaged in teaching social work. Access was password protected using the [[Athens (access and identity management service)|Athens Eduserve]] authentication system.  Subsequently the Learning Exchange was added to the [[NHS Education for Scotland]] (NES) portfolio of content accessible via Athens Eduserve.  This made Learning Exchange available to the higher education sector and the entire social services workforce.

In practice much of the content of the Learning Exchange did not require password protection, partly because in 2008 Iriss adopted a policy of releasing its own content using [[Creative Commons]] licensing. Password protection was therefore removed and a simple search interface OpenSearch created&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/p/sruopensearch/ |title=sruopensearch |publisher=code.google.com |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which queried the database by [[Search/Retrieve via URL|SRU]].

In 2010, the Learning Exchange was rebuilt using [[Drupal]], an open source content management system.

The ability to allow metadata harvesting by third parties means that Learning Exchange content is automatically searchable by Social Services Knowledge Scotland&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssks.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; (SSKS), a portal to social service knowledge and information created by [[NHS Education for Scotland]] (NES) in partnership with Iriss, Scottish Social Services Learning Networks and the [[Social Care Institute for Excellence]].

==Multimedia==

In 2005 Iriss began creating web-based multimedia learning objects based on scenarios devised by social work educators, scripted, professional actors cast, and filmed by professional filmmakers. Examples include:
* Imagining the Future, a creative exploration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://content.iriss.org.uk/2025/|title = Imagining the Future - a creative exploration|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; looks at what will social care, support and community be like in Scotland 2025.  This key piece of research was released in November 2014 and was met with favourable review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/inside-track-social-work-meets-the-hunger-games.25960290|title = Inside Track: Social work meets the Hunger Games|last = Naysmith|first = Stephen|date =26 November 2014|work =[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |accessdate =17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Children, Families and Child Protection&lt;ref&gt;Children, Families and Child Protection - http://www.iriss.org.uk/childprotection, accessed 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on the legal, ethical and practice issues emerging from a child protection case scenario.  
* The Assessment Triangle&lt;ref&gt;The Assessment Triangle - http://www.iriss.org.uk/opencontent/assessment, accessed 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted within the development of the Integrated Assessment Framework of [[Getting it Right for Every Child - GIRFEC|GIRFEC]]. 
* The Golden Bridge&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iriss.ac.uk/goldenbridge&lt;/ref&gt; documents the migration of [[Home Children]] from Scotland to Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century. It includes artefacts, such as photographs, from [[Quarriers]] organisation, a major voluntary sector childcare agency.

==Audio and Video==

In 2006, Iriss began recording research seminars and other events as an effective and inexpensive way of capturing and sharing knowledge. These recordings were made available as a podcast&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iriss.org.uk/audio&lt;/ref&gt; either direct from the Iriss website or from the iTunes Store.

In June 2012 the podcast series was superseded by [http://iriss.fm IRISS.FM] [[internet radio]]

Iriss also uses Vimeo,&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/iriss&lt;/ref&gt; for video streaming.

==Knowledge Management Strategy==

Iriss collaborated with [[NHS Education for Scotland]] (NES) and other stakeholders to create The Knowledge Management Strategy for the Social Services which was derived from Changing Lives.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Executive (2006) Report of the recommendations made by the 21st Century Social Work Review Group for the future of social services in Scotland. http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/02094408/0, Accessed 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The Strategy  stresses the importance of a workforce confident and competent in the use of the technologies that allow them to access and share knowledge.

The Knowledge Management Strategy for the Social Services was revised and new edition &lt;ref&gt;A Strategy and Action Plan for Embedding Knowledge in Practice in Scotland's Social Services http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/10/4809&lt;/ref&gt; published by the Scottish Government  in November 2012

As the ubiquity of the web has grown, new skills are required, known collectively as [[information literacy]]: ‘the ability to find, evaluate and use digital information effectively, efficiently and ethically'.&lt;ref&gt;For more definitions see {{cite web|url=http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091732/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |archivedate= 4 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with [[NHS Education for Scotland]] Iriss developed a [http://www.iriss.org.uk/project/information-literacy-cyclel series of manuals] aimed at helping social services practitioners develop their information literacy skills, as well as a simple interactive web-based introductory tutorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iriss.org.uk/informationliteracy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence informed practice==
Iriss has developed a number of tools and services to promote and foster the use of evidence to inform practice. [http://toolkit.iriss.org.uk/  Confidence through Evidence] is a toolkit designed to help practitioners acquire, assess, adapt and apply evidence in practice. A complementary [http://www.iriss.org.uk/project/library-evidence-summaries library of evidence summaries] was created within the Learning Exchange.

A [http://www.iriss.org.uk/project/champion-network Champions Network] has been established to foster links between Iriss and social services workforce in both the statutory and voluntary sectors.

The [http://www.iriss.org.uk/services/research-advice-service Research Advice Service] was set up to support the social care workers carrying out their own research.

==Innovation and improvement==
The Innovation and Improvement programme promotes new thinking for social services in Scotland. The programme develops tools, training and interventions that will support and enable the sustainable transformation of social services in Scotland.

==Technical barriers==

In 2010, Iriss commissioned a report, Social Media in the Social Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Focused on Learning |url=https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/reports/social-media-social-services |title=Social Media in the Social Services |publisher=Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services (IRISS) |date=October 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published as an interactive document inviting comment and discussion. Iriss continues (partly though the Just Do It! blog&lt;ref&gt;Just Do It! http://blogs.iriss.org.uk/socialmedia&lt;/ref&gt;) to urge public bodies to open up access to [[social media]] and trust  professional staff to act responsibly.

'''Kirk R. Smith''' is an expert on the health and [[global warming|climate]] effects of household energy use in developing nations. He is currently a professor of Global Environmental Health at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where his research focuses on the relationships among environmental quality, health, resource use, climate, development, and policy in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/people/smithk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Smith contributed a great deal to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]], and the work of the IPCC (including the contributions of many scientists) was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Smith is a recipient of the 2012 [[Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement]] for his work with cookstoves, health, and climate. He is also credited with designing and implementing the first [[randomized controlled trial]] of the health effects of [[indoor air pollution in developing countries|indoor air pollution (IAP)]] from [[cook stove|cookstoves]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrights.gov/2012/09/26/fact-sheet-global-alliance-for-clean-cookstoves-progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Smith grew up in the [[California]] [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], where he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Here, he received his Bachelor of Arts (1968) in [[Physics]] and [[Astronomy]], his [[Master of Public Health]] (1972) in Environmental Health Sciences, and his [[PhD|Doctorate (PhD)]] (1977) in Biomedical and Environmental Health with a focus on Energy &amp; Environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/krsmith/&lt;/ref&gt; His studies at Berkeley led to developments in coal-ash recycling and nuclear risk assessment, and were conducted under the advisorship of the current [[Office of Science and Technology Policy|Science Advisor]] to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], [[John Holdren]]. After finishing his PhD, Smith moved to Hawaii where he founded the Energy Program at the East-West Center. He led the center's work on energy research problems in the Asia-Pacific regions until 1985, when he became the coordinator for environmental risk research. In 1995, Smith returned to [[UC Berkeley]] where he joined the faculty at the [[UC Berkeley School of Public Health]]. He is currently a Professor of Global Environmental Health, the founder and co-Director of the university's Global Health and Environment Program, and Associate Director for International Programs at the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tylerprize.usc.edu/laureates.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krist Anthony Novoselic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|v|ə|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|ɪ|tʃ}}; {{lang-hr|'''Krist Novoselić'''}}; born May 16, 1965) is an [[Americans|American]] [[musician]] and [[Activism|political activist]], and was the [[bassist]] and founding member of the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] alongside [[guitarist]] and [[Lead vocalist|lead singer]] [[Kurt Cobain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvana.com/|title=Official Nirvana Website: Complete Discography, Videos and more|website=www.nirvana.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/nirvana|title=Nirvana {{!}} Music|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana achieved massive success, earning multiple gold and [[Platinum (award)|platinum awards]] and touring around the world at sold-out shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7518783/nirvana-nevermind-nine-chart-facts-anniversary|title=Nirvana's 'Nevermind': 9 Chart Facts About the Iconic Album|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nirvana disbanded following the [[death of Kurt Cobain]] in 1994, Novoselic formed [[Sweet 75]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/articles/sweet75.html|title=Life After Nirvana For Krist Novoselic - Page 1|last=tsunami@luini.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the following year and [[Eyes Adrift]] in 2002, releasing one album with each band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2009, he played in the [[punk rock]] band [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], and in 2011, he contributed bass and accordion to the song "[[Wasting Light|I Should Have Known]]" on the [[Foo Fighters]]' studio album ''[[Wasting Light]]'', along with playing [[bass guitar]] and [[accordion]] in his current band, Giants in the Trees since June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/giantsinthetrees/about/|title=Giants in the Trees Facebook|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/foo-fighters-375-1290502|title=Dave Grohl teams up with Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on new Foo Fighters album - NME|date=2010-10-27|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his musical endeavours, Novoselic has been active politically, including the creation of the [[political action committee]] JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/politics/career.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 through 2010 he wrote a weekly column on music and politics for ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'s'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|title=Reverb – "Krist Novoselic" Archives – Seattle Weekly|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006203927/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/reverb/krist_novoselic/|archivedate=October 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 Novoselic has been board chair of the [[electoral reform]] organization [[FairVote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/tags/author_krist_novoselic|title=Author krist novoselic at FairVote|last=FairVote.org|website=FairVote|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Krist Anthony Novoselic was born on May 16, 1965 to [[Croats|Croatian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/krist-novoselic-ne-vjeruje-bushu/114008.aspx|title=Krist Novoselic ne vjeruje Bushu|publisher=index|work=index.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tportal.hr/showtime/glazba/24409/Nirvanin-basist-hrvatskog-porijekla-duboko-u-politici.html|title=Nirvanin basist hrvatskog porijekla duboko u politici|publisher=tportal|work=tportal.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zadarskilist.hr/clanci/17042010/novaselici-nismo-ni-sanjali-da-ce-nam-sin-postati-rock-zvijezda|title=Novaselići: Nismo ni sanjali da će nam sin postati rock zvijezda!|publisher=[[Zadarski list]]|work=zadarskilist.hr|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; immigrant parents, Kristo and Maria, in [[Compton, California]]. He lived there for one year before his parents moved to the ethnically Croatian [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/audio/interviews/mp3/media/krist2.mp3 Interview with Krist Novoselic – Audio file]&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained for most of his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humoropedia.com/krist-novoselic/|title=5 Unreal Facts About Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic You’D Never Believe|work=Humoropedia|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic has a younger brother Robert, born in 1968, and a younger sister, Diana, born in 1973. In 1979, his family relocated to [[Aberdeen, Washington]] as a result of surging real estate costs in California. In 1980, his parents sent him to live with relatives in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Younger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/younger.php|title=Novoselic Dedication Page|publisher=novoselic.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic returned to Aberdeen in 1981. His earliest memories of listening to music was listening to [[Chuck Berry]] with his father. Growing up, he had a "severe" [[Malocclusion|underbite]], for which underwent corrective surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kristnovoselicescalators.tumblr.com/post/142188663820/novoselic-91-i-had-started-reading-michael|title=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic — Novoselic ‘91 I had started reading Michael...|website=Walk on escalators with Krist Novoselic|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pavitt commodore.jpg|thumb|Novoselic with Kathleen Hanna, Bruce Pavitt and Dylan Carlson, Paramount Theater, Seattle, October 31st, 1991]]
Novoselic was already interested in [[Hard rock|hard rock bands]] such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Who]], [[Van Halen]], [[Devo]] and [[Aerosmith]]. He also enjoyed listening to Yugoslavian bands such as [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Prljavo kazalište]] and [[Azra]]. While in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], he picked up an interest in [[punk rock]], and discovered bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Ramones]] when he lived in Croatia at the age of 14 for one year.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/krist-novoselic/110291/biography|title=Krist Novoselic Biography – AOL Music|publisher=Music.aol.com|date=May 16, 1965|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goalweb.com/nirvana2/101_random_facts.htm|title=101 Random Facts|website=www.goalweb.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has cited [[Paul McCartney]], [[Geezer Butler]], [[John Entwistle]], and [[Gene Simmons]] as the fundamental influences of his bass playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic|first=Krist|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|title=The Daily Weekly: Krist Novoselic: My Favorite Bass Players (Seattle Weekly)|publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com|accessdate=July 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824080836/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/01/krist_novoselic_my_favorite_ba.php|archivedate=August 24, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Novoselic's brother Robert introduced him to his friend [[Kurt Cobain]], who had noticed loud music coming from upstairs. Robert told Cobain that it was his older brother, who listened to [[punk rock]]. Cobain eventually befriended the older Novoselic, as the pair ended up sharing similar musical tastes, including a fondness for local band [[Melvins]]. The two had several mutual friends and began hanging out shortly thereafter. Krist attended [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]] and Kurt attended Montesano High School (Washington). At one point, Cobain gave Novoselic a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] of his former band [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]], and asked him to form a band together. After several months, Novoselic finally listened to the tape, liked it, and agreed to start a band with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/nirvana/biography|title=Nirvana Biography|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After high school, Novoselic worked as a [[House painter and decorator|painter and decorator]] and was eventually laid off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wattpad.com/301062129-nirvana-facts-krist-novoselic|title=Nirvana FACTS - Krist Novoselic  - Wattpad|website=www.wattpad.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nirvana (1987–1994) ===

{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}
	 
Cobain and Novoselic's first band lasted barely a few weeks before it disbanded, leaving the pair to move on. However, the duo eventually discovered that Melvins could pull $80 a night for one show. Inspired, Cobain and Novoselic started a [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] [[cover band]], in which Cobain played [[Drum kit|drums]] and Novoselic sang and played [[guitar]]. That band was short-lived as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|title=Come as You are: The Story of Nirvana|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday|year=1993|isbn=0-385-47199-8|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some months later, Cobain and Novoselic met drummer [[Aaron Burckhard]]. While the new band never used the name, it was the first incarnation of Nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nirvanaguide.com/1987.php|title=Nirvana Live Guide - 1987|website=www.nirvanaguide.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Burckhard lasted only a few months and Melvins' drummer [[Dale Crover]] filled in until Novoselic and Cobain met [[Chad Channing]]. The trio recorded their debut [[album]] ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.subpop.com/releases/nirvana/bleach_deluxe_edition|title=Bleach: Deluxe Edition|last=Records|first=Sub Pop|website=Sub Pop Records|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channing left the band in 1990 and was briefly replaced by Crover and [[Mudhoney]] drummer [[Dan Peters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternativenation.net/surprising-drummer-reveals-missed-joining-nirvana-twice/|title=Surprising Drummer Reveals How He Missed Out On Joining Nirvana Twice|last=Buchanan|first=Brett|date=2018-01-13|work=AlternativeNation.net|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/nirvana-chad-channing-no-regrets/|title=Chad Channing Recalls His Time in Nirvana Without Regrets|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic contributed to song writing of various songs, helping out Cobain, such as giving ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselic-on-kurts-writing-process-and-the-in-utero-aesthetic-20131003|title=Krist Novoselic on Kurt Cobain's Writing Process|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1990, Melvins' singer-guitarist [[Buzz Osborne]] encouraged Novoselic and Cobain to check out a punk band called [[Scream (band)|Scream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-scream-mn0001287850|title=The Scream {{!}} Biography &amp; History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were impressed by their drummer, [[Dave Grohl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/03/dave-grohls-first-band-scream-to-reissue-1988-album-no-more-censorship/|title=Dave Grohl’s first band, Scream, to reissue 1988 album No More Censorship|date=2018-03-29|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Scream disbanded, and Grohl placed a call to Osborne for advice. Osborne gave him Novoselic's phone number, and Novoselic invited Grohl up to Seattle (from [[San Francisco]], where Scream broke up). Grohl passed the audition and joined Nirvana. Grohl was Nirvana's fifth and final [[drummer]]. This was after the first few recordings of songs from their ''Bleach'' Album. Novoselic spent the following months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped for a deal, eventually signing with [[DGC Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hardrock.com/rpm/nirvana-signs-to-a-major-or-how-kim-gordon-saved-the-world/|title=NIRVANA SIGNS TO A MAJOR (or how Kim Gordon saved the world)|work=Hard Rock presents Revolutions Per Minute|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1991, the band entered [[Sound City Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] to record ''[[Nevermind]].'' Novoselic helped write the song "[[Polly (Nirvana song)|Polly]]". Upon its release, ''Nevermind'' (1991) exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2016/09/howling-in-the-abyss-the-improbable-success-of-nirvanas-nevermind/|title=Howling in the Abyss: The Improbable Success of Nirvana's 'Nevermind'|date=2016-09-23|work=Observer|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=2016-09-24|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Nevermind]]'' had launched the band as a worldwide phenomenon with their hit single "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/nirvana-debuted-smells-like-teen-spirit-22-years-ago-tonight-20130417|title=Watch Nirvana Debut 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' Live in 1991|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, at the [[MTV Music Awards|MTV music awards show]], Nirvana would win awards for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist in a Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]] for "Smells Like Teen Spirit." At the show, Nirvana performed "[[Lithium (Nirvana song)|Lithium]]". When Novoselic started playing the opening bass riff, he signaled that he could not hear his bass. Instead of continuing to play, Novoselic threw his bass guitar in the air, to perform a "Bass Toss". He failed to catch it, later stating that he misjudged the height; he further stated that he "faked like he was knocked out." Musician [[Brian May]] ran to give him medical attention; he did not suffer any injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/10/nirvanas-eight-most-rock-n-roll-moments.html|title=Paste Magazine|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/nirvana-181-1336070|title=Nirvana bassist reveals Brian May helped him after bass-throwing injury - NME|date=2008-11-20|work=NME|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvanas-novoselic-relives-failed-1992-vma-bass-toss-20081120|title=Nirvana's Novoselic Relives Failed 1992 VMA Bass Toss|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Novoselic and the rest of Nirvana recorded a [[compilation album]] named ''[[Incesticide]]''. Novoselic helped write lyrics for the songs "[[Dive (Nirvana song)|Dive]]", "[[Hairspray Queen]]", and "[[Incesticide|Aneurysm]]" on the album. This album was produced by a joint venture between [[DGC Records|DGC]] and [[Sub Pop|Sup Pop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/incesticide-19930121|title=Review: Nirvana's 'Incesticide' Delivers Emotional Honesty|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|Novoselic (left) playing bass alongside singer Cobain (right) in 1992.]]
During Nirvana's 1992 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading]] concert, Novoselic sang "The Money Will Roll Right In" with Cobain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livenirvana.com/digitalnirvana/songguide/bodyd9ac.html?songid=179|title=The Money Will Roll Right In|website=www.livenirvana.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic was an occasional [[vocalist]] and [[backing vocalist]] in Nirvana, occasionally singing "[[Scoff (song)|Scoff]]" and "[[Rape Me]]" at live shows. Novoselic stated that "I kind of discovered my voice for the first time, and the more I did it, the better it got."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/adrift/articles/guitar.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1993, Nirvana worked on their third album [[In Utero (album)|''In Utero'']], it debuted at number one on the [[billboard 200]] in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nirvana/chart-history/billboard-200/song/177363|title=Nirvana In Utero Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recording sessions mixed by [[Steve Albini]] were criticized by the band members, saying some songs "didn't sound perfect" as well as the Novoselic and the rest of the band agreeing that Novoselic's bass lines sounded "too low". ''In Utero'' sold 3.5 million copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5b8c/|title=BBC - Music - Review of Nirvana - In Utero|last=Stack|first=Eamonn|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/in-utero-19930916|title=In Utero|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, Nirvana performed on [[MTV Unplugged]] with [[Lori Goldston]] playing [[cello]], the introduction of guitarist [[Pat Smear]], and Novoselic playing acoustic bass guitar, accordion, and acoustic rhythm guitar. This live performance was released a year later as an album, named ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]],'' which earned a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|best alternative music performance.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-nineties-20110427/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-20110517|title=100 Best Albums of the '90s|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-album-anniversary/|title=23 Years Ago: 'Nirvana: MTV Unplugged in New York' Released|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/deep-10-nirvanas-mtv-unplugged-new-york|title=Deep 10: Nirvana's MTV Unplugged In New York|date=2016-11-03|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nirvana ended abruptly in April 1994 following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/krist-novoselic-kurt-cobain-clear-mind-wouldnt-have-killed-himself/|title=Krist Novoselic Discusses Kurt Cobain's Suicide|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the rest of that year, Novoselic retreated from the spotlight. One of a few public appearances came that September at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, where the video for Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]" was awarded for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video|Best Alternative Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1994/mtvvmas.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 1994 MTV Video Music Awards|website=www.rockonthenet.com|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Cobain.

Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at [[Robert Lang Studios]] in Seattle to work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on demos of their own songs.

Novoselic and Grohl continued to support the Nirvana franchise. Novoselic worked on completing the ''[[With the Lights Out]]'' [[box set]] and ''[[From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]]'' album, as well as pushing for release of a [[Nevermind|20th anniversary album for ''Nevermind'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/discography.php|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Nirvana (1995–present) ===
After Cobain's death, Novoselic continued to dabble in musical endeavors. He co-formed the band [[Sweet 75]] with Seattle musician Yva Las Vegass in 1995, releasing a single [[Sweet 75 (album)|self-titled album]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/krist-novoselics-ecelctic-new-sound-19970911|title=Krist Novoselic’s Ecelctic New Sound|last=Stone|first=Rolling|date=1997-09-11|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.novoselic.com/sweet75/info.html|title=The Krist Novoselic Dedication Page - www.novoselic.com -|website=www.novoselic.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Novoselic performed uncredited background [[vocals]] on Foo Fighters' song "Walking a Line", written as a tribute to Cobain, during the ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'' album sessions. The track is included on the ''One by One'' bonus [[DVD]], as well as being a bonus track to the album. He then joined former [[Meat Puppets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themeatpuppets.com/|title=Meat Puppets|website=www.themeatpuppets.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; front man [[Curt Kirkwood]] and former [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] drummer [[Bud Gaugh]] to form [[Eyes Adrift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-20020827|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Australia]], there was another group called "Eyes Adrift", and rather than pay to license that name, the trio called the band and album "Bud, Curt &amp; Krist" in this nation. Eyes adrift released a self-titled album with twelve songs, with the [[Japan]]ese version including two extras. Eyes Adrift was the first official release in Krist's career where he sang [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], singing lead on "Inquiring Minds", "Dottie Dawn &amp; Julie Jewel" and "Pasted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/novoselic-focuses-on-eyes-adrift-251464/|title=Novoselic Focuses on Eyes Adrift|last=Luerssen|first=John D.|date=2002-08-27|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a single named ''Alaska''.

Following the end of Eyes Adrift, Novoselic announced that he was quitting the music business, noting that he disliked the process of building up publicity for new records. However, in recent years, Novoselic has occasionally worked on music for a possible solo album, noting, "Right now, I'm just doing it for myself, and that's what it's all about."&lt;ref&gt;Jasmin, Earnest.

In 2009, Novoselic played a newspaper vendor in the movie ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]]. In October 2010, [[Dave Grohl]], former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bandmate of Novoselic, announced live on [[BBC]] [[radio]], that Novoselic would be joining [[Foo Fighters]] as a bassist and accordionist on their next album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', which was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/952506/foo-fighters-return-dave-grohl-recruits-krist-novoselic |title=Foo Fighters Return, Dave Grohl Recruits Krist Novoselic |work=Billboard  |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KristNovoselic2011.jpg|alt=|thumb|Novoselic performing in 2011.]]
In 2012, the Nirvana members partnered with [[Paul McCartney]] on the song "[[Cut Me Some Slack]]", which was composed specially for [[Sound City: Real to Reel|the soundtrack of the documentary]] ''[[Sound City (film)|Sound City]]'' directed by Dave Grohl.

=== Performance and recording with Foo Fighters ===
Grohl originally asked Novoselic to join [[Foo Fighters]] as a full-time [[Musical ensemble|band member]], he declined, stating they would call it "Nirvana 2".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=SiriusXM|title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl On His Joining The Band // SiriusXM // Lithium|date=2011-09-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRsvCoN__MI|accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novoselic's first experience with [[Foo Fighters]] was participating in the encore of their show on August 29, 1997 at [[Memorial Stadium (Seattle)|Memorial Stadium]] as part of the [[Bumbershoot]] [[festival]], where he played bass for the band's covers of "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]" and "[[Communication Breakdown]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bendersky|first=Ari|title=Semi-Nirvana Reunion at Bumbershoot|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 5, 1997|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/semi-nirvana-reunion-at-bumbershoot-19970905}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Novoselic performed [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] for a non-album track titled "Walking a Line", later released on a special edition of the band's album ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/nirvana-bassist-krist-novoselic-secretive-musical-project-dave-grohl/|title=Nirvana Bassist Krist Novoselic Talks About Secretive Musical Project With Dave Grohl|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the [[encore]] of Foo Fighters' secret show at Paladino's in [[Tarzana, California]] on December 22, 2010, the band, with Grohl on drums was joined onstage by Novoselic and the band's live guitarist [[Pat Smear]] for a version of Nirvana's "[[Marigold (song)|Marigold]]" a 1992 Grohl original, which was a [[B-side]] on Nirvana's "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]", the first single from ''In Utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=Foo Fighters Secret Show Becomes Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=December 22, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/12/22/foo-fighters-secret-show-becomes-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novoselic also recorded bass and accordion on the song "[[I Should Have Known (Foo Fighters song)|I Should Have Known]]", appearing on Foo Fighters' seventh studio album called ''[[Wasting Light]]'', released on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grierson|first=Tim|title=New Foo Fighters Album Will Be a Nirvana Reunion|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://rock.about.com/b/2010/10/28/new-foo-fighters-album-will-be-a-nirvana-reunion.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political and social activism ==
[[File:Krist Novoselic 15A.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Novoselic in 2008]]
Novoselic has had an interest in politics from high school. This included the [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] conflict between [[Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=garyalexw|title=Nirvana in Belfast - MTV News|date=2012-11-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whyVYQvQPk|accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nirvana/1992/kings-hall-belfast-northern-ireland-63d67e4f.html|title=Nirvana Setlist at King's Hall, Belfast|website=setlist.fm|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state legislature attempted to pass a [[Bill (law)|bill]] called the Erotic Music Law. The [[law]] would allow courts to declare certain albums "erotic" by their content, and would make it illegal to sell those albums to those under the age of 18. A lobbying group called the Washington Music Industry Coalition formed as a response to the bill. Novoselic and Nirvana actively [[Campaigner|campaigned]] against the bill and performed a benefit concert for the [[Advocacy group|lobbying group]] in September 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/nirvana-bassist-turns-politician|title=Nirvana Bassist Turns Politician|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krist appeared on [[ABC Studios|ABC]] [[KOMO-TV]]{{'}}s "Town Meeting" in March 1992 arguing his points and expressing his views with two opposing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=RareNirvana|title=Krist Novoselic on Komo TV's "Town Meeting" Show in 1992|date=2015-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDrog9H-Yd0|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With JAMPAC, Novoselic began to turn his focus more and more towards politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2011/05/icons-of-rock-krist-novoselic/|title=Icons Of Rock: Krist Novoselic|date=2011-05-01|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |title=Barack Obama For President |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=August 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130232930/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/barack_obama_for_president.php/ |archivedate=January 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php/ |title=Presidential Pick-A-Problem Primary |publisher=Blogs.seattleweekly.com |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102131705/http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2008/02/krist_novoselic_presidential_p.php |archivedate=November 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since broken with the Democratic Party, partly because "it's a top-down structure" adverse to reform from its grassroots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic?%20Run%20blog))|title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on Punk, FairVote, Dumping the Dems, &amp;amp; Why the GOP Should Embrace Anarchy|date=June 19, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, he made a donation to [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/krist-novoselic.asp?cycle=08|title=Krist Novoselic - $1,570 in Political Contributions for 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Grange is not actually a political party. He was running in order to protest Washington state's system, in which a candidate can claim any party as their own (real or fictional) without consent or support from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Times|url=http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/olympia/2009/jun/04/former-nirvana-bassist-krist-novoselic-running-wahkiakum-county-clerk/|title=The Spokesman Review, Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic running for Wahkiakum County clerk… .

[[File:KristNovoselicpodium.jpg|thumb|Novoselic giving a speech during his political career.]]

In an interview for ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason TV]]'', Novoselic was asked how he described his [[Ideology|political views]], and he responded, "I'm an [[anarcho-capitalist]], [[Socialism|socialist]], moderate... I don't know" and continued to say that while his political views couldn't be easily categorized, he finds fault in the political philosophies of both the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/06/19/krist-novoselic (at 11:30)&lt;/ref&gt; On his [[Twitter]] page, he announced that he had voted for 2016 [[Libertarian]] [[presidential candidate]] [[Gary Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KristNovoselic/status/594881482914562048|title=Krist Novoselić on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, he supported [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016|his political campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Novoselic |first=Krist |url=http://kristnovoselic.blogspot.com/2015/08/real-election-reform-enters-2016.html |title=This Is Krist Novoselić: Real Election Reform Enters The 2016 Race |publisher=Kristnovoselic.blogspot.com |date=2015-08-12 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8843">'''Life skills''' are abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable humans to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Life Skills Education for Children and Adolescents in Schools"[[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is also termed as [[psychosocial]] competency.&lt;ref&gt;Best Thomas, A study on stress and its correlatives with family environment. Retrieved from [[ResearchGate]].&lt;/ref&gt; The subject varies greatly depending on [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and community expectations but skills that function for well-being and aid individuals to develop into active and productive members of their communities are considered as life skills.

==Enumeration and categorization==

The [[UNICEF]] Evaluation Office suggests that "there is no definitive list" of psychosocial skills;&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2012"&gt;
{{cite web
| url           = http://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/files/UNICEF_GLS_Web.pdf
| title         = Global evaluation of life skills education programmes

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
nevertheless [[UNICEF]] enumerates psychosocial and interpersonal skills that are generally well-being oriented, and essential alongside literacy and [[numeracy]] skills. Since it changes its meaning from culture to culture and life positions, it is considered a concept that is elastic in nature. But UNICEF acknowledges social and emotional life skills identified by Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513044119/https://casel.org/why-it-matters/what-is-sel/skills-competencies|url=https://casel.org/why-it-matters/what-is-sel/skills-competencies|title=Skills &amp; Competencies - CASEL|archivedate=13 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life skills are a product of synthesis: many skills are developed simultaneously through practice, like [[humor]], which allows a person to feel in [[Locus of control|control]] of a situation and make it more manageable in perspective. It allows the person to release fears, anger, and stress &amp; achieve a qualitative life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/tc/humor-therapy-topic-overview|title=Do Hasya Yoga|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, decision-making often involves critical thinking ("what are my options?") and values clarification ("what is important to me?"), ("How do I ''feel'' about this?"). Ultimately, the interplay between the skills is what produces powerful behavioral outcomes, especially where this approach is supported by other strategies.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/search/search.php?q=Life-skills&amp;type=Main|title=UNICEF – Search Results|publisher=unicef.org|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life skills can vary from financial literacy,&lt;ref name="USA Funds Life Skills"&gt;[http://content.usafunds.org/financial_aid/products/ourproducts/pages/lifeskills.aspx USA Funds Life Skills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317045654/http://content.usafunds.org/financial_aid/products/ourproducts/Pages/lifeskills.aspx |date=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Substance abuse prevention|substance-abuse prevention]], to therapeutic techniques to deal with disabilities such as [[autism]].

===Life skills===

The [[World Health Organization]] in 1999 identified the following core cross-cultural areas of life skills:&lt;ref name="WHO 1999"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/30.pdf |title=Partners in Life Skills Education : Conclusions from a United Nations Inter-Agency Meeting |date=1999 |website=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[decision-making]] and [[problem-solving]];
* [[creative thinking]] (''see also:'' [[lateral thinking]]) and [[critical thinking]];
* [[communication]] and [[interpersonal skills]]; 
* [[self-awareness]] and [[empathy]]; 
* [[assertiveness]] and [[equanimity]]; and
* [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] and [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with emotions and coping with stress.

UNICEF listed similar skills and related categories in its 2012 report.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2012"/&gt;

Life skills curricula designed for [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] often emphasize communications and practical skills needed for successful independent living as well as for developmental-disabilities/special-education students with an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP).&lt;ref name="PSESD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psesd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=297&amp;Itemid=448 |title=Puget Sound ESD – excellence &amp;amp; equity in education &amp;#124; Pre-K-12 Life Skills Curriculum Guide |publisher=psesd.org|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parenting: a venue of life skills nourishment==
Life skills are often taught in the domain of [[Parenting#Skills|parenting]], either indirectly through the observation and experience of the child, or directly with the purpose of teaching a specific skill. Parenting itself can be considered as a set of life skills which can be taught or comes natural to a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.4135/9781412958479.n53|chapter = Behavioral parent training|title = Encyclopedia of Human Relationships|year = 2009|last1 = Prinz|first1 = Ron| isbn=9781412958462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating a person in skills for dealing with [[pregnancy]] and parenting can also coincide with additional life skills development for the child and enable the parents to guide their children in adulthood.

Many life skills programs are offered when traditional family structures and healthy relationships have broken down, whether due to parental lapses, divorce, psychological disorders or due to issues with the children (such as substance abuse or other risky behavior). For example, the [[International Labour Organization]] is teaching life skills to ex-child laborers and [[At-risk students#At-risk students|at-risk children]] in Indonesia to help them avoid and to recover from worst forms of [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/jakarta/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/lang--en/WCMS_151750/index.htm Improving Vocational and Life Skills of Ex-Child Labourers and at Risk Children Aged 15 to 17 Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926070201/http://www.ilo.org/jakarta/whatwedo/eventsandmeetings/lang--en/WCMS_151750/index.htm |date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models: behavior prevention vs. positive development==

While certain life skills programs focus on teaching the prevention of certain behaviors, they can be relatively ineffective. Based upon their research, the Family and Youth Services Bureau,&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/fysb|title=Home &amp;#124; Family and Youth Services Bureau &amp;#124; Administration for Children and Families|publisher=acf.hhs.gov|accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a division of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] advocates the theory of [[Positive Youth Development]] (PYD) as a replacement for the less effective prevention programs. PYD focuses on the strengths of an individual as opposed to the older decrepit models which tend to focus on the "potential" weaknesses that have yet to be shown. The Family and Youth Services Bureau has found that individuals who were trained in life skills by positive development model identified themselves with a greater sense of confidence, usefulness, sensitivity and openness rather than that of preventive model.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Image:MSCP Generic Poster.PNG|thumb|right|MSCP Poster outlining the various activities of the organisation. [http://www.mscp.org.au/ MSCP Website]]]

The '''Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy''' ('''MSCP''') is an institution dedicated to scholarly, extensive and engaged readings of key figures and texts in the history of modern European thought and contemporary discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au MSCP Identity Statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The School was founded in 2003 and formalised its status as an independent, [[not-for-profit]] organisation in 2004. It is based in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and is housed by [[The University of Melbourne]].

== Formation and early years ==

In January 2002, Cameron Shingleton, Jon Roffe, Matt Sharpe and David Rathbone ran a summer school with four courses (on Nietzsche, on Deleuze, on Zizek and on Hegel, respectively) in the 1888 Building at the University of Melbourne.  Sharpe had just finished his PhD on Zizek with Marion Tapper and Jon Rundell at Melbourne; Rathbone had returned to Melbourne from studies with Agnes Heller and Reiner Schurmann at the New School for Social Research in New York; Shingleton had completed his honors degree on Nietzsche in the German department; and Roffe his, in French.  All four were of the opinion that the formalities of institutional academia alone were not sufficient to undertaking philosophical and critical thought. They thus formed the MSCP in the spirit of a [[guild]] of philosophers with the intention of preserving and fostering genuine intellectual engagement with continental philosophy. In 2003, they were joined by Sean Ryan, Craig Barrie, and Ashley Woodward, and later, Esther Anatolitis, Felicity Joseph, Jack Reynolds, Kate Noble, Alex Murray, Atliana Safich, Mark Tomlinson, Marc Hiatt, James Garrett, Bryan Cooke, Paul Daniels, Andrea Leon-Martino, and Sherah Bloor, all of whom have all been involved in various ways during the five years 2004-2009, running annual Summer and Winter Schools, as well as several conferences and research days.

== Events and activities ==
===Summer and Winter Schools===

The MSCP runs Summer and Winter Schools at the University of Melbourne during the university vacation breaks. Courses in the Schools consist of five two-hour lectures over a week and do not involve assessment or require any demonstrated prior knowledge of the topic in question. As the MSCP is a not-for-profit organisation, registration costs are minimal.

MSCP courses seek a detailed and scholarly encounter with philosophical thinkers and themes. In particular, the courses attempt to promote constructive ways of engaging with philosophy which are not widely represented in contemporary academic discourse. The courses aim to locate philosophy in the context of its historical and cultural milieu, encouraging lively, academic debate, emphasising the interdisciplinary aspects of philosophy. Classes are informal but strive to be rigorous and faithful to the philosophers and texts being studied.

Past courses have covered philosophers such as [[Hegel]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]], [[Derrida]], [[Deleuze]] and [[Badiou]]. A series of courses has run over several Summer and Winter Schools entitled 'MSCP History of Philosophy Series' which assessed philosophy from the [[pre-Socratics]] to [[modern empiricism]]. Similar courses, treating a theme rather than a particular philosopher or text, have included 'Three Centuries of Aphorism' and 'Democracy, Elites and Violence'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/past.html MSCP past sessions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences===

The MSCP has run conferences including:

* 2002 Australasian Society of Continental Philosophy conference at the University of Melbourne (the MSCP hosted this conference in conjunction with the Department of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascp.org.au/conferences.htm ASCP 2002 conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in December 2002
* 'Immanuel Kant Today', commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/kant_papers.html Immanuel Kant Today conference]&lt;/ref&gt; held in February 2004
* 'Sensorium', a conference on philosophy and [[aesthetics]], held in June 2005
* '[[Sartre]] Colloquium' which included a performance of ''[[Huis Clos]]'' (held in conjunction with the Department of French, Italian and Spanish Studies and the Department of Philosophy), held in October 2005
* '200 Years of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/community/events/starters/archive/arts-starters-06-27-07.html "200 Years of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit''"]&lt;/ref&gt; held in July 2007

===Research days===

The MSCP has initiated a series of research days where philosophers in a particular field converge on a specific topic and workshop their papers together. So far, "[[Spinoza]] and the [[Infinity (philosophy)|Infinite]]", convened by Jon Roffe was held in December 2005 and was attended by [[Justin Clemens]], Simon Duffy, Minna Koivuniemi and Jon Roffe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscp.org.au/research/spinoza_infinite.html 'Spinoza and the Infinite' research day]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parrhesia Journal.PNG|thumb|left|''Parrhesia'' An International Journal of Critical Philosophy. [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/ Parrhesia Journal]]]

=== ''Parrhesia'' Journal ===
''[[Parrhesia: A Journal of Critical Philosophy]]'' is an international journal of [[Critical Philosophy]] affiliated with MSCP. It is edited by four MSCP members: Alex Murray, Matthew Sharpe, Jon Roffe and Ashley Woodward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org Parrhesia Journal website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000041083174 National Library of Australia entry for Parrhesia Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2006 and has included articles by [[Alain Badiou]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou1.pdf Badiou, Alain, "A musical variant on the metaphysics of the subject", trans. Justin Clemens, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 29 - 36]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia02/parrhesia02_badiou2.pdf Badiou, Alain, "The Event in Deleuze", trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 2, 2007, pp. 37 - 44 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacques Rancière]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia01/parrhesia01_ranciere.pdf Rancière, Jacques, "Thinking between disciplines: an aesthetics of knowledge," trans. Jon Roffe, in ''Parrhesia'', 1, 2006, pp. 1 - 12 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The MSCP and the University of Melbourne ==

[[File:Old Arts Building, University of Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Law Quadrangle at the University of Melbourne, home to the School of Philosophy. The MSCP office is located in this building.]]
 
During 2004, the founding Convenor, Jon Roffe, negotiated an informal relationship between the MSCP and the Philosophy Department with Chris Cordner (then Head of the Philosophy Department).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ Link to the MSCP via the School of Philosophy website ]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the MSCP to undertake its activities using an office in the Department and University of Melbourne resources and teaching spaces. Late 2004, the MSCP invited Dr Marion Tapper of the University of Melbourne Philosophy Department to become a member. This merely formalised her involvement as she had always been supportive of the MSCP both philosophically and on account of knowing all of its members personally from teaching and supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html Marion Tapper, School of Philosophy staff profile]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One way in which the MSCP attempts to transcend its university boundaries is by seeking new ways to teach and engage with philosophy.  In particular, MSCP events strive to be both informal and rigorous. With their courses offering no credit or assessment, students who attend are usually there for the joy of philosophy and seek to further their own intellects outside of a formal classroom setting. Being a not-for-profit organisation, the MSCP charges a minimum for its courses; again, this is aimed at transcending the current economic climate of university funding.

== Membership ==

New members are typically recommended by current members and, largely because the organisation was founded by postgraduate students, they are usually honours year or postgraduate students themselves.

'''Melody type''' or '''type-melody'''&lt;ref&gt;David Hiley. ''Western Plainchant. A Handbook''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;331–33.&lt;/ref&gt; is a set of [[melody|melodic]] formulas, [[figure (music)|figures]], and [[melodic pattern|patterns]].

== Term and typical meanings ==
"Melody type" is a fundamental notion for understanding a nature of Western and non-Western musical [[Mode (music)|modes]], according to [[Harold Powers|Harold Powers']] seminal article "Mode" in the first edition of the ''[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' {{harv|Powers|1980|loc=12:376–77, 379, et passim}}.

Melody types are used in the [[musical composition|composition]] of an enormous variety of [[music]], especially [[music of Asia|non-Western]] and [[early music|early Western music]]. Such music is generally composed by a process of [[centonization]], either freely (i.e. improvised) or in a fixed pattern.

"Melody type" as used by the ethmnomusicologist [[Mark Slobin|Mark]] {{harvtxt|Slobin|1982|loc=186}}&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, Mark (1982). ''Tenement Songs: The Popular Music of the Jewish Immigrants''. Music in American Life. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-00893-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as a "group of melodies that are related, in that they all contain similar modal procedures and characteristic [[rhythm]]ic and melodic contours or patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Koskoff, Ellen (2000). ''Music in Lubavitcher Life'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press), p.&amp;nbsp;86. {{ISBN|978-0-252-02591-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cultures which compose music in this way organize the patterns into distinct melody types. These are often compared to modern Western [[musical scale|scale]]s, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible [[pitch (music)|pitches]], since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for [[improvisation]]. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.

{{quote|On one end of the continuum, the right, the melody type is a schema that is quite definite—a specific melody or a tune. When a musician improvises on this schema, he [or she] plays the melody with only slight variations. The basic outline is preserved and is clearly recognized by the listener. The best example&amp;nbsp;... on this end of the continuum is a folk song. A genuine folk song performance is a kind of improvisation. No one person sings it exactly as it came to him [or her]. One of the challenges of folk song research, of course, is to find all the variants of the tune and to try to trace the family relationships.&lt;br/&gt; On the left side of the continuum is the melody type as a [[musical mode|mode]]. Here the melody type is similar to a [[Gregorian mode|church mode]]: a scalar configuration with a preferential order of tones.&lt;br/&gt; ...The closer we get to the pole where a melody type is a tune, the more definite and literal is the schema.|May (1983)&lt;ref&gt;May, Elizabeth (1983). ''Musics of Many Cultures: An Introduction, Part 1'', p.&amp;nbsp;274. {{ISBN|978-0-520-04778-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|A melodic formula, ranging length from a short motif of a few notes to an entire melody, which is used as the basis for musical compositions. It differs from a mode, which simply sets forth a sequence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] (in Western music, half tones and whole tones), and from a scale (the notes of a mode in rising order of pitch), in that it is more specific: a melody type spells out actual sequences of tones, just as they are to appear in a piece, as well as particular beginnings and endings, [[ornament (music)|ornaments]], and other details. Melody types are found mostly in the music of ancient peoples—the Greeks, Hebrews, and others—and of Eastern peoples—the Arabs, Persians (Iranians), Indians, and others. For...example...[[raga]].|Ammer (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ammer, Christine (2004). "Melody type", ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;238. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5266-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pseudo-liturgical verses with initial numerals (''primum..., secundum..., tertia...'' etc.) helped singers to associate a current model with a 'real' chant (such as antiphon) of the same tone.

'''MusicWriter''' was founded in 1989 by music industry veterans [[Jon Monday]] and Larry Heller to develop and market NoteStation, a kiosk-based retail "point-of-sale manufacturing" system for the distribution and printing of [[sheet music]]. Besides having a very large library of songs across all music genres, the NoteStation was able to print the [[sheet music]] on demand in any key, as selected by the customer. This reduced the need for retailers to carry a large selection of physical inventory, which was usually only printed in one key.

Early in the MusicWriter's history [[Warner Bros.]] Music and [[Thorn EMI]], the two largest music publishers in the world, invested in the company and became board members. The company then was able to sign most of the major music publishers to offer their titles through the system.

MusicWriter was among the first applications of the new distribution paradigm of "Mass Customization" or "Point-of-Sale Manufacturing", where a retailer is able to offer a very large selection of a product, with virtually no inventory, and manufacture the customized product on the spot for a customer. This trend was documented in B. Joseph Pine II’s 1993 book, ''Mass Customization, The New Frontier in Business Competition'' published by Harvard Business School Press.

The company expanded its features to include producing [[MIDI]] files on demand and online ordering of music products from distributors.{{ref|Article1}}

The company was featured on CNN TV and written about in Fortune Magazine, Business Week, USA Today, San Francisco Examiner, San Jose Mercury News, and Popular Science.

Due to the major print music companies that fought against the technologies, in 1999 MusicWriter went bankrupt as online technology emerged and the decline of [[sheet music]] retailers made the in-store technology obsolete. However, years later online versions of the technology were introduced by other companies, such as SheetMusicDirect.com, MusicNotes.com, and SheetMusicPlus.com.

{{canon law}}
In the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], '''obrogation''' is the enacting of a contrary law that is a revocation of a previous law.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be the partial cancellation or amendment of a law, decree, or legal regulation by the imposition of a newer one.

==Obrogation==
In the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], obrogation is the modification or repeal of a law in whole or in part by issuing a new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Obrogate |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher=Merriam-Webster.com. |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obrogate}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=obrogate |work=[[Black's Law Dictionary]] |edition=7th |page=1104 |first1=Bryan A. |last1=Garner |authorlink1=Bryan A. Garner |publisher=[[West Publishing]] |location=St. Paul, Minnesota |year=1999 |isbn=0-314-22864-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] governs here in Canon 53: {{quote|If decrees are contrary one to another, where specific matters are expressed, the specific prevails over the general; if both are equally specific or equally general, the one later in time&lt;ref name=Can53/&gt; obrogates ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''obrogat''&lt;ref&gt;Caparros ''et al.'', ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]] Annotated'', canon 53 (pg. 66)&lt;/ref&gt; from ''obrogare''{{sfn|Black|Nolan|Connolly|1979|page=971}}) the earlier insofar as it is contrary to it.&lt;ref name=Can53&gt;[[1983 Code of Canon Law]], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P6.HTM Canon 53], accessed 24 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This canon incorporates Rule 34 in VI of the ''[[Regulae Iuris]]'': ''"Generi per speciem derogatur"'' or "The specific derogates from the general."&lt;ref&gt;Coriden ''et al.'', ''Commentary'', pg. 54 (commentary on canon 53).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ocean Networks Canada''' is a [[University of Victoria]] initiative that operates the [[NEPTUNE]] and [[VENUS]] cabled ocean observatories in the northeast [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Salish Sea]]. Additionally, Ocean Networks Canada operates smaller community-based observatories offshore from [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut]].,&lt;ref&gt;Juniper and McLean, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell River, Kitamaat Village and Digby Island. These observatories collect data on physical, chemical, biological, and geological aspects of the ocean over long time periods. As with other ocean observatories such as ESONET, [[Ocean Observatories Initiative]], MACHO and DONET, scientific instruments connected to Ocean Networks Canada are operated remotely and provide continuous streams of freely available data to researchers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Puilliat et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200 gigabytes of data are collected every day.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[VENUS]] Observatory is situated at three main sites in the [[Salish Sea]], including [[Saanich Inlet]] (depth 100 m), the eastern and central [[Strait of Georgia]] (depths 170–300 m), and the [[Fraser River]] delta.

The [[NEPTUNE]] observatory is situated off the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]] in [[Barkley Sound]], along the [[Cascadia subduction zone]], on the Cascadia Basin abyssal plain, and on the Endeavour segment of the  [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, the system includes 3 observatories, 5 shore stations, 850+ km of seafloor backbone cables, 11 instrumented sites, 32 instrument platforms, 6 mobile instrument platforms, 400+ instruments and over 2000 scientific sensors deployed.&lt;ref&gt;Heesemann et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific topics of study that are enabled by data from these observatories include Arctic oceanography,&lt;ref&gt;Juniper and McLean, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; deep-sea biodiversity,&lt;ref&gt;Matabos et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; marine ecosystem function,&lt;ref&gt;Wang and Pawlowicz, 22014&lt;/ref&gt; [[marine forensics]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2010&lt;/ref&gt; gas hydrates,&lt;ref&gt;Riedel and Willoughby, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; hydrothermal vents,&lt;ref&gt;Bemis et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; marine mammals,&lt;ref&gt;André et al, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; sediment&lt;ref&gt;Katz et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and benthic&lt;ref&gt;Robert et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; dynamics and tsunami&lt;ref&gt;Fine et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; studies.

== Study sites ==
Ocean Networks Canada instrumentations are installed in the following seafloor locations:

=== Salish Sea ===
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations in the Salish Sea.jpg|thumb|Ocean Networks Canada installations and data sources in the Salish Sea.]]

==== Saanich Inlet ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations in Saanich Inlet.jpg|thumb|2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations in Saanich Inlet between Sidney and Mill Bay, BC, on the east coast of Vancouver Island. This is one of the sites on the VENUS observatory. The University of Victoria's Ocean Technology Test Bed is located here as well.]]
Saanich Inlet, at the southern end of Vancouver Island, Canada, is a naturally hypoxic basin. A shallow sill (70 m) at the mouth isolates the deep basin (215 m) that experiences seasonal deep-water anoxia as a result of high primary productivity and subsequent degradation of sedimented organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;Matabos, Tunnicliffe et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Saanich Inlet network consists of cabled arrays of instruments in [[Mill Bay, British Columbia|Mill Bay]], [[Patricia Bay]] and an autonomous mooring at the entrance (sill) to the inlet. Two cabled surface buoys are connected to the Patricia Bay installation, supporting a technology testbed facility (Patricia Bay) and a full water column observation station (Coles Bay). Patricia Bay installations include:
* Seafloor network at 100 m depth connected to a shore station at the [[Institute of Ocean Sciences]]
* Surface buoy based Ocean Technology Testbed designed and built to support engineering and technology development.
* Surface based Buoy Profiling System (BPS) designed and built for water column measurements off Coles Bay in central Saanich Inlet.
* Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ("Bluefin")

In Mill Bay, a mini-observatory is installed at Brentwood College with basic sensors that measure water properties at 8 m depth.

==== Strait of Georgia ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations in the Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada's installations in the Salish Sea, which comprise the Strait of Georgia portion of the VENUS observatory.]]
A network with three sites on seafloor at Central, East and Fraser Delta&lt;ref&gt;Lintern and Hill, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; locations of the southern [[Strait of Georgia]], and surface-based systems on BC Ferries, Iona Causeway, and Coal Port terminal. Installations in the Strait of Georgia include:
* Seafloor networks linking 3 nodes at 300 m (Central), 175 m (East), and 170 m (Fraser Delta)
* Shore-based High Frequency radar (CODAR with 2 antennas)
* Instrumentation on BC Ferries vessels ("Seekeeper")
* Ocean glider (Webb "Slocum")

=== Northeast Pacific ===

==== Barkley Canyon ====
Barkley Canyon extends from the continental shelf edge at 400 m down the continental slope to the canyon axis at 985 m water depth. Located at the leading edge of the [[Cascadia subduction zone]], this site supports the study of the accretionary prism, where the sediments pile along the continental slope as they are scraped off the subducting or descending tectonic plate. This is also a location where pressure, temperature, gas saturation, and local biological and chemical conditions are just right for exposed gas hydrates to be stable on the seafloor. [[Gas hydrates]] have gas molecules, typically methane in marine environments, trapped within “cages” of water molecules. This gives them a crystalline structure that resembles ice and can appear as white to yellow mounds covered by sediment on the seafloor.

The region is influenced by a major ocean current system. Off the coast, the west wind drift current splits to create the Alaska and the California currents (the [[California current]] system). The direction and strength of the currents regulate the upwelling/downwelling regime along the coast, with a flow towards the equator in summer (California current) and reversal in winter (Alaska current). In addition to these two currents, a large submarine canyon acts as a primary conduit for the transfer of sediment from the continental slope to the deep-sea.

Organisms living in the depths of Barkley Canyon have evolved to be able to persist in areas with high pressure, no light, and low nutrients/food availability. The Barkley Canyon instruments span a diversity of habitats, each of which is associated with its own specialized biological community. Most of the areas within Barkley Canon are characterised by a soft, finely sedimented seafloor. Video observations suggest that animal densities are higher at the shallower sites compared with the deeper sites, although most species are present at all sites. A number of fish including sablefish, thornyheads, rockfish, flatfish, sharks, skates, hagfish and eelpouts have been observed throughout Barkley Canyon. The area is rich with invertebrates as well including molluscs (bivalves, octopus, snails), echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and urchins) as well as arthropods (crabs and shrimp). Cnidarians are seen both on the seafloor (anemones, sea pens, and corals) as well as floating in the water column (jellyfish) along with other organisms such as salps, ctenophores, and tunicates.&lt;ref&gt;Juniper et al, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Where gas hydrates are observed on the seafloor, there are mats of chemosynthetic bacteria which derive their energy from hydrogen sulphide produced by the oxidate of methane by a second group of microbes living deep within the sediments. Other chemosynthetic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria live in symbiosis with clams who live at these hydrate mounts. Many of the species observed elsewhere in Barkley Canyon are not dependent on this system but are frequently observed in the area.

==== Cascadia Basin ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations at Cascadia Basin.jpg|thumb|2013 layout of installations at Ocean Networks Canada's Cascadia Basin site on the NEPTUNE observatory.]]
The Cascadia Basin is the heavily sediment part of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] that extends from the base the continental margin to the west where the sediments lap on to the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank. The Juan de Fuca Plate is one of the last remnants of the [[Farallon Plate]], the original eastern Pacific oceanic plate, which has been almost entirely subducted beneath North America. The flat sediment surface constitutes an abyssal plain, an exceedingly vast environment that covers over 50% of the planet’s surface. Seemingly inhospitable, with temperatures below 2&amp;nbsp;°C, high-pressures, and a total absence of light, the Cascadia Basin is nevertheless home to an assortment of well-adapted organisms.

Depending mostly on marine snow—the continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from surface waters—little is known about the complicated food web connecting the organisms of the deep. Because of the harsh environment, there is a low density of organisms observed. Despite the low density, there is a fairly diverse community living on the abyssal plain. Installation and maintenance work has enabled a number of these organisms to be observed. The main groups of organisms observed include fish (skates and rattails), echinoderms (sea cucumbers, sea stars, brittle stars, and crinoids), molluscs (octopus and squid), sea pens, crabs, and squat lobsters. A number of pelagic (living in the water column) organisms were observed such as squid, jellyfish, ostracods, ctenophores, and salps.

A few isolated outcropping seamounts that pierce through more than 200 m of impermeable sediments, are conduits that allow hydrologic exchange between the open ocean and the upper oceanic crust—the largest aquifer of the planet. The Cascadia Basin site is placed in the vicinity of several circulation obviation retrofit kit (CORK) borehole observatories, which are designed to study the hydrology, geochemistry and microbiology of the upper oceanic crust. CORKs are also being used to investigate changes in regional plate strain that are caused by earthquakes on the plate boundaries. The seafloor pressure measurements of the CORK borehole observatories constitute the center of a “[[tsunami]]-meter”, a network of several high precision, rapid sampling bottom pressure recorders (BPRs), that allows precise determination of deep water tsunami amplitude, direction of propagation, and speed.

==== Clayoquot Slope ====
The name Clayoquot (pronounced “Clah-quot”) is an anglicized version of Tla-o-qui-aht, the largest nation in the [[Nuu-chah-nulth]] (Nootka) First Nations, whose people have resided in the [[Clayoquot Sound]] region near [[Tofino]] and [[Ucluelet, British Columbia|Ucluelet]] for at least the last 2000 years. The Clayoquot Slope site lies about 1250 m below sea level and approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km landward of the toe of the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. The Cascadia subduction zone is the area at which the [[Juan de Fuca plate]] is subducting (descending) beneath the North American plate. This is a zone where much of the thick layer of sediments deposited on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are scraped off and accreted as the tectonic plates converge (move together). As sediments thicken and compact from accretion, pore waters are expelled from the sediment, and gases — primarily biogenic methane — contribute to the formation of [[gas hydrates]] in the upper few hundred metres of the sediment. At this site, a cold vent, known as Bullseye Vent, has formed along with significant concentrations of gas hydrates.&lt;ref&gt;Scherwath et al, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Clayoquot Slope is home to a variety of deep-sea organisms. Many demersal fish (fish which live very near the bottom) were observed (rockfish, flatfish, throny heads, and rattails) along with echinoderms (sea cucumbers, brittle stars, sea stars), octopus, crabs, cnidarians (sea pens, corals, anemones), and bacterial mats. In the water column, organisms such as squid, krill, jellyfish, siphonophores, and larvaceans have been observed during installation and maintenance work.

==== Endeavour ====
[[File:Ocean Networks Canada Installations at Endeavour.jpg|thumb|2013 map of Ocean Networks Canada installations along the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca mid-ocean ridge in the northeast Pacific. This site is part of the NEPTUNE observatory.]]
Endeavour (depth 2200–2400 m) is a northern segment of the [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]] which, in turn, is part of the complex, 80,000&amp;nbsp;km long mid-ocean ridge system spanning the World Ocean. Juan de Fuca Ridge is a medium rate spreading centre (~6&amp;nbsp;cm/yr) forming the divergent boundary between the Pacific (to the west) and the Juan de Fuca (to the east) tectonic plates . At these divergent boundaries, convection currents in the mantle rise up as magma, emerge through the rifts as lava, and crystallise as new rock (basalts and gabbro). These processes continually create new ocean crust. Hydrothermal vents, which typically form along these mid-ocean ridges, are fissures from which geothermally heated water flows. The water flowing out of vents is dominantly seawater drawn into the system through the faults, porous sediments, and volcanic rocks. As the cool seawater moves through the sediment and rock towards the hot magma, the water becomes super heated (300-400&amp;nbsp;°C) and rich in dissolved mineral elements (such as sulphur, iron, zinc and copper) from the young ocean crust. When the hot effluent is expelled, it encounters the cold, ambient seawater (about 2&amp;nbsp;°C) minerals precipitate from the element-rich vent water. At the Endeavour segment, a notably vigorous venting area, black smokers form at the high temperature vents,where the effluent is precipitating iron sulphides.This gives the plumeits dark colour and deposits sulphide-minerals, creating chimneys up to 30 m in height. There are 6 known vent fields with distinct morphologies spaced about 2&amp;nbsp;km apart along the axial rift valley of the segment.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley et al, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

These tall sulphide chimneys (hydrothermal vents) host some unique ecological communities. While most of the deep sea depends on near-surface productivity with photosynthesis as its fundamental energy source, vent communities are completely independent from the surface and sunlight. Bacteria are able to use reduced compounds from the vent effluent as an energy source ([[chemosynthesis]]). These bacteria can be free-living or symbiotic and are the base of the food web of these communities where 90% of the species are endemic to this special environment. The tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae grows in large colonies in diffuse venting areas, supported by the symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria developing in their cells. These worms have no mouth and rely on their internal symbiotic bacteria to survive. Other species living within hydrothermal communities include limpets, worms (scale worms and sulphide worms), fish, and sea spiders.

Folger Passage is located at the mouth of [[Barkley Sound]], offshore [[Vancouver Island]] near [[Bamfield, BC|Bamfield]], British Columbia. The seafloor composition includes cobble, gravel, soft sandy sediment, and carbonate-rich detritus. Two instrument platforms, Folger Deep (100 m) and Folger Pinnacle (23 m), are installed at Folger Passage. Folger Deep is situated on soft sediment at the mouth of an inlet channel while the Folger Pinnacle platform is secured to the top of a rocky reef within a rockfish conservation area.

This coastal zone is ideal for studies of land-ocean interactions and coastal physical oceanography. Estuarine circulation from Barkley Sound is influenced by the shelf dynamics of an eastern boundary current, creating a complex physical environment. Surface outflow drives a deep water inflow which is strongly influenced by upwelling and downwelling conditions on the nearby continental shelf. The nutrient-rich, terrestrial freshwater discharge and the nutrient-rich, cool, salty upwelled water support a diverse and abundant ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowicz and McClure, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Folger Pinnacle, located atop a shallow reef, has dense mats of sponges, ascidians and encrusting algae. There are numerous types of sessile (bottom attached) organisms including sponges, anemones, bryozoans, tunicates, and barnacles. Since this is a rockfish conservation area, there is a wide variety of rockfish (yellowtail, China, quillback, Puget Sound, black, and blue) in addition to many other fish (kelp greenling, lingcod, flatfish, wolfeels), molluscs (giant Pacific octopus, mussles, swimming scallops, and snails), and echinoderms (seastars, sea cucumbers, and urchins). An echosounder installed at Folger Deep shows evidence of a dense zooplankton community and schools of fish in the water column, while hydrophones regularly record the songs of whales and dolphins in the area.

'''Promulgation''' in the '''canon law''' of the [[Catholic Church]] is the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] for the law to obtain legal effect. Universal [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|laws]] are promulgated when they are published in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', and unless specified to the contrary, [[vacatio legis|obtain legal force]] three months after promulgation.&lt;ref name=Canon8.1&gt;Canon 8 §1, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Particular laws are promulgated in various ways but by default take effect one month after promulgation.&lt;ref name=Canon8.2&gt;Canon 8 §2, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and nature==
Promulgation is the act by which the legislator manifests to those subject to his jurisdiction the decision that he has made and makes known to them his intention to bind them to the observance of his law.&lt;ref name=Metz41&gt;Metz, René. ''What is Canon Law?'', pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without having been promulgated, the canonical law in question has no legal effect, since promulgation is "an essential factor of legislation"&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and "an absolute condition for the effectiveness of a law".&lt;ref name=Metz41/&gt;
{{quote|
For as law is a rational precept, no one can be bound to obey it if it have not been sufficiently made known to him. Ignorance takes away the voluntary ;&lt;ref&gt;Sic (space after "voluntary" and before semicolon).&lt;/ref&gt; and where there is nothing voluntary there can be no fault or punishment.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia393&gt;Taunton, Ethelred Luke. ''The Law of the Church: A Cyclopedia of Canon Law for English-speaking Countries'' (1906: K. Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Company, Limited, 1906), pg. 393. https://books.google.com/books?id=AiS4eZsQyCwC&amp;dq=Taunton,+Cyclopaedia+Canon+law&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 accessed 18 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Promulgation is a "formal and fundamental element"&lt;ref name=Manual70&gt;Della Rocca, Fernando. ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; of canon law. For the purposes of canonical jurisprudence, promulgation is equivalent to publication.&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt;

Once promulgation takes place, a canonical law acquires its last "essential condition" and takes immediate effect,&lt;ref name=Abbo&amp;Hannan16&gt;Abbo &amp; Hannan, ''Sacred Canons'', pg. 16 (commentary on canon 8, 1917 CIC)&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the ''[[vacatio legis]]'' imposed by universal law, or by the particular legislator issuing a law (see section below).

The nature of promulgation in its relation to the nature of canon law is a matter of discussion among canonical writers. Some canonists hold that promulgation as such "enters the very essence of the law",&lt;ref name=Abbo&amp;Hannan16/&gt; while Abbo &amp; Hannan hold what they assert to be "the more probable opinion that promulgation is merely an extrinsic essential condition ''sine qua non''."&lt;ref name=Abbo&amp;Hannan16/&gt;

==Legal requirements==
{{quote|For sufficient promulgation, the law must be published in such a way that it can come to the notice of the community, although it be not brought specially and singly before the notice of individuals.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia393/&gt;}}

===Universal &amp; particular law===
A [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|law]] issued by the [[Pope]] (or with his consent in the case of laws issued by an [[ecumenical council]] or [[congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]]) is promulgated when it is published in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', and by default has the [[force of law]] three calendar months&lt;ref name=Compendium176&gt;De Meester, ''Juris Canonici Compendium'', v. 1, pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; after promulgation.&lt;ref name=Canon8.1/&gt;

{{quote|Pontifical laws and [[apostolic constitution]]s begin to oblige, so far as is ''ex se'', the whole world as soon as they have been solemnly promulgated in [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]] and come to the knowledge of others. It is not necessary that they should be promulgated in every province or [[diocese (Roman Catholic)|diocese]] unless such is stated in the laws themselves.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia393/&gt;}}

Particular laws, issued by bishops and [[synod|particular council]]s, are promulgated in various ways but, unless specified to the contrary, take effect one calendar month&lt;ref name=Compendium176/&gt;

===''Vacatio legis''===
{{main article|Vacatio legis}}
In principle, a law becomes binding from the time of its promulgation. But because there are often reasons that the immediate efficacy of a law would be detrimental to those upon whom it enjoins, the legislator often orders a delay—''vacatio''—in the law's applicability.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'', pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Latin canon law]], the ''vacatio legis'' is three months for universal laws,&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §1"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; and one month for particular laws,&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §2"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; unless the law itself establishes a longer or shorter period of time.&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §2"/&gt; The legislator of the law can stipulate a longer or shorter time of ''[[vacatio legis|vacatio]]'' than that which is stipulated generally.&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt;

===Computation of time===
{{main article|Computation of time}}
Months are computed according to the calendar from the date of publication.&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt; A "canonical month" (in contradistinction to a "calendar month") is a period of 30 days,&lt;ref&gt;Canon 202 §1, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; while a "calendar month" is a continuous month. The ''[[vacatio legis]]'' is computed according to the calendar; for example, if a law is promulgated on 2 November, and the ''vacatio legis'' is 3 months, then the law takes effect on 2 February.&lt;ref name=Compendium176/&gt; So a universal law has a ''[[vacatio legis]]'' of approximately 90 days—3 months taken according to the calendar—while a particular law has a ''vacatio legis'' of approximately 30 days—1 month taken according to the calendar—unless specified to the contrary.

==History==
{{see also|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
According to Canon 7 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], ''Lex instituitur cum promulgatur'' ("A law is instituted when it is promulgated").&lt;ref&gt;Canon 7, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is an ancient provision in [[Latin Church|Latin-rite]] [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], dating in its plural form to the [[ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] formulation of the great twelfth-century [[codification (law)|codifier]] of canon law, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]: ''Leges instituuntur cum promulgantur'' ("Laws are instituted when they are promulgated"). The exact same formulation found in Gratian's ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'' was reproduced in the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]],&lt;ref&gt;Canon 8, [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Latin plural of the original was modified to its singular form (''Leges'' to ''Lex'', ''instituuntur'' to ''instituitur'', and ''promulgantur'' to ''promulgatur'').

In previous times laws issued by the Holy See were affixed to the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], the [[Basilica of St. Peter]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria|Palace of the Apostolic Chancery]], and in the [[Campo de' Fiori|Campo dei Fiori]]. Since the laws had been posted publicly in the city (Urbi), they were deemed to have been promulgated to the world (Orbi).&lt;ref name=Metz41/&gt; The current method of promulgating universal laws—publishing them in the ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis''—was introduced by Pope Pius X with the apostolic constitution ''Promulgandi'' of 29 September 1908, and was confirmed by the 1917 Code.&lt;ref name=Metz41/&gt;

A recent trend is to promulgate universal laws independently of their publication in the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis|''Acta Apostolicæ Sedis'']], with the ''Acta'' remaining the source for their official Latin text.&lt;ref name=Coriden30&gt;Coriden, James A., ''et al.'', ''The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary'', pg. 30 (commentary on Canon 8).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the [[Holy See]] does not give its assent to translations of the [[Latin]] originals (so-called "'authentic' translations"&lt;ref name=Coriden30/&gt;); the Holy See is content to publish the Latin alone, as Latin is the official language of canon law.&lt;ref name=Coriden30/&gt;

==Promulgation in general==
(Lat. ''promulgare,'' to make known, to post in public).
This is the act by which the legislative power makes legislative enactments known to the authorities entrusted with their execution and to the subjects bound to observe them. Philosophically it is a matter of dispute whether promulgation is of the essence of a law. It seems indisputable that the essential element of a law is the will of the legislator, but it is clear that the legislator should make known his will and intention in one way or another. This manifestation is the promulgation of the law, which is not necessarily distinct from the very elaboration of the law, provided that this takes place by external acts-such as the vote of a legislative assembly or by royal sanction. Such is the practice observed in England and in most of the states of the American Union, but, as it was thought too severe, the legislation of various countries requires the promulgation of laws by a special formal act, through which the text of the law is made known to the community, e.g. by publication of this text in an official journal or bulletin of the Government. Previous to this publication the law does not take effect. The promulgation of a law must not be confounded with its publication, the object of the first being to make known the will of the legislator, of the second to spread the knowledge of legislative enactments among subjects bound to observe them.

==Promulgation in canon law==

The Church has long exacted the promulgation of a law by a special act of the authorities: "Leges instituuntur cum promulgantur", a law is not really a law until it has been made known, says Gratian (Decretum Gratiani, pt. I, c. 3, dist. VII). However, no special form is prescribed for acts of ecclesiastical authorities inferior to the pope, even synodal decrees being considered sufficiently promulgated by being read in the synod. The Constitution "Promulgandi" of Pius X (29 September 1908) determined the ordinary method of promulgating pontifical laws, namely by the insertion of the text of the law in the "Acta Apostolica Sedis" (the official publication of the Holy See), after the insertion has been ordered by the secretary or the supreme authority of the congregation or the office through the medium of which the pope has passed the law. A regulation of 5 January 1910, divides the official bulletin of the Holy See into two parts: in the first or official part should be inserted all documents requiring promulgation to have the force of law; the second merely serves to illustrate and supplement the first (Acta Apost. Sedis, 1910, p.&amp;nbsp;36). However, the pope explicitly reserves the right to determine in exceptional cases another method of promulgation. Prior to this law two systems had been chiefly in use in the Church-provincial promulgation, until the end of the thirteenth century, and Roman promulgation. During the first period promulgation often took place in the different ecclesiastical provinces either through special envoys or through the bishops. Nevertheless, it is also a fact that laws binding in one province were also binding in others. During the second period the custom, which became exclusive during the fifteenth century, developed of having the new laws read and posted up by ''cursores'' at Rome only, at the doors of the great basilicas, the Palazzo Cancellaria, the Campo de' fiori, and sometimes at the Capitol. The value of this means of promulgation was disputed in modern times: some claimed that the Church had admitted the arrangements of Novels lxvi and cxvi of Justinian, which required provincial promulgation for some laws; others maintained that in theory publication at Rome was sufficient, but that the popes did not wish to bind the faithful before the laws were made known to them by the bishops; while others appealed to ancient customs, to which the pope should conform. This last theory, made use of by the Gallicans and Febronianists, furnished the State with a pretext for preventing the promulgation of laws which it did not like. A special method of promulgation was also introduced with the express or tacit consent of the Holy See for the decrees of congregations; they were published at the secretariate of the dicasteries from which they emanated.

'''''Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic: Rock 'n' Roll as Literature and Literature as Rock 'n' Roll''''' is a collection of essays written by famous rock music critic [[Lester Bangs]]. Named for a 1971 article of the same title, it was edited by [[Greil Marcus]] and released in 1987, five years after Bangs' death. In his introduction, Marcus explains that, "Perhaps what this book demands from a reader is a willingness to accept that the best writer in America could write almost nothing but record reviews."

The book consists mainly of Bangs' published articles, beginning with his early work for ''[[Creem]]'' magazine before moving into his later writings as a freelancer for ''[[New Musical Express]]'' and other publications. Many of his most famous works are present, including the title piece on garage rock band the [[Count Five]] and the [[Troggs]]-inspired "James Taylor Marked for Death" from his earlier career as well as an acclaimed profile of [[the Clash]] and a tribute to [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' from his later years. One chapter of the book is devoted entirely to Bangs' infamous series of interviews with [[Lou Reed]], including "[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves]]," while another chapter features unpublished essays and an unfinished novel excerpt, "Maggie May".

'''Pure alexia''', also known as '''agnosic alexia''' or '''alexia without agraphia''' or '''pure word blindness''', is one form of [[Alexia (condition)|alexia]] which makes up "the peripheral dyslexia" group.&lt;ref name="Acquired dyslexia"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coslett HB |title=Acquired dyslexia |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=419–26 |year=2000 |pmid=11149697 |doi=10.1055/s-2000-13174 |url=https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2000-13174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have pure alexia have severe reading problems while other language-related skills such as naming, oral repetition, auditory comprehension or writing are typically intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behrmann M, Shomstein SS, Black SE, Barton JJ |title=The eye movements of pure alexic patients during reading and nonreading tasks |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=983–1002 |year=2001 |pmid=11516450 |doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00021-5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Pure alexia results from cerebral lesions in circumscribed brain regions and therefore belongs to the group of acquired reading disorders, [[Alexia (condition)|alexia]],&lt;ref name="Acquired dyslexia"/&gt; as opposed to [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]] found in children who have difficulties in learning to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Temple CM |title=Developmental and acquired dyslexias |journal=Cortex |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=898–910 |date=August 2006 |pmid=17131596 |doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70434-9 |url=http://www.cortexjournal.net/article/S0010-9452%2808%2970434-9/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Pure alexia almost always involves an infarct to the left [[posterior cerebral artery]] (which perfuses the [[splenium of the corpus callosum]] and left [[visual cortex]], among other things). The resulting deficit will be pure alexia – i.e., the patient can write but cannot read (even what they have just written).  However, because pure alexia affects visual input, not auditory input, patients with pure alexia can recognize words that are spelled out loud to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-23939-0|page=501|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the left visual cortex has been damaged, leaving only the right visual cortex ([[occipital lobe]]) able to process visual information, but it is unable to send this information to the language areas ([[Broca's area]], [[Wernicke's area]], etc.) in the left brain because of the damage to the [[splenium]] of the corpus callosum. Patients with this deficit mostly do have a stroke to the posterior cerebral artery. But they may be susceptible to pure alexia as a consequence of other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) as well. Anything that stops proper blood flow to the area necessary for normal reading abilities will cause a form of alexia.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. |title= Treatment for Alexia With Agraphia Following Left Ventral Occipito-Temporal Damage: Strengthening Orthographic Representations Common to Reading and Spelling.  |journal= JSLHR |year=2015 |doi=10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0286 |url= |volume=58 |page=1521|pmc=4686312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posterior cerebral artery is a main local for the cause of this deficit because this artery is not just responsible for itself. It also supplies the anterior temporal branches, the posterior temporal branches, the calcarrine branch, and the parieto-occipital branch.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R.|title= Visual Attention in Posterior Stroke and Relations to Alexia |journal= Neuropsychologia |date=2015 |doi=10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0286 |url= |volume=58 |page=1521|pmc=4686312}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is important about these arteries is their location. All of them supply blood to the back outer parts of the brain.&lt;ref name="Imaging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Imaging|url= http://ophthalmology.stanford.edu/blog/archives/imaging/ |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the brain is also referred to as the posterior lateral part of the brain. In cases of pure alexia, locations are found in the section of the brain, specifically the temporo-occipital area.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; This is the area that is activated when people without any sort of alexia receive activation when undergoing orthographic processing. This area is known as the visual word form area due to this pattern of activation.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;

These people typically adapt to their disability and are able to use a style of compensatory reading known as letter-by-letter reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexia|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/friedmar/alexia.html|website=Cognitive Neuropsychology Laboratory|publisher=Center for Aphasia Research and Rehabilitation|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of reading takes longer than the conventional style of reading does. As the number of letters in a word increases, the amount of time it takes for the person with pure alexia increases. For each letter that is added, a patient may take up to an additional three seconds to read the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montant|first1=Marie|last2=Behrmann|first2=Marlene|title=Pure Alexia|journal=Neurocase|date=2000|volume=6|pages=265–294|url=https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~behrmann/dlpapers/MontantBehrmann.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015|doi=10.1080/13554790008402777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that pure alexia may be a result of a disconnection syndrome. Analysis of diffusion images showed that the visual word form area (VWFA) is connected to the occipital lobe via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), a projection that runs between the temporal and occipital lobe. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) showed that two weeks after surgery in the ILF, the VWFA-Occipital Lobe tract was severely degenerated. The results came from an epileptic patient who showed symptoms of pure alexia after his surgery. Thus, the proposed pathophysiological mechanism is that the ILF lesion interferes with transmission of visual information to the VWFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epelbaum|first1=S.|title=Pure alexia as a disconnection syndrome: New diffusion imaging evidence for an old concept|journal=Cortex|date=2008|volume=44|issue=8|pages=962–974|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.05.003|pmid=18586235}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, an alternative view that suggests the "VWFA" is devoted to processing of high acuity foveal input, which is particularly salient for complex visual stimuli like letter strings. Studies have highlighted disrupted processing of non-linguistic visual stimuli after damage to the left pFG, both for familiar and unfamiliar objects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Woollams|first2=AM|last3=Kim|first3=E|last4=Beeson|first4=PM|last5=Rapcsak|first5=SZ|last6=Lambon Ralph|first6=MA|title=Efficient Visual Object and Word Recognition Relies on High Spatial Frequency Coding in the Left Posterior Fusiform Gyrus: Evidence from a Case-Series of Patients with Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex Damage|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=24 August 2012|volume=23|issue=11|pages=2568–2580|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhs224|pmid=22923086|pmc=3792736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Kim|first3=ES|last4=Tainturier|first4=MJ|last5=Beeson|first5=PM|last6=Rapcsak|first6=SZ|last7=Woollams|first7=AM|title=Processing deficits for familiar and novel faces in patients with left posterior fusiform lesions|journal=Cortex|date=November 2015|volume=72|pages=79–96|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2015.02.003|pmid=25837867|pmc=4643682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure alexia exhibits some unexpected residual abilities despite the inability to read words. For instance, one patient had preserved calculation capabilities such as deciding which number was greater, and whether a number was odd or even with greater than chance probability. The study showed that the patient was also able to calculate simple arithmetic tasks such as addition, subtraction, and division, but not multiplication, even though the patient could not read the numbers. For example, the patient would be presented with "8 – 6", and he or she would read it as "five minus four", but still come up with the correct answer "two" with greater than chance accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=L.|title=Calculating Without Reading: Unsuspected Residual Abilities In Pure Alexia|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=2000|volume=17|issue=6|pages=563–583|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/02643290050110656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure alexia patients also seem to retain some residual semantic processing. They are able to perform better than chance when forced to make a lexical decision or make a semantic-categorisation decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Woollams|first3=AM|title=When does less yield more?

However, this may be due to right hemisphere input or residual left hemisphere input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coslett|first1=H.B.|title=Evidence For Preserved Reading In ‘Pure Alexia’|journal=Brain|date=1989|volume=112|issue=2|pages=327–359|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/brain/112.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In patients, a common symptom is letter-by-letter reading or LBL. This action is a compensatory strategy which these patients use in order to come up with a semblance of reading.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; It is essentially looking at the consonants and vowels of the word and sounding them out as they sound. However, this method does not always work, especially for words like 'phone' where the ph sounds like an f, but if sounded out, does not sound like an f. Also, by reading words in the fashion, the rate at which patients read words is much slower compared to people who do not have this disability. Petersen et al. proved that the issue of reading time had more to do with the length of the words than reading ability. The team had 4 patients with right hemisphere damage and 4 patients with left hemisphere damage in the temporo-occipital lobes as well as 26 controls were shown one word at a time on a screen. They were exposed to 20 words of 3 and 5 letters, 12 words of 7 letters. The subjects were asked to read the words as quickly and as accurately as possible. The patients with left hemisphere lesions consistently read the longer words slower than the controls despite the difficulty of the word.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; It is thought that as the word gets longer, the letters on the outsides of the word go into peripheral vision, making the patient shift their attention thus making the patient take longer to read.

==Rehabilitation==
Though there have been ample attempts to rehabilitate patients with pure alexia, few have proven to be effective on a large scale. Most rehabilitation practices have been specialized to a single patient or small patient group. At the simplest level, patients seeking rehabilitation are asked to practice reading words aloud repeatedly. This is meant to stimulate the damaged system of the brain. This is known as multiple oral re-reading (MOR) treatment. This is a text-based approach that is implemented in order to prevent patients from LBL reading. MOR works by reading aloud the same text repeatedly until certain criteria are reached.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; The most important criteria for a pure alexic patient is reading at an improved rate. The treatment aims to shift patients away from the LBL reading strategy by strengthening links between visual input and the associated orthographic representations. This repetition supports the idea of using top-down processing initially minimize the effects peripheral processing which were demonstrated in the study above.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imaging"/&gt; From here, the goal is to increase bottom-up processing. This will hopefully aid in word recognition and promote interactive processing of all available information to support reading. 'The supported reading stimulation from MOR has a rehabilitative effect so that reading rate and accuracy are better for untrained text, and word-form recognition improves as evidenced by a reduced word-length effect.'&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; These tactics have seen quite good success. 
Another tactic that has been employed is the use of cross modal therapy. In this therapy, patients are asked to trace the words in which they are trying to read aloud. There has been success using cross modal therapy such as kinaesthetic or motor-cross cuing therapy, but tends to be a more feasible approach for those on the slower reading end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leff|first1=Alexander P.|last2=Schofield|first2=T.

{{otheruses|Assimilation (disambiguation)}}

'''Religious assimilation''' refers to the adoption of a majority or dominant [[culture]]'s [[Religion|religious]] practices and [[Belief|beliefs]] by a minority or subordinate culture. It is an important form of [[cultural assimilation]].

Religious assimilation includes the [[religious conversion]] of individuals from a minority [[faith]] to the dominant faith. It can also include the religious [[indoctrination]] of children into a dominant religion by their converted parents. However, religious assimilation need not involve wholesale adoption of a dominant religious belief system by a minority; the concept is broad enough to include alterations in the frequency of religious participation to match that of the dominant culture. Indeed, religious assimilation among [[Immigration|immigrant]] groups most commonly involves such minor changes, rather than sweeping change in religious belief systems.{{r|Connor-2010|p=134}}

In sharp contrast to other aspects of cultural assimilation such as language and nationality, dominant cultures in general tend not to expect immigrants to adopt the dominant religion.{{r|Connor-2010|p=3}} Some researchers, such as [[Will Herberg]], have advanced a thesis of perpetual [[religious pluralism]], to the effect that [[Immigration|immigrants]] would typically retain their religious affiliation even after complete cultural assimilation in other aspects of culture.{{r|Yang-and-Ebaugh-2010|p=368}} Nevertheless, some dominant cultures may exert pressures for religious assimilation so extreme as to amount, according to some researchers, to a form of [[religious persecution]].{{r|LeMay-2010}} These pressures may be exerted by making other, more appealing forms of cultural assimilation, such as membership in secular social club activities, so time-consuming that they interfere seriously with attendance at minority religious services, and by discouraging expression of minority religious beliefs in public.{{r|LeMay-2010}}

{{For|the art medium|social practice (art)}}

'''Social artistry''' is the attempt to address or recognize a particular social issue using art and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; Social artists are people who use creative skills to work with people or organizations in their community to affect change.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://www.jeanhouston.org/Social-Artistry/social-artistry.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; While a traditional artist uses their creative skills to express their take on the world, a social artist puts their skills to use to help promote and improve communities. Thus, the main aim of a social artist is to improve society as a whole and to help other people find their own means of creative expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialartistryinstitute.org/who_we_are.htm Institute of Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artists may address issues such as youth alienation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/creative-youth-camps/ Creative Youth Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; or the breakdown of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://education.jhu.edu/research/newhorizons/future/articles/social-artistry/index.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, social artists will address these problems by helping people express themselves and find their voice, or by bringing people together and using art to help them to foster an understanding of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wenger-Trayner [http://wenger-trayner.com/resources/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artistry can incorporate several different art forms including [[theatre]], [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]]. 

Findings from 2013 confirm the shift from individual expression to community engagement, or "from autonomous to socially engaged."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingo and Tepper cite several examples:
#contemporary artists "see themselves as educators, social workers, policy actors, and health providers (Lena &amp; Cornfield, 2008; Simonds, 2013; Throsby &amp; Zednik, 2011)
#Nick Rabkin writes "more arts graduates end up in education than in any other occupation" (2013)
#social practice artists "freely blur the lines among object making, performance, political activism, community organizing, environmentalism and investigative journalism, creating a deeply [[participatory art]] that often flourishes outside the gallery and museum system"&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Ethnomusicology''' is, with the [[International Council for Traditional Music]] and the [http://www.bfe.org.uk/ British Forum for Ethnomusicology], one of three major international associations for [[ethnomusicology]]. Its mission is "to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Officially founded in 1955, its origins extend back to November, 1953 at the annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] in Philadelphia with an informal agreement between [[Willard Rhodes]], [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]], and [[Alan P. Merriam]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1953. "Introduction." ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'' 1 (December), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These three traveled together to the annual meeting of the [[American Musicological Society]] in New Haven to enlist the support of musicologist [[Charles Seeger]] in their endeavor to create a new academic society. This meeting resulted in the launch of the ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'', ethnomusicology's first dedicated serial publication, containing notes about current field research projects, a bibliography, and list of recordings of interest to the nascent discipline. The first annual meeting of the society was in [[Philadelphia]], in September 1955.

Over the decades, The Society for Ethnomusicology has created a setting that allows scholars to publish and present their work from the field, better communicate and connect with fellow researchers, and provides leadership opportunities for those striving to improve the field of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Nettl, “We’re on the Map: Reflections on SEM in 1955 and 2005,” ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The society currently publishes a quarterly newsletter, a quarterly journal entitled ''Ethnomusicology'', and an extensive set of "ographies" (bibliography, discography, filmography, videography). It organizes an annual international conference and over a dozen regional conferences, maintains an active website, and presents more than a dozen awards for scholarship and service, such as the [[Jaap Kunst]] prize for the best published article in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/general/custom.asp?page=Prizes_Kunst |title=Jaap Kunst Prize - Society for Ethnomusicology |publisher=Ethnomusicology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of SEM==

===Before 1953===

The founding of the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ Society for Ethnomusicology] was not the first attempt at an organization focusing on the music of the world. Before the work of SEM’s founders in the 1950s, several efforts in Europe had taken place through the work of dozens of musicologists and those who would eventually be considered ethnomusicologists, including [[Frances Densmore]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], and [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]]. These and other scholars found inspiration in Viennese [[Guido Adler]] and Englishman [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], who both produced articles in 1885 discussing “ethnological studies” of music and the equal treatment of every society’s music.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"&gt;Nettl 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, scholars turned to Austrian [[Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]], credited with inventing the musical instrument categorization system still used today, and his 1905 article outlining "The Problems of Comparative Musicology."&lt;ref name="Nettl180"&gt;Nettl 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ethnomusicology, though casually used towards the mid-1900s, was not widely used officially. The word first appeared in publication in [[Jaap Kunst]]'s book, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods representative personalities'', which wasn’t published in 1955.&lt;ref name="Nettl180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Kunst, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods and representative personalities; to which is added a bibliography'', Martinus Nijhoff, The Hauge, Netherlands, 1955, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

These works are a few of the examples of some of the musical thought taking place at the turn of the century. However, many European thinkers found fewer resources and more censorship with the incoming Second World War. In response, Charles Seeger helped found the American Society for Comparative Musicology to house the number of musicologists fleeing the rise of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willard Rhodes, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924574 A Decade of Progress]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 178, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM History"&gt;William Rhodes, "[http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=History_Founding SEM History]", The Society for Ethnomusicology Website, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953===

In November 1953, [[David P. McAllester]], [[Alan P. Merriam]], and [[Willard Rhodes]] attended the 52nd Annual Meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] taking place in the city of [[Philadelphia]]. The three found they shared a common interest, particularly in North American Indian music, but also had productive conversation about, "the problems of ethnomusicology, historical, theoretical and methodological, and above all, a need for association and communication with persons with similar interests."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; The scholars believed that the ever-evolving field of ethnomusicology would be better navigated if the scholars, musicologist, anthropologists, and anyone with passion for ethnomusicology formed a society. The three agreed that producing a newsletter was the first step in founding a society, as it would unite the wider community of scholars to better communicate research and ideas of their fellow scholars. Rhodes suggested seeking out colleague [[Charles Seeger]] as a fellow conspirator. Following the American Anthropology Association meeting, the team traveled to the [[American Musicological Society]] annual meeting the following December. Seeger became the fourth member of the group and, under his consultation and Merriam’s editorship, the Newsletter began to take shape.

Ignited and led by McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, and Seeger, Ethno-musicology Newsletter No. 1 was mailed to about 300 individuals and institutions. While the initial effort towards the creation of the Newsletter lies solely with these four men, many other scholars were working towards the goals the Newsletter set out to promote. A letter separate from the Newsletter signed by the aforementioned four, but also [[Manfred Bukofzer]], [[Frances Densmore]], Mieczslaw Kolinksi, [[Curt Sachs]] (who worked alongside Hornbostel), [[Harold Spivacke]], and Richard Waterman, was sent to about 70 individuals. The letter stated, "It must be emphasized that the present effort is the prerogative of no individual or group of individuals rather, the project is conceived as the joint effort of all those interested in seeing contact reestablished among ethnomusicologists."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt;

===1955-1962===

The popularity of the Newsletter increased dramatically, jumping to 472 recipients by April 1955.&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; With the intense interest in ethnomusicology, it was felt that the society could soon be founded. The September Newsletter announced that an organized meeting of ethnomusicologists would take place at the 54th Annual Meeting of American Anthropology Association in [[Boston]] on November 18, 1955. McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, Seeger, and several others, nearly all recipients of the Newsletter, founded the Society for Ethnomusicology and elected its first council:

President: Williard Rhodes,

Honorary President: Curt Sachs

Vice President: Mieczlaw Kolinki

Sectretary-Treasurer: David McAllester

Editor: Alan Merriam

The first official annual conference for the Society for Ethnomusicology was held the following year in alongside the 5th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences on September 5, 1956 in Philadelphia. The constitution was drafted, officer positions expanded, and mission statement defined: “…to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; It was also decided that the hyphen would be removed from ethno-musicology with some disapproval."&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/852423 Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992)]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 37 (1993): 251-262, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, it was recorded that 25% of the Society’s membership was made up of non-U.S. residents and only 7% of that were Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Newsletter expanded and added David McAllester and [[Bruno Nettl]] as editors. In 1962, [[Wesleyan University]] took over the publication of the printed pamphlet newsletter, which had until this point been sponsored by the founding four.

===1963-1955===

In 1963, The Society for Ethnomusicology produce a special, tenth anniversary issue with articles that looked back at the Newsletter and Society’s accomplishments. Challenged to find a way to measure these successes, David McAllester and Donald Winkelman both commented on the impressive efforts made at academic institutions around the country to include courses entirely or partially related to ethnomusicology.  In McAllester’s “Ethnomusicology: The Field and the Society” article, he quoted Winkelman’s finding that about 30 institutions offered anywhere from one to fourteen courses related to ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924575 Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 182, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an incredible number when compared to the findings of [[Bruno Nettl]], who had been charged to construct a survey of the institutions that offered courses in ethnomusicology in 1954, which showed that only fourteen institutions made the list.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Winkelman found that the number had doubled in about ten years.

Among these institutions, a few stood out as academic leaders in ethnomusicology in 1963. [[UCLA]] offered one of the largest graduate program, which believed that the “actual performance of an exotic music is essential to the full understand of its structure and purpose."&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society,” 183.&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA was also praised for sending its graduate students abroad to be immersed in a culture and its music. The [[University of Hawaii]] was well known for its ability to harmonize the relationship between the anthropology and music departments, drawing from both to create well-rounded ethnomusicology courses. Alan Merriam had made significant headway at Indiana University, having been made a Professor of Anthropology in 1962, equipped with skills in African music, music analysis, and Indian music. He worked closely with music professor and ethnomusicologist, [[Walter Kaufmann (ethnomusicologist)|Walter Kaufmann]]. At [[Columbia University]], Willard Rhodes had already been teaching some ethnomusicology course since he was made full Professor in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 255.&lt;/ref&gt; He helped develop the ethnomusicology depart alongside Nicholas England, but later traveled to Africa and Asia to conduct and bring back research.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Nettl]] and Richard Waterman were able to bridge the gap between the anthropology and music departments by teaching across both departments, bringing up [[Wayne State University]] as one of the countries strongest ethnomusicology institutions.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"&gt;McAllester, "Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society," 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, [[Wesleyan University]] had already proven its great strength and devotion to ethnomusicology by printing the Newsletter, but McAllester continued to develop the ethnomusicology department throughout his time there.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie C., Wade, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20174447 Fifty Years of SEM in the United States: A Retrospective]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006): 192, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the rise in institutions teaching ethnomusicology courses, Williard Rhodes found that students were able to produce more dissertations that ever before. Rhodes believed that this was because the Newsletter’s Bibliographies and Reviews sections had given students access to material and research that had previously been unavailable to them: “In comparison with the limited ethnomusicological literature in English that appeared during the first half of the present century, the production of books and monographs during the past decade is remarkable in quantity, quality, and range of subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes found that Frank Gillis’ 1962 supplement (Ethnomusicology 6: 191-214) written for Alan Merriam’s 1960 “Annotated Bibliography of Theses and Dissertations in Ethnomusicology and Folk Music Accepted at American Universities” (''Ethnomusicology'' 4: 21-35) showed an increase from 180 to 197 titles nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Governance===

The Society is governed by a Constitution, Board of Directors, Council Members, and stands by its strict Bylaws. There are several standing committees that members can participate, ranging in size from 4-15 members. Some of these committees organize national events, such as the annual conference, while others operate local events, nominations, awarding of prizes, publications, and student concerns.

===Membership===

The Society offers Individual and Institution Memberships, which offer benefits and additional resources not available to the public. Individual membership fees are determined by annual income and academic enrollment (full-time student), but also one-time lifetime memberships are also available. Members receive copies of SEM publications, such as the Newsletter and Journal, gain voting rights, can submit papers for meetings and conferences, can access a members-only section of the website, and receive discounts for certain databases, such as [[JSTOR]].

==Annual Conferences==

The first official SEM meeting was September 2–9, 1956, and since then, the Society of Ethnomusicology has continued to host annual conferences throughout the country and occasionally abroad. Locations for these large-scale gatherings require a host university with a strong ethnomusicology department, hotels that can house the huge number of attendees ranging, which ranges from 800-1000 people, at an affordable price, and has access to air travel. Locations are typical chosen three years in advance by the SEM Board. The conference is then executed by the Program Committee, Local Arrangements Committee, and Business Office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4143">The '''Soncino Books of the Bible''' is a set of [[Hebrew Bible]] commentaries, covering the whole [[Tanakh]] ([[Old Testament]]) in fourteen volumes, published by the [[Soncino Press]]. The first volume to appear was [[Psalms]] in 1945, and the last was [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] in 1952. The series was edited by [[Abraham Cohen (editor)|Rev. Dr. Abraham Cohen]] and the commentary was written by several rabbis including Cohen himself, [[Eli Cashdan]], [[Harry Freedman (rabbi)|Harry Freedman]] and Israel Wolf Slotki (identified as I. W. Slotki) (1884–1973)

Each volume contains the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and English texts of the Hebrew Bible in parallel columns, with a running commentary below them. The Hebrew text in Psalms is that of [[C. D. Ginsburg]]'s earlier (1894) edition.&lt;ref&gt;See preface to Psalms&lt;/ref&gt; This led to protests, since Ginsburg had [[Apostasy#In Judaism|converted to Christianity]], so subsequent volumes used a (completely reset) copy of [[Meir Letteris]]' second (1866) edition of the Hebrew text. Both Hebrew texts are scrupulous versions of the [[Masoretic Text]], so the differences between them are small.  The English translation is the [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version]] of 1917.

==First edition==

The commentary in the first edition of the series drew mainly upon classical Jewish sources (see below), but also drew upon the best of early-to-mid 20th century Bible scholarship, including the work of Christian expositors.&lt;ref&gt;See preface to Psalms&lt;/ref&gt;

The only exception was the ''Soncino [[Humash|Chumash]]'', covering the [[Torah]] and [[Haftara]]s, first published in 1947 and frequently reprinted. It was felt that to have a modern commentary in that book would unnecessarily duplicate the book ''The Pentateuch and Haftarahs'' edited by [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Joseph H. Hertz]], also published by the Soncino Press. Thus instead there was a summary of the views of the most important medieval Jewish commentators, such as [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], [[Rashi]], [[Nachmanides|Ramban]], [[Radak]], [[Sforno]] and [[Ralbag]] (Gersonides).&lt;ref&gt;See preface to Chumash&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second edition==

A second edition of all books other than the ''Soncino Chumash'' appeared in the 1990s, edited by Rabbi [[Abraham J. Rosenberg]], (a disciple of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]]) who had previously done a Bible commentary for [[Judaica Press]] and a [[Mishnah]] commentary for [[Artscroll]].&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.amazon.com/Judaica-Press-Prophets-Writings-Vol/dp/B000BKLDBO and the approbation (haskama) by Rabbi Feinstein found in the beginning of each volume, http://www.artscroll.com/cgi-bin/searchtitle?Author=Rabbi_A.J._Rosenberg, and the Thursday, May 11, 2006 entry (Did Rashi mean Canaanite?) of the blog "What's bothering Artscroll?" (http://elucidation-not-translation.blogspot.com/2006_05_11_archive.html)&lt;/ref&gt; In this edition, all work from historical scholars and Christian bible commentators has been removed; it has been replaced by additional references to the [[Midrash]] literature and medieval Jewish commentators.  This has led to complaints that it is now difficult to find a modern but [[Orthodox Jewish]] Bible commentary, and to accusations that [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews, who reject the application of modern scholarship to Bible commentary, are exerting too much influence over Jewish life.

==Translations of classical works==

The Soncino Press also published the [[Soncino Talmud]] (1935–1952), the [[Soncino Midrash Rabbah]] and the [[Soncino Zohar]] (1934) all of which were translations of the [[Talmud]], [[Midrash Rabba]]h, and [[Zohar]], respectively.  The first two have brief commentaries in footnotes.  Some reprints of the Talmud also include the original Hebrew and Aramaic text.  Another publication is the [[Soncino Haggadah]], a translation and commentary on the [[Haggadah]] by [[Cecil Roth]].

'''Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Confidential,'' Chicago Tribune, Business, Section 2, Sunday, January 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;''' is an educational center in [[Chicago]], Illinois. Not affiliated with any single branch of [[Judaism]], Spertus offers learning opportunities that are "rooted in Jewish wisdom and culture and open to all."&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.spertus.edu/about "About"] on the Spertus Institute website&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate programs and workshops "train leaders and engage individuals in exploration of Jewish life."&lt;ref name=about /&gt;  Public programs include films,&lt;ref&gt;''Spertus to screen tale of two cultures,'' Chicago Tribune, November 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; speakers,&lt;ref&gt;''Book marks,'' Chicago Jewish Star, January 25-February 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; seminars, concerts,&lt;ref&gt;''Jazz meets Jewish music in a Hanukkah Jam,'' Chicago Tribune, December 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibits&lt;ref&gt;''Tales, Myths, and Nightmares,'' JUF News, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; — at the Institute’s main campus at 610 S. [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], as well as in the Chicago suburbs and online.

Spertus offers graduate degrees in Jewish Professional Studies, Jewish Studies, and until 2016, Nonprofit Management — accredited by [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] — as well as professional workshops and a range of public educational and cultural programs.

==Architecture of the Spertus Institute building==
In November 2007, Spertus Institute opened an award-winning,&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago AIA Awards 2008,'' Architecture Week, January 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; environmentally sustainable facility at 610 S. Michigan Avenue. Designed by Chicago-based [[Krueck and Sexton Architects]], the building features interconnected interior spaces and an unusual ten-story faceted window wall that provides views of the Chicago skyline, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], and [[Lake Michigan]]. This window wall is built from 726 individual pieces of glass in 556 different shapes.&lt;ref&gt;"Light radiates throughout new home of Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies," ''JUF News'', November 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The building also houses a 400-seat theater, space for community events and [[kosher]] catering facilities.

Like the surrounding buildings, many constructed in the period of architectural innovation that followed the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, this building is forward-looking in its design and use of materials, while maintaining respect for its setting.{{fact|date=December 2017}} Like the bays of its 19th- and 20th-century neighbors, the facets that create the façade’s dynamic crystalline form allow light to extend into the narrow building, while expanding the views enjoyed from inside.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}} The geometry of the façade is unique because the surface is constantly tilting in three dimensions, resulting in individual units of glass that are parallelograms rather than rectangles.{{tone-inline|date=December 2017}} At the same time, the average size of each of the façade's individual panes of glass is consistent with the standard size of the windows in the buildings up and down [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The Spertus building was the first new construction in the [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]] after the area was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002. The cost of the Spertus project was more than $50 million.&lt;ref name ="Kamin"&gt;Blair Kamin, "Blades of Glass," ''Chicago Tribune'', November 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Meadville Lombard Theological School]], a [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[seminary]], relocated from its [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] location to the sixth floor of the Spertus building. Academic and administrative tasks of the school now take place in the Spertus building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadville.edu/Ab_News_loopmove.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110103444/http://www.meadville.edu/Ab_News_loopmove.html |archivedate=2012-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the global scale '''sustainability and environmental management''' involves managing the [[ocean]]s, [[freshwater]] systems, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]] and [[atmosphere]], according to [[sustainability]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&amp;file=users/|title=The Economics and Social Benefits of NOAA Ecosystems Data and Products  Table of Contents  Data Users|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2009-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325190416/http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems|archivedate=2010-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchenrieder, G., und A.R.

[[Land use]] change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s.&lt;ref name="Krebs 2001 pp. 560–582"&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 560–582.&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] involves assessment of all aspects of the [[carbon cycle]] to identify opportunities to address human-induced [[climate change]] and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on [[biodiversity]] and human communities. [[Ocean circulation]] patterns have a strong influence on [[climate]] and [[weather]] and, in turn, the [[food supply]] of both humans and other organisms.

In March 2009 at a meeting of the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]] 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction targets "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate may occur that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with".&lt;ref&gt;University of Copenhagen (March 2009) [http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ "Key Messages from the Congress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316181631/http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ |date=2009-03-16 }} News item on Copenhagen Climate Congress in March 2009.

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur oxide|sulphur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]]. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosols]] in the atmosphere reduce the direct [[irradiance]] and reflectance ([[albedo]]) of the [[Earth]]'s surface. Known as [[global dimming]] the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a [[Thermal energy|cooling]] effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, G.C. et al. (2007).

==Freshwater==
{{See|Water crisis}}

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. All life depends on the solar-powered global water cycle, the evaporation from oceans and land to form water vapour that later condenses from clouds as rain, which then becomes the renewable part of the freshwater supply.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of the global importance of preserving [[water]] for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world’s [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. [[Biodiversity]]-rich [[freshwater]] ecosystems are currently declining faster than [[marine (ocean)|marine]] or land [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y. (2006).

==Land==
{{See|Land use}}
Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref name="Krebs 2001 pp. 560–582"/&gt; At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from the pursuit of [[green cities]] and [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

==Forests==
{{See|Forestry|Ecoforestry}}
[[File:Grib skov.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Beech forest – Grib Skov, Denmark|Beech forest – Grib Skov, Denmark]]

Since the [[Neolithic Revolution]], human use has reduced the world’s forest cover by about 47%. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (1998). ''World Resources 1998–1999.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-521408-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In temperate and [[boreal forest|boreal]] regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but [[deforestation]] in the tropics is of major concern.&lt;ref&gt;Groombridge &amp; Jenkins (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Forests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance ([[albedo]]) and [[evapotranspiration]]. They also conserve [[biodiversity]], protect [[water quality]], preserve soil and [[soil quality]], provide fuel and [[pharmaceuticals]], and purify the air. These free [[ecosystem services]] are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of [[logging]] and clearance which, through [[soil degradation]] and organic [[decomposition]] returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name = FAO1&gt;Food and Agriculture Organisation (2006).

Retrieved on: 2009-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions).&lt;ref name = FAO1/&gt; [[Climate change]] can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in [[reafforestation]] schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable [[carbon-neutral]] fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2006).'' IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Inventories, Vol.4, Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land Uses.'' Japan: Institute for Global Environment Strategies.&lt;/ref&gt; However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the [[International Union of Forest Research Organizations]] in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M.

[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|alt=Picture of the now extinct bird the dodo|The extinct [[dodo]] (''Raphus cucullatus'')]]

Although [[biodiversity loss]] can be monitored simply as loss of species, effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species [[extinctions]] have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Known as the [[Holocene extinction event]] this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass [[extinction event]]s. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leakey &amp; Lewin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 42–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 [[IUCN Red List]] warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species.&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M. (May 2008). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7409034.stm ''Climate 'accelerating bird loss.''] BBC News, UK.

In many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after [[climate change]], has become the destructive effect of [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of [[organism]]s across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of [[globalization]] is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like [[HIV]] [[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]], [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and [[swine flu]], but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native [[biodiversity]]. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural [[predator]]s, they are able to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 190–205.&lt;/ref&gt; At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the [[Global Invasive Species Information Network]] but there is improved international [[biosecurity]] legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through [[CITES]] legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Blood (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to change==
{{Main|Sustainability and systemic change resistance}}
The environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system in preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is systemic change resistance. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7753">In the [[systems sciences]] '''system equivalence''' is the behavior of a [[parameter]] or component of a [[system]] in a way similar to a parameter or component of a different system.  Similarity means that mathematically the parameters and components will be indistinguishable from each other. Equivalence can be very useful in understanding how [[complex system]]s work.

== Overview ==
Examples of equivalent systems are first- and second-[[order (differential equation)|order]] (in the [[independent variable]]) [[translational]], [[electrical]], [[Torque|torsional]], [[Fluid mechanics|fluidic]], and [[caloric]] systems.

Equivalent systems can be used to change large and expensive mechanical, thermal, and fluid systems into a simple, cheaper electrical system.  Then the electrical system can be analyzed to validate that the [[system dynamics]] will work as designed.  This is a preliminary inexpensive way for engineers to test that their complex system performs the way they are expecting.

This testing is necessary when designing new complex systems that have many components.  Businesses do not want to spend millions of dollars on a system that does not perform the way that they were expecting. Using the equivalent system technique, engineers can verify and prove to the business that the system will work.  This lowers the risk factor that the business is taking on the project.

The equivalents shown in the chart are not the only way to form mathematical analogies.  In fact there are any number of ways to do this.  A common requirement for analysis is that the analogy correctly models energy storage and flow across energy domains.  To do this, the equivalences must be compatible.  A pair of variables whose product is power (or energy) in one domain must be equivalent to a pair of variables in the other domain whose product is also power (or energy).  These are called power conjugate variables.  The thermal variables shown in the chart are not power conjugates and thus do not meet this criterion.  See [[mechanical-electrical analogies]] for more detailed information on this.  Even specifying power conjugate variables does not result in a unique analogy and there are at least three analogies of this sort in use.  At least one more criterion is needed to uniquely specify the analogy, such as the requirement that [[electrical impedance|impedance]] is equivalent in all domains as is done in the [[impedance analogy]].

==Examples==
; Mechanical systems
:Force &lt;math&gt;F = -kx = c\frac{dx}{dt} = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

; Electrical systems
:Voltage &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{Q}{C} = R\frac{dQ}{dt} = L\frac{d^2Q}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

All the fundamental [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] of these systems have the same functional form.

==Discussion==
The system equivalence method may be used to describe systems of two types: "vibrational" systems (which are thus described - approximately - by harmonic oscillation) and "translational" systems (which deal with "flows").  These are not mutually exclusive; a system may have features of both. Similarities also exist; the two systems can often be analysed by the methods of Euler, Lagrange and Hamilton, so that in both cases the energy is quadratic in the relevant degree(s) of freedom, provided they are linear.

Vibrational systems are often described by some sort of wave (partial differential) equation, or oscillator (ordinary differential) equation. Furthermore, these sorts of systems follow the capacitor or spring analogy, in the sense that the dominant degree of freedom in the energy is the generalized position. In more physical language, these systems are predominantly characterised by their potential energy. This often works for solids, or (linearized) undulatory systems near equilibrium.

On the other hand, flow systems may be easier described by the hydraulic analogy or the diffusion equation. For example, Ohm's law was said to be inspired by Fourier's law (as well as the work of C.-L. Navier).&lt;ref&gt;

The most important idea is the flux, or rate of transfer of some important physical quantity considered (like electric or magnetic fluxes). In these sorts of systems, the energy is dominated by  the derivative of the generalized position (generalized velocity). In physics parlance, these systems tend to be kinetic energy-dominated. Field theories, in particular electromagnetism, draw heavily from the hydraulic analogy.

The '''Templeton Prize''' is an annual award granted to a living person who, in the estimation of the judges, "has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's spiritual dimension, whether through insight, discovery, or practical works".  It was established, funded and administered by [[John Templeton]] starting in 1972, and then after 1987 by the [[John Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Nature2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=M. Mitchell |title=Religion: Faith in science |journal=Nature |date=17 February 2011 |volume=470 |issue=7334 |pages=323–325 |doi=10.1038/470323a}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize was originally awarded to people working in the field of religion ([[Mother Teresa]] was the first winner), but in the 1980s the scope broadened to include people working at the intersection of science and religion.&lt;ref name=Nature2011/&gt;  Until 2001, the name of the prize was "Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion", and from 2002 to 2008 it was called the "Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=894efb53-74d6-4b64-b275-ee22c7a296e0| work = Ottawa Citizen| date = 8 July 2008| first = Charles| last = Enman| accessdate = 9 July 2009| publisher = Canada.com| title = Templeton dies| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120509223008/http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=894efb53-74d6-4b64-b275-ee22c7a296e0| archivedate = 9 May 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article1119787.ece | work = The Times | accessdate=2 July 2009|date=15 March 2003|title = Just because science looks forward, religion isn't backward | first=Daniel | last=Crewe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hindu]]s, [[Christian]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[Buddhist]]s and [[Muslim]]s have been on the panel of judges and have been recipients of the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.templetonprize.org/judges.html | title =Judges| publisher =Templeton Foundation|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monetary value of the prize is adjusted so that it exceeds that of the [[Nobel Prize]]s; Templeton felt, according to ''The Economist'', that "spirituality was ignored" in the Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11745591 |work = The Economist| title= Obituary – John Templeton | accessdate=2 July 2009|date=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has typically been presented by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] in a ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Nathan |title=God, Science and Philanthropy {{!}} The Nation |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/god-science-and-philanthropy/ |work=The Nation |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize has been criticized: British [[biology|biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] said in his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' that the prize was given "usually to a scientist who is prepared to say something nice about religion".&lt;ref name=jeffries/&gt;  [[Sean M. Carroll]], a research professor in the Department of Physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]], criticized his colleagues for taking Templeton research grants when they did not support Templeton's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_48/b3961604.htm | work = Business Week | title = The Devout Donor|accessdate=2 July 2009|date=28 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martinus J. G. Veltman]], the 1999 Nobel laureate in physics, suggested the prize "bridg[ed] the gap between sense and nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Facts and mysteries in elementary particle physics | first=Martinus|last=Veltman|page=286|isbn=981-238-149-X |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion''''' (retitled '''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion''''' in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of [[mythology]] and [[religion]], written by the Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[James George Frazer]]. ''The Golden Bough'' was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–15. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology|The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes]]'' (1855). The influence of ''The Golden Bough'' on contemporary [[European literature]] and thought was substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Karbiener, K. &amp; Stade, G., |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present|volume =2|publisher= Infobase Publishing|date= 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&amp;pg=PA189#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages= 188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Mirror Judgement of Paris Louvre Bj1734.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]''—an Etruscan bronze-handled mirror of the fourth or third century BC that relates the often misunderstood myth as interpreted by Frazer, showing the three goddesses giving their apple or [[pomegranate]] to the new king, who must kill the old king - Campana Collection, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Sully]]

Frazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, [[human sacrifice]], the [[dying god]], the [[scapegoat]], and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamel, Frazer (Editor)|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] is that old religions were [[fertility cult]]s that revolved around the [[worship]] and periodic [[sacrifice]] of a [[sacred king]]. Frazer proposed that mankind progresses from [[Magic and religion|magic]] through [[religious belief]] to scientific thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Frazer's thesis was developed in relation to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of ''The Golden Bough'', a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night. It was a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of [[Nemi]], "[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s Mirror", where religious ceremonies and the "fulfillment of vows" of priests and kings were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frazer, Sir James|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who underwent a mystic marriage to a [[goddess]] of the Earth. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.

Frazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king at the [[wiktionary:fane|fane]] of [[Rex Nemorensis|Nemi]], who was ritually murdered by his successor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first put pen to paper to write ''The Golden Bough'' I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood. (''Aftermath'', p. vi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book's title was taken from an incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', illustrated by Turner, in which [[Aeneas]] and the [[Sibyl]] present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of [[Hades]] to gain admission.

Frazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of ''The Golden Bough'' that while he had never studied [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his friend James Ward, and the philosopher [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of "the nature and historical relations of magic and religion". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that "we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection." Frazer included an extract from Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frazer, James George |title=The Golden Bough.

==Critical reception==
''The Golden Bough'' scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of [[Jesus]] and the [[Resurrection]] in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] reading of the [[Lamb of God]] as a relic of a [[pagan]] religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the [[Crucifixion]] in a speculative appendix; the discussion of [[Christianity]] was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Leach, Edmund R. |url= http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |title= Kingship and divinity: The unpublished Frazer Lecture |location= Oxford |origyear= 28 October 1982 |journal= ''HAU: ''Journal of Ethnographic Theory ''1.1'' |date= 2011 |pages= 279–298 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150922093723/http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |archivedate= 22 September 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, Jonathan Z. |title= When the bough breaks |work= History of Religions ''12.4'' |date=1973 |pages= 342–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=E.C.|last=Cawte|page=38|chapter=It's an Ancient Custom—But How Ancient?|isbn=1850752435|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R. Angus|last=Downie|title=Frazer and the Golden Bough|location=London|publisher=Victor Gallancz|page=112|isbn=978-0-575-00486-3|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, at the inauguration of the [[Frazer Lecture|Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology]], he said: "It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine."&lt;ref name="Lienhardt"&gt;{{Citation|issn=0044-8370|volume=24|issue=1|year=1993|first=Godfrey|last=Lienhardt|title=Frazer's anthropology: science and sensibility|pages=1–12|journal=[[Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer's lifetime, social anthropologists "had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions", and that the lasting influence of ''The Golden Bough'' and Frazer's wider body of work "has been in the literary rather than the academic world."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Robert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still "an embarrassment" for being "the most famous of them all" while they now dissociate themselves "from much that he wrote." While ''The Golden Bough'' achieved wide "popular appeal" and exerted a "disproportionate" influence "on so many [20th century] creative writers", Frazer's ideas played "a much smaller part" in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer's interpretations of primitive religion as "little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer's] own Victorian rationalism", while 
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], in his ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'' (1979), wrote: "Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages' [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Initially, the book's influence on the emerging discipline of [[anthropology]] was pervasive. For example, the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] read Frazer's work in the original English, and afterwards wrote: "No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Hays &amp; L.L. Langness (Editor) |title= From Ape to Angel: An Informal History of Social Anthropology |pages= 75, 314 |work= The Study of Culture |location= Corte Madera |publisher= Chandler &amp; Sharp |date= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1920s, Frazer's ideas "began to belong to the past": {{Quote|In 1922, simultaneously with the publication of the first abridged edition of ''The Golden Bough'', came Malinowski's ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' and Radcliffe-Brown's ''The Andaman Islanders'', the first outstanding products of the British field research tradition that Frazer had very actively encouraged. As every first-year student knows, these monographs began to point students towards empirical studies of Frazer's 'savages', who, when spoken to in their own homes and languages, were found to have much more of interest to say for themselves than Frazer had to say about them. The central theme (or, as he thought, theory) of ''The Golden Bough''—that all mankind had evolved intellectually and psychologically from a superstitious belief in magicians, through a superstitious belief in priests and gods, to enlightened belief in scientists—had little or no relevance to the conduct of life in an Andamanese camp or a Melanesian village, and the whole, supposedly scientific, basis of Frazer's anthropology was seen as a misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology.&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;}}

[[Edmund Leach]], "one of the most impatient critics of Frazer's overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect", was scathing of the [[artistic license]] exercised by Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'', saying: "Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to ''illustrate'' propositions which he had arrived at in advance by ''a priori'' reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!"&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

[[René Girard]], a French historian, literary critic, and [[Philosophy of social science|philosopher of social science]], "grudgingly" praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as "a key primitive ritual", but described his interpretation of the ritual as "a grave injustice to ethnology."&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Frazerian roots of contemporary theories of religion and violence|journal=[[Religion (journal)|Religion]]|first=Robert A.|last=Segal|pages=4–25|issue=1|volume=37|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scapegoat|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1986|page=120|isbn=978-0-801-83315-1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girard's "grievances" against ''The Golden Bough'' were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer's assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the [[New Testament]] Gospels were "just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt; Girard himself considered the Gospels to be "revelatory texts" rather than myths or the remains of "ignorant superstition", and rejected Frazer's idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, "whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Girard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1978|page=180|isbn=978-0-804-72215-5|publisher=Athlone Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence==
Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, ''The Golden Bough'' inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet [[Robert Graves]] adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948). [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] refers to Frazer's thesis in his poem "[[Sailing to Byzantium]]". The horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s understanding of religion was influenced by ''The Golden Bough'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joshi, S. T. |title=H. P. Lovecraft: A Life |publisher=Necronomicon Press |location=West Warwick |year=1996 |page=209 |isbn=0-940884-88-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lovecraft, H. P. |author2=Turner, James |title=Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=1998 |page=3 |isbn=0-345-42204-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. S. Eliot]] acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''. [[William Carlos Williams]] refers to ''The Golden Bough'' in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/PatersonWCW|title=Paterson - William Carlos Williams|first=|last=William Carlos Williams|date=5 May 1963|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Bough'' influenced [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's work also influenced the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt; the novelist [[James Joyce]],&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt; [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt;

The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] drew on ''The Golden Bough'' in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), where he accepted Frazer's view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Hero with a Thousand Faces |publisher=New World Library |location=Novato, California |year=2008 |pages=330 |isbn=978-1-57731-593-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later described Frazer's work as "monumental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=164 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Weston La Barre]], writing in ''[[The Human Animal (book)|The Human Animal]]'' (1955), described Frazer as "the last of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]]" and wrote that Frazer's work was "an extended footnote to a line in [[Virgil]] he felt he did not understand."&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Animal'' (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, ''The Study of Culture'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of the musician [[Jim Morrison]]'s song "[[Not to Touch the Earth]]" were influenced by the table of contents of ''The Golden Bough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hopkins, Jerry |author2=Sugarman, Danny |title=No One Here Gets Out Alive |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=179 |isbn=978-0446602280 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s commentaries on ''The Golden Bough'' have been compiled as ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'', edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|title=Phil.uni-passau.de|author=|date=|website=uni-passau.de|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202203/http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|archivedate=14 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ackerman, in his ''The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists'' (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the [[history of ideas]]. The [[myth and ritual school]] includes scholars [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[F. M. Cornford]], and [[Arthur Bernard Cook|A.B. Cook]], who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing [[Modernism|Modernist literature]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has cited ''The Golden Bough'' as one of the most important influences on her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |page=114 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described it as "a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination." Paglia acknowledged that "many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded", but maintained that the work of Frazer's Cambridge school of classical anthropology "will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today's sterile academic climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= 10 November 2009 | title= Pelosi’s victory for women | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 22 April 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171608/http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | archivedate= 1 May 2015 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of ''The Golden Bough'' is "bland" and should be "avoided like the plague."&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | date= 10 March 1999 | title= In defense of "The Golden Bough" | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 28 April 2017 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160512072038/http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | archivedate= 12 May 2016 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential''' ('''IAHP'''), founded in 1955 by [[Glenn Doman]] and Carl Delacato, provide literature on and teaches patterning therapy (motor learning), which the Institutes promote as improving the "neurologic organization" of "brain injured" and healthy children through a variety of programs, including diet and exercise.&lt;ref name="Thomas1969"&gt;{{cite book |title=Brian-Injured Children |author=Evan W.

==History==
The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP, also known as "The Institutes") was founded in 1955.&lt;ref name= "Hines2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hines |first= T.M. |year= 2001 |title= The Doman-Delcato patterning treatment for brain damage |journal= Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |volume= 5 |issue= 2 |pages= 80–9 |url= http://www.sram.org/media/documents/uploads/article_pdfs/5-2-02.Hines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It practices pattern therapy, which was developed by Doman and [[Educational psychology|educational psychologist]] Carl Delacato.&lt;ref name= "Spitz2013"&gt;{{cite book |first= Herman H. |last= Spitz |authorlink= Herman H. Spitz |year= 2013 |origyear= 1986 |title= The Raising of Intelligence: A Selected History of Attempts To Raise Retarded Intelligence |publisher= [[Routledge]] |pages= 183–7 |isbn= 9781136562075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattern therapy drew upon the ideas and work of ideas of [[neurophysiology|neurophysiologist]] Temple Fay, former head of the Department of Neurosurgery at [[Temple University School of Medicine]] and president of the Philadelphia Neurological Society.&lt;ref name="Spitz2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Temple Fay, MD |publisher= The Society of Neurological Surgeons |url= http://www.societyns.org/society/bio.aspx?MemberID=99050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960, Doman and Delacato published an article in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') detailing pattern therapy.&lt;ref name="doman1960"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Doman |first1= R.J. |last2= Spitz |first2= E.B. |last3= Zucman |first3= E. |last4=  Delacato |first4= C.H. |last5= Doman |first5= G. |displayauthors= 4 |title= Children with severe brain injuries.

==Philosophy==
The philosophy of the Institutes consists of several interrelated beliefs: that every child has genius potential, stimulation is the key to unlocking a child's potential, teaching should commence at birth, the younger the child, the easier the learning process, children naturally love to learn, parents are their child's best teacher, teaching and learning should be joyous and teaching and learning should never involve testing.&lt;ref name= "BrillKids, Inc."&gt;{{cite website |title= The Early Learning Experts: Glenn Doman |url= http://www.brillbaby.com/early-learning/experts/glenn-doman-2.php |date= 2017 |website= brillbaby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy follows very closely to the Japanese [[Suzuki method]] for violin, which is also taught at the institute in addition to the Japanese language itself.  The Institutes consider [[brain damage]], [[intellectual impairment]], "mental deficiency", [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], [[autism]], [[athetosis]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], "[[developmental delay]]", and [[Down syndrome]] as conditions encompassing "brain injury", the term favored by IAHP.&lt;ref name="Doman1974"&gt;{{cite book |first= Glenn |last= Doman |title= What To Do About Your Brain-injured Child |origyear= 1974 |edition= Revised |year= 2005 |publisher= Square One |isbn= 978-0757001864}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 WPVI television news report, IAHP uses the word "hurt" to describe the children they see "with all kinds of brain injuries and conditions, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, epilepsy, Down's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism".&lt;ref name= "WPVI 2007"&gt;{{cite episode |title= Controversial treatment for brain-injured children |url= http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/health&amp;id=5805363 |date= December 1, 2007 |station= [[WPVI-TV|WPVI]] |network= [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) |location= Philadelphia, PA |series= WPVI Action News: HealthCheck |accessdate= 2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glenn Doman described his own personal philosophy for treating patients as stemming from his WWII veteran officer motto: "Leave no injured behind."&lt;ref name="Doman1974"/&gt;

==Programs==
===Programs for brain-injured children===
IAHP’s program begins with a five-day seminar for the parents of "brain injured" children, because the program is carried out by parents at their homes.&lt;ref name="WPVI 2007"/&gt; Following the seminar, IAHP conducts an initial evaluation of the child.&lt;ref name="WPVI 2007"/&gt;

The program described in the 1960 ''JAMA'' paper (Doman, et al.) for "brain-injured" children included:

* ''Patterning'' – manipulation of limbs and head in a rhythmic fashion
* ''Creeping'' – forward bodily movement with the abdomen in contact with the floor
* ''Crawling'' – forward bodily movement with the abdomen raised from the floor
* ''Receptive stimulation'' – visual, tactile and auditory stimulation
* ''Expressive activities'' – e.g. picking up objects
* ''Masking'' – breathing into a rebreathing mask to increase the amount of carbon dioxide inhaled, which is purported to increase cerebral blood flow
* ''Brachiation'' – swinging from a bar or vertical ladder
* ''Gravity/Antigravity activities'' – rolling, somersaulting and hanging upside down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Zigler |first1= Edward |last2= Hodapp |first2= Robert M. |title= Understanding Mental Retardation |chapter= Searching for Miracle Cures |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1986 |isbn= 9780521318785 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgzUwO_IiRYC&amp;pg=PA185 185–6] |ref= {{SfnRef|Zigler &amp; Hodapp|1986}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAHP holds that brain injury at a given level of neurological development prevents or slows further progress.&lt;ref name="Doman1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scherzer2000"&gt;{{cite book |first= Alfred L. |last= Scherzer |year= 2000 | title = Early Diagnosis and Interventional Therapy in Cerebral Palsy: An Interdisciplinary Age-Focused Approach |edition= 3rd, Revised |publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |isbn= 9780824760069 |page= 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other therapies utilized by IAHP include eye exercises for children who have an eye that converges more than the other when looking at an object in the distance and those who have one eye that diverges more than the other when an object is moved slowly toward the bridge of the nose. IAHP also recommends stimulating the eyes of children with [[amblyopia]] by flashing a light on and off. For children with poor hearing, IAHP recommends auditory stimulation with loud noises, which may be pre-recorded. Brain-injured children may also be taught to identify by touch alone various objects placed in a bag.&lt;ref name="Thomas1969"/&gt;

IAHP recommends dietary restrictions, including reduced fluid intake for brain-injured children in an attempt to prevent "the possible overaccumulation of cerebrospinal fluid". Alongside fluid restriction, IAHP recommends a diet low in salt, sweets, and other "thirst provoking" foods.&lt;ref name="Thomas1969"/&gt;

==Scientific evaluation and criticism==
The Institutes model of childhood development has been criticized in the scientific community.&lt;ref name= "Myles2007"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Brenda Smith |last1= Myles |first2= Terri Cooper |last2= Swanson |first3= Jeanne |last3= Holverstott |first4= Megan Moore |last4= Duncan |year= 2007 |title= Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Handbook for Parents and Professionals |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood]] |isbn= 9780313336324 |pages= 243–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Academy of Pediatrics position statement===
According to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], patterning treatment is based on an oversimplified theory of [[brain development]] and its effectiveness is not supported by [[evidence-based medicine]], making its use unwarranted.&lt;ref name=pediatrics/&gt; The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Committee on Children With Disabilities issued warnings regarding patterning, one of the IAHP's therapies for brain injured children, as early as 1968&lt;ref name=AAP1968&gt;{{cite journal |author= American Academy of Pediatrics |title= Doman-Delacato treatment of neurologically handicapped children |journal= AAP Newsletter |date= 1 June 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated in 1982.&lt;ref name=AAP1982&gt;{{cite journal |author= American Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Children With Disabilities |url= http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/70/5/810.full.pdf |title= The Doman-Delacato treatment of neurologically handicapped children |journal= Pediatrics |year= 1982 |volume= 70 |issue= 5 |pages= 810–2 |pmid= 6182521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their latest cautionary policy statement was in 1999, which was reaffirmed in  2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= American Academy of Pediatrics |authorlink= American Academy of Pediatrics |type= Policy Statement |title= AAP publications reaffirmed and retired |journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume= 126 |issue= 4 |year= 2010 |url= http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/126/4/e994.full |pages= e994 |doi= 10.1542/peds.2010-2212}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This treatment is based on an outmoded and oversimplified theory of brain development. Current information does not support the claims of proponents that this treatment is efficacious, and its use continues to be unwarranted.... [T]he demands and expectations placed on families are so great that in some cases their financial resources may be depleted substantially and parental and sibling relationships could be stressed.&lt;ref name=pediatrics&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Committee on Children with Disabilities |first1= [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |last2= Ziring |first2= P.R. |last3= brazdziunas |first3= D. |last4= Cooley |first4= W.C. |last5= Kastner |first5= T.A. |last6= Kummer |first6= M.E. |last7= González de Pijem |first7= L. |last8= Quint |first8= R.D. |last9= Ruppert |first9= E.S. |last10= Sandler |first10= A.D. |displayauthors= 4 |title= The treatment of neurologically impaired children using patterning |journal= [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] |volume= 104 |issue= 5 Pt 1 |pages= 1149–51 |year= 1999 |pmid= 10545565 |url= http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/104/5/1149 |doi= 10.1542/peds.104.5.1149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the text in the position statement from the AAP, however, may differ somewhat from the medical literature and research that has surfaced since their most recent reaffirmation in 2010, as described below.  The statement reads, "some of the cases dramatically publicized by the Institutes have been children with traumatic brain damage or postencephalitis, who may make substantial gains without any special treatment".&lt;ref name="AAP Position Statement"&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Academy of Pediatrics. Policy statement: The Doman-Delacato treatment of neurologically handicapped children|journal=[[Pediatrics]]|volume=70|pages=810–12|year=1982|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030130115642/http://members.carol.net/~ndsc/doman.html|url=http://members.carol.net/~ndsc/doman.html|archive-date=2003-01-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent studies suggest that without systematic medical and physiotherapeutic support (special treatment) dystonia leads to deterioration of “the handicap”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Cerebral Palsy: A Lifelong Challenge Asks for Early Intervention |journal= The Open Neurology Journal|volume= 9|pages= 45–52|author= Christos P Panteliadis,  Christian Hagel, Dieter Karch, and Karl Heinemann|pmc= 4503828|year= 2015|pmid= 26191093|doi= 10.2174/1874205X01509010045}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to "significant gains".  Modern research and innovation is ongoing today that focuses on offsetting the secondary progressive degenerative diseases that follow from a neglect of special treatment for children with a habitual sedentary lifestyle (declines in function into adulthood attributed to weakness, spasticity and orthopaedic abnormalities, as well as chronic pain, fatigue, obesity, premature sarcoepenia, cardiometabolic disease, fragility and/or early mortality).&lt;ref name ="Chronic disease in CP"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Chronic disease risk among adults with cerebral palsy: the role of premature sarcopoenia, obesity and sedentary behaviour |journal= Obesity Reviews|volume= 14|issue= 2|pages= 171–182|author= M.

The AAP statement regarding postencephalitis also conflicts in that patients with symptoms following the reduction of inflammation of the brain is considered [[postencephalitic parkinsonism]], a disease that triggers degeneration of the nerve cells in the [[substantia nigra]], leading to clinical [[parkinsonism]], an incurable disease still today.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Parkinson's Disease Information Page|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Parkinsons-Disease-Information-Page|website=NINDS|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While certain standard drugs and therapies may help delay the progression of the disease, such treatment is typically only considered "delays of progression", not gains.&lt;ref name="Nice-palliative"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Palliative care in Parkinson's disease | editor=The National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions | title=Parkinson's Disease  | chapter-url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG35/Guidance/pdf/English | publisher=Royal College of Physicians | location=London | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-86016-283-1 | pages=147–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAP statement, while a statement opposed to patterning without further evidence, is in fact in agreement with The Institutes in the manner at which the patients make improvements, stating that these improvements are due to "the basis of growth and development" (according to the Institutes the "brain grows with use"), "the intensive practice of certain isolated skills" and "the nonspecific effects of intensive stimulation".&lt;ref name="AAP Position Statement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doman1974"/&gt; And the AAP considers this method to "differ substantially from other groups treating developmental problems".  In their summary, the AAP does acknowledge "improvement observed in patients undergoing this method of treatment" but considers said observations as "poorly documented claims for cure" and thus "an unproven technique".&lt;ref name="AAP Position Statement"/&gt;

In addition to the American Academy of Pediatrics, a number of other organizations have issued cautionary statements about claims for efficacy of this therapy.&lt;ref name=pediatrics/&gt; These include the executive committee of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy,&lt;ref name=CerebralPalsy1965&gt;{{citation |author= American Academy for Cerebral Palsy |title= Doman-Delacato treatment of neurologically handicapped children.

Hornby et al. conclude, "It is now clear that the only results supporting the effectiveness of the programme come from a handful of early, poorly controlled studies."&lt;ref name= "Hornby2013"/&gt; Kavale and Mostert and others also identified serious problems with the early research on the IAHP program.&lt;ref name= "Kavale2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Spitz2013"/&gt; An analysis of higher quality studies found that students not receiving the treatment had better outcomes than those who were treated by the IAHP.&lt;ref name= "Kavale2004"/&gt;

A 15 patient 2012 Norwegian cost analysis of an unproven intensive training treatment for brain damage that included 11 patients treated by IAHP found the treatment regimen not cost effective. The authors expressed doubt that the treatments could achieve adequate benefits to be cost effective and concluded that health care services should only fund these treatments for clinical trials.&lt;ref name= "Norum2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Norum |first1= J. |last2= Ramsvik |first2= A. |last3= Tjeldnes |first3= K. |year= 2012 |title= Brain damage treated with non proven intensive training 2003-2011: A Norwegian cost analysis |journal= Global Journal of Health Science |volume= 4 |issue= 6 |pages= 179–84 |pmid= 23121754 |doi= 10.5539/gjhs.v4n6p179 |url= http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/gjhs/article/view/19910/13770 |pmc=4776988}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study found the claims of superior results of treatment by the IAHP were not substantiated.&lt;ref name= "von Tetzchner2013"/&gt;

A 2006 retrospective study of 21 children by the IAHP and others of children with [[cortical visual impairment]] found significant improvement after use of the program the study had no [[control group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Malkowicz |first1= D.E. |last2= Myers |first2= G. |last3= Leisman |first3= G. |title= Rehabilitation of cortical visual impairment in children |journal= Int J Neurosci |volume= 116 |issue= 9 |pages= 1015–33 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16861165 |doi= 10.1080/00207450600553505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norum et al. stated regarding this study, "...any proof of effectiveness cannot be obtained from a non-randomized study".&lt;ref name= "Norum2012"/&gt;

Doctors Martha Farrell Erickson and Karen Marie Kurz-Riemer wrote that IAHP "capitalized on the desires of members of the 'baby boom' generation to maximize their children's intellectual potential" and "encouraged parents to push their infants to develop maximum brain power". But most contemporary child development experts "described many aspects of the program as useless and perhaps even harmful".&lt;ref name="erickson2002"&gt;{{cite book |first= Martha Farrell |last= Erickson |last2= Kurz-Riemer |first2= Karen Marie |year= 2002 |title= Infants Toddlers and Families |publisher= Guilford Press |isbn= 978-1572307780 |pages = 17, 204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Quill concluded that "professionals" have nothing to learn from pattern therapy.&lt;ref name="quill1994"&gt;{{cite book |first= Kathleen Ann |last= Quill |year= 1995 |title= Teaching Children With Autism |publisher= Thomson Delmar Learning |isbn= 978-0827362697 |pages= 57, 336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavone and Ruggieri have written that pattern therapy does not have an important role in treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Prendergrast |first= M. |year= 2006 |title= ''The Neurology of Autism'' |type= book review |journal= [[Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology]] |volume= 48 |issue= 5 |page= 400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurologist [[Steven Novella]] has characterized pattern therapy as being based on a discarded theory and a "false cure".&lt;ref name=Novella&gt;{{cite web |url= http://quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/patterning.html |title= Psychomotor patterning: A critical look |year= 2008 |accessdate= 2008-10-23 |work= [[Quackwatch]] |last= Novella |first= S. |authorlink= Steven Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that IAHP's unsubstantiated claims can cause both financial and emotional damage.&lt;ref name=Novella/&gt; While detailing criticism of pattern therapy, Robards also wrote that the therapy caused pediatricians and therapists to recognize that early intervention programs are necessary.&lt;ref name="robards1994"/&gt;

Much of the work at The Institutes follows from Dr. Temple Fay who believed in [[recapitulation theory]], which posits that the infant brain evolves through chronological stages of development similar to first a fish, a reptile, a mammal and finally a human. This theory can be encapsulated as "[[ontogeny]] recapitulates [[phylogeny]]". Recapitulation theory has been largely discredited in biology.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite web |url= http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=219 |title= Ernst Haeckel and the Biogenetic Law |accessdate= 2008-05-03 |first= Scott F. |last= Gilbert |year= 2006 |work= DevBio a Companion to: Developmental Biology, 9th edition |publisher= Sinauer Associates |quote= Eventually, the Biogenetic Law had become scientifically untenable. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080203072312/http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?id=219 |archivedate= 2008-02-03 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PayneWenger1998"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Payne |first1= David G. |last2= Wenger |first2= Michael J. |title= Cognitive Psychology |year= 1998 |publisher= Houghton Mifflin College Division |isbn=9780395685730 |page= 352 |ref= {{SfnRef|Payne &amp; Wenger|1998}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations have criticized the IAHP's claims of effectiveness, theoretical basis and the demands placed on parents by IAHP programs.&lt;ref name=pediatrics/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAP1968/&gt; Early studies originating from IAHP appeared to show some value of their program but were later criticized as significantly flawed.&lt;ref name="Kavale2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines2001"/&gt; Kenneth Kavale and Mark Mostert have written that later studies they believe to have better design and more objectivity have shown pattern therapy "to be practically without merit".&lt;ref name="Kavale2004"/&gt;

In their book ''Controversial Issues in Special Education'', Garry Hornby, Jean Howard and Mary Atkinson state the program also includes "gagging" in which the child breathes into a plastic bag until gasping for breath. This is based on the belief that it will cause maximum use of the lungs and thus maximize oxygen circulation to the brain.&lt;ref name="Hornby2013"/&gt; The book concludes that pattern therapy is ineffective and potentially damaging to the functioning of families.&lt;ref name="Hornby2013"/&gt;

===Opposition to a control group===
The IAHP has asserted in the past that it was willing and interested in participating in controlled scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gellis |first= Sydney |title= On the patterning treatment of neurologically handicapped children |journal= Pediatric Notes |date= June 21, 1984 |volume= 8|issue= 25 |url= http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/31289282}}{{Copyvio link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies require a [[control group]], in that half the patients receive the treatment and the other half receive [[placebo]] treatment over time.  A control group in this manner, where children are not being treated, was in direct opposition to Glenn Doman's personal philosophy: "leave no injured behind". Additionally, since Doman taught that "time is the enemy of the brain-injured child" (in that each day they are not getting better, they are getting worse), the months or years that the control group would not be treated, he would be doing "harm" in participation.  According to his philosophy, this would be in conflict with the [[Hippocratic oath]], namely [[first do no harm]]. The IAHP then instructed parents of children in their program not to take part in any independent studies designed to evaluate the program's effectiveness.&lt;ref name= "Hornby2013"/&gt; The IAHP withdrew its agreement to participate in a "carefully designed study supported by federal and private agencies" when the study was in its final planning stages.&lt;ref name= "Spitz2013"/&gt; According to Herman Spitz, "The IAHP no longer appears to be interested in a scientific evaluation of their techniques; they have grown large, wealthy, and independent, and their staff is satisfied to provide case histories and propaganda tracts in support of their claims."&lt;ref name= "Spitz2013"/&gt; Terrence M. Hines then stated that they "have shown very little interest in providing empirical support for their methods".&lt;ref name= "Hines2001"/&gt;

==Funding and contributors==
The Institutes receive funding from a variety of sources, some of which include patient care/therapy, book sales, events, courses, as well as private/public funders and foundations.&lt;ref name= "Donate to The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential"&gt;{{cite web |title= Donate to The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential |url= https://iahp.org/donate-iahp/ |website= iahp.org |publisher= The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their public list of contributors is diverse: Ametek Foundation, Arcadia Foundation, Mrs. Elizabeth G.

'''The Matheson Trust''' is an educational charity based in London dedicated to further and disseminate the study of [[comparative religion]], especially from the point of view of the [[Perennial philosophy#Definition|underlying harmony]] of the major religious and philosophical traditions of the world. 

== History ==

The Matheson Trust was established in London in 1974 by [[Donald Macleod Matheson]] [[CBE]] (1896-1979),&lt;ref&gt;Settlement recorded in the archives of the London Borough of [[Bromley]], 12 January 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition to his work as a civil servant&lt;ref&gt;Matheson was appointed CBE in 1945, after serving for years as the Secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]: [http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37119/supplements/2953/page.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; was active as a translator of [[Traditionalist School|Perennialist]] works, most notably ''Understanding Islam'' by [[Frithjof Schuon]]&lt;ref&gt;George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''An Introduction to Sufi Doctrine'' by [[Titus Burckhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Donald-McLeod-Matheson.aspx |title=Sh. Muhammad Ashraf, Lahore Pakistan, 1963. For some more biographical information, see his author page at World Wisdom Books |publisher=Worldwisdom.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Registered as a UK charity in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=284155&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=UK Charity Commission entry |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date=1981-01-12 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the trust was for years active sponsoring academic research,&lt;ref&gt;[[Algis Uždavinys]] ''Philosophy as a Rite of Rebirth: From Ancient Egypt to Neoplatonism'', p. x ({{ISBN|978-1-898910-35-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; lectures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multifaithbook.org/ViewEventDetail.aspx?Id=567 |title=Collaboration with the Temenos Academy |publisher=Multifaithbook.org |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; film production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zamzam.tv/uk/products-page/films/circling-the-house-of-god/ |title=Circling the House of God |publisher=Zamzam.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fonsvitae.com/OnlineStore/tabid/58/pid/123/01962-The-Origin-Of-The-Buddha-Image-Elements-of-Buddhist-Iconography.aspx |title=Including The Origin Of The Buddha Image by Ananda Coomaraswamy |publisher=Fonsvitae.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zamzam.tv/uk/products-page/books/ibn-ajiba-two-treatises-on-the-oneness-of-existence-by-jean-louis-michon/ |title=Ibn ‘Ajiba: Two Treatises on the Oneness of Existence by Jean-Louis Michon |publisher=Zamzam.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2011 they have launched a new series of paperback publications, the Matheson Monographs, and a public website hosting the Matheson Library.

Matheson Trust associates have included, among others, [[Martin Lings]], [[Gai Eaton|Charles Le Gai Eaton]], [[William Stoddart]] and [[Reza Shah-Kazemi]].

== Matheson Monographs ==

Since 2008, The Matheson Trust had been co-producing publications with a number of kindred organisations and established publishers: The Prometheus Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prometheustrust.co.uk/index.html |title=Prometheus Trust |publisher=Prometheus Trust |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fons Vitae&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonsvitae.com/ |title=fonsvitae.com |publisher=fonsvitae.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (KY), Archetype UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetype.uk.com/home.htm |title=Archetype Home |publisher=Archetype.uk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but December 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Zinner |url=http://samuelzinner.blogspot.com/ |title=See Samuel Zinner's blog announcement |publisher=Samuelzinner.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the launch of an independent series, the "Matheson Monographs", covering "scriptural exegesis, the modalities of spiritual and contemplative life, studies of particular religious traditions, comparative analyses, studies of traditional arts, crafts and cosmological sciences, contemporary scholarly expositions of religious philosophy and metaphysics, translations of both classical and contemporary texts and transcriptions of lectures by, and interviews with, spiritual and scholarly authorities from different religious and philosophical traditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/publications/index.php#copublications |title=Publications |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matheson Library ==

In March 2011 the Matheson Trust website was launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/announce/2011/03/04/matheson-website-launched/ |title=Matheson Website Launched — The Matheson Trust |publisher=Themathesontrust.org |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting an online library of free selected books and articles, almost exclusively in English, including authors and sources as varied as [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah|Shaykh Abdallah Bin Bayyah]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/ |title=archbishopofcanterbury.org |publisher=archbishopofcanterbury.org |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Berzin]] archives, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Jonathan Sacks|Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks]], [[James Cutsinger]], [[Gavin D'Costa]], [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], [[Harry Oldmeadow]], the journal [[Ali Lakhani|Sacred Web]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Timothy Winter]] (Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad), [[The Woolf Institute of Abrahamic Faiths]] and others. Documents are free to browse and download, most in [[PDF]] format, with a few articles in HTML.&lt;br /&gt;

As of October 2018, there are more than 600 holdings in the library, a quarter of which are audio recordings.

=== Audio Library ===

One of the purported aims of the Matheson Library is to use existing contemporary media technologies to make available resources from ancient traditions, either in the form of recitation of traditional scriptures or in the scholarly transmission of the doctrines and insights pertaining to the different religions. An ongoing ''hear!'' project is converting scholarly texts and other texts of interest into [[MP3]] format, and making them available through the Audio section of the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themathesontrust.org/type/audio/ |title=Audio |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 the ''Matheson Trust Sacred Audio Collection'' was launched, a repository of selected liturgical audio recordings from the major religious traditions. This collection includes live recordings from temples and ritual gatherings around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/sacred-audio-collection |title=Sacred Audio Collection |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During each episode of The Voice of the Performing Arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Voice of the Performing Arts|url=http://thevoiceoftheperformingarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; guests from the arts community including arts professionals, educators and community leaders discuss the importance of introducing young people to the arts. Discussions include how they personally were drawn to the arts as a child and what can be done today to get young people excited about the arts. The hosts often ask guests to explain the “transformative moment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=That Transformative Moment|url=http://www.skybluewindow.org/indianapolis/that-transformative-moment/Content?oid=2144681}}&lt;/ref&gt;” when he or she fell in love with the performing arts.

The '''University of California, Santa Cruz''' (also known as '''UC Santa Cruz''' or '''UCSC''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]].  It is one of 10 campuses in the [[University of California]] system. Located 75 miles (120&amp;nbsp;km) south of San Francisco at the edge of the coastal community of Santa Cruz, the campus lies on {{convert|2001|acres|ha}} of rolling, forested hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean and [[Monterey Bay]].

Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz began as a showcase for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. Since then, it has evolved into a modern research university with a wide variety of both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation for strong undergraduate support and student political activism. The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.

==History==
Although some of the original founders had already outlined plans for an institution like UCSC as early as the 1930s, the opportunity to realize their vision did not present itself until the City of Santa Cruz made a bid to the [[Regents of the University of California|University of California Regents]] in the mid-1950s to build a campus just outside town, in the foothills of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].&lt;ref name="City council hasn't told"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Doyle | first = William T.| title = What the city council has not told us about university expansion| newspaper = Santa Cruz Sentinel| publisher = MediaNews Group| date = October 1, 2006| url = http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=42181| accessdate =February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Santa Cruz site was selected over a competing proposal to build the campus closer to the population center of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Santa Cruz was selected for the beauty, rather than the practicality, of its location, however, and its remoteness led to the decision to develop a residential college system that would house most of the students on-campus.&lt;ref name="McHenry UCSC origins"&gt;{{Cite book| last = McHenry | first = Dean E.| editor1-last = Spedding Calciano | editor1-first = Elizabeth| title = Volume II The University of California, Santa Cruz: Its Origins, Architecture, Academic Planning and Early Faculty Appointments 1958–1968| publisher = UC Santa Cruz | year = 1974 | page = 59| url = http://digitalcollections.ucsc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p265101coll13/id/3700 | format = PDF |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal design process of the Santa Cruz campus began in the late 1950s, culminating in the Long Range Development Plan of 1963.&lt;ref name="1963 LRDP"&gt;{{cite web| title = Long Range Development Plan, University of California Santa Cruz| publisher = UC Santa Cruz Campus Planning Committee| date = October 21, 1963| url = http://ppc.ucsc.edu/cp/planning/1963_lrdp.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = February 19, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624040556/http://ppc.ucsc.edu/cp/planning/1963_lrdp.pdf| archivedate = June 24, 2010| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction had started by 1964, and the university was able to accommodate its first students (albeit living in trailers on what is now the East Field athletic area) in 1965.

===Impact on Santa Cruz===
Although the city of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] already exhibited a strong [[conservation ethic]] before the founding of the university, the coincidental rise of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=27810|title=35 years later, students’ environmental report seems prescient|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 3, 2008|last=Seals|first=Brian|date=July 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc.&lt;ref name="Burchins3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40020|title=1980s ushered in discussion of UCSC expansion that continues today |newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 2, 2008|date=July 9, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large and growing population of politically [[progressivism|liberal]] UCSC [[alumnus|alumni]] changed the electorate of the town from predominantly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Honig|first=Tom|title=Santa Cruz was once Reagan country|date=June 4, 2004|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to markedly [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]], consistently voting against expansion measures on the part of both [[town and gown]].

===Expansion plans===
{{main|Long Range Development Plan (UCSC)}}
Plans for increasing enrollment to 19,500 students and adding 1,500 faculty and staff by 2020, and the anticipated environmental impacts of such action, encountered opposition from the city, the local community, and the student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Marshall | first=Carolyn | title=As College Grows, a City Is Asking, ‘Who Will Pay?’ | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/us/19campus.html | date=January 27, 2007 | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=40191|title=Tie-dyed philosophy majors of the past make way for pencil-protected science majors|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 2, 2008|date=July 16, 2006|last=Burchyns|first=Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC to pay for the impacts of campus growth. A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on the ballot. In 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.&lt;ref name="bookwalter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|title=Suits over UCSC growth settled: City, county, neighbors reach deal; university agrees to concessions over roads, water and housing|last=Bookwalter|first=Genevieve|date=August 9, 2008|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=September 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815200839/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_10150203|archive-date=August 15, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Blumenthal, UCSC's 10th Chancellor, intends to mitigate growth constraints in Santa Cruz by developing off-campus sites in [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[NASA Ames Research Center]] campus is planned to ultimately hold 2,000 UCSC students – about 10% of the entire university's future student body as envisioned for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Krieger | first= Lisa M. | title= Think of UCSC as UC-Silicon Valley, new chancellor says | url= http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_7044109 | publisher= [[Mercury News]] | date= September 30, 2007 | accessdate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Mills | first=Kay | title=Changes at "Oxford on the Pacific," UC Santa Cruz turns to engineering and technology | url=http://www.highereducation.org/crosstalk/ct0401/news0401-changesoxfordpacific.shtml | journal=National Crosstalk | publisher=National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education | volume=9 | date=Spring 2001 | accessdate=January 28, 2008 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, UC Santa Cruz opened its new $35 million Digital Arts Research Center; a project in planning since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14986867?nclick_check=1| title = UCSC cuts ribbon on $35 million digital arts building| author = Megha Satyanarayana| date = April 29, 2010| accessdate =May 3, 2010| publisher = San Jose Mercury News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The $72 million Coastal Biology Building officially opened on 21 October 2017 on the Coastal Science Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Santa Cruz to dedicate new Coastal Biology building on October 21|url=https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/coastal-biology-building.html|website=UC Santa Cruz News|accessdate=October 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new campus houses the Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Department and faculty interested in the study of ocean, terrestrial and freshwater environments, marine sciences, ecology and evolution, and plant sciences.  UC Santa Cruz is extending its environmental leadership in coastal science with a robust new program that will welcome its first cohort of students in Fall 2018. The Graduate Program in Coastal Science and Policy will train advocates and develop government and community responses to pressing sustainability issues.

[[File:UCSC &amp; Santa Cruz Aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|UCSC &amp; Santa Cruz aerial view. The Great Meadow is the undeveloped area between city and university]]
The {{convert|2000|acre|ha|adj=on}} UCSC campus is located {{convert|75|mi|km}} south of San Francisco, in the Ben Lomond Mountain ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. Elevation varies from {{convert|285|ft|m}} at the campus entrance to {{convert|1195|ft|m}} at the northern boundary, a difference of about {{convert|900|ft|m}}. The southern portion of the campus primarily consists of a large, open [[meadow]], locally known as the Great Meadow. To the north of the meadow lie most of the campus' buildings, many of them among [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] groves. The campus is bounded on the south by the city's upper-west-side neighborhoods, on the east by Harvey West Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Harvey West Park |url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/harvey.html|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pogonip (park)|Pogonip open space preserve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parks and Recreation – Pogonip|url=http://www.santacruzparksandrec.com/parks/pogo.html|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the north by [[Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Cowell Redwoods SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=546|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the town of [[Felton, California|Felton]], and on the west by [[Gray Whale Ranch]], a portion of [[Wilder Ranch State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilder Ranch SP|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=549|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The campus is built on a portion of the [[Cowell Lime Works|Cowell Family ranch]], which was purchased by the University of California in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.scsextra.com/story.php?sid=11341|title=The original City on a Hill|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=February 5, 2008|last=Redfern|first=Cathy|date=September 2, 2001
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern half of the campus property has remained in its undeveloped, forested state apart from fire roads and hiking and bicycle trails. The heavily forested area has allowed UC Santa Cruz to operate a [[RV park|recreational vehicle park]] as a form of student housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UC Santa Cruz – University Family Student Housing| url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| accessdate=October 27, 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026004728/http://housing.ucsc.edu/sponsored-housing/rv-index.html| archive-date=October 26, 2006| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[shrines]], dens and other student-built curiosities are scattered around the northern campus. These structures, mostly assembled from branches and other forest detritus, were formerly concentrated in the area known as Elfland, a glen the university razed in 1992 to build colleges Nine and Ten. Students were able to relocate and save some of the structures, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|title='An Unnatural History of UCSC' traces the evolution of a magical campus setting – Santa Cruz Sentinel|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|date=April 13, 2008|accessdate=April 12, 2008|last=Baine|first=Wallace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413062824/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8888134|archive-date=April 13, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF173AF931A25752C0A964958260

Creeks traverse the UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The footbridges make it possible to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being built on a mountainside with varying elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UCSC Walking Map | url=http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901143913/http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdwalkingmap.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flickr: Oaks Path Night | url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/exitfromreality/55520898/ |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of natural points of interest throughout the UCSC grounds. The "Porter Caves" are a popular site among students on the west side of campus. The entrance is located in the forest between the [[Porter College]] meadow and Empire Grade Road. The caves wind through a set of caverns, some of which are challenging, narrow passages. Tree Nine is another popular destination for students. A large [[Douglas fir]] spanning approximately {{convert|103|ft|m}} tall, Tree Nine is located in the upper campus of UCSC behind [[College Nine]]. The tree had been a popular climbing spot for many years but due to environmental corrosion and fear of student injuries, UC ground services sawed off the limbs to make it nearly impossible to climb.&lt;ref&gt;Tovin Lapan, [http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 "UCSC attempts to stop students from climbing campus favorite 'Tree Nine' "] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520114146/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_16240649 |date=May 20, 2013 }} ' 'Santa Cruz Sentinel' ' , October 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For specific directions, reference: [https://web.archive.org/web/20100111072232/http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Tree-Nine-at-the-University-of-California-in-Santa-Cruz directions to Tree Nine] For the less experienced tree-climber, students also frequent Sunset Tree located on the east side of the meadow behind the UCSC Music Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|title=UCSC Campus Field Trip|date=April 17, 2001|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010417170443/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/index.html|archivedate=April 17, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|title=Empire Cave|date=April 20, 2001|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010420140510/http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~es10/fieldtripUCSC/cave.html|archivedate=April 20, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UCSC campus is also one of the few homes to [[Mima Mounds]] in the United States. They are rare in the United States and in the world in general.

==Academics==
[[File:UCSC farm rows.jpg|left|thumb|Organic farm rows]]
The university offers 63 undergraduate majors and 35 minors, with graduate programs in 33 fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Santa Cruz – Academic Programs|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/academics/
|accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popular undergraduate majors include Art, [[Business management|Business Management Economics]], [[Molecular biology|Molecular and Cell Biology]], and [[Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=University of California, Santa Cruz (Statistics)|work=The Princeton Review|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/academics.asp?listing=1023551&amp;ltid=1&amp;intbucketid=

Interdisciplinary programs, such as Computational Media, Feminist Studies, [[Environmental studies|Environmental Studies]], Visual Studies, Digital Arts and New Media, Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies, and the prestigious [[History of Consciousness]] Department are also hosted alongside UCSC's more traditional academic departments.

A joint program with [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|UC Hastings]] enables UC Santa Cruz students to earn a bachelor's degree and law degree in six years instead of the usual seven.  The "3+3 BA/JD" Program between UC Santa Cruz and UC Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco accepted its first applicants in fall 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3plus3.ucsc.edu/|title=3 Plus 3|website=3plus3.ucsc.edu|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UCSC students who declare their intent in their freshman or early sophomore year will complete three years at UCSC and then move on to UC Hastings to begin the three-year law curriculum. Credits from the first year of law school will count toward a student's bachelor's degree. Students who successfully complete the first-year law course work will receive their bachelor's degree and be able to graduate with their UCSC class, then continue at UC Hastings afterwards for two years.

===Research===
According to the [[National Science Foundation]], UC Santa Cruz spent $155.5 million on research and development in 2012, ranking it 120th in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site;jsessionid=519A925E61C6701A1CAB3D9DDC0EE0B8?method=rankingBySource&amp;ds=herd |title=Rankings by total R&amp;D expenditures |publisher=National Science Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although designed as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level [[natural science]] research component with the appointment of plant physiologist [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] as the first provost of [[Crown College, University of California, Santa Cruz|Crown College]]. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714160609/http://library.ucsc.edu/library/reg-hist/thimann.pdf|archivedate=July 14, 2006|title=Kenneth V.

In 2016 it was ranked 83rd in the world by the ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' and 296th worldwide in 2016 by the ''[[QS World University Rankings]]''.

In 2009, RePEc, an online database of research economics articles, ranked the UCSC Economics Department sixth in the world in the field of international finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economics web site ranks UCSC sixth in the world for research on international finance|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3363|accessdate=November 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528041409/http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=3363|archivedate=May 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''High Times'' magazine placed UCSC as first among US universities as a "counterculture college."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC ranked 1st in High Times 2007|url=http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/3637|accessdate=October 14, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920125855/http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/3637|archivedate=September 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' (with ''[[Gamepro]]'' magazine) ranked UC Santa Cruz's Game Design major among the top 50 in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC ranked in top 50 for Game Design |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/game-design.aspx|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''The Princeton Review'' and ''Gamepro Media'' ranked UC Santa Cruz's graduate programs in Game Design as seventh in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Graduate Schools for Video Game Design 2011|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, UCSC was ranked No. 3 in the Most Beautiful Campus list of ''Princeton Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Franek, Robert.

==Residential colleges==
The undergraduate program, with only the partial exception of those majors run through the university's School of Engineering, is still based on the version of the "[[residential college|residential college system]]" outlined by Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry at the inception of their original plans for the campus (see [[University of California, Santa Cruz#History|History]], above). Upon admission, all undergraduate students have the opportunity to choose one of ten colleges, with which they usually stay affiliated for their entire undergraduate careers.&lt;ref name="collegesection"&gt;
{{cite web|title=UCSC General Catalog 2004–2006 (The Colleges section)|accessdate=June 29, 2006|url=http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/html/04_06colleges.htm

There are cases where some students switch college affiliations as each college holds a different graduation ceremony. Almost all faculty members are affiliated with a college as well.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; The individual colleges provide housing and dining services, while the university as a whole offers courses and majors to the general student community.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; Other universities with similar college systems include [[Rice University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

Each of the colleges has its own, distinctive architectural style and a resident faculty [[provost (education)|provost]], who is the nominal head of his or her college.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; An incoming first-year student will take a mandatory "core course" within his or her respective college, with a curriculum and central theme unique to that college.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; College resident populations vary from about 750 to 1,550 students, with roughly half of undergraduates living on campus within their college community or in smaller, intramural campus communities such as the International Living Center, the Trailer Park, and the Village.&lt;ref name="collegesection"/&gt; Coursework, academic majors and general areas of study are not limited by college membership, although colleges host the offices of many academic departments. Graduate students are not affiliated with a residential college, though a large portion of their offices, too, have historically tended to be based in the colleges. The ten colleges are, in order of establishment:

===Grading===
For most of its history, UCSC employed a unique [[Grading in the United States|student evaluation]] system. With the exception of the choice of letter grades in science courses the only [[grade (education)|grades]] assigned were "pass" and "no record", supplemented with [[narrative evaluation]]s. Beginning in 1997, UCSC allowed students the option of selecting letter grade evaluations, but course grades were still optional until 2000, when faculty voted to require students receive letter grades. Students were still given narrative evaluations to complement the letter grades. {{As of|2010}}, the narrative evaluations were deemed an unnecessary expenditure. Still, some professors write evaluations for all students while some would write evaluations for specific students upon request.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/02/24/MN88561.DTL|title=UC Santa Cruz To Start Using Letter Grades|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=February 2, 2008|last=Schevitz|first=Tanya|date=February 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can still elect to receive a "pass/no pass" grade, but many academic programs limit or even forbid pass/no pass grading. A grade of C and above would receive a grade of "pass". Overall, students may now earn no more than 25% of their UCSC credits on a "pass/no pass" basis. Although the default grading option for almost all courses offered is now "graded", most course grades are still accompanied by written evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC Discover – Academics

The [[McHenry Library]] houses UCSC's arts and letters collection, with most of the scientific reading at the newer Science and Engineering Library. The McHenry Library was designed by [[John Carl Warnecke]].&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; In addition, the colleges host smaller libraries, which serve as quiet places to study.  The McHenry Special Collections Library includes the archives of [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the papers of [[Anaïs Nin]], the papers and drawings of [[Beat poet]] [[Kenneth Patchen]], the largest collection of [[Edward Weston]] photographs in the country, the [[mycology]] book collection of composer [[John Cage]], a large collection of works by [[Satyajit Ray]], the [[Hayden White]] collection of 16th-century Italian printing, a photography collection with nearly half a million items, and the Mary Lea Shane Archive. The latter contains an extensive collection of photographs, letters, and other documents related to [[Lick Observatory]] dating back to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A {{convert|82000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} new addition to the library opened on March 31, 2008, including a "cyber study" room and a Global Village café.

UCSC students are known for political activism. In 2005, a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] surveillance program deemed student opposition to [[military recruiter]]s on campus a "credible threat," the only campus [[Antimilitarism|antiwar]] action to receive the designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kershaw|first=Sarah|title=A Protest, a Spy Program and a Campus in an Uproar|date=January 14, 2006

UC Santa Cruz is also well known for its [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] culture. On April 20, 2007, approximately 2,000 UCSC students gathered at Porter Meadow to celebrate the annual "[[420 (cannabis culture)|420]]". Students and others openly smoked marijuana while campus police stood by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Thousands at UCSC burn one to mark pot holiday

The 2007 event attracted a total of 5,000 participants. The university does not condone the gathering, but has taken steps to regulate the event and ensure security for all participants. On April 20, 2010, the school administration shut down the west entrance to campus and limited the number of buses that could drive through campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=UCSC takes security measures for '4/20|date=April 18, 2008|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|last=Brown|first=J.M.|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8970788|accessdate=April 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120091023/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_8970788|archive-date=November 20, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_9014404?source=most_viewed|title=Police: Pot-smoking event in UCSC meadow 'a moral slap in the face|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|accessdate=April 23, 2008|date=April 22, 2008|last=Ragan|first=Tom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208215646/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_9014404?source=most_viewed|archive-date=February 8, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well known tradition is what is known as "[[First Rain]]". Students run around campus naked or nearly naked to celebrate the school year's first night of heavy rain. The run begins at Porter and proceeds to travel through all the other colleges, collecting more students in its train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cityonahillpress.com/2006/10/12/a-naked-run-through-campus/

===Housing===
Most of the UCSC undergraduate housing is affiliated with one of the ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen to twenty students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas. Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women. Single-gender, [[gender-neutral housing|gender-neutral]] and substance-free floors are also available.

All of the colleges, except for Kresge, have both residence halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by four to eight students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and a combination of shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.

In addition to the residential colleges, housing is available at the Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing and transfer students (in 2016-17, this will be restricted to only continuing students); the Redwood Grove Apartments, which is available to continuing student applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, located downtown, that serves both continuing and transfer students. The Transfer Community is located in sections of both the A and B Buildings at Porter College and over 500 residents live within this theme housing. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Housing Services | url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | accessdate=April 16, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404191759/http://housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | archive-date=April 4, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
UCSC is home to few fraternities and sororities. The first Greek organization on campus, [[Theta Chi]], was given colony status on January 10, 1987 and chartered on October 14, 1989 (designation: Theta Iota). In the beginning, fraternities like [[Theta Chi]] and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] were met with strong opposition from the student body. Student groups like P.A.C. (People's Alternative Community), S.A.G.E. (Students Against Greek Environments), and M.A.C. (Men's Alternative Community) protested the existence of Greek life at the UCSC campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxucsc.com/history.html|title=Wayback Machine|date=August 31, 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831231223/http://oxucsc.com/history.html|archivedate=August 31, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek life at UCSC includes fraternities [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Phi Zeta]], [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Pi Alpha Phi]], and [[Delta Lambda Psi]], the nation's first gender neutral queer Greek organization. Sororities that are members of the [[National Panhellenic Council]] at the University of California, Santa Cruz include [[Gamma Phi Beta]] and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]. Recently in June 2016 the Theta Xi chapter of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] was chartered to bring a third National sorority to UC Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kappaalphatheta.org/whatsnew/index.cfm?entryId=86CC0556-DDF7-2DE8-A1591D25B14DFC64|title=Kappa Alpha Theta - What's New - Kappa Alpha Theta Welcomes UC Santa Cruz!|website=Kappaalphatheta.org|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sororities on campus include [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Kappa Delta Phi]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Sigma Pi Alpha]], [[Tri Chi]], [[Sigma Omicron Pi]], [[Kappa Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]] and [[Alpha Psi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soar.ucsc.edu/v2/studentorgs/rso-glo/glolist.html|title=List of Greek Organizations|website=soar.ucsc.edu|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent Greek lettered organization added to the campus was [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority, which chartered its chapter Gamma Phi as of Spring 2016.

Aside from social fraternities and sororities on campus, there are also a number of professional organizations as well. There are [[Kappa Gamma Delta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgdatucsc.org|title=Kappa Gamma Delta- UC Santa Cruz, Zeta Chapter|website=KGD|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prehealth sorority, [[Sigma Mu Delta]], a prehealth fraternity, [[Alpha Phi Omega]], a coed service fraternity, [[Phi Alpha Delta]], a pre-law fraternity, and [[Delta Sigma Pi]], a co-ed professional business fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|title=UCSC Discover - Student Life|date=May 31, 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=November 15, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531010536/https://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/discover/faq/studentlife.cfm|archivedate=May 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
Though UCSC has been known for its conservation efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC sustainability movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a sustainability funding body, the Campus Sustainability Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on Sustainability and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide Sustainability Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot Sustainability Office was created to help institutionalize sustainability, coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus sustainability activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Sustainability Office|url=http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|work=Sustainability Office|publisher=UCSC Sustainability Office|accessdate=May 21, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607060403/http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/about/office/history|archivedate=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward sustainability in a variety of different ways.

==Athletics==
{{main|UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs}}
[[File:UCSC East Field.jpg|thumb|East Field]]
UCSC competes in [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] as an Independent member. There are fifteen [[varsity team|varsity]] sports – men's and women's basketball, tennis, soccer, volleyball, swimming, cross country and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], and women's golf. UCSC teams have been Division III nationally ranked in tennis, soccer, men's volleyball, and swimming. The Men's water polo team was ranked 18th in the nation in 2006 and won the D3 national Championship, however in 2009 the team was cut due to budget cuts. UCSC maintains a number of successful club teams. It has won multiple club national championships in men's tennis, 3 in men's waterpolo and also a women's Division II championship in club rugby.

In 2016, due to a mounting debt in funding of the athletic program, the university polled its students on whether or not they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.

'''Vensim''' is [[simulation software]] developed by Ventana Systems. It primarily supports [[continuous simulation]] ([[System Dynamics|system dynamics]]), with some [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] and [[agent-based model]]ling capabilities. It is available commercially and as a free "Personal Learning Edition".

== Modeling environment ==

Vensim provides a graphical modeling interface with [[stock and flow]] and [[causal loop diagram]]s, on top of a text-based system of equations in a [[declarative programming]] language. It includes a patented method for interactive tracing of behavior through causal links in model structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vensim.com/causal-tracing/|title=Vensim Causal Tracing™|website=Vensim - Ventana Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/EP0527907A1?cl=en&amp;dq=causal+tracing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVhI3i2ZbOAhWLKCYKHbilAGkQ6AEIHjAA|title=Simulation system employing causal tracing. US Patent Application EP19910909851, Feb. 26 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/5428740|title=Applying successive data group operations to an active data group. Patent # 5,428,740|website=Justitia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a language extension for automating quality control experiments on models called Reality Check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sdr.4260100205/pdf|title=Reality check: A bridge between systems thinking and system dynamics|first1=David W.|last1=Peterson|first2=Robert L.|last2=Eberlein|journal=System Dynamics Review|volume=10|issue=2–3|pages=159–174|year=1994|doi=10.1002/sdr.4260100205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modeling language supports arrays (subscripts) and permits mapping among dimensions and aggregation. Built-in allocation functions satisfy constraints that are sometimes not met by conventional approaches like [[logit]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://vensim.com/allocation-by-priority-alloc-p/ Vensim Allocation by Priority]&lt;/ref&gt; It supports discrete delays, queues and a variety of stochastic processes.

There are multiple paths for cross sectional and time-series data import and export, including text files, spreadsheets and ODBC. Models may be calibrated against data using optimization, [[Kalman Filter]]ing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/27424|title=Hypothesis, estimation, and validation of dynamic social models : energy demand modeling|last1=Peterson|first1=David Walter|year=1975|type=Ph.D.|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods. Sensitivity analysis options provide a variety of ways to test and sample models, including Monte Carlo simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling.

Vensim model files can be packaged and published in a customizable read-only format that can be executed by a freely available Model Reader. This allows sharing of interactive models with users who do not own the program and/or who the model author does not wish to have access to the model's code base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vensim.com/vensim-model-reader/|title=Vensim Model Reader|website=Vensim - Ventana Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63969">'''Vocal learning''' is the ability to modify acoustic and syntactic sounds, acquire new sounds via imitation, and produce vocalizations. "Vocalizations" in this case refers only to sounds generated by the vocal organ (mammalian [[larynx]] or avian [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]]) as opposed to by the lips, teeth, and tongue, which require substantially less motor control.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Petkov | first1 = CI. | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = ED. | title = Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates. | journal = Front Evol Neurosci | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 12 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.3389/fnevo.2012.00012 | pmid = 22912615 | pmc = 3419981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A rare trait, vocal learning is a critical substrate for spoken language and has only been detected in eight animal groups despite the wide array of vocalizing species; these include [[humans]], [[bats]], [[cetaceans]], [[pinnipeds]] ([[Pinniped|seals]] and [[sea lions]]), [[elephants]], and three distantly related bird groups including [[songbirds]], [[parrots]], and [[hummingbirds]]. Vocal learning is distinct from [[auditory learning]], or the ability to form memories of sounds heard, a relatively common trait which is present in all vertebrates tested. For example, dogs can be trained to understand the word "sit" even though the human word is not in its innate auditory repertoire (auditory learning). However, the dog cannot imitate and produce the word "sit" itself as vocal learners can.

==Classification==
[[File:Continuum Hypothesis.tiff|thumb|400px|Hypothetical distributions of two behavioral phenotypes: vocal learning and sensory (auditory) sequence learning. We hypothesize that the behavioral phenotypes of vocal learning and auditory learning are distributed along several categories.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}} (A) Vocal learning complexity phenotype and (B) auditory sequence learning phenotype. The left axis (blue) illustrates the hypothetical distribution of species along the behavioral phenotype dimensions. The right axis (black step functions) illustrates different types of transitions along the hypothesized vocal-learning (A) or auditory-learning (B) complexity dimensions. Whether the actual distributions are continuous functions (blue curves), will need to be tested, in relation to the alternatives that there are several categories with gradual transitions or step functions (black curves). Although auditory learning is a prerequisite for vocal learning and there can be a correlation between the two phenotypes (A–B), the two need not be interdependent. A theoretical Turing machine (Turing, 1968) is illustrated [G∗], which can outperform humans on memory for digitized auditory input but is not a vocal learner. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
Historically, species have been classified into the binary categories of vocal learner or vocal non-learner based on their ability to produce novel vocalizations or imitate other species, with evidence from [[social isolation]], deafening studies, and [[cross-fostering]] experiments.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt; However, vocal learners exhibit a great deal of plasticity or variation between species, resulting in a spectrum of ability. The vocalizations of [[songbirds]] and [[whales]] have a syntactic-like organization similar to that of humans but are limited to Finite-State Grammars (FSGs), where they can generate strings of sequences with limited structural complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okanoya|first=K|title=The Bengalese finch: a window on the behavioral neurobiology of birdsong syntax|journal=Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.|year=2004|volume=1016|pages=724–735|doi=10.1196/annals.1298.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, on the other hand, show deeper hierarchical relationships, such as the nesting of phrases within others, and demonstrate compositional [[syntax]], where changes in syntactic organization generate new meanings, both of which are beyond the capabilities of other vocal learning groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurford|first=JR|title=The Origins of Grammar: Language in the Light of Evolution|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal learning phenotype also differ within groups and closely related species will not display the same abilities. Within avian vocal learners, for example, [[zebra finch]] songs only contain strictly linear transitions that go through different syllables in a motif from beginning to end, yet [[mockingbird]] and [[nightingale]] songs show element repetition within a range of legal repetitions, non-adjacent relationships between distant song elements, and forward and backward branching in song element transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Honda|first=E|author2=Okanoya K |title=Acoustical and syntactical com- parisons between songs of the white-backed Munia (Lonchura striata) and its domesticated strain, the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica)|journal=Zool. Sci.|year=1999|volume=16|pages=319–326|doi=10.2108/zsj.16.319}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parrots]] are even more complex as they can imitate the speech of heterospecifics like humans and synchronize their movements to a rhythmic beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schachner|first=A |author2=Brady TF |author3=Pepperberg IM |author4=Hauser MD|title=Spontaneous motor entrainment to music in multiple vocal mim- icking species.|journal=Curr. Biol.|year=2009|volume=19|pages=831–836|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.03.061 |pmid=19409786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuum hypothesis===
Even further complicating the original binary classification is evidence from recent studies that suggests that there is greater variability in a non-learner's ability to modify vocalizations based on experience than previously thought. Findings in suboscine [[passerine birds]], [[non-human primates]], [[mice]], and [[goats]], has led to the proposal of the vocal learning continuum hypothesis by [[Erich Jarvis]] and Gustavo Arriaga. Based on the apparent variations seen in various studies, the continuum hypothesis reclassifies species into non-learner, limited vocal learner, moderate vocal learning, complex vocal learner and high vocal learner categories where higher tiers have fewer species. Under this system, previously identified non-human vocal learners like [[songbirds]] are considered complex learners while humans fall under the “high” category; non-human [[primates]], [[mice]], and [[goats]], which are traditionally classified as non-learners, are considered limited vocal learners under this system.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

==Evidence of vocal learning in various species==

===Known vocal learners===

====Birds====
The most extensively studied [[model organism]]s of vocal learning are found in birds, namely songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds.  The degree of vocal learning in each specific species varies. While many parrots and certain songbirds like canaries can imitate and spontaneously combine learned sounds during all periods of their life, other songbirds and hummingbirds are limited to a certain songs learned during their [[critical period]].

====Bats====
The first evidence for audio-vocal learning in a non-human mammal was produced by Karl-Heinz Esser in 1994. Hand-reared infant [[lesser spear-nosed bat]]s (''Phyllostomos discolor'') were able to adapt their isolation calls to an external reference signal. Isolation calls in a control group that had no reference signal did not show the same adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esser | first1 = KH | year = 1994 | title = Audio-vocal learning in a non-human mammal: the lesser spear-nosed bat ''Phyllostomus discolor'' | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 5 | issue = 14| pages = 1718–1720 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199409080-00007 | pmid=7827315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence for vocal learning in bats appeared in 1998 when Janette Wenrick Boughman studied female [[greater spear-nosed bat]]s (''Phyllostomus hastatus''). These bats live in unrelated groups and use group contact calls that differ among [[social groups]]. Each social group has a single call, which differs in frequency and temporal characteristics. When individual bats were introduced to a new social group, the group call began to morph, taking on new frequency and temporal characteristics, and over time, calls of transfer and resident bats in the same group more closely resembled their new modified call than their old calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boughman | first1 = JW | year = 1998 | title = Vocal learning by greater spear-nosed bats | url = | journal = Proc. Biol. Sci. | volume = 265 | issue = | pages = 227–233 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cetaceans====

=====Whales=====
Male [[humpback whales]] (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') sing as a form of [[sexual display]] while [[Animal migration|migrating]] to and from their breeding grounds. All males in a population produce the same song which can change over time, indicating vocal learning and [[cultural transmission]], a characteristic shared by some bird populations. Songs become increasingly dissimilar over distance and populations in different oceans have dissimilar songs.

Whale songs recorded along the east coast of Australia in 1996 showed introduction of a novel song by two foreign whales who had migrated from the west Australian coast to the east Australian coast. In just two years, all members of the population had switched songs. This new song was nearly identical to ones sung by migrating humpback whales on the west Australian Coast, and the two new singers who introduced the song are hypothesized to have introduced the new "foreign" song to the population on the east Australian coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noad | first1 = MJ | last2 = Cato | first2 = DH | last3 = Bryden | first3 = MM | last4 = Jenner | first4 = MN | last5 = Jenner | first5 = KC. | year = 2000 | title = Cultural revolution in whale songs | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = | page = 537 |pmid=11117730|doi=10.1038/35046199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocal learning has also been seen in [[killer whale]]s (''Orcinus orca''). Two juvenile killer whales, separated from their natal pods, were seen mimicking cries of [[California sea lion]]s (''Zalophus californianus'') that were near the region they lived in. The composition of the calls of these two juveniles were also different from their natal groups, reflecting more of the sea lion calls than that of the whales.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, AD; Griffin, RM; Howitt, D; Larsson, L, Miller, PJO; and Hoelzel, AR. (2006). Killer whales are capable of vocal learning. ''Biol. Lett.'', 2, pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dolphins=====
Captive [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops truncatus'') can be trained to emit sounds through their blowhole in open air. Through training, these vocal emissions can be altered from natural patterns to resemble sounds like the human voice, measurable through the number of bursts of sound emitted by the dolphin. In 92% of exchanges between humans and dolphins, the number of bursts equaled ±1 of the number of syllables spoken by a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lilly | first1 = JC. | year = 1965 | title = Vocal mimicry in tursiops: ability to match numbers and durations of human vocal bursts | url = | journal = Science | volume = 147 | issue = 3655| pages = 300–301 | doi=10.1126/science.147.3655.300 | pmid=17788214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study used an underwater keyboard to demonstrate that dolphins are able to learn various whistles in order to do an activity or obtain an object. Complete mimicry occurred within ten attempts for these trained dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reiss | first1 = D | last2 = McCowan | first2 = B | year = 1993 | title = Spontaneous vocal mimicry and production by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus): Evidence for vocal learning | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 107 | issue = 3| pages = 301–312 | doi=10.1037/0735-7036.107.3.301 | pmid=8375147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of dolphins have given even more evidence of spontaneous [[mimicry]] of species-specific whistles and other biological and computer-generated signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herman | first1 = LM | last2 = Richards | first2 = DG | last3 = Wolz | first3 = JP. | year = 1984 | title = Comprehension of sentences by bottlenosed dolphins | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 129–219 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(84)90003-9 | pmid=6540652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such vocal learning has also been identified in wild bottlenose dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins develop a distinct signature whistle in the first few months of life, which is used to identify and distinguish itself from other individuals. This individual distinctiveness could have been a driving force for evolution by providing higher species fitness since complex communication is largely correlated with increased intelligence.  However, vocal identification is present in vocal non-learners as well. Therefore, it is unlikely that individual identification was a primary driving force for the evolution of vocal learning. Each signature whistle can be learned by other individuals for identification purposes and are used primarily when the dolphin in question is out of sight. Bottlenose dolphins use their learned whistles in matching interactions, which are likely to be used while addressing each other, signalling alliance membership to a third party, or preventing deception by an imitating dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janik | first1 = VM.| year = 2000 | title =  Whistle matching in wild bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5483| pages = 1355–1357  | quote = Comparative studies indicate that whistles vary in structure across populations and species (Steiner 1981; Ding et al. 1995; Rendell et al. 1999), with whistle divergence perhaps facilitating species recognition and speciation (Podos et al. 2002).| doi=10.1126/science.289.5483.1355 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mate attraction and territory defense have also been seen as possible contributors to vocal learning evolution. Studies on this topic point out that while both vocal learners and non-learners use vocalizations to attract mates or defend territories, there is one key difference: variability. Vocal learners can produce a more varied arrangement of vocalizations and frequencies, which studies show may be more preferred by females. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caldwell|first1=D.K.|title=How animals communicate|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed that male Atlantic bottlenose dolphins may initiate a challenge by facing another dolphin, opening its mouth, thereby exposing its teeth, or arching its back slightly and holding its head downward. This behavior is more along the lines of visual communication but still may or may not be accompanied by vocalizations such as burst-pulsed sounds. The burst-pulsed sounds, which are more complex and varied than the whistles, are often utilized to convey excitement, dominance or aggression such as when they are competing for the same piece of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janik|first1=Vincent|title=Communication in bottlenose dolphins: 50 years of signature whistle research|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|volume=199|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1007/s00359-013-0817-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dolphins also produce these forceful sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey. On the sexual side &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caldwell|first1=D.K.|title=How Animals Communicate|pages=794}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw that dolphins may solicit a sexual response from another by swimming in front of it, looking back, and rolling on its side to display the genital region. These observations provide yet another example of visual communication where dolphins exhibit different postures and non-vocal behaviors to communicate with others that also may or may not be accompanied by vocalizations. Sexual selection for greater variability, and thus in turn vocal learning, may then be a major driving force for the evolution of vocal learning.

====Seals====
Captive [[harbor seal]]s (''Phoca vitulina'') were recorded mimicking human words such as "hello", "Hoover" (the seal's own name) and producing other speech-like sounds. Most of the vocalizations occurred during the reproductive season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ralls | first1 = K | last2 = Fiorelli | first2 = P | last3 = Gish | first3 = S. | year = 1985 | title = Vocalizations and vocal mimicry in captive harbour seals, Phoca vitulina | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 1050–1056 | doi=10.1139/z85-157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More evidence of vocal learning in seals occurs in [[southern elephant seal]]s (''Mirounga leonine''). Young males imitate the vocal cries of successful older males during their [[breeding season]]. [[northern elephant seal|northern]] and southern elephant seals have a highly [[polygynous]] mating system with a vast disparity in mating success. In other words, few males guard huge [[harem (zoology)|harems]] of females, eliciting intense [[Sexual selection in mammals#Male-male competition|male-male competition]]. Antagonistic vocal cries play an important role in inter-male competitions and are hypothesized to demonstrate the resource-holding potential of the emitter. In both species, antagonistic vocal cries vary geographically and are structurally complex and individually distinct. Males displays unique calls, which can be identified by the specific arrangement of syllable and syllable parts.

Harem holders frequently vocalize to keep peripheral males away from females, and these vocalizations are the dominant component in a young juvenile's acoustic habitat. Successful vocalizations are heard by juveniles, who then imitate these calls as they get older in an attempt to obtain a harem for themselves. Novel vocal types expressed by dominant males spread quickly through populations of breeding elephant seals and are even imitated by juveniles in the same season.

Genetic analysis indicated that successful vocal patterns were not passed down hereditarily, indicating that this behavior is learned. Progeny of successful harem holders do not display their father's vocal calls and the call that makes one male successful often disappears entirely from the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanvito | first1 = S | last2 = Galimberti | first2 = F | last3 = Miller | first3 = EH. | year = 2007 | title = Observational evidences of vocal learning in southern elephant seals: a longitudinal study | url = | journal = Ethology | volume = 113 | issue = 2| pages = 137–146 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elephants====
Mlaika, a ten-year-old adolescent female [[African elephant]], has been recorded imitating truck sounds coming from the Nairobi-Mombasa highway three miles away. Analysis of Mlaika's truck-like calls show that they are different from the normal calls of African elephants, and that her calls are a general model of truck sounds, not copies of the sounds of trucks recorded at the same time of the calls. In other words, Mlaika's truck calls are not imitations of the trucks that she hears, but rather, a generalized model she developed over time.

Other evidence of vocal learning in elephants occurred in a cross-fostering situation with a captive African elephant. At the [[Basel Zoo]] in [[Switzerland]], Calimero, a male [[African elephant]], was kept with two female [[Asian elephants]]. Recordings of his cries shows evidence of chirping noises, typically only produced by [[Asian elephants]]. The duration and frequency of these calls differs from recorded instances of chirping calls from other African elephants and more closely resembles the chirping calls of [[Asian elephants]].&lt;ref&gt;Poole, JH et al. (2005). "Animal behaviour: elephants are capable of vocal learning." ''Nature'' 434.7032 : 455-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversial or limited vocal learners===
The following species are not formally considered vocal learners, but some evidence has suggested they may have limited abilities to modify their vocalizations. Further research is needed in these species to fully understand their learning abilities.

====Non-human primates====
Early research asserted that primate calls are fully formed at an early age in development, yet recently some studies have suggested these calls are modified later in life.&lt;ref name=owren&gt;Owren, MJ, et al. (1992). "'Food' Calls Produced by Adult Female Rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and Japanese (M. fuscata) Macaques, Their Normally-Raised Offspring, and Offspring Cross-Fostered between Species." ''Behaviour'': 218-231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Masataka and Fujita cross-fostered [[Japanese macaque|Japanese]] and [[rhesus monkeys]] in the same room and demonstrated that foraging calls were learned directly from their foster mothers, providing evidence of vocal learning.&lt;ref&gt;Masataka, N; and Fujita, K. (1989). "Vocal learning of Japanese and rhesus monkeys." ''Behaviour'': 191-199.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when another independent group was unable to reproduce these results, Masataka and Fujita's findings were questioned.&lt;ref name=owren /&gt; Adding to the evidence against vocal learning in [[non-human primates]] is the suggestion that regional differences in calls maybe be attributed to genetic differences between populations and not vocal learning.&lt;ref name=snowdon&gt;Snowdon, CT. (2009). "Plasticity of communication in non-human primates," in ''Advances in the Study of Behavior'', eds M. Naguib and V. M. Janik (Burlington, NJ: Academic Press), 239–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies argue that [[non-human primates]] do have some limited vocal learning ability, demonstrating that they can modify their vocalizations in a limited fashion through laryngeal control&lt;ref name=snowdon /&gt; and lip movements.&lt;ref name=hopkins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hopkins | first1 = WD | last2 = Taglialatela | first2 = J | last3 = Leavens | first3 = DA. | year = 2007 | title = Chimpanzees differentially produce novel vocalizations to capture the attention of a human | url = | journal = Anim. Behav. | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 281–286 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.004| pmc = 1832264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wich&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wich | first1 = SA | last2 = Swartz | first2 = KB | last3 = Hardus | first3 = ME | last4 = Lameira | first4 = AR | last5 = Stromberg | first5 = E | last6 = Shumaker | first6 = RW. | year = 2009 | title = A case of spontaneous acquisition of a human sound by an orangutan | url = | journal = Primates | volume = 50 | issue = 1| pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1007/s10329-008-0117-y | pmid=19052691}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[chimpanzee]]s in both captivity and in the wild have been recorded producing novel sounds to attract attention. By puckering their lips and making a vibrating sounds, they can make a "raspberry" call, which has been imitated by both naïve captive and wild individuals.&lt;ref name=hopkins /&gt; There is also evidence of an [[orangutan]] learning to whistle by copying a human, an ability previously unseen in the species.&lt;ref name=wich /&gt; A cross-fostering experiment with [[marmoset]]s and [[macaque]]s showed convergence in pitch and other acoustic features in their supposedly innate calls,&lt;ref name=snowdon /&gt; demonstrating the ability, albeit limited, for vocal learning.

====Mice====
[[Mouse|Mice]] produce long sequences of vocalizations or "songs" that are used for both isolation calls in pups when cold or removed from nest and for [[courtship display|courtship]] when males sense a female or detect [[pheromones]] in their urine. These [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] vocalizations consist of discrete syllables and patterns, with species-specific differences. Males tend to use particular syllable types that can be used to differentiate individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holy | first1 = TE | last2 = Guo | first2 = Z. | year = 2005 | title = Ultrasonic songs of male mice | url = | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 12| page = e386 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030386 | pmid=16248680 | pmc=1275525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been intense debate on whether these songs are innate or learned. In 2011, Kikusui ''et al''. cross-fostered two strains of mice with distinct song [[phenotypes]] and discovered that strain-specific characteristics of each song persisted in the offspring, indicating that these vocalizations are innate.&lt;ref&gt;Kikusui, T; et al. (2011). "Cross fostering experiments suggest that mice songs are innate." ''PloS'' one 6.3: e17721.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year later work by Arriaga et al. contradicted these results as their study found a motor cortex region active during singing, which projects directly to brainstem motor neurons and is also important for keeping songs stereotyped and on [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. Vocal control by forebrain motor areas and direct cortical projections to vocal motor neurons are both features of vocal learning. Furthermore, male mice were shown to depend on auditory feedback to maintain some ultrasonic song features, and sub-strains with differences in their songs were able to match each other’s pitch when cross-housed under competitive social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arriaga|first=G |author2=Zhou E.P. |author3=Jarvis E.D.|title=Of Mice, Birds, and Men: The Mouse Ultrasonic Song System Has Some Features Similar to Humans and Song- Learning Birds|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=10|pages=e46610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046610|pmid=23071596|pmc=346858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arriaga | first1 = G | last2 = Jarvis | first2 = ED. | year = 2013 | title = Mouse vocal communication system: Are ultrasounds learned or innate?. | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 124 | issue = 1| pages = 96–116 | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2012.10.002| pmc = 3886250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this conflicting evidence, it remains unclear whether mice are vocal non-learners or limited vocal learners.

====Goats====
When [[goats]] are placed in different social groups, they modify their calls to show more similarity to that of the group, which provides evidence they may be limited vocal learners according to Erich Jarvis' continuum hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Arriaga 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arriaga | first1 = G. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = EP. | last3 = Jarvis | first3 = ED. | title = Of mice, birds, and men: the mouse ultrasonic song system has some features similar to humans and song-learning birds. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = e46610 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0046610 | pmid = 23071596 | pmc = 346858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
As vocal learning is such a rare trait that evolved in distant groups, there are many theories to explain the striking similarities between vocal learners, especially within avian vocal learners.

===Adaptive advantage===
There are several proposed hypotheses that explain the selection for vocal learning based on environment and behavior. These include:&lt;ref name=jarvis2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Bird Song Systems: Evolution|journal=Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=2|pages=217–225.|doi=10.1016/b978-008045046-9.00935-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Individual identification: In most vocal-learning species, individuals have their own songs which serve as a unique signature to differentiate themselves from others in the population, which some suggest has driven selection of vocal learning. However, identification by voice, rather than by song or name, is present in vocal non-learners as well. Among vocal learners, only [[humans]] and maybe [[bottlenose dolphins]] actually use unique names. Therefore, it is unlikely that individual identification was a primary driving force for the [[evolution]] of vocal learning.
* Semantic communication: Semantic vocal communication associates specific vocalizations with animate or inanimate objects to convey a factual message. This hypothesis asserts that vocal learning evolved to facilitate enhanced communication of these specific messages as opposed to affective communication, which conveys emotional content. For example, humans are able to shout "watch out for that car!" when another is in danger while crossing the street instead of just making a noise to indicate urgency, which is less effective at conveying the exact danger at hand. However, many vocal non-learners, including [[chickens]] and velvet monkeys, have been shown to use their innate calls to communicate semantic information such as ‘a food source’ or 'predator.' Further discrediting this hypothesis is the fact that vocal learning birds also use innate calls for this purpose and only rarely use their learned vocalizations for semantic communication (for example, the [[grey parrot]] can mimic human speech and the black-capped chickadee uses calls to indicate predator size). As learned vocalizations rarely convey semantic information, this hypothesis also does not fully explain the evolution of vocal learning.
* Mate attraction and territory defense: While both vocal learners and non-learners use vocalizations to attract mates or defend territories, there is one key difference: variability. Vocal learners can produce more varied [[syntax]] and [[frequency modulation]], which have been shown to be preferred by females in [[songbirds]]. For example, [[Atlantic canary|canaries]] use two voices to produce large [[frequency modulation]] variations called "sexy syllables" or "sexy songs", which are thought to stimulate [[estrogen]] production in females. When vocal non-learner females were presented with artificially increased [[frequency modulation]]s in their innate vocalizations, more mating was stimulated. [[Sexual selection]] for greater variability, and thus in turn vocal learning, may then be a major driving force for the evolution of vocal learning.
* Rapid adaptation to sound propagation in different environments: Vocal non-learners produce their sounds best in specific habitats, making them more susceptible to changes in the environment. For example, pigeons' low-frequency calls travel best near the ground, and so communication higher in the air is much less effective. In contrast, vocal learners can change voice characteristics to suit their current environment, which presumably allows for better group communication.

===Predatory pressure===
With the many possible advantages outlined above, it still remains unclear as to why vocal learning is so rare. One proposed explanation is that predatory pressure applies a strong selective force against vocal learning.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt; If mates prefer more variable vocalizations, predators may also be more strongly attracted to more variable vocalizations. As innate calls are typically constant, predators quickly habituate to these vocalizations and ignore them as background noise. In contrast, the variable vocalizations of vocal learners are less likely to be ignored, possibly increasing the [[predation]] rate among vocal learners. In this case, relaxed predation pressure or some mechanism to overcome increased predation must first develop to facilitate the evolution of vocal learning. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that many mammalian vocal learners including [[human]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[elephant]]s have very few major predators. Similarly, several avian vocal learners have behaviors that are effective in avoiding predators, from the rapid flight and escape behavior of [[hummingbirds]] to predator mobbing in [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]].

While little research has been done in this area, some studies have supported the predation hypothesis. One study showed that Bengalese finches bred in captivity for 250 years without predation or human selection for singing behavior show increased variability in [[syntax]] than their conspecifics in the wild. A similar experiment with captive [[zebra finch]]es demonstrated the same result as captive birds had increased song variability, which was then preferred by females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zann|first=RA|title=The Zebra Finch: A Synthesis of Field and Laboratory Studies|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these studies are promising, more research is needed in this area to compare predation rates across vocal learners and non-learners.

===Phylogeny===

====Birds====
[[File:Avian Tree.tiff|thumb|400px|Avian phylogenetic tree and the complex-vocal learning phenotype. Shown is an avian phylogenetic tree (based on: Hackett et al., 2008). Identified in red text and ∗ are three groups of complex-vocal learning birds. Below the figure are summarized three alternative hypotheses on the evolutionary mechanisms of complex-vocal learning in birds. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
Modern birds supposedly evolved from a common ancestor around the [[Cretaceous]]-Paleogene boundary at the time of the extinction of dinosaurs, about 66 million years ago. Out of the thirty [[Bird#Classification of modern bird orders|avian orders]], only three evolved vocal learning and all have incredibly similar forebrain structures despite the fact that they are distantly related (for example, [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]] are as distantly related as [[humans]] and [[dolphins]]). Phylogenetic comparisons have suggested that vocal learning evolved among birds at least two or three independent times, in [[songbirds]], [[parrots]], and [[hummingbirds]]. Depending on the interpretation of the trees, there were either three gains in all three lineages or two gains, in [[hummingbirds]] and the common ancestor of [[parrots]] and [[songbirds]], with a loss in the [[suboscine]] songbirds. There are several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;
* Independent convergent evolution: All three avian groups evolved vocal learning and similar neural pathways independently (not through a common ancestor). This suggests that there are strong [[epigenetic]] constraints imposed by the environment or morphological needs, and so this hypothesis predicts that groups that newly evolve vocal learning will also develop similar neural circuits.
* Common ancestor: This alternative hypothesis suggests that vocal learning birds evolved the trait from a distant common ancestor, which was then lost four independent times in interrelated vocal non-learners. Possible causes include high survival costs of vocal learning (predation) or weak adaptive benefits that did not induce strong selection for the trait for organisms in other environments. 
* Rudimentary structures in non-learners: This alternative hypothesis states that avian non-learners actually do possess rudimentary or undeveloped brain structures necessary for song learning, which were enlarged in vocal learning species. Significantly, this concept challenges the current assumption that vocal nuclei are unique to vocal learners, suggesting that these structures are universal even in other groups such as mammals.
* [[Motor theory of speech perception|Motor theory]]: This hypothesis suggests that cerebral systems that control vocal learning in distantly related animals evolved as specializations of a pre-existing motor system inherited from a common ancestor. Thus in avian vocal learners, each of the three groups of vocal learning birds evolved cerebral vocal systems independently, but the systems were constrained by a previous genetically determined motor system inherited from the common ancestor that controls learned movement sequencing. Evidence for this hypothesis was provided by Feenders and colleagues in 2008 as they found that [[EGR1]], an [[immediate early gene]] associated with increases in neuronal activity, was expressed in forebrain regions surrounding or directly adjacent to song nuclei when vocal learning birds performed non-vocal movement behaviors such as hopping and flying. In non-learners, comparable areas were activated, but without the adjacent presence of song nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feenders|first=G|author2=Liedvogel, M |author3=Rivas, M |author4=Zapka, M |author5= Horita, H |title=Molecular Mapping of Movement-Associated Areas in the Avian Brain: A Motor Theory for Vocal Learning Origin|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2008|volume=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001768 |pages=e1768 |pmid=18335043 |pmc=2258151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EGR1]] expression patterns were correlated with the amount of movement, just as its expression typically correlates with the amount of singing performed in vocal birds. These finding suggest that vocal learning brain regions developed from the same cell lineages that gave rise to the motor pathway, which then formed a direct projection onto the brainstem vocal motor neurons to provide greater control.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

Currently, it remains unclear as to which of these hypotheses is the most accurate.

====Primates====
[[File:Primate Tree.tiff|thumb|500px|Primate phylogenetic tree and complex-vocal learning vs. auditory sequence learning. Shown is a primate phylogenetic tree based on a combination of DNA sequence and fossil age data (Goodman et al., 1998; Page et al., 1999). Humans (Homo) are the only primates classified as “vocal learners.” However, non-human primates might be better at auditory sequence learning than their limited vocal-production learning capabilities would suggest. In blue text and (#) we highlight species for which there is some evidence of Artificial Grammar Learning capabilities for at least adjacent relationships between the elements in a sequence (tamarins: Fitch and Hauser, 2004), (macaques: Wilson et al., 2011). Presuming that the auditory capabilities of guenons and gibbons (or the symbolic learning of signs by apes) would mean that these animals are able to learn at least adjacent relationships in Artificial Grammars we can tentatively mark these species also in blue #. Note however, that for the species labeled in black text, future studies might show them to be capable of some limited-vocal learning or various levels of complexity in learning the structure of auditory sequences. Three not mutually exclusive hypotheses are illustrated for both complex-vocal learning and auditory sequence learning. From Petkov, CI; Jarvis ED (2012). "Birds, primates, and spoken language origins: behavioral phenotypes and neurobiological substrates". Front. Evol. Neurosci. 4:12.]]
In [[primates]], only [[humans]] are known to be capable of complex vocal learning.  Similar to the first hypothesis relating to birds, one explanation is that vocal learning evolved independently in humans. An alternative hypothesis suggests evolution from a primate common ancestor capable of vocal learning, with the trait subsequently being lost at least eight other times. Considering the most parsimonious analysis, it seems unlikely that the number of independent gains (one in humans) would be exceeded so greatly by the number of independent losses (at least eight), which supports the independent evolution hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;

==Neurobiology==

===Neural pathways in avian vocal learners===

As avian vocal learners are the most amenable to experimental manipulations, the vast majority of work to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of vocal learning has been conducted with [[zebra finch]]es, with a few studies focusing on [[budgerigar]]s and other species. Despite variation in vocal learning phenotype, the [[Song control system|neural circuitry]] necessary for producing learned song is conserved in [[songbird]]s, [[parrot]]s, and [[hummingbird]]s. As opposed to their non-learner avian counterparts such as [[quail]], [[doves]], and [[pigeons]], these avian vocal learners contain seven distinct cerebral song nuclei, or distinct brain areas associated with auditory learning and [[Bird vocalizations|song production]] defined by their gene expression patterns. As current evidence suggests independent evolution of these structures, the names of each equivalent vocal nucleus are different per bird group, as shown in the table below.

Vocal nuclei are found in two separate brain pathways, which will be described in [[songbirds]] as most research has been conducted in this group, yet it should be noted that connections are similar in [[parrots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|author2=Mello CV |title=Molecular mapping of brain areas involved in parrot vocal communication|journal=J. Comp. Neurol.|year=2000|volume=419|pages=1–31|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(20000327)419:1&lt;1::aid-cne1&gt;3.0.co;2-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hummingbirds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|author2=Ribeiro, S|author3=Da Silva, ML|author4=Ventura, D|author5=Vielliard, J|author6=Mello, CV|title=Behaviourally driven gene expression reveals song nuclei in hummingbird brain|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=406|pages=628–632|doi=10.1038/35020570|pmid=10949303|pmc=2531203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projections of the anterior vocal pathway in the [[hummingbird]] remain unclear and so are not listed in the table above.

The posterior vocal pathway (also known as vocal motor pathway), involved in the production of learned vocalizations, begins with projections from a nidopallial nucleus, the [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] in [[songbirds]]. The [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] then projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). The RA connects to the midbrain vocal center DM (dorsal medial nucleus of the [[midbrain]]) and [[Hypoglossal nerve|the brainstem (nXIIts) vocal motor neurons]] that control the muscles of the [[syrinx]], a direct projection similar to the projection from LMC to the [[nucleus ambiguus]] in humans&lt;ref name="Petkov 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Learned birdsong and the neurobiology of human language.|journal=Ann.

Sci.|year=2004|volume=1016|pages=749–777|doi=10.1196/annals.1298.038|pmc=2485240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] is considered the [[syntax]] generator while the RA modulates the acoustic structure of syllables. Vocal non-learners do possess the DM and twelfth motor neurons (nXIIts), but lack the connections to the [[arcopallium]]. As a result, they can produce vocalizations, but not learned vocalizations.

The anterior vocal pathway (also known as vocal learning pathway) is associated with learning, [[syntax]], and social contexts, starting with projections from the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to the striatal nucleus Area X. Area X then projects to the medial nucleus of dorsolateral thalamus (DLM), which ultimately projects back to MAN in a loop&lt;ref name="Schraff 1991 2896–2913"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schraff|first=C|author2=Nottebohm F |title=A comparative study of the behavioral deficits following lesions of various parts of the zebra finch song system: implications for vocal learning|journal=J Neurosci|year=1991|volume=11|pages=2896–2913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lateral part of MAN (LMAN) generates variability in song, while Area X is responsible for stereotypy, or the generation of low variability in syllable production and order after song crystallization.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;

Despite the similarities in vocal learning neural circuits, there are some major connectivity differences between the posterior and anterior pathways among avian vocal learners. In [[songbirds]], the posterior pathway communicates with the anterior pathway via projections from the [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]] to Area X; the anterior pathway sends output to the posterior pathway via connections from LMAN to RA and medial MAN (MMAN) to [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]]. [[Parrots]], on the other hand, have projections from the [[ventral]] part of the AAC (AACv), the parallel of the songbird RA, to the NAOc, parallel of the songbird MAN, and the oval nucleus of the mesopallium (MO). The anterior pathway in [[parrots]] connects to the posterior pathway via NAOc projections to the NLC, parallel of the [[songbird]] [[HVC (avian brain region)|HVC]], and AAC. Thus, [[parrots]] do not send projections to the [[striatum|striatal]] nucleus of the anterior pathway from their posterior pathway as do [[songbirds]]. Another crucial difference is the location of the posterior vocal nuclei among species. Posterior nuclei are located in auditory regions for songbirds, laterally adjacent to auditory regions in hummingbirds, and are physically separate from auditory regions in parrots. Axons must therefore take different routes to connect nuclei in different vocal learning species. Exactly how these connectivity differences affect song production and/or vocal learning ability remains unclear.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wild|first=JM|title=Neural pathways for the control of birdsong production|journal=Journal of Neurobiology|year=1997|volume=33|pages=653–670|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19971105)33:5&lt;653::aid-neu11&gt;3.0.co;2-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An auditory pathway that is used for [[auditory learning]] brings auditory information into the vocal pathway, but the auditory pathway is not unique to vocal learners. Ear [[hair cells]] project to cochlear ganglia neurons to auditory pontine nuclei to [[midbrain]] and [[thalamus|thalamic]] nuclei and to primary and secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] areas. A descending auditory feedback pathway exists projecting from the dorsal [[nidopallium]] to the intermediate [[arcopallium]] to shell regions around the [[thalamus|thalamic]] and [[midbrain]] auditory nuclei. Remaining unclear is the source of auditory input into the vocal pathways described above. It is hypothesized that songs are processed in these areas in a hierarchical manner, with the primary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] area responsible for acoustic features (field L2), the secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] area (fields L1 and L3 as well as the caudal medial nidopallium or NCM) determining sequencing and discrimination, and the highest station, the caudal mesopallium (CM), modulating fine discrimination of sounds. Secondary [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallial]] areas including the NCM and CM are also thought to be involved in auditory memory formation of songs used for vocal learning, but more evidence is needed to substantiate this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=jarvis2009 /&gt;

===Critical period===
The development of the sensory modalities necessary for song learning occurs within a “[[critical period]]” of development that varies among avian vocal learners.  Closed-ended learners such as the [[zebra finch]] and aphantochroa [[hummingbird]] can only learn during a limited time period and subsequently produce highly stereotyped or non-variable vocalizations consisting of a single, fixed song which they repeat their entire lives. In contrast, open-ended learners, including [[Atlantic canary|canaries]] and various [[parrot]] species, display significant [[Synaptic plasticity|plasticity]] and continue to learn new songs throughout the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brenowitz|first=EA|author2=Beecher MD |title=Song learning in birds: diversity and plasticity, opportunities and challenges|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2005|volume=28|issue=3|pages=127–132|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.01.004|pmid=15749165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the male zebra finch, vocal learning begins with a period of sensory acquisition or [[auditory learning]] where juveniles are exposed to the song of an adult male “tutor” at about posthatch day 30 to 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eales|first=LA|title=Song learning in zebra finches: some effects of song model availability on what is learnt and when|journal=Anim Behav|year=1985|volume=33|pages=1293–1300|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(85)80189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this stage, juveniles listen and memorize the song pattern of their tutor and produce subsong, characterized by the production of highly variable syllables and syllable sequences. Subsong is thought to be analogous to [[babbling]] in human infants. Subsequently during the sensorimotor learning phase at posthatch day 35 to 90, juveniles practice the motor commands required for song production and use auditory feedback to alter [[Bird vocalizations|vocalizations]] to match the song template. Songs during this period are plastic as specific syllables begin to emerge but are frequently in the wrong sequence, errors that are similar to phonological mistakes made by young children when learning a language. As the bird ages, its song becomes more stereotyped until at posthatch day 120 the song syllables and sequence are crystallized or fixed. At this point, the zebra finch can no longer learn new songs and thus sings this single song for the duration of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=AE|author2=Ten-Cate C |author3=Slater PJB |title=Early experience and plasticity of song in adult male zebra finches|journal=J Comp Psychol|year=1996|volume=110|pages=354–369|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.110.4.354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neural mechanisms behind the closing of the [[critical period]] remain unclear, but early deprivation of juveniles from their adult tutors has been shown to extend the [[critical period]] of song acquisition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aamodt|first=SM |author2=Nordeen EJ |author3=Nordeen KW|title=Early isolation from conspecic song does not affect the normal developmental decline of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor binding in an avian song nucleus|journal=Journal of Neurobiology|year=1995|volume=27|pages=76–84|doi=10.1002/neu.480270108}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Synapse selection” theories hypothesize that [[synaptic plasticity]] during the [[critical period]] is gradually reduced as [[dendritic spines]] are pruned through activity-dependent synaptic rearrangement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bischof|first=HJ|author2=Geissler E |author3=Rollenhagen A. |title=Limitations of the sensitive period for sexual imprinting: Neuroanatomical and behavioral experiments in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|year=2002|volume=133|pages=317–322|doi=10.1016/s0166-4328(02)00016-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pruning of [[dendritic spines]] in the LMAN song nucleus was delayed in isolated [[zebra finch]]es with extended [[critical periods]], suggesting that this form of synaptic reorganization may be important in closing the [[critical period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallhausser-Franke|first=E |author2=Nixdorf-Bergweiler BE |author3=DeVoogd TJ|title=Song isolation is associated with maintaining high spine fre- quencies on zebra Wnch 1MAN neurons|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=1995|volume=64|pages=25–35|doi=10.1006/nlme.1995.1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other studies have shown that birds reared normally as well as isolated juveniles have similar levels of dendritic pruning despite an extended [[critical period]] in the latter group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=JE|author2=Nordeen KW |author3=Nordeen EJ |title=Dissociation between extension of the sensitive period for avian vocal learning and dendritic spine loss in the song nucleus lMAN|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=2005|volume=83|pages=143–150|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2004.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that this theory does not completely explain [[critical period]] modulation.

Previous research has suggested that the length of the [[critical period]] may be linked to differential gene expression within song nuclei, thought to be caused by [[neurotransmitter]] binding of receptors during neural activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wada|first=K |author2=Sakaguchi H |author3=Jarvis ED |author4=Hagiwara M|title=Differential expression of glutamate receptors in avian neural pathways for learned vocalization|journal=J Comp Neurol|year=2004|volume=476|pages=44–64|doi=10.1002/cne.20201|pmc=2517240}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key area is the LMAN song nucleus, part of the specialized cortical-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop in the anterior forebrain pathway, which is essential for vocal plasticity.&lt;ref name="Schraff 1991 2896–2913"/&gt; While inducing deafness in songbirds usually disrupts the sensory phase of learning and leads to production of highly abnormal song structures, lesioning of LMAN in [[zebra finch]]es prevents this song deterioration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainard|first=MS|author2=Doupe AJ |title=Postlearning consolidation of birdsong: stabilizing effects of age and anterior forebrain lesions|journal=J Neurosci|year=2001|volume=21|pages=2501–2517}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the earlier development of stable song. One of the neurotransmitter receptors shown to affect LMAN is the [[NMDA receptor|N- methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor]] (NMDAR), which is required for learning and activity-dependent gene regulation in the post-synaptic neuron. Infusions of the [[NMDAR antagonist]] [[AP5|APV]] (R-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) into the LMAN song nucleus disrupts the [[critical period]] in the [[zebra finch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basham ME|first=ME|author2=Nordeen EJ |author3=Nordeen KW |title=Blockade of NMDA receptors in the anterior   forebrain impairs sensory acquisition in the zebra finch (Poephila guttata)|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=1996|volume=66|pages=295–304|doi=10.1006/nlme.1996.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[NMDAR]] density and [[mRNA]] levels of the NR1 subunit also decrease in LMAN during early song development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinrich|first=JE|author2=Singh TD|author3=Sohrabji F|author4=Nordeen KW|author5=Nordeen EJ|title=Developmental and hormonal regulation of NR2A mRNA in forebrain regions controlling avian vocal learning|journal=J.

===In humans===
[[File:Brain Comparisons.tiff|thumb|400px|Vocalization subsystems in complex-vocal learners and in limited-vocal learners or vocal non-learners: Direct and indirect pathways. The different subsystems for vocalization and their interconnectivity are illustrated using different colors. (A) Schematic of a songbird brain showing some connectivity of the four major song nuclei (HVC, RA, AreaX, and LMAN). (B) Human brain schematic showing the different proposed vocal subsystems. The learned vocalization subsystem consists of a primary motor cortex pathway (blue arrow) and a cortico-striatal-thalamic loop for learning vocalizations (white). Also shown is the limbic vocal subsystem that is broadly conserved in primates for producing innate vocalizations (black), and the motoneurons that control laryngeal muscles (red). (C) Known connectivity of a brainstem vocal system (not all connections shown) showing absence of forebrain song nuclei in vocal non-learning birds. (D) Known connectivity of limited-vocal learning monkeys (based on data in squirrel monkeys and macaques) showing presence of forebrain regions for innate vocalization (ACC, OFC, and amygdala) and also of a ventral premotor area (Area 6vr) of currently poorly understood function that is indirectly connected to nucleus ambiguous. The LMC in humans is directly connected with motoneurons in the nucleus ambiguus, which orchestrate the production of learned vocalizations. Only the direct pathway through the mammalian basal ganglia (ASt, anterior striatum; GPi, globus palidus, internal) is shown as this is the one most similar to AreaX connectivity in songbirds.

Humans seem to have analogous anterior and posterior vocal pathways which are implicated in speech production and learning. Parallel to the avian posterior vocal pathway mentioned above is the motor cortico-brainstem pathway. Within this pathway, the face motor cortex projects to the nucleus ambiguous of the medulla, which then projects to the muscles of the [[larynx]]. Humans also have a vocal pathway that is analogous to the avian anterior pathway. This pathway is a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortico loop which begins at a strip of the [[premotor cortex]], called the cortical strip, which is responsible for speech learning and syntax production. The cortical strip includes spans across five brain regions: the anterior [[insular cortex|insula]], [[Broca’s area]], the anterior dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior pre-supplementary motor area, and the [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. This cortical strip has projections to the anterior [[striatum]] which projects to the [[globus pallidus]] to the anterior dorsal [[thalamus]] back to the cortical strip. All of these regions are also involved in [[syntax]] and speech learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=ED|title=Neural systems for vocal learning in birds and humans: a synopsis|journal=Journal of Ornithology|year=2007|volume=148|issue=1|pages=35–44|doi=10.1007/s10336-007-0243-0|pmc=2726745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic applications to humans==
In addition to the similarities in the neurobiological circuits necessary for vocalizations between animal vocal learners and humans, there are also a few genetic similarities. The most prominent of these genetic links are the [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] genes, which code for forkhead box (FOX) proteins P1 and P2, respectively. [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are [[transcription factors]] which play a role in the development and maturation of the lungs, heart, and brain,&lt;ref name="FOXP1 and FOXP2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pariani|first=MJ|author2=Spenser, A|author3=Graham Jr, JM|author4=Rimoin, DL|title=A 785 kb deletion of 3p14.1p13 including the FOXP1 gene, associated with speech delay, contractures, hypertonia and blepharophimosis|journal=European Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2009|volume=52|issue=2–3|pages=123–127|doi=10.1016/j.ejmg.2009.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy" /&gt; and are also highly expressed in brain regions of the vocal learning pathway, including the [[basal ganglia]] and the [[frontal cortex]]. In these regions (i.e. the basal ganglia and frontal cortex), [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are thought to be essential for brain maturation and development of speech and language.&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vargha-Kahadem|first=F |author2=Gadian, DG |author3=Copp, A |author4=Mortimer, M|title=FOXP2 and the neuroanatomy of speech and language|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year=2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=131–138|doi=10.1038/nrn1605|pmid=15685218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthologues]] of [[FOXP2]] are found in a number of vertebrates including [[mice]] and [[songbirds]], and have been implicated in modulating [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of neural circuits. In fact, although mammals and birds are very distant relatives and diverged more than 300 million years ago, the [[FOXP2]] gene in [[zebra finch]]es and [[mice]] differs at only five [[amino acid]] positions, and differs between [[zebra finch]]es and [[humans]] at only eight [[amino acid]] positions. In addition, researchers have found that patterns of expression of [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] are amazingly similar in the human fetal brain and the [[songbird]].&lt;ref name="FOXP2 and Neuroanatomy" /&gt;

These similarities are especially interesting in the context of the aforementioned avian song circuit. [[FOXP2]] is expressed in the avian Area X, and is especially highly expressed in the [[striatum]] during the [[critical period]] of song plasticity in [[songbirds]]. In humans, [[FOXP2]] is highly expressed in the [[basal ganglia]], [[frontal cortex]], and [[insular cortex]], all thought to be important nodes in the human vocal pathway. Thus, mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene are proposed to have detrimental effects on human speech and language, such as grammar, language processing, and impaired movement of the mouth, lips, and tongue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=K|author2=Liu, F |author3=Hirokawa, K |author4=Takahashi, H |title=Expression of FOXP2, a gene involved in speech and language, in the developing and adult striatum|journal=Journal of Neuroscience Research|year=2003|volume=73|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1002/jnr.10638}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as potential detrimental effects on song learning in [[songbirds]]. Indeed, [[FOXP2]] was the first gene to be implicated in the cognition of speech and language in a family of individuals with a severe speech and language disorder.

Additionally, it has been suggested that due to the overlap of [[FOXP1]] and [[FOXP2]] expression in [[songbirds]] and humans, mutations in [[FOXP1]] may also result in speech and language abnormalities seen in individuals with mutations in [[FOXP2]].&lt;ref name="FOXP1 and FOXP2" /&gt;

These genetic links have important implications for studying the origin of language because [[FOXP2]] is so similar among vocal learners and humans, as well as important implications for understanding the [[etiology]] of certain speech and language disorders in humans.

Currently, no other genes have been linked as compellingly to vocal learning in animals or humans.

[[File:Ill-2 O3.jpg|thumb|X-rays start at ~0.008 nm and extend across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to ~8 nm, over which the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]].]]
'''X-ray astronomy''' is an observational branch of [[astronomy]] which deals with the study of [[X-ray]] observation and detection from [[astronomical object]]s. [[X-radiation]] is absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by [[Balloon-borne telescope|balloons]], [[sounding rocket]]s, and [[X-ray astronomy satellite|satellites]]. X-ray astronomy is the [[space science]] related to a type of [[space telescope]] that can see farther than standard light-absorption telescopes, such as the [[Mauna Kea Observatories]], via x-ray radiation.

[[X-ray generation|X-ray emission]] is expected from astronomical objects that contain extremely hot gases at temperatures from about a million [[kelvin]] (K) to hundreds of millions of kelvin (MK). Although X-rays have been observed emanating from the [[Sun]] since the 1940s, the discovery in 1962 of the first cosmic X-ray source was a surprise. This source is called [[Scorpius X-1]] (Sco X-1), the first X-ray source found in the [[constellation]] [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]. The X-ray emission of Scorpius X-1 is 10,000 times greater than its visual emission, whereas that of the Sun is about a million times less. In addition, the energy output in X-rays is 100,000 times greater than the total emission of the [[Sun]] in all [[wavelength]]s. Based on discoveries in this new field of X-ray astronomy, starting with Scorpius X-1, [[Riccardo Giacconi]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2002. It is now known that such X-ray sources as Sco X-1 are [[compact star]]s, such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s. Material falling into a black hole may emit X-rays, but the black hole itself does not. The energy source for the X-ray emission is [[gravity]]. Infalling gas and dust is heated by the strong [[gravitational fields]] of these and other celestial objects.

Many thousands of X-ray sources are known. In addition, the space between [[galaxy|galaxies]] in [[galaxy clusters]] is filled with a very hot, but very dilute gas at a temperature between 10 and 100 megakelvins (MK). The total amount of hot gas is five to ten times the total mass in the visible galaxies.

==Sounding rocket flights==
{{main|Sounding rocket}}
The first sounding rocket flights for X-ray research were accomplished at the [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]] with a [[V-2 rocket]] on January 28, 1949. A detector was placed in the [[nose cone]] section and the rocket was launched in a suborbital flight to an altitude just above the atmosphere.

X-rays from the Sun were detected by the U.S. [[Naval Research Laboratory]] Blossom experiment on board.&lt;ref name="rockooni"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology – Quarter 1 1949 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408082333/http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |archivedate=April 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Aerobee]] 150 rocket was launched on June 12, 1962 and it detected the first X-rays from other celestial sources (Scorpius X-1).&lt;ref name=Giacconi&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Giacconi R |title=Nobel Lecture: The dawn of x-ray astronomy |journal=Rev Mod Phys|date=2003 |volume=75|issue=3|page=995|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.995 |bibcode=2003RvMP...75..995G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest drawback to rocket flights is their very short duration (just a few minutes above the atmosphere before the rocket falls back to Earth) and their limited [[field of view]]. A rocket launched from the United States will not be able to see sources in the southern sky; a rocket launched from Australia will not be able to see sources in the northern sky.

===X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) project===
[[File:Nike-Black Brant VC XQC launch.gif|thumb|right|A launch of the Black Brant 8 Microcalorimeter (XQC-2) at the turn of the century is a part of the joint undertaking by the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] known as the X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) project.]]
In astronomy, the [[interstellar medium]] (or '''ISM''') is the gas and [[cosmic dust]] that pervade interstellar space: the [[matter]] that exists between the [[star system]]s within a galaxy. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding [[intergalactic medium]]. The interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute (by terrestrial standards) mixture of [[ion]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, larger dust grains, [[cosmic ray]]s, and (galactic) magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Spitzer&gt;{{Cite book|author=Spitzer L |date=1978 |title=Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-29335-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], is the '''interstellar radiation field'''.

Of interest is the hot ionized medium (HIM) consisting of a [[coronal cloud]] ejection from star surfaces at 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; K which emits X-rays. The ISM is [[turbulence|turbulent]] and full of structure on all spatial scales. [[Star formation|Stars are born]] deep inside large complexes of [[molecular clouds]], typically a few [[parsec]]s in size. During their lives and deaths, [[star]]s interact physically with the ISM. [[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures are [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas. The Sun is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].

To measure the spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission from the interstellar medium over the energy range 0.07 to 1 keV, [[NASA]] launched a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant 9]] from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico on May 1, 2008.&lt;ref name=McCammon&gt;{{cite web|author=Wright B |title=36.223 UH MCCAMMON/UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story83.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511111524/http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story83.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Principal Investigator for the mission is Dr. Dan McCammon of the [[University of Wisconsin]].

Balloon flights can carry instruments to altitudes of up to 40&amp;nbsp;km above sea level, where they are above as much as 99.997% of the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes, balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer. However, even at such altitudes, much of the X-ray [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] is still absorbed. X-rays with energies less than 35 keV (5,600 aJ) cannot reach balloons. On July 21, 1964, the [[Crab Nebula]] supernova remnant was discovered to be a hard X-ray (15 – 60 keV) source by a scintillation counter flown on a balloon launched from [[Palestine, Texas]], USA. This was likely the first balloon-based detection of X-rays from a discrete cosmic X-ray source.&lt;ref name=headates1&gt;{{cite web|author=Drake SA |title=A Brief History of High-Energy Astronomy: 1960–1964 |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/headates/1960.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-energy focusing telescope (HEFT) is a balloon-borne experiment to image astrophysical sources in the hard X-ray (20–100 keV) band.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Harrison FA|title=Development of the High-Energy Focusing Telescope (HEFT) balloon experiment|date=2000 |journal=Proc SPIE|volume=4012 |page=693 |doi=10.1117/12.391608|series=X-Ray Optics, Instruments, and Missions III|editor1-last=Truemper|editor1-first=Joachim E|last2=Boggs|first2=Steven E.|last3=Bolotnikov|first3=Aleksey E.|last4=Christensen|first4=Finn E.|last5=Cook Iii|first5=Walter R.|last6=Craig|first6=William W.|last7=Hailey|first7=Charles J.|last8=Jimenez-Garate|first8=Mario A.|last9=Mao|first9=Peter H.|displayauthors=8|editor2-last=Aschenbach|editor2-first=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maiden flight took place in May 2005 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The angular resolution of HEFT is ~1.5'. Rather than using a grazing-angle [[X-ray telescope]], HEFT makes use of a novel [[tungsten]]-silicon multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity of nested grazing-incidence mirrors beyond 10 keV. HEFT has an energy resolution of 1.0 keV [[full width at half maximum]] at 60 keV. HEFT was launched for a 25-hour balloon flight in May 2005. The instrument performed within specification and observed [[SN 1054|Tau X-1]], the Crab Nebula.

===High-resolution gamma-ray and hard X-ray spectrometer (HIREGS)===
A balloon-borne experiment called the High-resolution gamma-ray and hard X-ray spectrometer (HIREGS) observed X-ray and gamma-rays emissions from the Sun and other astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="hiregs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/balloon/|title=HIREGS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feffer|first=Paul|year=1996|title=Solar energetic ion and electron limits from High Resolution Gamma-ray and Hard X-ray Spectrometer (HIREGS) Observations|url=|journal=Solar Physics|volume=171|issue=2|pages=419–445|doi=10.1023/A:1004911511905|bibcode=1997SoPh..171..419F}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched from [[McMurdo Station]], [[Antarctica]] in December 1991 and 1992.

==Rockoons==
{{main|Rockoon}}
[[File:Deacon Rockoon.jpg|thumb|Navy Deacon rockoon photographed just after a shipboard launch in July 1956.]]
The [[rockoon]] (a [[portmanteau]] of [[rocket]] and [[balloon]]) was a [[solid fuel rocket]] that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket did not have to move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.

The original concept of "rockoons" was developed by Cmdr. Lee Lewis, Cmdr. G. Halvorson, S. F. Singer, and [[James A. Van Allen]] during the Aerobee rocket firing cruise of the {{USS|Norton Sound|AVM-1|6}} on March 1, 1949.&lt;ref name="rockooni"/&gt;

From July 17 to July 27, 1956, the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) shipboard launched eight [[Deacon (rocket)|Deacon]] rockoons for solar [[ultraviolet]] and X-ray observations at ~30° N ~121.6° W, southwest of [[San Clemente Island]], apogee: 120&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=nrl10&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology – Quarter 3 1956 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19563.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-ray astronomy satellite==
{{main| X-ray astronomy satellite}}
X-ray astronomy satellites study X-ray emissions from celestial objects. Satellites, which can detect and transmit data about the X-ray emissions are deployed as part of branch of space science known as X-ray astronomy. Satellites are needed because X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites.

==X-ray telescopes and mirrors==
{{main|X-ray telescope}}
[[File:Xrtlayout.gif|thumb|The [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] contains a grazing incidence Wolter I telescope (XRT) to focus X-rays onto a state-of-the-art CCD.]]
X-ray telescopes (XRTs) have varying directionality or imaging ability based on glancing angle reflection rather than refraction or large deviation reflection.&lt;ref name=swift&gt;{{cite web |title=SWIFT X-ray mirrors |url=http://swift.sonoma.edu/about_swift/instruments/xrt.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chandra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/telescope_system.html |title=Chandra X-ray focusing mirrors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This limits them to much narrower fields of view than visible or UV telescopes. The mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil.&lt;ref name=xrayoptics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astrophysics.gsfc.nasa.gov/xrays/MirrorLab/xoptics.html |title=X-ray optics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first X-ray telescope in astronomy was used to observe the Sun. The first X-ray picture (taken with a grazing incidence telescope) of the Sun was taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960 the very first X-ray image of the sun was taken using a pinhole camera on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=R. L.|author2=Chubb, T.

The utilization of X-ray mirrors for extrasolar X-ray astronomy simultaneously requires:
* the ability to determine the location at the arrival of an X-ray photon in two dimensions and
* a reasonable detection efficiency.

==X-ray astronomy detectors==
[[File:Proportional Counter Array RXTE.jpg|thumb|right|Proportional Counter Array on the [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (RXTE) satellite.]]
{{main|X-ray astronomy detectors}}
X-ray astronomy detectors have been designed and configured primarily for energy and occasionally for wavelength detection using a variety of techniques usually limited to the technology of the time.

X-ray detectors collect individual X-rays (photons of X-ray electromagnetic radiation) and count the number of photons collected (intensity), the energy (0.12 to 120 keV) of the photons collected, wavelength (~0.008 to 8&amp;nbsp;nm), or how fast the photons are detected (counts per hour), to tell us about the object that is emitting them.

==Astrophysical sources of X-rays==

Several types of astrophysical objects emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays, from [[galaxy cluster]]s, through black holes in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) to galactic objects such as [[supernova remnant]]s, stars, and [[binary star]]s containing a [[white dwarf]] ([[cataclysmic variable star]]s and [[super soft X-ray source]]s), neutron star or black hole ([[X-ray binaries]]). Some [[solar system]] bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the [[Moon]], although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed [[X-ray background]]. The X-ray continuum can arise from [[bremsstrahlung]], [[Thermal radiation|black-body radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], or what is called [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton scattering]] of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morrison P |title=Extrasolar X-ray Sources |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=1967 |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=325 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.05.090167.001545 |bibcode=1967ARA&amp;A...5..325M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[intermediate-mass X-ray binary]] (IMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole. The other component is an intermediate mass star.&lt;ref name=Podsiadlowski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Podsiadlowski P |author2=Rappaport S |author3=Pfahl E |title=Evolutionary Binary Sequences for Low- and Intermediate-Mass X-ray Binaries |date=2001 |doi=10.1086/324686 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=565 |issue=2 |pages=1107 |arxiv=astro-ph/0107261|bibcode = 2002ApJ...565.1107P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hercules X-1]] is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star (HZ Herculis) probably due to Roche lobe overflow. X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, {{Solar mass|~2|link=y}}, between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.&lt;ref name=Priedhorsky&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Priedhorsky WC|author2= Holt SS |title=Long-term cycles in cosmic X-ray sources |journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=45|date=1987|issue=3–4 |page=291|doi=10.1007/BF00171997 |bibcode=1987SSRv...45..291P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial X-ray sources==
{{main|Astrophysical X-ray source}}
The [[celestial sphere]] has been divided into 88 constellations. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) constellations are areas of the sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be [[galaxies]] or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are [[pulsar]]s. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the [[universe]] as a whole, and how these affect us on [[Earth]]. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy has been around for a long time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends to focus on the physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.

[[File:Orion-Eridanus Bubble.gif|thumb|right|This [[ROSAT]] PSPC false-color image is of a portion of a nearby stellar wind superbubble (the [[Orion-Eridanus Superbubble]]) stretching across [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].]]
Within the constellations Orion and Eridanus and stretching across them is a soft X-ray "hot spot" known as the [[Orion-Eridanus Superbubble]], the '''Eridanus Soft X-ray Enhancement''', or simply the '''Eridanus Bubble''', a 25° area of interlocking arcs of Hα emitting filaments. Soft X-rays are emitted by hot gas (T ~ 2–3 MK) in the interior of the superbubble. This bright object forms the background for the "shadow" of a filament of gas and dust. The filament is shown by the overlaid contours, which represent 100 micrometre emission from dust at a temperature of about 30 K as measured by [[IRAS]]. Here the filament absorbs soft X-rays between 100 and 300 eV, indicating that the hot gas is located behind the filament. This filament may be part of a shell of neutral gas that surrounds the hot bubble. Its interior is energized by [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light and stellar winds from hot stars in the Orion OB1 association. These stars energize a superbubble about 1200 lys across which is observed in the visual (Hα) and X-ray portions of the spectrum.

==Proposed (future) X-ray observatory satellites==
{{main| X-ray astronomy satellite}}
There are several projects that are proposed for X-ray observatory satellites. See main article link above.

==Explorational X-ray astronomy==
[[File:Ulysses 2 orbit.jpg|thumb|right|Ulysses' second orbit: it arrived at [[Jupiter]] on February 8, 1992, for a [[swing-by maneuver]] that increased its inclination to the [[ecliptic]] by 80.2 degrees.]]
Usually observational astronomy is considered to occur on Earth's surface (or beneath it in [[neutrino astronomy]]). The idea of limiting observation to Earth includes orbiting the Earth. As soon as the observer leaves the cozy confines of Earth, the observer becomes a deep space explorer.&lt;ref name=Kawakatsu&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kawakatsu Y |title=Concept study on Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=Dec 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11–12 |pages=1019–28 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576507001300|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.12.019 |bibcode = 2007AcAau..61.1019K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for [[Explorer 1]] and [[Explorer 3]] and the earlier satellites in the series,&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|author=Smith W |title=Explorer Series of Spacecraft |url=https://history.nasa.gov/explorer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually if a probe is going to be a deep space explorer it leaves the Earth or an orbit around the Earth.

For a satellite or space probe to qualify as a deep space X-ray astronomer/explorer or "astronobot"/explorer, all it needs to carry aboard is an XRT or X-ray detector and leave Earth orbit.

[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] was launched October 6, 1990, and reached Jupiter for its "[[Gravity assist|gravitational slingshot]]" in February 1992. It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 and crossed the ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; erg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1 nJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from the sum of the 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During 'wait' mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest integration time being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.

The Ulysses soft X-ray detectors consisted of 2.5-mm thick × 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area Si surface barrier detectors. A 100&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; beryllium foil front window rejected the low energy X-rays and defined a conical FOV of 75° (half-angle). These detectors were passively cooled and operate in the temperature range −35 to −55&amp;nbsp;°C. This detector had 6 energy channels, covering the range 5–20 keV.

==Theoretical X-ray astronomy==
Theoretical X-ray astronomy is a branch of [[theoretical astronomy]] that deals with the theoretical [[astrophysics]] and theoretical [[astrochemistry]] of [[X-ray generation]], emission, and detection as applied to [[astronomical object]]s.

Like [[theoretical astrophysics]], theoretical X-ray astronomy uses a wide variety of tools which include [[Mathematical model|analytical model]]s to approximate the behavior of a possible X-ray source and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulation]]s to approximate the observational data. Once potential observational consequences are available they can be compared with experimental observations. Observers can look for data that refutes a model or helps in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Most of the topics in [[astrophysics]], [[astrochemistry]], [[astrometry]], and other fields that are branches of [[astronomy]] studied by theoreticians involve X-rays and X-ray sources. Many of the beginnings for a theory can be found in an Earth-based laboratory where an X-ray source is built and studied.

===Dynamos===
{{main|Dynamo theory}}
{{See also|Solar dynamo}}
Dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a [[magnetic field]]. This theory is used to explain the presence of anomalously long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies. If some of the stellar magnetic fields are really induced by dynamos, then field strength might be associated with rotation rate.&lt;ref name=Trimble&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Trimble V |title=White dwarfs in the 1990s |journal=Bull Astron Soc India|date=1999 |volume=27 |page=549 |bibcode=1999BASI...27..549T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical models===
[[File:NASA-2015IYL-MultiPix-ChandraXRayObservatory-20150122.jpg|thumb|right|Images released to celebrate the [[International Year of Light|International Year of Light 2015]]&lt;br&gt;([[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]]).]]
From the observed X-ray spectrum, combined with spectral emission results for other wavelength ranges, an astronomical model addressing the likely source of X-ray emission can be constructed. For example, with Scorpius X-1 the X-ray spectrum steeply drops off as X-ray energy increases up to 20 keV, which is likely for a thermal-plasma mechanism.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; In addition, there is no radio emission, and the visible continuum is roughly what would be expected from a hot plasma fitting the observed X-ray flux.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The plasma could be a [[coronal cloud]] of a central object or a transient plasma, where the energy source is unknown, but could be related to the idea of a close binary.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

In the Crab Nebula X-ray spectrum there are three features that differ greatly from Scorpius X-1: its spectrum is much harder, its source diameter is in [[light-year]]s (ly)s, not [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), and its radio and optical synchrotron emission are strong.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Its overall X-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma. However, the Crab Nebula appears as an X-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma, where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion, obtained from the unknown source.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

The [[Astrophysical X-ray source#X-ray dark stars|"Dividing Line"]] as [[giant star]]s evolve to become [[red giant]]s also coincides with the Wind and Coronal Dividing Lines.&lt;ref name=Kashyap&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kashyap V|author2= Rosner R|author3=Harnden FR Jr.|author4=Maggio A|author5=Micela G|author6=Sciortino S |title=X-ray emission on hybird stars: ROSAT observations of alpha Trianguli Australis and IOTA Aurigae |journal=Astrophys J|date=1994|volume=431 |page=402|doi=10.1086/174494 |bibcode=1994ApJ...431..402K}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the drop in X-ray emission across these dividing lines, a number of models have been proposed:
# low transition region densities, leading to low emission in coronae,
# high-density wind extinction of coronal emission,
# only cool coronal loops become stable,
# changes in a magnetic field structure to that an open topology, leading to a decrease of magnetically confined plasma, or
# changes in the magnetic dynamo character, leading to the disappearance of stellar fields leaving only small-scale, turbulence-generated fields among red giants.&lt;ref name=Kashyap/&gt;

==Analytical X-ray astronomy==
Analytical X-ray astronomy is applied to an astronomy puzzle in an attempt to provide an acceptable solution. Consider the following puzzle.

[[High-mass X-ray binaries]] (HMXBs) are composed of OB supergiant companion stars and compact objects, usually [[neutron stars]] (NS) or [[black holes]] (BH). Supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs) are HMXBs in which the compact objects orbit massive companions with orbital periods of a few days (3–15 d), and in circular (or slightly eccentric) orbits. SGXBs show typical the hard X-ray spectra of accreting [[pulsar]]s and most show strong absorption as obscured HMXBs. X-ray luminosity (''L''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) increases up to 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; watts).

The mechanism triggering the different temporal behavior observed between the classical SGXBs and the recently discovered [[X-ray transient#Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs)|supergiant fast X-ray transients]] (SFXT)s is still debated.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zurita Heras JA|author2= Chaty S |title=Discovery of an eccentric 30 day period in the supergiant X-ray binary SAX J1818.6–1703 with INTEGRAL |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2009 |volume=493|issue=1 |page=L1|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200811179 |bibcode=2009A&amp;A...493L...1Z|arxiv = 0811.2941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aim: use the discovery of long orbits (&gt;15 d) to help discriminate between emission models and perhaps bring constraints on the models.

Method: analyze archival data on various SGXBs such as has been obtained by [[INTEGRAL]] for candidates exhibiting long orbits. Build short- and long-term light curves. Perform a timing analysis in order to study the temporal behavior of each candidate on different time scales.

Compare various astronomical models:
* direct spherical accretion
* Roche-Lobe overflow via an accretion disk on the compact object.

Draw some conclusions: for example, the SGXB SAX J1818.6-1703 was discovered by [[BeppoSAX]] in 1998, identified as a SGXB of spectral type between O9I−B1I, which also displayed short and bright flares and an unusually very low quiescent level leading to its classification as a SFXT.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt; The analysis indicated an unusually long orbital period: 30.0 ± 0.2 d and an elapsed accretion phase of ~6 d implying an elliptical orbit and possible supergiant spectral type between B0.5-1I with eccentricities e ~ 0.3–0.4.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt; The large variations in the X-ray flux can be explained through accretion of macro-clumps formed within the stellar wind.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt;

Choose which model seems to work best: for SAX J1818.6-1703 the analysis best fits the model that predicts SFXTs behave as SGXBs with different orbital parameters; hence, different temporal behavior.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt;

==Stellar X-ray astronomy==

X-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mewe1/&gt; The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using [[HEAO 1]] required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

In 1978, α Cen was identified as a low-activity coronal source.&lt;ref name=Telleschi&gt;{{cite web|author=Telleschi AS |title=Coronal Evolution of Solar-Like Stars in Star-Forming Regions and the Solar Neighborhood |url=http://www.astro.phys.ethz.ch/papers/atellesc/diss/diss.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the operation of the [[Einstein Observatory|Einstein]] observatory, X-ray emission was recognized as a characteristic feature common to a wide range of stars covering essentially the whole Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.&lt;ref name=Telleschi/&gt; The Einstein initial survey led to significant insights:
*X-ray sources abound among all types of stars, across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and across most stages of evolution,
*the X-ray luminosities and their distribution along the main sequence were not in agreement with the long-favored acoustic heating theories, but were now interpreted as the effect of magnetic coronal heating, and
*stars that are otherwise similar reveal large differences in their X-ray output if their rotation period is different.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

To fit the medium-resolution spectrum of UX Ari, subsolar abundances were required.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

Stellar X-ray astronomy is contributing toward a deeper understanding of
*magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic dynamos,
*the release of energy in tenuous astrophysical plasmas through various plasma-physical processes, and
*the interactions of high-energy radiation with the stellar environment.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

Current wisdom has it that the massive coronal main sequence stars are late-A or early F stars, a conjecture that is supported both by observation and by theory.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Young, low-mass stars===
{{main|pre-main-sequence star}}
[[File:Chandra_X-ray_View_of_Orion.jpg|thumb|right|A Chandra X-ray image of the [[Trapezium Cluster|Cluster]] of [[star formation|newly formed stars]] in the [[Orion Nebula]].]]
Newly formed stars are known as [[pre-main-sequence star]]s during the stage of stellar evolution before they reach the [[main-sequence]]. Stars in this stage (ages &lt;10 million years) produce X-rays in their stellar coronae. However, their X-ray emission is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; times stronger than for main-sequence stars of similar masses.&lt;ref name=preibisch05&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Preibisch | first = T. | display-authors = etal | year= 2005| title = The Origin of T Tauri X-Ray Emission: New Insights from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project | journal = Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume = 160 | issue =2 | pages = 401–422 | doi = 10.1086/432891| bibcode = 2005ApJS..160..401P|arxiv = astro-ph/0506526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray emission as an indicator of stellar youth is important for studies of star-forming regions. Most star-forming regions in the Milky Way Galaxy are projected on [[Zone of Avoidance|Galactic-Plane fields]] with numerous unrelated field stars. It is often impossible to distinguish members of a young stellar cluster from field-star contaminants using optical and infrared images alone. X-ray emission can easily penetrate moderate absorption from molecular clouds, and can be used to identify candidate cluster members.&lt;ref name=feigelson13&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Feigelson | first = E.

===Unstable winds===
Given the lack of a significant outer convection zone, theory predicts the absence of a magnetic dynamo in earlier A stars.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; In early stars of spectral type O and B, shocks developing in unstable winds are the likely source of X-rays.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Coolest M dwarfs===
Beyond spectral type M5, the classical αω dynamo can no longer operate as the internal structure of dwarf stars changes significantly: they become fully convective.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; As a distributed (or α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) dynamo may become relevant, both the magnetic flux on the surface and the topology of the magnetic fields in the corona should systematically change across this transition, perhaps resulting in some discontinuities in the X-ray characteristics around spectral class dM5.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; However, observations do not seem to support this picture: long-time lowest-mass X-ray detection, VB 8 (M7e V), has shown steady emission at levels of X-ray luminosity (''L''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; W) and flares up to an order of magnitude higher.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; Comparison with other late M dwarfs shows a rather continuous trend.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Strong X-ray emission from Herbig Ae/Be stars===
{{main|Herbig Ae/Be star}}
Herbig Ae/Be stars are pre-main sequence stars. As to their X-ray emission properties, some are
* reminiscent of hot stars,
* others point to coronal activity as in cool stars, in particular the presence of flares and very high temperatures.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The nature of these strong emissions has remained controversial with models including
* unstable stellar winds,
* colliding winds,
* magnetic coronae,
* disk coronae,
* wind-fed magnetospheres,
* accretion shocks,
* the operation of a shear dynamo,
* the presence of unknown late-type companions.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===K giants===
The FK Com stars are giants of spectral type K with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity. Their X-ray coronae are among the most luminous (''L''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; W) and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 MK.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; However, the current popular hypothesis involves a merger of a close binary system in which the orbital angular momentum of the companion is transferred to the primary.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

[[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] is the brightest star in the constellation [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], despite its Beta designation, and the 17th brightest in the sky. Pollux is a giant orange K star that makes an interesting color contrast with its white "twin", Castor. Evidence has been found for a hot, outer, magnetically supported corona around Pollux, and the star is known to be an X-ray emitter.&lt;ref name=Hatzes&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=8|author=Hatzes AP|author2=Cochran WD|author3=Endl M|author4=Guenther EW|author5=Saar SH|author6=Walker GAH|author7=Yang S|author8=Hartmann M|author9=Esposito M|author10=Paulson DB|author11=Döllinger MP |title=Confirmation of the planet hypothesis for the long-period radial velocity variations of β Geminorum |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2006 |volume=457|issue=1 |page=335|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20065445 |bibcode=2006A&amp;A...457..335H|arxiv = astro-ph/0606517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ECARmulticolor4.tnl.jpg|thumb|right|Classified as a [[Peculiar star]], Eta Carinae exhibits a superstar at its center as seen in this image from [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Credit: Chandra Science Center and NASA.]]
New X-ray observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] show three distinct structures: an outer, horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter, a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter, and a hot central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show. The outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago. These three structures around [[Eta Carinae]] are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure. "The Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X-rays," says Prof. Kris Davidson of the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=Horack&gt;{{cite web|title=Chandra Takes X-ray Image of Repeat Offender |url=https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast08oct99_1.htm |date=October 8, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson is principal investigator for the Eta Carina observations by the [[Hubble Space telescope]]. "In the most popular theory, X-rays are made by colliding gas streams from two stars so close together that they'd look like a point source to us. But what happens to gas streams that escape to farther distances? The extended hot stuff in the middle of the new image gives demanding new conditions for any theory to meet."&lt;ref name=Horack/&gt;

==Amateur X-ray astronomy==
{{main|Amateur X-ray astronomy}}
Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. The [[United States Air Force Academy]] (USAFA) is the home of the US's only undergraduate satellite program, and has and continues to develop the FalconLaunch sounding rockets.&lt;ref name=Helms&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of Astronautics|title=World's first astronautics department celebrates 50 years|date=2008|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123089260|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212204116/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123089260|archivedate=December 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to any direct amateur efforts to put X-ray astronomy payloads into space, there are opportunities that allow student-developed experimental payloads to be put on board commercial sounding rockets as a free-of-charge ride.&lt;ref name=Blaylock&gt;{{cite web|author=Blaylock E |title=AFRL Signs EPA to Educate and Inspire Future Aerospace Professionals |url=http://www.wpafb.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123110810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are major limitations to amateurs observing and reporting experiments in X-ray astronomy: the cost of building an amateur rocket or balloon to place a detector high enough and the cost of appropriate parts to build a suitable X-ray detector.

In 1927, E.O. Hulburt of the [[US Naval Research Laboratory]] and associates [[Gregory Breit]] and [[Merle A. Tuve]] of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] explored the possibility of equipping [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. "Two years later, he proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere, including detection of ultraviolet radiation and X-rays at high altitudes".&lt;ref name=Spacelab2&gt;{{cite web|title=Spacelab 2 NRL Looks at the Sun |url=http://wwwsolar.nrl.navy.mil/sl2_pub.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, the presence of a very hot, tenuous gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; The Sun has been known to be surrounded by a hot tenuous corona.&lt;ref name=Grottian&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Grottian W |journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=27 |page=214|doi=10.1007/BF01488890|title=Zur Frage der Deutung der Linien im Spektrum der Sonnenkorona|date=1939|issue=13|bibcode = 1939NW.....27..214G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The beginning of the search for X-ray sources from above the Earth's atmosphere was on [[Spaceflight before 1951|August 5, 1948 12:07]] GMT. A US Army (formerly German) [[V-2 rocket]] as part of [[Hermes project|Project Hermes]] was launched from [[White Sands Proving Grounds]]. The first solar X-rays were recorded by T. Burnight.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Keller CU |title=X-rays from the Sun |journal=Cell Mol Life Sci|date=1995 |volume=51|issue=7 |page=710|doi=10.1007/BF01941268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the sensitivity of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of X-ray astronomy. In addition, the ability to focus X-rays has developed enormously—allowing the production of high-quality images of many fascinating celestial objects.

==Major questions in X-ray astronomy==
As X-ray astronomy uses a major spectral probe to peer into source, it is a valuable tool in efforts to understand many puzzles.

===Stellar magnetic fields===
Magnetic fields are ubiquitous among stars, yet we do not understand precisely why, nor have we fully understood the bewildering variety of plasma physical mechanisms that act in stellar environments.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; Some stars, for example, seem to have magnetic fields, [[fossil stellar magnetic field]]s left over from their period of formation, while others seem to generate the field anew frequently.

===Extrasolar X-ray source astrometry===
{{main|Extrasolar X-ray source astrometry}}
With the initial detection of an extrasolar X-ray source, the first question usually asked is "What is the source?" An extensive search is often made in other wavelengths such as visible or radio for possible coincident objects. Many of the verified X-ray locations still do not have readily discernible sources. X-ray [[astrometry]] becomes a serious concern that results in ever greater demands for finer [[angular resolution]] and [[Radiance|spectral radiance]].

There are inherent difficulties in making X-ray/optical, X-ray/radio, and X-ray/X-ray identifications based solely on positional coincidents, especially with handicaps in making identifications, such as the large uncertainties in positional determinants made from balloons and rockets, poor source separation in the crowded region toward the galactic center, source variability, and the multiplicity of source nomenclature.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thomas RM|author2=Davison PJN |title=A comment on X-ray source identifications |journal=Astron Soc Australia, Proc|date=1974 |volume=2 |page=290|bibcode=1974PASAu...2..290T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X‐ray source counterparts to stars can be identified by calculating the angular separation between source centroids and position of the star. The maximum allowable separation is a compromise between a larger value to identify as many real matches as possible and a smaller value to minimize the probability of spurious matches. "An adopted matching criterion of 40" finds nearly all possible X‐ray source matches while keeping the probability of any spurious matches in the sample to 3%."&lt;ref name=Gaidos&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gaidos EJ |title=Nearby Young Solar Analogs.

===Solar X-ray astronomy===
{{Main|Solar X-ray astronomy}}
All of the detected X-ray sources at, around, or near the [[Sun]] appear to be associated with processes in the [[corona]], which is its outer atmosphere.

====Coronal heating problem====
In the area of solar X-ray astronomy, there is the [[Corona#Coronal heating problem|coronal heating problem]]. The [[photosphere]] of the Sun has an effective temperature of 5,570 K&lt;ref name=Massey&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Massey P|author2= Silva DR|author3=Levesque EM|author4=Plez B|author5=Olsen KAG|author6=Clayton GC|author7=Meynet G|author8=Maeder A |title=Red Supergiants in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) |journal=Astrophys J |volume=703|date=2009|issue=1 |page=420|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/703/1/420 |bibcode=2009ApJ...703..420M|arxiv = 0907.3767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; yet its corona has an average temperature of 1–2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Erdèlyi R|author2=Ballai, I |title=Heating of the solar and stellar coronae: a review |date=2007|journal=Astron Nachr|volume=328|issue=8|page=726|doi=10.1002/asna.200710803|bibcode=2007AN....328..726E}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hottest regions are 8–20 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; K.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat [[Heat conduction|conduction]] from the photosphere.&lt;ref name=Russell2001&gt;{{Cite book|author=Russell CT |title=Space Weather (Geophysical Monograph) |date=2001 |publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]] |chapter=Solar wind and interplanetary magnetic filed: A tutorial |editor=Song, Paul |editor2=Singer, Howard J. |editor3=Siscoe, George L. |isbn=978-0-87590-984-4|pages=73–88|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/SolWindTutorial.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; The first is [[wave]] heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat.&lt;ref name=Alfven&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Alfvén H |title=Magneto-hydrodynamic waves, and the heating of the solar corona |bibcode=1947MNRAS.107..211A|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=107|issue=2 |page=211 |date=1947 |doi=10.1093/mnras/107.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is [[magnetic field|magnetic]] heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through [[magnetic reconnection]] in the form of large [[solar flare]]s and myriad similar but smaller events—[[nanoflares]].&lt;ref name=Parker2&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Parker EN |title=Nanoflares and the solar X-ray corona|journal=Astrophys J|volume=330 |page=474 |date=1988 |doi=10.1086/166485 |bibcode=1988ApJ...330..474P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except [[Alfvén wave]]s have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.&lt;ref name=Sturrock&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sturrock PA|author2=Uchida Y |title=Coronal heating by stochastic magnetic pumping|journal=Astrophys J|volume=246|page=331 |date=1981 |doi=10.1086/158926 |bibcode=1981ApJ...246..331S|hdl=2060/19800019786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt;

====Coronal mass ejection====
A [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of electrons and [[proton]]s (in addition to small quantities of heavier elements such as helium, oxygen, and iron), plus the entraining coronal closed magnetic field regions. Evolution of these closed magnetic structures in response to various photospheric motions over different time scales (convection, differential rotation, meridional circulation) somehow leads to the CME.&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gopalswamy N|author2=Mikic Z|author3=Maia D|author4=Alexander D|author5=Cremades H|author6=Kaufmann P|author7=Tripathi D|author8= Wang YM |title=The pre-CME Sun |journal=Space Science Reviews|date=2006 |volume=123|issue=1–3 |page=303|doi=10.1007/s11214-006-9020-2|bibcode = 2006SSRv..123..303G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs.

The soft X-ray sigmoid (an S-shaped intensity of soft X-rays) is an observational manifestation of the connection between coronal structure and CME production.&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy/&gt; "Relating the sigmoids at X-ray (and other) wavelengths to magnetic structures and current systems in the solar atmosphere is the key to understanding their relationship to CMEs."&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy/&gt;

The first detection of a Coronal mass ejection (CME) as such was made on December 1, 1971 by R. Tousey of the US Naval Research Laboratory using [[OSO 7]].&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite web|title=R.A.Howard, A Historical Perspective on Coronal Mass Ejections |url=http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/summerschool/lectures/vourlidas/AV_intro2CMEs/additional%20material/corona_history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier observations of '''coronal transients''' or even phenomena observed visually during [[solar eclipses]] are now understood as essentially the same thing.

The largest geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a "prehistoric" CME, coincided with the first-observed solar flare, in 1859. The flare was observed visually by [[Richard Christopher Carrington]] and the [[geomagnetic storm]] was observed with the recording magnetograph at [[Kew Gardens]]. The same instrument recorded a '''crotchet''', an instantaneous perturbation of the Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays (by [[Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen|Roentgen]]) and the recognition of the [[ionosphere]] (by [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly|Kennelly]] and [[Heaviside]]).

==Exotic X-ray sources==
{{main|Astrophysical X-ray source}}
{{See also|Be X-ray binaries}}
A [[microquasar]] is a smaller cousin of a [[quasar]] that is a radio emitting [[X-ray binary]], with an often resolvable pair of radio jets.
[[LS I +61 303|LSI+61°303]] is a periodic, radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma-ray source, CG135+01.
Observations are revealing a growing number of recurrent [[X-ray transient]]s, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB [[supergiant]]s and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs).
Observations made by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that surrounds [[Messier 87]]. A '''[[magnetar]]''' is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s.

==X-ray dark stars==

During the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images at right, at times the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable. [[Betelgeuse]], on the other hand, appears to be always X-ray dark. Hardly any X-rays are emitted by red giants. There is a rather abrupt onset of X-ray emission around spectral type A7-F0, with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class F. Altair is spectral type A7V and Vega is A0V. Altair's total X-ray luminosity is at least an order of magnitude larger than the X-ray luminosity for Vega. The outer convection zone of early F stars is expected to be very shallow and absent in A-type dwarfs, yet the acoustic flux from the interior reaches a maximum for late A and early F stars provoking investigations of magnetic activity in A-type stars along three principal lines. Chemically peculiar stars of spectral type Bp or Ap are appreciable magnetic radio sources, most Bp/Ap stars remain undetected, and of those reported early on as producing X-rays only few of them can be identified as probably single stars. X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit. "Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area."

As X-ray detectors have become more sensitive, they have observed that some planets and other normally X-ray non-luminescent celestial objects under certain conditions emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays.

===Comet Lulin===

NASA's [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] satellite was monitoring [[Comet Lulin]] as it closed to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray images of a comet. "The solar wind—a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun—interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the Sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite web|author=Reddy F |title=NASA's Swift Spies Comet Lulin |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/lulin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
