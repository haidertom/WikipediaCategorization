'''Adolphe Schloss''' (10 August 1842 – 31 December 1910) was a French art collector.

Schloss was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/dealer-blasts-french-art-plunder-case-article-1.849145 New York Daily News: "DEALER BLASTS FRENCH IN ART PLUNDER CASE" by Mike Claffey] September 26, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Furth, Lower Bavaria]]. He married Mathilde Lucie Haas and together they collected 333 works from the Northern and Southern Netherlands that became notable as a collection between World War I and World War II. They held a gallery at salon Adolphe Schloss residence 38, avenue Henri Martin, [[Paris]]. After Adolphe's death there, his collection became the property of his wife Lucie, who died in 1938 and the collection was left to their children Marguerite, Henry, Juliette and Lucien. They moved the collection to Chambon for safekeeping during the war, where it was looted by the Vichy government in 1943. Of the 333 objects, only 230 were actually offered to the Hitler museum and 49 were saved for France and given to the [[Louvre museum|Louvre]]. After the war all were lost, but gradually 148 objects could be rediscovered.

A '''banduryst''' ({{lang-uk|бандури́ст}}) is a person who plays the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[plucked string instrument]] known as the [[bandura]].

==Types of performers==
There are a number of different types of bandurist who differ in their particular choice of instrument, the specific repertoire they play and manner in which they approach their vocation.

*'''[[Kobzar]]i''', who play authentic ethnographic instruments or copies. This group can also be further categorized into ''authentic'', ''reproduction'', and ''stage'' performers.
*'''Academic players''', playing more sophisticated contemporary concert banduras. These performers have a [[tertiary education]] majoring in bandura performance and typically perform works by Western classical composers in addition to, or instead of, Ukrainian folk music. This category can be further divided into instrumentalists (who only perform instrumental works) and vocalists (who primarily use the bandura to accompany their voice). The most common academic bandurists play in the [[Kiev academic style]]. There are also a number of [[Kharkiv style]] academic bandurists.
* So-called "'''Fakeloric'''" '''performers''', who play stylized songs and repertoire on contemporary instruments. Othen these performers refer to themselves as contemporary kobzars. Many contemporary blind bandurists can be placed into this category.
*'''Ensemble performers''' - performers who sing in a choir and accompany their chorral performance with their own playing on the bandura.

===Ensembles===

[[Image:Kyiv1925.jpeg|thumb|150px|The Kiev Bandurist Capella 1928.]]
[[Image:Kaplelia39.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Canadian Bandurist Capella]].]]

Evidence of ensemble playing prior to the 20th century is scarce, although there do exist accounts of two or sometimes three kobzars playing together at bazaars, especially in the area around Kharkiv.

The first documented performance by a bandura ensemble however took place in Kharkiv in 1902, at the [[XIIth Archeological conference]]. The performance had a very positive effect on the popularity of the bandura and ensemble bandura playing. Attempts were made by [[Hnat Khotkevych]] to repeat the performance and take the ensemble on tour throughout [[Ukraine]], but permission was not obtained from the Russian authorities.

In 1905 there is evidence of the first performance of a bandura quartet of non-blind bandurists performing in [[Moscow]]. From 1906 small bandura ensembles began to form not just from kobzars who had participated in the [[Kharkiv]] performance of 1902 but also from non-blind bandurists and had become interested in the instrument. Groups were established by [[M. Domontovych]] in Kiev and [[V. Shevchenko]] in Moscow and the Kuban.

What is considered to be the first professional (in the sense that this was their main livelihood) bandurist ensemble was established by [[Vasyl Yemetz]] in 1918 and became known as the [[Kiev Bandurist Capella]]. Despite periods in which the ensemble did not function due to the political turmoil within the country, the ensemble re-established and re-defined itself on numerous occasions and through its concerts stimulated the establishment of many other similar bandura groups. By 1928 there were over 900 bandura ensembles in [[Ukraine]].

Active persecution of bandurists in the 1930s resulted in many players being murdered or persecuted in the 1930s. Many of those that continued playing took the opportunity of seeking freedom emigrating to the West. The [[Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus]] which was originally established in 1941 during the Nazi occupation emigrated as a group. It settled in [[Detroit]] in the USA where it continued to actively propagated the art form in the West.

The [[Kiev State Bandurist Capella]] was re-established in [[Kiev]] in 1948 under the direction of [[Oleksander Minkivsky]]. Many members after being mobilized to the front in 1941 had died. Others had emigrated. It currently has over 70 members. Numerous other bandurist Capellas exist in Ukraine throughout the country having all male membership, mixed membership, or just female membership. A capella made up of blind bandurists also exists in Lviv.

Bandurist choruses, ensembles and capellas were also established in [[Argentina]], Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Paraguay, Poland the United States and Venezuela.

A '''blook''' is a printed book that contains or is based on content from a [[blog]].

The first printed blook was User Interface Design for Programmers, by [[Joel Spolsky]], published by Apress on June 26, 2001, based on his blog [[Joel on Software]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} An early blook was written by Tony Pierce in 2002 when he compiled selected posts from his one-year-old blog and turned the collection into a book called "Blook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonypierce.com/blog/2002_11_03_blogarc.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182557/http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2002_11_03_blogarc.htm |archivedate=17 May 2008 |title=tonypierce.com + bushblog |website=tony pierce dot com |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name came about when Pierce held a contest, asking his readers to suggest a title for the book. [[Jeff Jarvis]] of BuzzMachine won the contest and subsequently invented the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2002_12_21.html#002759 |title=Posts from December 21, 2002 |date=21 December 2002 |website=BuzzMachine |accessdate=18 January 2014 |first=Jeff |last=Jarvis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce went on to publish two other blooks, How To Blog and Stiff.

[[Print-on-demand]] publisher [[Lulu (publisher)|Lulu]] inaugurated the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]] for blooks, which was first awarded in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/apr/03/news.newmedia1|title=From blog to book: first awards for online writers who became mainstream successes|last=Gibson|first=Owen|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 April 2006|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printed blook phenomenon is not limited to self-publishing. Several popular bloggers have signed book deals with major publishers to write books based on their blogs. However, some publishers are starting to realize that blog popularity does not translate to sales. Blog to book conversions via traditional publishing houses still happen, but the focus has shifted from blog popularity to content quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-blogbook1211,0,5596105,full.story |title=The sharp rise (and quick fall) of the bloggers' books |date=11 December 2007 |first=Kara |last=Warner |website=am New York |archivedate=11 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213548/http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-blogbook1211%2C0%2C5596105%2Cfull.story |accessdate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Scribe Book Scanner.jpg|thumb|[[Internet Archive]] Scribe book scanner in 2011]]
[[File:Internet Archive book scanner 1.jpg|thumb|Internet Archive book scanner]]
'''Book scanning''' (or '''magazine scanning''') is the process of converting physical [[book]]s and magazines into [[digital media]] such as [[digital image|images]], [[electronic text]], or [[e-book|electronic books]] (e-books) by using an [[image scanner]].

Digital books can be easily distributed, reproduced, and [[screen reading|read on-screen]]. Common file formats are [[DjVu]], [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF), and [[Tagged Image File Format]] (TIFF). To convert the raw images [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) is used to turn book pages into a digital text format like [[ASCII]] or other similar format, which reduces the file size and allows the text to be reformatted, searched, or processed by other applications.

Image scanners may be manual or automated. In an ordinary commercial image scanner, the book is placed on a flat glass plate (or platen), and a light and optical array moves across the book underneath the glass. In manual book scanners, the glass plate extends to the edge of the scanner, making it easier to line up the book's spine. Other book scanners place the book face up in a v-shaped frame, and photograph the pages from above. Pages may be turned by hand or by automated paper transport devices. Glass or plastic sheets are usually pressed against the page to flatten it.

After scanning, software adjusts the document images by lining it up, cropping it, picture-editing it, and converting it to text and final e-book form. Human proofreaders usually check the output for errors.

Scanning at {{nowrap|118 dots/centimeter}} ({{nowrap|300 [[dots per inch|dpi]]}}) is adequate for conversion to digital text output, but for archival reproduction of rare, elaborate or illustrated books, much higher resolution is used.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} High-end scanners capable of thousands of pages per hour can cost thousands of dollars, but [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY), manual book scanners capable of 1200 pages per hour have been built for US$300.&lt;ref name="instructables"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-High-Speed-Book-Scanner-from-Trash-and-Cheap-C/|title=DIY High-Speed Book Scanner from Trash and Cheap Cameras|publisher=instructables.com|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial book scanners==
[[File:V-shaped-cradle - en.svg|thumb|Sketch of a V-shaped book scanner from Atiz]]
[[File:book scanner.svg|thumb|Sketch of a typical manual book scanner]]
Commercial book scanners are not like normal [[image scanner|scanners]]; these book scanners are usually a high quality [[digital camera]] with light sources on either side of the camera mounted on some sort of frame to provide easy access for a person or machine to flip through the pages of the book. Some models involve V-shaped book cradles, which provide support for book spines and also center book position automatically.

The advantage of this type of scanner is that it is very fast, compared to the productivity of overhead scanners.

==Book scanning by organizations on a large scale==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Projects like [[Project Gutenberg]] (est. 1971), [[Million Book Project]] (est. circa 2001), [[Google Books]] (est. 2004), and the [[Open Content Alliance]] (est. 2005) scan books on a large scale.

One of the main challenges to this is the sheer volume of books that must be scanned. In 2010 the total number of works appearing as books in human history was estimated to be around 130&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taycher |first=Leonid |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.co.at/2010/08/you-can-count-number-of-books-in-world.html |title=As of Aug 5, 2010, google estimates that there are 129,864,880 different books in the world |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.co.at |date=2010-08-05 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these must be scanned and then made searchable online for the public to use as a [[universal library]]. Currently, there are three main ways that large organizations are relying on: outsourcing, scanning in-house using commercial book scanners, and scanning in-house using robotic scanning solutions.

As for outsourcing, books are often shipped to be scanned by low-cost sources to [[India]] or [[China]]. Alternatively, due to convenience, safety and technology improvement, many organizations choose to scan in-house by using either overhead scanners which are time-consuming, or digital camera-based scanning machines which are substantially faster and is a method employed by Internet Archive as well as Google. Traditional methods have included cutting off the book's spine and scanning the pages in a [[image scanner|scanner]] with automatic page-feeding capability, with subsequent rebinding of the loose pages.

Once the page is scanned, the [[data]] is either entered manually or via OCR, another major cost of the book scanning projects.{{According to whom|date=January 2016}}

Due to [[copyright]] issues, most scanned books are those that are out of copyright; however, [[Google Book Search]] is known to scan books still protected under copyright unless the [[publisher]] specifically prohibits this.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Destructive scanning methods==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
For book scanning on a low budget, the least expensive method to scan a book or magazine is to cut off the binding. This converts the book or magazine into a sheaf of looseleaf papers, which can then be loaded into a standard [[automatic document feeder]] (ADF) and scanned using inexpensive and common scanning technology. While this is not a desirable solution for very old and uncommon books, it is a useful tool for book and magazine scanning where the book is not an expensive collector's item and replacement of the scanned content is easy. There are two technical difficulties with this process, first with the cutting and second with the scanning.

===Unbinding===
More precise and less destructive than cutting pages with a paper guillotine or razor or scissors is the technique of meticulous unbinding by hand, assisted with tools.  This technique has been successfully employed for tens of thousands of pages of archival original paper scanned for the Riazanov Library digital archive project from newspapers and magazines and pamphlets, varying from 50 to 100 years old and more, and often composed of fragile, brittle paper.  Although the monetary value for some collectors (and for most sellers of this sort of material) is destroyed by unbinding, unbinding in many cases actually greatly assists preservation of the physical pages themselves, making them more accessible to researchers and less likely to be damaged when subsequently examined. The down side is that unbound stacks of pages are "fluffed up", and therefore more exposed to oxygen in the air, which may in some cases (theoretically) speed deterioration.  This can be addressed by putting weights on the pages after they are unbound, and storage in appropriate containers.

Hand unbinding will preserve text that runs into the gutters of bindings, and most critically allows more easy and complete high quality scans to be made of two page wide material, such as center cartoons, graphic art, and photos in magazines.  The digital archive of The Liberator 1918-1924 on Marxist Internet Archive nicely demonstrates the quality of two page wide graphic art scans made possible by careful hand unbinding prior to flat bed or other scanning.

Unbinding techniques vary with the binding technology, from simply removing a few staples to unbending and removing nails to meticulous grinding down of layers of glue on the spine of a book to precisely the right point, followed by laborious removal of the string used to hold the book together.

Note that with some newspapers (such as Labor Action 1950-1952) there are columns on the center facing pages that run right in-between the pages.  Chopping off part of the spine of a bound volume of such papers  will lose part of this text.  Even the Greenwood Reprint of this publication failed to preserve the text content of those center columns, cutting off significant amounts of text there.  Only when bound volumes of the original newspaper were meticulously unbound, and the opened pair of center pages were scanned as a single page on a flat bed scanner was the center column content made digitally available. Alternatively, one can present the two facing center pages as three scans. One of each individual page, and one of a page sized area situated over the center of the two pages.

===Cutting===
One method of cutting a stack of 500 to 1000 pages in one pass is accomplished with a [[Paper cutter|guillotine]] paper cutter. This is a large steel table with a paper [[vise]] that screws down onto the stack and firmly secures it before cutting. The cut is accomplished with a large sharpened steel blade which moves straight down and cuts the entire length of each sheet all at once. A lever on the blade permits several hundred pounds of force to be applied to the blade for a quick one-pass cut.

A clean cut through a thick stack of paper cannot be made with a traditional inexpensive sickle-shaped hinged [[paper cutter]]. These cutters are only intended for a few sheets, with up to ten sheets being the practical cutting limit. A large stack of paper applies torsional forces on the hinge, pulling the blade away from the cutting edge on the table. The cut becomes more inaccurate as the cut moves away from the hinge, and the force required to hold the blade against the cutting edge increases as the cut moves away from the hinge.

The guillotine cutting process dulls the blade over time, requiring that it be resharpened. [[Coated paper]] such as slick magazine paper dulls the blade more quickly than plain book paper, due to the [[kaolinite]] [[clay]] coating. Additionally, removing the binding of an entire hardcover book causes excessive wear due to cutting through the cover's stiff backing material. Instead the outer cover can be removed and only interior pages need be cut.

An alternate method of unbinding books is to use a table saw.  While this method is potentially dangerous and does not leave as smooth an edge as the guillotine paper cutter method, it is more readily available to the average person.  The ideal method is to clamp the book between two thick boards using heavy machine screws to provide the clamping force.  The entire wood and book package is fed through the table saw using the rip fence as a guide.  A sharp fine carbide tooth blade is ideal for generating an acceptable cut.  The quality of the cut depends on the blade, feed rate, type of paper, paper coating, and binding material.

===Scanning===
Once the paper is liberated from the spine, it can be scanned one sheet at a time using a traditional [[flatbed scanner]] or [[automatic document feeder]].

Pages with a decorative riffled edging or curving in an arc due to a non-flat binding can be difficult to scan using an ADF. An ADF is designed to scan pages of uniform shape and size, and variably sized or shaped  pages can lead to improper scanning. The riffled edges or curved edge can be guillotined off to render the outer edges flat and smooth before the binding is cut.

The coated paper of magazines and bound textbooks can make them difficult for the rollers in an ADF to pick up and guide along the paper path. An ADF which uses a series of rollers and channels to flip sheets over may jam or misfeed when fed coated paper. Generally there are fewer problems by using as straight of a paper path as is possible, with few bends and curves. The clay can also rub off the paper over time and coat sticky pickup rollers, causing them to loosely grip the paper. The ADF rollers may need periodic cleaning to prevent this slipping.

Magazines can pose a bulk-scanning challenge due to small nonuniform sheets of paper in the stack, such as magazine subscription cards and fold out pages. These need to be removed before the bulk scan begins, and are either scanned separately if they include worthwhile content, or are simply left out of the scan process.

===A test case: PGP===
In 1995, [[Phil Zimmerman]] published ''PGP Source Code and Internals'' as a $60 hardbound book, which under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] could legally be shipped abroad. The buyer could either display it in a library or destructively scan it so that the source code could be compiled via freely available GNU software into the [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) cryptosystem that the U.S. government regarded as a restricted munition. Zimmerman was being prosecuted for distributing PGP software and wanted to test the law in the courts. It was not directly tested, but export restrictions have eased: it is [[Export of cryptography in the United States|legal to export PGP]] anywhere but the seven countries and specified groups and individuals to which nothing can be exported from the U.S.

==Non-destructive scanning==

[[File:MyBookScanner,June12,2011.JPG|thumb|An example of a DIY non-destructive book scanner/digitizer, with the book downwards design, allowing gravity to flatten pages]]
Software driven machines and robots have been developed to scan books without the need of disbinding them in order to preserve both the contents of the document and create a digital image archive of its current state. This recent trend has been due in part to ever improving imaging technologies that allow a high quality digital archive image to be captured with little or no damage to a rare or fragile book in a reasonably short period of time.

The first fully automated book scanner was the DL (Digitizing Line) scanner, manufactured by 4DigitalBooks in Switzerland. First known installation was at Stanford University in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=John|title=4DigitalBooks launches digital book scanner|url=http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1107446/4digitalbooks-launches-digital-book-scanner|publisher=PrintWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford University Libraries (SUL) Robotic Book Scanner|url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/library/prod//depts/diroff/DLStatement.html|publisher=Stanford University Libraries (SUL)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most high-end commercial robotic scanners use traditional air and [[suction]] technology while some others use alternative approaches like bionic finger for turning the pages. Some scanners take advantage of [[Ultrasonic sensor]] or [[Photoelectric sensor]] to detect dual pages and prevent skipping of pages. With reports of machines being able to scan up to 2900 pages per hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=David|title=Product Watch: Library Scanners|url=http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2011/06/industry-news/product-watch-library-scanners/#|publisher=Library Journal|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; robotic book scanners are specifically designed for large-scale digitization projects.

'''''Boy with a Basket of Fruit''''', c.1593, is a painting generally ascribed to [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master Michelangelo Merisi da [[Caravaggio]], currently in the [[Galleria Borghese]], [[Rome]].

The painting dates from the time when Caravaggio, newly arrived in Rome from his native [[Milan]], was making his way in the competitive Roman art world. The model was his friend and companion, the Sicilian painter [[Mario Minniti]], at about 16 years old. The work was in the collection of [[Giuseppe Cesari]], the Cavaliere d'Arpino, seized by Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]] in 1607, and may therefore date to the period when Caravaggio worked for d'Arpino "painting flowers and fruits" in his workshop; but it may date from a slightly later period when Caravaggio and Minniti had left [[Cavalier d'Arpino]]'s workshop (January 1594) to make their own way selling paintings through the dealer Costantino. Certainly it cannot predate 1593, the year Minniti arrived in Rome. It is believed to predate more complex works from the same period (also featuring Minniti as a model) such as ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]'' and the ''[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|Cardsharps]]'' (both 1594), the latter of which brought Caravaggio to the attention of his first important patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. Vittorio Sgarbi notes certain Murillesque portraiture qualities in the painting that could easily point to other painters in the Arpino workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio Sgarbi "Caravaggio", in FMR#9, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

At one level the painting is a [[genre]] piece designed to demonstrate the artist's ability to depict everything from the skin of the boy to the skin of a peach, from the folds of the robe to the weave of the basket. The fruit is especially exquisite, and Professor Jules Janick of the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture at Purdue University, Indiana, has analysed them from a horticulturalist's perspective:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The basket ... contains a great many fruits, all in nearly perfect condition and including a bi-colored peach with a bright red blush; four clusters of grapes — two black, one red, and one "white;" a ripe pomegranate split open, disgorging its red seeds; four figs, two of them dead-ripe, black ones, both split and two light-colored; two medlars; three apples—two red, one blushed and the other striped, and one yellow with a russet basin and a scar; two branches with small pears, one of them with five yellow ones with a bright red cheek and the other, half-hidden, with small yellow, blushed fruits. There are also leaves showing various disorders: a prominent virescent grape leaf with fungal spots and another with a white insect egg mass resembling that of the oblique banded leaf roller (''Choristoneura rosaceana''), and peach leaves with various spots.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The analysis indicates that Caravaggio is being realistic, in capturing only what was in the fruit basket; he idealizes neither their ripeness nor their arrangement—yet almost miraculously, we are still drawn in to look at it; for the viewer it is very much a beautiful and exquisite subject.

[[Image:Andrea Mantegna 054.jpg|thumb|right|The "Court Scene".]]

The '''Camera degli Sposi''' ("bridal chamber"), sometimes known as the '''Camera picta''' ("painted chamber"), is a room [[fresco]]ed with [[illusionistic painting]]s by [[Andrea Mantegna]] in the [[Ducal Palace, Mantua]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="radke"&gt;{{cite book|first=John T.|last=Paoletti|author2=Gary M. Radke|title=Art, Power, and Patronage in Renaissance Italy|location=[[Upper Saddle River]]|publisher=[[Pearson PLC|Pearson]]/[[Prentice Hall]] |year=2005|pages=356–359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{cite book|first= Laurie |last=Schneider Adams|title=Italian Renaissance Art|location=[[Boulder]]|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|year=2001|pages=262–267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted between 1465 and 1474 and commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Ludovico III Gonzaga]], and is notable for the use of ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' details and its ''[[di sotto in sù]]'' ceiling.
[[Image:Andrea Mantegna 080.jpg|thumb|left|The "Meeting Scene".]]

The chronological sequence of the paintings has been recently discovered: the painter started from the vault by dry painting in the background small bits particularly those of the oculus and the wreath surrounding it. Then he moved on to the ‘Court scene’ where he used a mysterious oily tempera dry laid out on the surface. The east and south walls followed, with the traditional fresco technique representing heavy curtains. Finally the ‘Meeting scene’ on the west wall was painted, always ‘a fresco’ but in very small bits which confirms an almost ten-year period of work on that part of the chamber.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guideturistichemantova.it/English/?p=34 |title=Mantua Tourist Guide, The Bridal Chamber |accessdate=4 April 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The walls==
The "Court Scene" on the north wall shows Ludovico Gonzaga, dressed informally, with his wife [[Barbara of Brandenburg, Marquise of Mantua|Barbara of Brandenburg]]. They are seated with their relatives, while a group of [[courtier]]s fill the rest of the wall. The figures are interacting in an illusionistically expanded space.

On the west wall is the "Meeting scene". This fresco shows Ludovico in official robes in an ideal meeting with his son, Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] and [[Christian I of Denmark]].

The commission is far from being explained by scholars. The traditional interpretation sees the frescos as linked to the election as Cardinal of Ludovico's son Francesco Gonzaga, which took place on January 1, 1462: the Court scene should then represent the Marquis receiving the news, and the Meeting Scene should see father and son reunited in the happy event.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"/&gt;

The mature and strongly-built figure of Francesco though, doesn’t seem to match with his age in 1461, which was only 17 (an early portrait held today in Naples confirms this). For this reason, these frescos could refer to a later visit of Cardinal Francesco to Mantua, perhaps on August 1472 when he was given the title of St. Andrew.&lt;ref name="guidemantova"/&gt;

==The ceiling==
Mantegna's playful ceiling presents an [[oculus]] that illusionistically opens into a blue sky, with foreshortened [[putti]] playfully frolicking around a balustrade. This was one of the earliest [[di sotto in sù]] ceiling paintings.

[[File:CTC Logo.JPG|thumb|Centenary Theatre Logo]]
'''Centenary Theatre Company''' is a [[theatre company]] based in [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire]]. They are one of the longest established theatre companies in North West of England. The name of the Company has changed several times over the years, with the original company being established in 1901.

Centenary perform four productions each performance season including [[Musical theatre|musicals]] and [[play (theatre)|plays]]. The company also performs concerts in aid of local charities.

Centenary Theatre Company is a [[registered charity]] in the U.K.

Membership to the company is not based on artistic ability. Only if members wish to perform in productions is any [[audition]] required. Centenary is also affiliated to the [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] (NODA). The group performs at [[The Brindley]] in [[Runcorn]].

==History of Centenary==

The origins of the Company can be traced back to 1901 and the forming of a ladies' choral society, which was augmented by a drama group in 1904.  By 1907 the Operatic and Dramatic Society took the form seen today, with the Crosfield family taking a very active part.  The Society’s first full-scale musical was in 1907 with the presentation of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Western,'' A Brief History of Centenary''&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier choral and dramatic productions were performed in the then newly built Crosfield Assembly Hall, which now forms part of the ground floor of the Crosfield General Office Building. In later years, musical shows were transferred to the [[Parr Hall]], and then on to the Royal Court Theatre, now lost with its site being occupied today by the Warrington Information Offices.  Crosfields celebrated their 100 years of [[soap]] making (1815–1915), and marked this several years later by building the Centenary Theatre.  The Society’s first production, in the main body of the hall (the stage had not been built yet!), was ''[[The Princess of Kensington]]''.  One year later in 1925, came the first full stage production in the theatre, ''The Geisha Girl''.

The Company's activities were suspended for World War II, as indeed it had been for World War I.  Prior to 1940 the musical productions had consisted primarily of one, two or three main scenes incorporating a large chorus that remained on stage for up to 75% of the time.  In the late 1940s a change came about with the arrival of bigger, more glamorous, and ever costlier shows – demanding more efficient detail and stage effects.

One such show was ''[[The Desert Song]]'', performed by the Society in 1947, which proved to be one of the group's greater successes, particularly in terms of attendance figures, playing to full houses – including the Saturday afternoon matinée.

During this period [[amateur theatre]] in general was booming and continued to do so for many years.  The Company flourished and was able to support various charities with donations amounting to many thousands of pounds.

The company has now completed in excess of 130 musical shows since the first one back in those early days of 1907 – with two shows every year from 1961 onwards.  They also produce two plays each year and these have included a wide variety of plays including classic drama; [[farce]]; [[comedy]] and ‘[[whodunit]]s’.

In 1984 the Society changed its name from 'Crosfields' to 'Centenary Operatic and Dramatic Society' – named after the theatre where all productions were then staged.  The Centenary Theatre closed in 1991.  The last musical there was ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and the last play was ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]''.  Later on that year the group returned to the Parr Hall – after decades away – with ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''.

In 2005 Centenary moved again to a new purpose built theatre - Runcorn's Brindley Theatre.  To coincide with the move to a professional venue, Centenary Operatic and Dramatic Society changed its name to Centenary Theatre Company.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Works==
Many of Jordan's works are created from photographs of [[waste|garbage]] and mass consumption, a serendipitous technique which started when he visited an industrial yard to look at patterns of color and order. Jordan uses everyday commonalitie such as a plastic cup and defines the blind unawareness involved in American consumerism. His work, while often unsettling, is a message about unconscious behaviors in our everyday lives, leaving it to the viewer to draw conclusions about the inevitable consequences which will arise from our habits.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/arts/story.html?id=3e093270-22f3-4c17-851b-8d86da709455 Beautifully ugly photography]".

==''Midway'' project==
''Midway: Message from the Gyre'' (2009–2013)&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrisjordan.com/gallery/midway Online gallery for the Midway series] Chris Jordan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ted.com/2009/09/14/chris_jordan_fo/ Chris Jordan follows the plastic to Midway Atoll, article in the [[TED (conference)|TED]] blog]&lt;/ref&gt; is a series of photographs depicting rotting carcasses of baby [[Laysan Albatross|Laysan albatrosses]] filled with plastic. These birds nest on [[Midway Atoll]] and are being fed plastic by their parents, who find floating plastic in the middle of the ocean and mistake it for food. This is a part of an ongoing arts and media project called Midway Journey, which has its own website.

In relation to the ''Midway'' photographs, Jordan created another project that was going to be a documentary. It was about the pollution on Midway Atoll called ''"The Midway Film Project"''. The project was successfully funded on [[Kickstarter]] in 2012 with over $100,000 worth of donations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/midwayfilm/join-the-midway-film-project Kickstarter: Join the Midway Film Project]&lt;/ref&gt; There has been little activity regarding the project (since 2014) although it was stated to be "in progress" as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/midwayfilm/join-the-midway-film-project/updates Kickstarter: Midway Film Project updates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/July-2016/How-Albatrosses-Taught-Photographer-Chris-Jordan-How-to-Grieve/ How Albatrosses Taught Photographer Chris Jordan How to Grieve]" Travis Hancock, [[Honolulu (magazine)]], 22 July 2016. Accessed 18 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the film was finished and being screened in select locations.

The '''Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec''' ('''CALQ''') is a public agency founded in 1994 by the [[government of Quebec]].

CALQ offers support and funding for art projects in the performing arts, multidisciplinary arts, circus arts, visual arts, media arts, architectural research, arts and crafts, and literature. It also seeks to broaden the influence of Quebec culture in Canada and abroad, and supports the advanced training of writers and professional artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/calq/mission_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207195706/http://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/calq/mission_en.htm |archivedate=2011-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordre des arts et des lettres du Québec==
In 2015, CALQ awarded the inaugural Ordre des arts et des lettres du Québec, honouring achievement in Quebec [[arts and letters]], on the occasion of its 20th anniversary. Thirty-five inductees were added to the order in its first year, including 13 board members. Though inspired by France's [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], the Quebec order differs in that it has only one grade, that of companion.&lt;ref name="Lemay"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lemay|first1=Daniel|title=Ordre des arts et lettres du Québec: Liza Frulla sera honorée|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/arts/nouvelles/201503/20/01-4853949-ordre-des-arts-et-lettres-du-quebec-liza-frulla-sera-honoree.php|accessdate=3 November 2016|work=La Presse|date=20 March 2015|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calq.gouv.qc.ca/actualites-et-publications/dix-huit-personnalites-quebecoises-decorees-de-lordre-des-arts-et-des-lettres-du-quebec-aujourdhui/|title=CALQ {{!}} Dix-huit personnalités québécoises décorées de l'Ordre des arts et des lettres du Québec aujourd'hui|website=www.calq.gouv.qc.ca|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distributed Proofreaders Canada''' (DP Canada) is a volunteer organization that converts books into digital format and releases them as [[public domain]] books in formats readable by electronic devices. It was launched in December 2007 and {{as of|2018|lc=yes}} has published about 4,200 books. Books that are released are stored on a book archive called ''Faded Page''. While its focus is on Canadian publications and preserving [[Canadiana]], it also includes books from other countries as well. It is modelled after [[Distributed Proofreaders]], and performs the same function as similar projects in other parts of the world such as [[Project Gutenberg]] in the United States and [[Project Gutenberg Australia]].

== History ==
Distributed Proofreaders Canada was launched in December 2007 by David Jones and Michael Shepard. Although it was established by members of the original Distributed Proofreaders site, it is a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Distributed Proofreaders just celebrated its 10th anniversary |first=Marie |last=Lebert |url=http://teleread.com/distributed-proofreaders-just-celebrated-its-10th-anniversary-by-marie-lebert/ |publisher=Teleread |date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a volunteer based non-profit organization. All the administrative and management costs are borne by its members. The software used by DP Canada was originally downloaded from [[SourceForge]] but has been substantially modified since then.

In addition to preserving Canadiana, DP Canada is notable because it is one of the first major efforts to take advantage of Canada's copyright laws which allows more works to be preserved. Unlike copyright law in other countries, Canada has a "life plus 50" copyright term. Works by authors who died more than fifty years ago may be made publicly available in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How long does copyright last? |first=Donald |last=Taylor |url=http://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/academic-integrity/copyright/length |publisher=Simon Fraser University |date=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have differing copyright laws. Although files available through DP Canada are publicly available in other countries, the onus is on the reader to ensure that they only download material that is not in copyright in their country of residence.

Notable Canadian authors whose books have been published include [[Stephen Leacock]], [[Lucy Maud Montgomery|L. M. Montgomery]], [[Ernest Thompson Seton|E. T. Seton]] and [[Mazo de la Roche]]. Authors whose works have been released in Canada but not other parts of the world include [[A. A. Milne]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[E. E. Smith]] and [[Amy Carmichael]].

==Proofreading==
[[File:DPC Proofreading Screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Proofreading software showing original text on left and edited text on the right.]]
Eligible books are chosen by members for publication based on personal interest and access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Books mean the world to volunteers |last=Knox |first=Jack |newspaper=Times - Colonist |location=Victoria, B.C |date=April 28, 2016 |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books are scanned electronically and each page is uploaded to the proofreading website. A project is created for the book and is made available to the proofreading members. Each book is proofread in three stages called 'P1', 'P2' and 'P3'. During the first stage, errors in scanning and other minor errors are corrected. Once all pages in the book have been edited the book pages are promoted to the next stage, P2. The proofreading is repeated and again in stage P3 to ensure no errors make it to the final publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proofreading Guidelines |url=http://www.pgdpcanada.net/guidelines/proofguide.html |publisher=Distributed Proofreaders Canada |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once stage P3 is finished the book moves to a set of two formatting stages called 'F1', and 'F2'. In these stages the book text is changed into a format that allows it to be presented to the reader in a style that resembles the original book as closely as possible. For example, text originally appearing in [[Italic type]] is placed within formatting tags &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;i&gt;this text is in italics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. When formatted the text appears correctly as ''this text is in italics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Formatting Guidelines |url=http://www.pgdpcanada.net/guidelines/formatguide.html |publisher=Distributed Proofreaders Canada |date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the formatting stages are complete, a post-processing stage brings all the files together to publish the books in five electronic formats. These include [[ePub]], [[Mobipocket|mobi]], [[HTML]], [[PDF]] and [[UTF-8|plain text]]. The HTML version is also made available as a [[Zip (file format)|Zip]] file. 

Before the books are added to the Faded Page book archive, the books are placed in a final round called 'Smooth Reading'. While in this phase, members of DP Canada are encouraged to download the books and read them. While the books are in this phase, comments about the book for possible improvements can be sent to the post processor. Once past the Smooth Reading process, the publication is posted on Faded Page.

==Publication==
The books that are published by DP Canada in the [[public domain]] are made available through the Faded Page book archive. Some of the publications released are also posted to the [[Project Gutenberg Canada]] (PG Canada) website. PG Canada is a book archive that does not perform proofreading tasks.

The '''Etaples art colony''' consisted of artists working in the [[Étaples]] area of northern France at the turn of the 20th century. The colony had its heyday between 1880–1914, after which it was disrupted by World War I. Although broadly international, it was made up mainly of English-speakers from North America, Australasia and the British Isles. While some artists settled in the area, other visitors stayed only a season, or an even shorter time, as they journeyed from art colony to art colony along the coasts of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. There was no uniformity of style, although there were several shared interests. While most painters left the town in 1914, artistic activity of varied quality was continued during the war by volunteers, artists in uniform and war artists. With peace, some former residents returned to their homes and the persistence of a small colony attracted a few visitors, although little innovative work now resulted.

==First decade==
[[File:Etaples-1.jpg|thumb|The market place and Étaples town hall, shortly after the tramway was built in 1900]]

The first French artists to paint in the area were those particularly associated with [[Plein air|open air]] painting. [[Charles-François Daubigny]] retreated there from the outbreak of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, where he spent his time drawing and executed at least one oil painting of beached boats (Gallery 3). Norman-born [[Eugène Boudin]] frequently painted along the Opal Coast and spent long periods in both Étaples and at [[Berck]]. [[Henri Le Sidaner]], who was brought up in [[Dunkirk]], spent the years 1885–1894 in the town{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and represented the area in all seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1st-art-gallery.com/Henri-Eugene-Augustin-Le-Sidaner/Snowy-Evening,-Etaples.html |title=Snowy Evening, Etaples Henri Eugene Augustin Le Sidaner &amp;#124; Oil Painting Reproduction |publisher=1st-Art-Gallery.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he was joined between 1887-93 by his childhood friend Eugène Chigot (1860-1923), who shared his interest in atmospheric light and afterwards went to stay in [[Le Touquet, France|Paris Plage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expertisez.com/magazine/?p=864 |title=Chigot Eugène &amp;#124; expertisez magazine |publisher=Expertisez.com |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 also, Eugène Vail (1857-1934), moved to Étaples and spent the winter there, lodging with his Irish friend [[Frank O'Meara]], whose letters home give us information about the colony at that time.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Amongst the other artists working there were Boudin and [[Francis Tattegrain]], several more Irish, the English [[Dudley Hardy]], the Americans [[Walter Gay]] and [[L. Birge Harrison]], and the Australian Eleanor Ritchie, whom Harrison met there and married.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} While the rest were painting tranquil figures down at the harbour or in the woods, O'Meara describes Vail as ‘painting the deck of a fishing boat in a heavy sea, life-size’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorrygallery.ie/catalogs/Cat0703.pdf |title=Gorry Gallery |publisher=Gorrygallery.ie |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was "Ready, About!", which won a first-class gold medal in the [[Paris Salon]] of 1888. In the following decade, Vail's Norwegian associate [[Frits Thaulow]] was to spend some time in Étaples while [[André Derain]] stopped there and in [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-mer]] during the summer of 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapage.noos.fr/shv2/vlam-derain.htm |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411232517/http://mapage.noos.fr/shv2/vlam-derain.htm |archivedate=April 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of Vail's stay was equally profitable for [[William Gerard Barry]], who painted his scene of returning prawn fishers, ''Retour de la Pèche aux Crevettes'', which was also accepted at the 1888 Salon.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} At the same time, Birge Harrison was completing his painting "The Return of the Mayflower". It was to be awarded a medal at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition and, for its use of an opalescent tone particularly, is seen as a precursor of American [[Tonalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americandecorativeart.com/internalpages/inventory/pages/harrison.html |title=Moonrise On The Sea : Lovell Birge Harrison |publisher=Americandecorativeart.com |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony that was in the process of being formed in Étaples and neighbouring villages such as Trépied, a mile away on the south bank of the river [[Canche]], was in reality made up largely of English-speaking expatriates who needed to live cheaply. As [[Blanche McManus]] was to comment two decades later in the record of her travels, 'the colony has been formed by buying up, or renting, the fishermen's cottages at nominal prices and turning them into studios. Such is the popularity of art that the native fisher people importune one to be taken on for models with as much insistence as the beggars of Naples appeal to strangers for money.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kellscraft.com/americanwoman/americanwoman17.html |title=Blanche McManus. The American Woman Abroad. Artists' Sketching Grounds Abroad |publisher=Kellscraft.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her account is supplemented by Jane Quigley's description of life there published in 1907. 'The usual plan is to live in rooms or studios and eat at the Hotel des Voyageurs or Hotel Joos – unpretentious hostelries with fairly good meals, served in an atmosphere of friendliness and stimulating talk. In winter the place is deserted, except by a group of serious workers who make it their home. Artists pay about twenty-five or thirty francs a week for board and rooms, and studios are cheap. Étaples has been called – and not without reason – a dirty little town, but it is healthy for all that. The artistic sense finds pleasure in its winding cobbled streets and mellow old houses and in the dark-complexioned southern looking people. Models are plentiful and pose well for a small payment, either in the studio or in the picturesque gardens that lie hidden behind the street doors. A great source of interest is the fishing fleet that comes up the estuary of the Canche to the quays where the fisher people and shrimpers live in a colony of their own. There is constant work for the sketch book, especially on Monday, when the boats go off for several days, the whole family helping the men and boys to start. All one can do amid this bewildering movement of boats putting up sail, and people bustling about with provisions, is to make hurried notes and sketches.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated0006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=DLDecArts.hdv12n03.p0006&amp;id=DLDecArts.hdv12n03&amp;isize=text |title=Decorative Arts: The craftsman: Picardy: a quiet, simple land of dreamy beauty, where artists find much to paint |publisher=Digicoll.library.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and subjects==
{{Synthesis|section|date = July 2013}}
There have been references to ''l'École d'Étaples'' in the wake of an exhibition of those who were painting locally between 1880-1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.fr/fr/sections/une/articles/peintres-8217-ecole-d |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218171851/http://www.culture.fr/fr/sections/une/articles/peintres-8217-ecole-d |archivedate=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But while many of them painted out of doors, as was the new fashion in those years, their styles were too diverse to constitute a school. They ranged from the plein-air style of [[Art colony|artists' colonies]] to the south, through [[Impressionism]] to [[Post Impressionism]]. Among some 200 individuals from three continents, subject matter was obviously varied. However, two broad tendencies can be observed in their work. One is the treatment of light, that recommended itself to those of an Impressionist tendency, such as Boudin and Le Sidaner among the French and [[Wilson Steer]] from England. In this connection, we have to thank the journalist and amateur painter [[:Fr:Édouard Lévêque|Édouard Lévêque]] for putting into words its quality and giving the coastal area it eventual name. Originally from [[Amiens]], he helped develop Le Touquet as a resort and was editor of its newspaper. The phrase 'Opal Coast' was coined in an article by him in ''Le journal de Paris-Plage'' in February 1911. "Is there", he asked, "anything natural that possesses this incessantly changing diversity of colour? Yes, the opal, that precious stone with its milky tones, projecting its series of red and green glints. So let our Côte d'Opale join company with the Côte d'Azur, the Côte d'Emeraude and the Côte d'Argent."

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The other tendency among the artists was to follow the [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] of such painters as [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] in their choice of humble everyday subjects – in the case of Étaples, the life of the fisherfolk. There are good examples in the work of the American [[Louis Paul Dessar]], who was in the town between 1886-1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.terraamericanart.org/view/people/asitem/items$0040null:193/0 |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405220126/http://collections.terraamericanart.org/view/people/asitem/items%240040null%3A193/0 |archivedate=April 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Anglo-Australian [[Tudor St George Tucker]], whose first major painting, "A Picardy Shrimp Fisher", was executed in Étaples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zubans |first=Ruth |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/tucker-tudor-st-george-8870 |title=Biography – Tudor St George Tucker – Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adb.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Gerard Barry's "Time Flies" and Birge Harrison's "The Return of the Mayflower", mentioned above, are works of the same tendency.

One particular focus of attention as a subject was the town's fish market, built in 1872 and now a maritime museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2p2m.org/musee_presentation.php?musee=3 |title=Bienvenue sur le site 2P2M – Patrimoine et Musées en pays du Montreuillois |publisher=2p2m.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "Fish Market, Etaples", shown in 1913 at the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofexhib13nati#page/14/mode/2up/search/Etaples |title=Annual Exhibition Catalogue of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1913 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Clara S.

The market outside was equally popular, a subject bringing together folk in their distinctive local dress which was particularly adapted to the kind of saleable genre subjects that many of these artists were producing. It is shown in the oil paintings "Market Day" by the English [[William Holt Yates Titcomb]] (see Gallery 2), "Market at Etaples" by the Australian [[Marie Tuck]] (1866-1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/lotdetailpage.aspx?lot_id=CAA71A99BC2E71823B9F9A72A1F509AE |title=Market at Etaples by Marie Tuck on artnet |publisher=Artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Market Scene at Etaples" by her compatriot [[Iso Rae]] (1860-1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img.aasd.com.au/30893878.jpg |title=Image |publisher=Img.assd.com.au |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the charcoal and crayon drawing "Le Marché à Etaples" by [[Hilda Rix Nicholas|Hilda Rix]] (1884-1961), another Australian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artvalue.com/auctionresult--rix-nicholas-hilda-emily-1884-le-marche-a-etaples-2825242.htm |title=Le marché à Etaples sold by Enchères Côte d'Opale, Boulogne-sur-Mer, on Saturday, February 26, 2011 |publisher=Artvalue.com |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Market Place, Étaples", a watercolour by the Irish artist Mima Nixon (1861-1939) that was displayed at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadja.com/auctions/en/nixon_mima/artist/127384 |title=Mima Nixon &amp;#124; Art auction results, prices and watercolours estimates |publisher=Arcadja.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently there has been some controversy over the authenticity of artistic portrayal of the life of fisherfolk. Nina Lübbren in particular has argued that the strategies employed in producing a work of art present a false picture and are chiefly aimed at satisfying market preconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDg9H-XVm1UC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=l%C3%BCbbren+%22performing+authenticity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hJkfO-UU3e&amp;sig=O4RG3BzGSd6FLuntbv9GZrWaX_w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=u0agTrTPHMaIhQfcu6nBBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rural Artists' Colonies in Europe, 1870–1910 – Nina Lübbren – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while a good deal that was produced is undeniably formulaic, there is evidence also of a social conscience in the paintings of some artists that is manifested in the depiction of their subjects. Walter Gay's "November" might perhaps be dismissed as merely picturesque, a posed portrayal of a peasant woman at the not particularly arduous task of hoeing her cabbage patch (Gallery 4). But George Clausen's depiction of the back-breaking work of "Gathering Potatoes", painted at nearby Dannes in 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dderrick.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/1887_gathering_potatoes.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=Dderrick.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflects concerns that are a constant in his output of the time. It was then too that he began to distance himself from those championing Impressionist effects precisely because drawing attention principally to technique takes it away from any other motivation for choosing the subject portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dderrick.typepad.com/derrick_clausen_burkhardt/gc_technique |title=George Clausen and Thomas Derrick: GC technique |publisher=Dderrick.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Nourse]]'s "Fisher Girl of Picardy" (Gallery 2) is another case of questionable authenticity. Painted on a blustery day in 1889, it shows a girl with her head slightly turned away and gazing out to sea, while her little brother shelters behind her and wipes the tears from his eyes. Elizabeth Nourse's friend Anna Schmidt later described the circumstances: "I was with Elizabeth when she painted that girl on the Etaples Dunes – it was so cold and windy the model used to weep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=18875 |title=Fisher Girl of Picardy by Elizabeth Nourse / American Art |publisher=Americanart.si.edu |date=1915-01-03 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concern underlies those paintings that show the hazardous nature of the fisherman's work, such as Vail's "Ready, About!" mentioned above, or [[Max Bohm]]'s "At Sea" (Gallery 3). Academic success, however, now tends to bring the artist's motivation, and so the painting's ultimate aim, into question. Since Eugène Chigot's "Lost at sea"  (1891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galeriebayart.fr/Art_Contemporain/1_art_19e_berck_chigot_v2.html |title=Galerie BAYART – Art ancien et contemporain à Compiègne &amp; Paris – Ecole d'Etaples (Ecole de Berck) – Charles Roussel, Eugène Chigot, Tattegrain |publisher=Galeriebayart.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; won a first prize at the Salon when it was exhibited, it might be asked whether the picture is to be viewed as a statement meant to stir the conscience of the urban diner over his fish course or alternatively as artistic exploitation of the subject in order to flatter the viewer into the belief that he has such a conscience.

==Nationalities==
:'''a) Americans'''
The painters of two of the colony's nationalities, Americans&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite book | last = Lesage | first = Jean-Claude | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Peintres Américains en Pas-de-Calis: la colonie d'Etaples | publisher = AMME | date = | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-904959-18-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australians,&lt;ref name=AUS&gt;{{cite book | last = Lesage | first = Jean-Claude | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Peintres Australiens à Etaples | publisher = AMME | date = | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-904959-16-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been the subject of special studies. Among the earliest Americans to visit the town were [[Walter Gay]], who was making a name for himself with Realist subjects at the time, and [[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]],{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} whose long career as a painter of young women in outside settings began with portraits of peasants in Étaples before his return to the U.S. in 1889. Another early visitor was [[Homer Dodge Martin]], who was painting on the coast between 1882-6.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} His work included a topographical view of the harbour (Gallery 3).

In 1889 the Paris-based salon genre painter, [[Elizabeth Nourse]], included the town on her tour. She created paintings there including "Milk Carrier",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/search/Search_Repeat.aspx?searchtype=IMAGES&amp;artist=23147 |title=Elizabeth Nourse – Auction Images and prices realized for Elizabeth Nourse |publisher=Askart.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fisher Girl of Picardy", "An Etaples Fair"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?q=record_ID:siris_ari_236827 |title=An Etaples Fair, (painting) &amp;#124; Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Collections.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Street Scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?q=record_ID:siris_ari_236828 |title=Etaples Street Scene, (painting) &amp;#124; Collections Search Center, Smithsonian Institution |publisher=Collections.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on [[E.

His "Coastal Scene, Etaples" is particularly worth noting for its interpretation of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/eanger-irving-couse-american-1866-1936-0 |title=Eanger Irving Couse (American, 1866-1936) (02/24/2008) |publisher=Worthpoint.com |date=2008-02-24 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myron Barlow (1873–1937) also had a home in Étaples from the late 1890s to his death and specialised particularly in figures in interiors. Among his students there was Norwood Hodge MacGilvary (1874–1949), who studied under him in the years 1904-6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfsfineart.com/biographies3.htm |title=American Painters – Artist Biographies M-Z |publisher=Wolfsfineart.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Bohm]] lived in the area between 1895-1904. Described as a romantic visionary, his heroic depiction of Étaples fishermen, "En Mer" (see Gallery 3), received a gold medal at the Paris Salon in 1898. He then moved out of the town to Trépied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkgvGYj34UMC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Max+Bohm++Etaples&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kqhahny2Jj&amp;sig=Wo0TERQni95CPINJs80dfMaUHe0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HDaMTrLnJuOh0QWu4rW2BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Max%20Bohm%20%20Etaples&amp;f=false |title=A Legacy of Art: Paintings and Sculptures by Artist Life Members of the ... – Carol Lowrey – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while there founded the Société Artistique de Picardie which took over arranging the annual exhibitions of work by local artists started in 1892 by Eugène Chigot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTEwEyV2QhUC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=%22Eugene+Boudin%22+Etaples&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5_yaTo_cK8GW8QOvt8ncBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Petit Futé Côte d'Opale – Jean-Paul Labourdette – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 the society's president was George Senseney (1874-1943),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindapages.com/wags-ohio/gsenseney.htm |accessdate=October 5, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was listed as still living in Etaples in a catalogue of works by American etchers the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073616488#page/n43/mode/2up/search/Etaples |title=Catalogue of an exhibition of works by American etchers under the management of the Chicago Society of Etchers |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 Senseney was succeeded as president by the African-American artist [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]],&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CgtERfkp-UC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=etaples+%22artists+colony%22+Henry+Ossawa+Tanner&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xs91xkmh0k&amp;sig=Th7Qkre2N1wuU4BOQRLQVoZGsXI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NKd9TsiZN8ip0QXN3oUE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Etaples&amp;f=false |title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: American Artist – Marcia M.

Early in his career, Tanner painted marine scenes that showed man's struggle with the sea, but by 1895 he was creating mostly religious works. The simple resources at Étaples were well adapted to his subject matter, which in several cases featured Biblical figures in dark interiors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Occasionally Tanner played host at Trépied to a fellow African-American, [[William Edouard Scott]], who painted there off and on between 1910-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTG-GXlmMAEC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Etaples+artist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UcB9TtuPMseg8QPP7uGiAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Etaples%20artist&amp;f=false |title=A Shared Heritage: Art by Four African Americans – William Edward Taylor – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1969-07-27 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Tanner's son claims that he was largely responsible for establishing the foreign artistic milieu at Etaples, often entertaining up to 100 people at his Trépied summer home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CgtERfkp-UC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=%22Etaples+art+colony+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y_mTUpGrFbKX0QXO3oHIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Etaples%20art%20colony%20%22&amp;f=false |title=Henry Ossawa Tanner: American Artist – Marcia M.

Students were attracted into the area to study with some of these artists. Writing in 1907, Jane Quigley testified of Max Bohm that 'He attracts a following of students by his power as a teacher and the vigorous and sincere personality which exacts good work from all who come under his influence".&lt;ref name="autogenerated0006"/&gt; This was certainly so of the New Zealand artist Samuel Hales (1868-1953), whose painting "La Nuit" was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cornwallartists.org/directory/h?page=1 |title=H &amp;#124; cornwall artists index |publisher=Cornwallartists.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later student was the English [[Jessica Dismorr]], who studied with Bohm in 1904 and went on to adopt a Fauvist and then a Vorticist style.

While Bohm taught in Étaples, the Australian artist [[Rupert Bunny]] did most of his teaching in Paris. But between 1893–1907 he was a frequent visitor and has left some memorable paintings, among them the atmospheric "Light on the Canche"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charleneking.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/BunnyEtaples.jpg |title=Image |publisher=Charleneking.com |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Low tide at Étaples",&lt;ref&gt;[http://c48743.r43.cf3.rackcdn.com/Images/2011_01/17/0029/1096262/129397293077772021_81183350-5085-4362-b7b3-a2c9021d66ad_303767_570.Jpeg ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; both dating from 1902, the same year as "Rainy weather at Étaples" (Gallery 1). Among the students that followed him down was his fellow countrywoman Marie Tuck (1866-1947), who paid for her tuition by cleaning out his studio and came to live in Étaples between 1907–14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/marie-tuck |title=Marie Tuck biography at Design and Art Australia Online |publisher=Daao.org.au |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthur Baker-Clack]] (1877–1955), another Australian, who settled in Trépied in 1910.

Some twenty-five antipodean painters, twenty-two Australians and three New Zealanders, are mentioned in Jean-Claude Lesage's study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717033244/http://users.tpg.com.au/npounder/jean_claude_lesage.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was [[E.

Another New Zealand visitor was [[Eric Spencer Macky]] (1880-1958), who went on to make a career for himself in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annexgalleries.com/artists/biography/1469/Macky/Eric |title=Eric Spencer Macky Biography &amp;#124; Annex Galleries Fine Prints |publisher=Annexgalleries.com |date=1958-05-05 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macky had arrived with his Canadian friend [[A.

The only considerable English painter connected with Étaples was [[Philip Wilson Steer]], who spent some time there in 1887. His misty Impressionist style is striking in such paintings as "The Beach" (Gallery 4) and "Fisher Children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4295575 |title=Philip Wilson Steer, O.M.

Dudley Hardy (1866–1922) captured an evening effect in a watercolour of 1888, looking from the south side of the Canche and showing the windmills that dominated the town at that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelyndacottongallery.co.uk/period_description.php?id=69 |title=Dudley Hardy |publisher=The Lynda Cotton Gallery |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nora Cundell]] (1889-1948) takes us into the back parlour of the Cafe Loos, through the doorway of which one can see a few artist types at table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-back-parlour-cafe-loos-taples-france-65885 |title=The Back Parlour, Café Loos, Étaples, France |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One English artist who visited the area over many years from 1904 onwards was [[William Lee Hankey]]. Eventually he was to have a house built in Le Touquet and maintain a studio at Étaples. His paintings include land- and seascapes such as "The Harbour",&lt;ref&gt;[http://c48743.r43.cf3.rackcdn.com/Images/2009_07/05/0150/526157/a1dcd253-4fcd-4138-a51c-cba4d6da2168_g_570.Jpeg ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and figure studies like "Mother and Child"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skinnerinc.com/asp/fullCataloguese.asp?salelot=2129+++++215+&amp;refno=++456342 |title=William Lee Hankey (British, 1869-1952) Mother and Child &amp;#124; Sale Number 2129, Lot Number 215 &amp;#124; Skinner Auctioneers |publisher=Skinnerinc.com |date=2002-03-22 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Goose Girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4027211 |title=William Lee-Hankey, R.W.S.

Among those painters known as Irish Impressionists&lt;ref&gt;Julian Campbell, ''The Irish Impressionists'', The National Gallery of Ireland 1984&lt;/ref&gt; were the peripatetic William Gerard Barry and the short-lived Frank O'Meara, whose early visit to Étaples has already been mentioned. Another of this group was Barry's protégé Harry Scully,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpfa.ie/scully.htm |title=Irish Art Archive – Harry Scully – Milmo-Penny Fine Art |publisher=Mpfa.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; who stopped in the town in 1896 but was identified with many other art colonies as well. [[Sarah Cecilia Harrison]], noted for her paintings of children and landscapes, was there in 1890 and her "On the road to Étaples" was exhibited at the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1984), p.95&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 [[Edith Somerville]] was painting in the town, companioned by her friend [[Violet Florence Martin|Violet Martin]]. In this case, though, they profited from their stay by conceiving together the stories gathered in ''Some Experiences of an Irish R. M.'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tG9B6b5jFZgC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Edith+Somerville++Etaples&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bgr0X9yKie&amp;sig=WcQJROvMtI9VffqB0A4FU__TT98&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y0KfTvOYDsqW8QPmlMSdCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%89taples&amp;f=false |title=The Professional Literary Agent in Britain, 1880–1920 – Mary Ann Gillies – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following decade Edward Millington Synge (1866-1913) passed some of the winter there and executed "The Thaw, Etaples" (1909), a watercolour of a muddy lane under trees with 'pale yellow sky, purple hills, dull red roof, grey and purple roadway, all obscured by patches of half melted snow’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/internationalstu58newy#page/148/mode/2up/search/Synge |title=International studio |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted for etching, his print of a winter sunset also dates from this stay. The previous year he had married Freda Molony (1869-1924), whose name was mentioned at this period as among those painting in the town and as a successful exhibitor at the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated0006"/&gt; Among her paintings was one of "The Blessing of the Fishing Fleet" at Étaples (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/lotdetailpage.aspx?lot_id=A1A4EA751E1D0824 |title=The blessing of the fishing fleet, Etaples, Brittany by Freda Moloney on artnet |publisher=Artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings of religious processions were comparatively rare in the colony, but in this case Molony's Impressionist approach, with its photographic cutting off of the action by the frame, can be compared with Iso Rae's Post Impressionist treatment of the "Rogation Sunday" procession some seven years later (Gallery 6).

==Aftermath==
With the outbreak of war, the artists in the colony scattered elsewhere and the English army eventually turned the dune area at the back of the town into a vast transit camp, which in turn brought air attacks and some devastation to the town. Several hospitals were set up for those wounded in the nearby fighting and, sadly, what was to become a huge military cemetery. Just before he left the area in 1914, William Lee Hankey had time to observe the consequences for ordinary people of the German invasion of France and Belgium. Its result was the particularly striking etching of "The Refugees". He went on to serve with the [[Artists Rifles]] from 1915 to 1918 and then returned to his home in France.

Some American artists also hung on for a while. Writing in the ''New York Times'' in February 1915, the newly returned Arnold Slade gave an account of the military build-up in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/02/21/104641562.pdf |title=AMERICAN ARTIST VISITS NEW BRITISH BASE CAMP – Just Back from Etaples, France, He Tells of Vast Preparations for 1,500,000, Men. AMERICAN ARTIST VISITS BRITISH BASE CAMP – View Article – NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1915-02-21 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentioned how American artists in the town had volunteered for 12-hour shifts feeding troops as they passed through the station. But almost the only artist to stay on in Étaples throughout the war and record the military activity there was Iso Rae. While working for the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) of the British Red Cross between 1915-1919, she produced about 200 pastel drawings of the army camp and the life of the soldiers there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/wartime/8/articles/iso_rae.pdf |title=Iso Rae in Etaples : another perspective of war |author=Betty Snowden |publisher=Awm.gov.au |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411164433/https://www.awm.gov.au/wartime/8/articles/iso_rae.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Made in the limited time she had spare from her duties, they are of great documentary interest but differ in style from her regular work.

Another medical volunteer connected with the camp was the Yorkshireman Fred Lawson (1888–1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/sketching_a_rich_slice_of_social_history_1_2611409 |title=Sketching a rich slice of social history |publisher=Yorkshire Post |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; who painted watercolours of the town&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennants.co.uk/Catalogue/Lots/89891.aspx#image |title=Tennants Auctioneers: Frederick (Fred) Lawson (1888-1968) |publisher=Tennants.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c0728562.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/LS153813_HR.jpg |title=Image |publisher=C0728562.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also a few who painted among those in uniform. William McDougall Anderson (1883–1917) was a Scottish stained glass artist who served as a Lance Corporal and made a few studies while passing through Étaples in October 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |year=2013 |work=IWM Collection Search |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/search?query=&amp;f%5b0%5d=makerString%3AAnderson%2C%20William%20McDougall&amp;items_per_page=50 |title=Anderson's work in the Imperial War Museum Collection |accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving in the Australian army was Major Edwin Summerhayes. Originally an architect from Perth, Western Australia, he executed several watercolours of war damage in the area (and at the front) in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pictureaustralia.org/apps/pictureaustralia?term1=Major+Edwin+Summerhayes&amp;Submit=search&amp;action=PASearch&amp;attribute1=any+field&amp;mode=search |title=Australian pictures in Trove – Trove |publisher=Pictureaustralia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a view over the Canche to Paris Plage from the notorious training grounds known as the 'bull ring'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media:Bull Ring 2.jpg|View online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two war artists were present during the German air raid on Étaples in May 1918 which also targeted the hospitals. [[Austin Osman Spare|Austin Spare]], who was in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], recorded the scene of devastation left by the raid. A dead British soldier lies amidst hundreds of splintered planks of wood that have come from the damaged wooden huts lining the background of the composition.

Hodgson Lobley (1878–1954), also serving in the RAMC at the time, pictured men constructing an underground dug-out which would serve as a shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/16900 |year=2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |work=IWM Collections Search |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |title=Galleries of Large Dug-outs at Etaples (Art.IWM ART 3670)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lavery]], one of the official British war artists, had been prevented by illness from leaving the country during the war but visited Étaples in 1919. Moved by the sight of the war cemetery that was served then only by a few women VADs, before it was officially designated by the [[War Graves Commission]], he painted it in its sandy starkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/16275 |year=2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |work=IWM Collections Search |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |title=The Cemetery, Etaples, 1919 (Art.IWM ART 2884)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted the officers’ convalescent home over the bridge in privileged Le Touquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/16276|year=2013 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |work=IWM Collections Search |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |title=The QMAAC Convalescent Home, Le Touquet, 1919 (Art.IWM ART 2885)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many soldier poets also passed through the camp at Étaples, among them [[Wilfred Owen]], who commented unfavourably upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Snowden p.38&lt;/ref&gt; However, their preoccupation was mainly with the fighting further inland and there are few poems specifically connected with the town. Most of those we know about were from authors later noted for their prose. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] ‘wrote a poem about England’ while passing through on his way to the front in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDQusCjsL-YC&amp;pg=PT80&amp;dq=Etaples+poem+--Jacques+-Lefevre&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kR-ATvmmNImq8QPOlYWDAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=J.

Lewis]] was injured in 1918 and wrote many of the poems in his ''Spirits in Bondage'' (1919) while in the Liverpool Merchants Mobile Hospital at Étaples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OskozFVBMYC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=C.S.Lewis+Etaples&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vb4HAmn32O&amp;sig=9YGPaidy8cCQ1WMmJVP4XdOUXxI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JUaITpGeB8Gj0QXC99XhDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=C.S.Lewis%20Etaples&amp;f=falsepp.92-4 |title=C.S.

(1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/db/results.php?CISOROOT=%2Fww1&amp;CISOSORT=descrif&amp;CISOOP1=all&amp;CISOFIELD1=CISOSEARCHALL&amp;CISOBOX1=&amp;CISOOP2=all&amp;CISOFIELD2=author&amp;CISOBOX2=vera+brittain |title=Vera Brittain (1893-1970) works |publisher=Oucs.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written while working in the military hospital and drew on her experiences there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zZYuqAXPv4C&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=Etaples+poem+--Jacques+-Lefevre&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oRmATrfcCIHE8QOJ8vyrAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Etaples%20poem%20--Jacques%20-Lefevre&amp;f=false |title=Because You Died: Poetry and Prose of the First World War and After – Vera Brittain – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muriel Stuart]] also devoted a poem to the town in her first collection, which included several references to the war:

:::'Étaples', a strange, vague word
:::Spelled on the lips of the guns
:::Where all that our wild hearts loved
:::Went through with the regiment once!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theotherpages.org/poems/idols.html |title=Poets' Corner – Muriel Stuart – Cockpit of Idols |publisher=Theotherpages.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few resident artists from the colony came back after the war, among them Myron Barlow, Arthur Baker-Clack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58542755 |title=HOME of BEAUTY from the RUINS of WAR. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=23 April 1927 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |page=17 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Henry Tanner, who had been working for the American Red Cross in France. In 1923 he was made a knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] for his work as an artist – as was Barlow in 1932. Iso Rae moved out of Étaples to Trépied, where she stayed until 1932, with Tanner as a neighbour. But, as the latter's biographer records, 'life at Trépied was never to be what it had been before the war. An artists’ colony still existed...but something was missing. Many of the old crowd did not return and those who did were less in step with the times.'&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; They were no longer at the cutting edge of artistic developments and the majority had preferred to take back what they had learned and renew traditional approaches in their own countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3551">'''Experimental tourism''' is a novel approach to [[tourism]] in which visitors do not visit the ordinary [[tourist attraction]]s (or, at least not with the ordinary approach), but allow whim to guide them. It is an alternative form of tourism in which destinations are chosen not on their standard touristic merit but on the basis of an idea or experiment. It often involves elements of [[humor]], [[serendipity]], and [[Randomness|chance]].

There are a number of approaches to experimental tourism:
*[[Aerotourism]] – in which a tourist visits the local airport and explores it without going anywhere.
*[[Alphatourism]] – in which a tourist finds the first street alphabetically on a map, and the last street alphabetically, draws a straight line (or any other figure they desire) between them, and walk the path between the two points.
*[[Alternating Travel]] – in which a tourist leaves their front door, turns right, turns left at the next intersection, turns right at the next, and so on, alternating each direction, until they are unable to continue because of an obstruction.
*[[Blindfolded tourism]] or Cecitourism – in which a blindfolded tourist is escorted through the city by a guide.
*[[Contretourism]] – in which a tourist visits a famous tourist site, but turns their back on the site and takes photos of, or just examines, the view from that direction.
*[[Erotourism]] – in which a couple travels separately to the same city and then tries to find each other.
*[[Monopolytourism]] – in which a tourist takes the local version of a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board with them and visits places on the board as determined by a roll of the [[dice]].
*[[Nyctalotourism]] – in which the tourist only visits tourist attractions between dusk and dawn.
*[[Sagittatourism]] – in which a [[person]] [[throws]] an [[arrow]] (often a [[dart arrow]]) on a [[map]], and [[travel]]s to the [[Location (geography)|place]] the arrow hit on the map.

Other ideas do not have particular names:

*"Touring" a home town.  Stay at a [[youth hostel]], [[Backpacking (travel)|backpack]] through town, meet new people, do not go home until the vacation is over.
*Taking a map of the town being visited, selecting a random map grid, and exploring every bit of the grid.
*Visiting a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], asking the [[bartender]] where their favorite bar is and what they drink there.  Visit that bar, do the same with the bartender there, and continue.

The concept of experimental travel was developed by writer Joel Henry, the [[France|French]] director of the Laboratory of Experimental Tourism (Latourex).

In 2005, [[Lonely Planet]] published ''The Lonely Planet Guide to Experimental Travel'', which formalised and developed many of Henry's ideas.

The deceased is shown above the central niche in front of a table of offerings, and inscriptions listing offerings for the deceased are carved along the side panels.]]
[[Image:Gravestone 6426.jpg|thumb|A false door from the [[First Intermediate Period]]]]

A '''false door''' is an artistic representation of a door which does not function like a real door. They can be carved in a wall or painted on it. They are a common architectural element in the tombs of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Pre-Nuragic Sardinia]]. Later they also occur in [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tombs and in the time of [[Ancient Rome]] they were used in the interiors of both houses and tombs.

==Ancient Egypt==
The Ancient Egyptians believed that the false door was a threshold between the worlds of the living and the dead and through which a deity or the spirit of the deceased could enter and exit.&lt;ref name="KBard"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bard | first = KA | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | location = NY, NY | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The false door was usually the focus of a tomb's offering chapel, where family members could place offerings for the deceased on a special offering slab placed in front of the door.&lt;ref name="JPAllen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Allen | first = JP | title = Middle Egyptian | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge UK | year = 2000 | pages = 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most false doors are found on the west wall of a funerary chapel or offering chamber because the Ancient Egyptians associated the west with the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|land of the dead]]. In many [[mastaba]]s, both husband and wife buried within have their own false door.

===Structure===
A false door usually is carved from a single block of stone or plank of wood, and it was not meant to function as a normal door. Located in the center of the door is a flat panel, or niche, around which several pairs of [[Jamb|door jambs]] are arranged—some convey the illusion of depth and a series of frames, a foyer, or a passageway. A semi-cylindrical drum, carved directly above the central panel, was used in imitation of the reed-mat that was used to close real doors.

The door is framed with a series of moldings and lintels as well, and an offering scene depicting the deceased in front of a table of offerings usually is carved above the center of the door.&lt;ref name="KBard" /&gt; Sometimes, the owners of the tomb had statues carved in their image placed into the central niche of the false door.

===Inscriptions===
The side panels usually are covered in inscriptions naming the deceased along with their titles, and a series of standardized [[Ancient Egyptian offering formula|offering formulas]]. These texts extol the virtues of the deceased and express positive wishes for the afterlife.

For example, the false door of Ankhires reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Strudwick | first = Nigel C. | title = Texts from the Pyramid Age | publisher = BRILL |page = 239 | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The scribe of the house of the god's documents, the stolist of Anubis, follower of the great one, follower of Tjentet, Ankhires."

The lintel reads:

:"His eldest son it was, the lector priest Medunefer, who made this for him."

===Historical development===
[[File:Saqqara BW 1.jpg|thumb|The mortuary complex of [[Djoser]] at [[Saqqara]] shows the [[palace façade]] motif from which the false door motif is derived.]]
The configuration of the false door, with its nested series of doorjambs, is derived from the niched palace façade that became a common architectural motif in the early Dynastic period. The false door was used first in the [[mastaba]]s of the [[Third Dynasty]] of the [[Old Kingdom]], and its use became nearly universal in tombs of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|fourth]] through [[Sixth Dynasty|sixth]] dynasties. During the nearly one hundred and fifty years spanning the reigns of the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|sixth dynasty]] pharaohs [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi I]], [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I|Merenre]], and [[Pepi II Neferkare|Pepi II]], the false door motif went through a sequential series of changes affecting the layout of the panels, allowing historians to date tombs based on which style of false door was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Strudwick | first = Nigel | title = The Administration of Egypt in the Old Kingdom | publisher = Kegan Paul | year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First Intermediate Period]], the popularity of the false doors diminished, being replaced by [[stele|stelae]] as the primary surfaces for writing funerary inscriptions.

==Prehistoric Sardinia==
In [[Domus de Janas]], chamber tombs of the pre-Nuragic [[Ozieri culture]], there are often false doors carved in the walls, supposed to be entrances to the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lilliu| first = Giovanni| title = La Civiltà dei Sardi | publisher = Nuova ERI | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Demartis| first = Giovanni Maria| title = La Necropoli di Anghelu Ruju | publisher = Carlo Delfino editore | year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neroargento.com/page_galle/sincantu_gallery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruria==
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
In Etruscan tombs the false door has a [[Dorians|Doric]] design and is always depicted closed. Most often it is painted, but on some occasions it is carved in [[relief]], like in the [[Tomb of the Charontes]] at [[Tarquinia]]. Unlike the false door in ancient Egyptian tombs, the Etruscan false door has given rise to a diversity of interpretations. It might have been the door the underworld, similar to its use of the ancient Egypt. It could have been used to mark the place where a new doorway and chamber would be carved for future expansion of the tomb. Another possibility is that it is the door of the tomb itself, as seen from outside. In the [[Tomb of the Augurs]] at Tarquinia two men are painted to the left and right of a false door. Their gestures of lamentation indicate that the deceased were considered to be behind the door.&lt;ref name=jann /&gt;

==Ancient Rome==
{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}
[[File:False door fresco in Villa Poppaea close-up Tcr.jpg|thumb|Fresco of a false door in the Roman [[Villa Poppaea]]]]
Painted doors were used frequently in the decoration of both First- and Second style interiors of [[Roman villa]]s. An example is the villa of Julius Polybius in [[Pompeii]], where a false door is painted on a wall opposite a real door to achieve symmetry. Apart from creating architectural balance, they could serve to make the villa seem larger than it really was.&lt;ref name=clar /&gt;

==Cases of note==

===Marillion===
The British rock band [[Marillion]] are considered to be one of the first artists to have truly harnessed the power of the [[internet]] as a means of music distribution and direct contact with fans, which began with setting up a website in 1996 and raising $60,000 to help finance a 1997 North American tour.&lt;ref name="Marillion fans to the rescue"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1325340.stm | title= Marillion fans to the rescue | first=Tim |last=Masters | work=BBC News | date=2001-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' music journalist [[Alexis Petridis]] as "the undisputed pioneers" of the fan-funded music model,&lt;ref name="This song was brought to you by ..."&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/18/popandrock.alexispetridis | title= This song was brought to you by ... | work=The Guardian | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=18 April 2008 | accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the distribution of their 2001 release ''[[Anoraknophobia]]''. Amidst a dissolving relationship with their record label and management team, the band calculated that they would need 5,000 fans to order the album to finance the project.  However, they needed the money up-front, before the record was released.  They turned to their mailing list and asked fans to pre-order the album in what was later described by the [[BBC]] as "a unique funding campaign".&lt;ref name="Marillion fans to the rescue"/&gt; Pre-sales well exceeded their 5,000-unit target (reaching about 12,000 pre-sales total).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music4point5.com/blog/the-marillion-story-and-what-we-can-all-learn-from-it/ The Marillion story and what we can all learn from it - Music 4.5&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109142548/http://www.music4point5.com/blog/the-marillion-story-and-what-we-can-all-learn-from-it/ |date=2012-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marillion have since released several other albums based on a fan-funded model, receiving a £360,000 advance for their 15th studio album ''[[Happiness Is the Road]]''.&lt;ref name="This song was brought to you by ..."/&gt;

===Amanda Palmer===
Unofficially dubbed the "queen" of Kickstarter, [[Amanda Palmer]] is an example of one of the most successful fan-funded music campaigns of all time.  On April 30, 2012, Palmer ran a campaign on Kickstarter, with a goal of $100,000 to fund her newest studio album, ''[[Theatre Is Evil]]''.  By the end of May 2012, Palmer had amassed almost $1.2 million, ultimately receiving donations from nearly 25,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amandapalmer/amanda-palmer-the-new-record-art-book-and-tour|title=Amanda Palmer: The new RECORD, ART BOOK, and TOUR|work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparison, the average successful project on Kickstarter at the time raised about $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/arts/music/amanda-palmer-takes-connecting-with-her-fans-to-a-new-level.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | title=Amanda Palmer Takes Connecting With Her Fans to a New Level | date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ellis Paul===
Boston-based singer/songwriter [[Ellis Paul]] is another important case study in the field of fan-funded music.  His 2010 release, The Day After Everything Changed, was funded completely by fan donations.  Instead of using a traditional crowd-funding platform, he adapted the online merchandise platform [[Nimbit]] to his own fan-funding scheme.  Paul set up a tiered donation hierarchy, ranging from the $15 Street Busker level, up to the $10,000 Woody Guthrie level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ellispaul.com/index.php?page=news&amp;display=2339|title=ELLIS PAUL|date=9 July 2008|work=Ellis Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fans received different perks based on the tier at which they donated.  The project proved to be highly successful, with total donations exceeding $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/04/12/lighters_down_checkbooks_up/|title=Musicians and fans join together to get albums made - The Boston Globe|work=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul is putting his fan-funding to the test again; he is currently in the midst of fan-funding a new studio album set to release sometime in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellispaul.com/index.php?page=blog&amp;category=&amp;display=5695|title=ELLIS PAUL|date=26 September 2012|work=Ellis Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric Eel Shock===
[[Tokyo]]-based [[garage rock|garage]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Electric Eel Shock]] is another group that has seen some success in the way of fan-funded music. In 2004 they offered a "SAMURAI 100" package, which gave fans the opportunity to secure "guest list for life" status.  The package cost £100 and the band raised £10,000 by selling 100 such packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/10764-wanna-go-vip-electric-eel-shock-ll-show-you-the-way|title=Wanna Go VIP? Electric Eel Shock'll show you the way...|work=DrownedInSound}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
As a business practice, fan-funded music is not without its criticism.  Fan-funded music has gained popularity in the past few years however, money raised through these platforms still is only estimated to make up 1% of the amount spent on albums and tours. Many bands start off with fan funding to finance their initial album but then get signed to a record label. Major labels are signing artists with successful fan funded campaigns using the campaigns as a filter before investing in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jan/21/fan-funded-model-record-deal | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Helienne | last=Lindvall | title=Behind the music: The fan-funded model that led to a major record deal | date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, more well-known bands have used fan funding to distance themselves from their label contracts and manage their own music. There has yet to be a band that has used fan funding to fully finance their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18788054 | work=BBC News | title=How fan-funding is changing the face of music finance | date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, ''The Guardian'' journalist [[Gareth McLean]] was scathing of Marillion's pioneering efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: "They have, they explained, decided to eschew the machinations of the record industry in order to be closer to the people. (One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/13/tvandradio.television1 | title= In the realm of pretences| author=Gareth McLean| date=13 August 2001|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that artists overestimate the cost of recording an album and dishonestly solicit more money than they need via fan-funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicthinktank.com/blog/an-argument-against-fan-funding.html|title=An Argument Against Fan Funding - MTT - Music Think Tank|work=musicthinktank.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advancements in digital technology, recording equipment has become increasingly compact and more affordable. It is no longer a requirement for an artist to need a large recording studio that houses oversized equipment.  This increase in accessibility that the everyday musician has today has made it possible for artists to record their own albums from their homes. Since there are no restrictions for what artists can ask for, it is not unheard of for artists to inflate the expected costs and then keep the extra money as profit.

Critics also point out that the fan-funded music model has turned bands into marketers and sales personnel. Artists must be able to develop personal marketing strategies in order to get the money to even begin working on their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;title=the_problem_with_fan_funded_music&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1|title=The Problem With Fan-Funded Music|author=NME.COM|work=nme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists must put lots of time and effort into creating a campaign that engages their fans and gets them to donate to their project. This can prove difficult for any artist to create a campaign that does not come off as  "[a] shrill and desperate-modern-day pan-handling by entitled go-getters."{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} While fan-funded platforms are accessible for any musician, they have become over-crowded with both artists and anyone with an idea. "For every legitimately exciting pitch there are dozens of musicians, filmmakers and designers pleading for funds to complete ill-conceived projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443991704577579190431157610|title=The Good, the Bad and the Crowdfunded|author=Erik Sofge|date=18 August 2012|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running fan-funded campaigns cost bands a large sum of money. They must pay for video production for the video that every campaign has,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} a producer and an engineer to mix and master their album, and fulfill all of the rewards promised to their fans as well as the shipping on them. Often the money made off these projects ends up going to paying the costs of running a successful fan funded campaign. For example, a large portion of the $1 million that [[Amanda Palmer]] raised went into funding her [[Kickstarter]] project itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2012/11/23/165658174/how-much-does-crowdfunding-cost-musicians|title=How Much Does Crowd Funding Cost Musicians?|date=23 November 2012|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as Palmer have huge fan bases to appeal to for money, but for the average artist raising that kind of money isn't a reliable method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicclout.com/contents/article-116-why-i-hate-crowd-funding-by-normandie-wilson.aspx|title=Music Clout|work=musicclout.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}
'''Fantasy films''' are films that belong to the [[fantasy]] genre with fantastic themes, usually [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[supernatural]] events, [[mythology]], [[folklore]], or exotic [[fantasy world]]s. The [[Film genre|genre]] is considered a form of [[speculative fiction]] alongside [[science fiction film]]s and [[horror film]]s, although the genres do overlap. Fantasy films often have an element of magic, [[myth]], wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/fantasyfilms.html Fantasy Films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgenres==
Several sub-categories of fantasy films can be identified, although the delineations between these subgenres, much as in fantasy literature, are somewhat fluid.

The most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are [[High fantasy|High Fantasy]] and [[Sword and sorcery|Sword and Sorcery]].{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} Both categories typically employ quasi-medieval settings, wizards, magical creatures and other elements commonly associated with fantasy stories.

High Fantasy films tend to feature a more richly developed fantasy world, and may also be more character-oriented or thematically complex. Often, they feature a hero of humble origins and a clear distinction between good and evil set against each other in an epic struggle. Many scholars cite [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' novel as the prototypical modern example of High Fantasy in literature, and the recent [[Peter Jackson]] [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film adaptation]] of the books is a good example of the High Fantasy subgenre on the silver screen.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Conan the barbarian.jpg|thumb|left|''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982), a typical Sword and Sorcery film]] --&gt;
Sword and Sorcery movies tend to be more plot-driven than high fantasy and focus heavily on action sequences, often pitting a physically powerful but unsophisticated warrior against an evil wizard or other supernaturally endowed enemy.  Although Sword and Sorcery films sometimes describe an epic battle between good and evil similar to those found in many High Fantasy movies, they may alternately present the hero as having more immediate motivations, such as the need to protect a vulnerable maiden or village, or even being driven by the desire for vengeance.

The [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|1982 film adaptation]] of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'', for example, is a personal (non-epic) story concerning the hero's quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac—while saving a beautiful princess in the process.  Some critics refer to such films by the term [[Sword and sandal|Sword and Sandal]] rather than Sword and Sorcery, although others would maintain that the Sword and Sandal label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth, and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever.  To some, the term Sword and Sandal has pejorative connotations, designating a film with a low-quality script, bad acting, and poor production values.

Another important subgenre of fantasy films that has become more popular in recent years is [[contemporary fantasy]].  Such films feature magical effects or supernatural occurrences happening in the "real" world of today.

[[Films with live action and animation]] such as [[Disney]]'s ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', and the [[Robert Zemeckis]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' are also fantasy films although are more often referred to as Live action/animation hybrids (2 of those are also classified as musicals).

Fantasy films set in the [[afterlife]], called [[Bangsian fantasy|Bangsian Fantasy]], are less common, although films such as the 1991 [[Albert Brooks]] comedy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' would likely qualify.  Other uncommon subgenres include [[Historical fantasy|Historical Fantasy]] and [[Romantic fantasy|Romantic Fantasy]], although 2003's ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' successfully incorporated elements of both.

As noted above, superhero movies and fairy tale films might each be considered subgenres of fantasy films, although most would classify them as altogether separate movie genres.

==Fantasy movies and the film industry==

As a cinematic genre, fantasy has traditionally not been regarded as highly as the related genre of science fiction film.  Undoubtedly, the fact that until recently fantasy films often suffered from the "[[Peplum (film genre)|Sword and Sandal]]" afflictions of inferior production values, over-the-top acting, and decidedly poor special effects was a significant factor in fantasy film's low regard.

Since the early 2000s, however, the genre has gained new respectability in a way, driven principally by the successful adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'' and J.K. Rowling's ''Harry Potter'' series. Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy is notable due to its ambitious scope, serious tone, and thematic complexity. These pictures achieved phenomenal commercial and critical success, and the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third installment]] of the trilogy became the first fantasy film ever to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The ''Harry Potter'' series has been a tremendous financial success, has achieved critical acclaim for its design, thematic sophistication and emotional depth, grittier realism and darkness, narrative complexity, and characterization, and boasts an enormous and loyal fanbase.

Following the success of these ventures, Hollywood studios have greenlighted additional big-budget productions in the genre.  These have included adaptations of the first, second, and third books in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series and the teen novel ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', as well as adaptations of [[Susan Cooper]]'s ''[[The Dark Is Rising (film)|The Dark Is Rising]]'', [[Cornelia Funke]]'s ''[[Inkheart]]'', [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[The Golden Compass]]'', [[Holly Black]]'s ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', Nickelodeon's TV show ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', and the ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' segment (along with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s original poem) ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''

Fantasy movies in recent years, such as ''The Lord of the Rings'' films, the first and third ''Narnia'' adaptations, and the first, second, fourth and seventh ''Harry Potter'' adaptations have most often been released in November and December. This is in contrast to science fiction films, which are often released during the northern hemisphere summer (June–August). All three installments of the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' fantasy films, however, were released in July 2003, July 2006, and May 2007 respectively, and the latest releases in the ''Harry Potter'' series were released in July 2007 and July 2009. The huge commercial success of these pictures may indicate a change in Hollywood's approach to big-budget fantasy film releases.

==History==
{{Fantasyfilmlist}}

Fantasy films have a history almost as old as the medium itself.  However, fantasy films were relatively few and far between until the 1980s, when high-tech filmmaking techniques and increased audience interest caused the genre to flourish.

What follows are some notable Fantasy films. For a more complete list see: [[List of fantasy films]]

===1900–1920s===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:TheWizardofOzDVDcover.jpg|thumb|''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939), a fantasy film classic]] --&gt;
In the era of [[silent film]], the earliest fantasy films were those made by French film pioneer [[Georges Méliès]] from 1903. The most famous of these was 1902's ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. In the Golden Age of Silent film (1918–1926) the most outstanding fantasy films were [[Douglas Fairbanks]]' ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1924), [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924), and ''[[Der müde Tod|Destiny]]'' (1921). Other notables in the genre were [[F.W. Murnau]]'s romantic ghost story ''[[Phantom (1922 film)|Phantom]]'', ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' starring [[Elmo Lincoln]], and [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Satan (film)|The Sorrows of Satan]]''.

===1930s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1930s}}
Following the advent of [[sound film]]s, audiences of all ages were introduced from 1937's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  Also notable of the era, the iconic 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' borrows heavily from the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] subgenre of fantasy fiction as does such films as the 1935 adaptation of H. Rider Haggard's novel ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' about an African expedition that discovers an immortal queen known as Ayesha "She who must be obeyed". [[Frank Capra]]'s 1937 picture ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' transported audiences to the [[Himalaya]]n fantasy kingdom of [[Shangri-La]], where the residents magically never age. Other noteworthy fantasy films of the 30s include ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' in 1932 starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]] starting a successful series of talking pictures based on the fantasy-adventure novels by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and the [[G. W. Pabst]] directed ''[[The Mistress of Atlantis]]'' from 1932. 1932 saw the release of the [[Universal Studios]] monster movie ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' which combined horror with a romantic fantasy twist. more light-hearted and comedic affairs from the decade include films like 1934s romantic drama film [[Death Takes a Holiday]] where [[Fredric March]] plays Death who takes a human body to experience life for three days and 1937s ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' where a man is haunted by two fun-loving ghosts who try to make his life a little more exciting.

===1940s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1940s}}
The 1940s then saw several full-color fantasy films produced by [[Alexander Korda]], including ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), a film on par with ''The Wizard of Oz'', and ''[[Jungle Book (1942 film)|Jungle Book]]'' (1942).  In 1946, [[Jean Cocteau]]'s classic adaptation of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' won praise for its [[Surrealism|surreal]] elements and for transcending the boundaries of the [[fairy tale]] genre.  ''[[Sinbad the Sailor (1947 film)|Sinbad the Sailor]]'' (1947), starring [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], has the feel of a fantasy film though it does not actually have any [[fantastic]] elements.

Several other pictures featuring supernatural encounters and aspects of Bangsian fantasy were produced in the 1940s during [[World War II]].  These include ''[[Beyond Tomorrow (1940 film)|Beyond Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941 film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'', and ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', all from 1941, ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' the musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' (1943), the comedy ''[[The Horn Blows at Midnight]]'' and romances such as ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'' (1947), ''[[One Touch of Venus (film)|One Touch of Venus]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Jennie]]'', both 1948.

An astonishing anticpation of the full "sword and sorcery" genre was made in 1941 in Italy by Alessandro Blasetti. ''[[La Corona di Ferro (1941 film)|La Corona di Ferro]]'' presents the struggles of two imaginary kingdoms around the legendary Iron Crown (historically the ancient crown of Italy), with war, cruelty, betrayal, heroism, sex, magic and mysticism, a whirl of events taken from every possible fairy tale and legend source Blasetti could find. This movie is unlike anything done before; indeed, considering that it was finished fifteen years before the publication of Lord Of The Rings, its invention of a vast, national epic mythology is an act of genius. And while the storytelling is rough - due to the need to insert everything - and the resources limited, Blasetti shows how to make a little go a long way through beautifully staged and designed battle and crowd scenes.

Although it's not classified as a fantasy film, [[Gene Kelly]]'s ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]'' had a fantasy sequence called "The King who Couldn't Dance" in which Gene did a song and dance number with [[Jerry Mouse]] from [[Tom and Jerry]].

Because these movies do not feature elements common to high fantasy or [[sword and sorcery]] pictures, some modern critics do not consider them to be examples of the fantasy genre.

===1950s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1950s}}
In the 1950s there were a few major fantasy films, including ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' and ''[[The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T]]'', the latter penned by [[Dr. Seuss]].  Jean Cocteau's [[Orphée|Orphic Trilogy]], begun in 1930 and completed in 1959, is based on [[Greek mythology]] and could be classified either as fantasy or surrealist film, depending on how the boundaries between these genres are drawn. Russian fantasy director [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] created three mythological epics from Russian fairytales, ''[[Sadko]]'' (1953), ''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'' (1956), and ''[[Sampo (film)|Sampo]]'' (1959). Japanese director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s 1953 film ''[[Ugetsu Monogatari (film)|Ugetsu Monogatari]]'' draws on Japanese classical ghost stories of love and betrayal.

Other notable pictures from the 1950s that feature fantastic elements and are sometimes classified as fantasy are ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'' (1950), featuring a [[púca]] of [[Celtic mythology]]; ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'', the 1951 adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''; and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1957 masterpiece, ''[[The Seventh Seal]]''. Disney's 1951 animated film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' is also a fantasy classic.

There were also a number of lower budget fantasies produced in the 1950s, typically based on Greek or Arabian legend.  The most notable of these may be 1958's ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'', featuring special effects by [[Ray Harryhausen]] and music by [[Bernard Herrmann]].

===1960s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1960s}}
Harryhausen worked on a series of fantasy films in the 1960s, most importantly ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963). Many critics have identified this film as Harryhausen's masterwork for its [[stop-motion]] animated statues, skeletons, [[harpies]], [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]], and other mythological creatures. Other Harryhausen fantasy and science fantasy collaborations from the decade include the 1961 adaptation of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', the critically panned ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' starring [[Raquel Welch]], and ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969).

Capitalising on the success of the [[sword and sandal]] genre several Italian [[B-movie]]s based on classical myth were made, including the ''[[Maciste]]'' series. Otherwise, the 1960s were almost entirely devoid of fantasy films. The fantasy picture ''[[7 Faces of Dr. Lao]]'', in which [[Tony Randall]] portrayed several characters from Greek mythology, was released in 1964. But the 1967 adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' removed most of the fantasy elements from [[T. H. White]]'s classic ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', on which the musical had been based. The 1960s also saw a new adaption of Haggard's ''[[She (1965 film)|She]]'' in 1965 starring [[Ursula Andress]] as the immortal "She who must be obeyed" and was followed by a sequel in 1968 ''[[The Vengeance of She]]'' based loosely on the novel [[Ayesha: The Return of She]] both produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]], 1968 also saw the release of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' based on a story by [[Ian Fleming]] with a script from [[Roald Dahl]].

===1970s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1970s}}
Fantasy elements of [[Arthurian legend]] were again featured, albeit absurdly, in 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. Harryhausen also returned to the silver screen in the 1970s with two additional ''Sinbad'' fantasies, ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1974) and ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977). The animated movie ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'' (1977) had limited success at the box office but achieved status as a [[cult film]]. There was also ''[[The Noah]]'' (1975) which was never released theatrically but became a [[cult favorite]] when it was finally released on DVD in 2006. Some would consider 1977's ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh God!]]'', starring [[George Burns]] to be a fantasy film, and ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978) was a successful Bangsian fantasy remake of 1941's ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' (not 1943's ''Heaven Can Wait'').

A few low budget "Lost World" pictures were made in the 1970s, such as 1975's ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]''. Otherwise, the fantasy genre was largely absent from mainstream movies in this decade, although 1971's ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' and ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' were two fantasy pictures in the public eye the former being predominantly from the same team who did ''Mary Poppins'' the latter again being from Roald Dahl in both script and novel.

===1980s===
{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1980s}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Ladyhawke ver1.jpg|200px|thumb|As fantasy film's box office draw increased, so did its star power. 1985's ''[[Ladyhawke]]'', for example, starred [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Rutger Hauer]].]] --&gt;
1980s fantasy films were initially characterised by directors finding a new spin on established mythologies. Ray Harryhausen brought the monsters of Greek legends to life in ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' while Arthurian lore returned to the screen in [[John Boorman]]'s 1981 ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''. Films such as [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1985 ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' and [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1981–1986 trilogy of fantasy epics (''[[Time Bandits]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'') explored a new artist-driven style featuring surrealist imagery and thought-provoking plots. The modern [[sword and sorcery]] boom began around the same time with 1982's ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' followed by ''[[Krull (film)|Krull]]'' and ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' in 1983, as well as a boom in [[fairy tale]]-like fantasy films such as ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985), ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), and ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988).

The 1980s also started a trend in mixing modern settings and [[action movie]] effects with exotic fantasy-like concepts. ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), directed by [[John Carpenter]] and starring [[Kurt Russell]], combined humor, martial arts and classic Chinese folklore in a modern Chinatown setting. ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', a film about immortal Scottish swordsmen, was released the same year.

[[Jim Henson]] produced two iconic fantasy films in the 80s, the solemn ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' and the more whimsical and lofty ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''. Meanwhile, [[Robert Zemeckis]] helmed ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', featuring various famous cartoon characters from animation's "Golden Age," including [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Droopy]], [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Tweety Pie]], and [[Jiminy Cricket]], among others.

'''''Fatal Attraction''''' is a 1987 American [[psychological]]  [[erotic thriller|erotic thriller film]] directed by [[Adrian Lyne]] from a screenplay written by [[James Dearden]], based on his 1980 short film ''[[Diversion (1980 film)|Diversion]]''. Starring [[Michael Douglas]], [[Glenn Close]] and [[Anne Archer]], the film centers on a married man who has a weekend affair with a woman who refuses to allow it to end and becomes obsessed with him.

''Fatal Attraction'' was released on September 18, 1987 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received generally positive critical response and generated controversy at the time of its release. The film became a huge box office success, grossing $320.1 million against a $14 million budget, becoming the [[1987 in film|highest grossing film of 1987 worldwide]].

At the [[60th Academy Awards]], it received six nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Close), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Archer), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

==Plot==
Dan Gallagher is a successful, happily married [[Manhattan]] lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra "Alex" Forrest, an editor for a [[Publishing|publishing company]]. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Though it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex starts clinging to him.

Dan spends a second unplanned evening with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her bandage the cuts and then leaves. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'', but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. Alex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.

Dan moves his family to [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a [[restraining order]] against Alex (claiming that it is "for a client"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without [[probable cause]], and that the "client" has to own up to his [[adultery]].

At one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy. Enraged, she demands that Dan leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she realizes that she does not know where Ellen is. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection. Beth gets injured and is then hospitalized. Alex later takes Ellen home, asking her for a kiss on the cheek. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan and they return home.

Dan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan confronts them about having her arrested.

Beth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears, again with the kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of Beth, nervously fidgeting (which causes Alex to cut her own leg) and then attacks Beth. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife. Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun, shoots Alex in the chest, killing her. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of them and Ellen.

==Production==
===Writing===
The film was adapted by [[James Dearden]] (with some help from [[Nicholas Meyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =https://books.google.com/?id=WW3on1yWkPoC&amp;pg=PT139&amp;q=nicholas%20meyer%20the%20making%20of%20fatal%20attraction|title=The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood|isbn=9781101133477|last1=Meyer|first1=Nicholas|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from ''[[Diversion (1980 film)|Diversion]]'', an earlier 1980 short film by Dearden for British television. In Meyer's book "The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood", he explains that in late 1986 producer [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions for the script including a new ending for the movie. A few weeks later he met with director [[Adrian Lyne]] and gave him some additional suggestions. Ultimately Meyer was asked to redraft the script on the basis of his suggestions, which ended up being the shooting script.

===Casting===
Producers Sherry Lansing and Stanley Jaffe both had serious doubts about casting Glenn Close because they didn't think she could be sexual enough for the role of Alex.&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; Close was persistent, so that after meeting with Jaffe several times in New York, she was asked to fly out to Los Angeles to read with Michael Douglas in front of Adrian Lyne and Lansing. Before the audition, she let her naturally frizzy hair "go wild" because she was impatient at putting it up, and she wore a slimming black dress she thought made her look "fabulous" to audition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.ew.com/article/2011/10/07/reunion-fatal-attraction/| title=From the archives: Fatal Attraction’s Glenn Close, Michael Douglas reunite| author=Jess Cagle| publisher=Entertainment Weekly| date=2011-10-07| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impressed Lansing, because Close "came in looking completely different...right away she was into the part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ivSI9tY2OI&amp;t=815s| title=Fatal Attraction (1987) The Making Of Part 1 &amp; 2| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2017-09-05| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close and Douglas performed a scene from early in the script, where Alex flirts with Dan in a café, and Close came away "convinced my career was over, that I was finished, I had completely blown my chances."&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; Lansing and Lyne, however, were both convinced that she was right for the role; Lyne stated that "an extraordinary erotic transformation took place. She was this tragic, bewildering mix of sexuality and rage—I watched Alex come to life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-dark-side-of-love-vol-28-no-17/| title=The Dark Side of Love| author=James S. Kunen| publisher=People Magazine| date=1987-10-26| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for her role, Glenn Close consulted several psychologists, hoping to understand Alex's psyche and motivations. She was uncomfortable with the bunny boiling scene, which she thought was too extreme, but she was assured on consulting the psychologists that such an action was entirely possible and that Alex's behavior corresponded to someone who had experienced incestual sexual abuse as a child.&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt;

===Alternate ending===
Alex Forrest was originally scripted slashing her throat at the film's end with the knife Dan had left on the counter, so as to make it appear that Dan had murdered her. After seeing her husband being taken away by police, Beth finds a revealing cassette tape that Alex sent Dan in which she threatens to kill herself. Upon realizing Alex's intentions, Beth takes the tape to the police, which acquits Dan of the murder. The last scene shows, in flashback, Alex taking her own life by slashing her throat while listening to ''Madame Butterfly''.

After doing test screenings, Joseph Farrell (who handled the test screenings) suggested Paramount to reshoot a new ending.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/business/joseph-farrell-dies-at-76-used-market-research-to-shape-films.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/07/magazine/tm-30884&lt;/ref&gt; Alex was killed by a gunshot during the three-week reshoot of the action scene. Alex's murder by Beth juxtaposes the relationship between the two characters; with Alex being victimized and Beth violently protecting her family.&lt;ref name = autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the 2002 Special Edition [[DVD]], Close comments that she had doubts about re-shooting the film's ending because she believed the character would "self-destruct and commit suicide".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Close eventually gave in on her concerns, and filmed the new sequence after having fought against the change for two weeks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Close has described how protective she was of her character, whom she "never thought of as a villain",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IY8lxuo_yA&amp;t=1s| title=Fatal Attraction Reunion Interview| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2010-03-06| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that: "I wasn't playing a generality, I wasn't playing a cliché. I was playing a very specific, deeply disturbed, fragile human being, whom I had grown to love."&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; However, though the ending made Alex into a "psychopath" against Close's wishes, she has also acknowledged that the film would not have experienced the enormous success it did without the new ending, because it gave the audience "...a sense of catharsis, a hope, that somehow the family unit would survive the nightmare." &lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt;

The film was initially released in Japan with the original ending. The original ending also appeared on a special edition [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] release by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1992, and was included on the film's DVD release a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition) (1987)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Attraction-Special-Collectors-Michael-Douglas/dp/B00003CXA0/|website=[[Amazon (website)|Amazon]] (United States)|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles===
In the earlier phase of the film, when it was under the title ''Diversion'', Alex committed suicide in the end. After showing this version to a test audience, they felt this was not a good enough way for Alex to go. Instead, the producers decided to shoot the last scene as a more vengeful and violent death for Alex.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bromley |first=Susan |last2=Hewitt |first2=Pamela |title=Fatal Attraction: The Sinister side of Women's Conflict about Career and Family |journal=The Journal of Popular Culture |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=17–23 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1992.2603_17.x |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close has spoken of the decision to change the ending as "a terrible betrayal of the character that I created...I desperately wanted to remind the audience that this character was more self-destructive than destructive."

After spending $1.3 million, Alex's death and Beth's survival was determined to be the official ending of the film. However, this presented a more traditionalist message to the audience. This new ending gave the idea that a professional woman and a wife/mother are two very divided choices. With Alex being shot by Beth, in the official ending of the film, this is viewed as death to the bad woman (a career woman), and a win for the good woman (a wife/mother).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Close insisted on adding the shot in the confrontation scene where Alex mutilates her own leg with a kitchen knife to show that she was "as self-destructive as she was aggressive".&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"/&gt; However, according to Close, "the image of Alex wielding that knife was too horrifying for any subtle nuance, and it transformed her into a psychopath as a result. And she became the most hated woman in America."&lt;ref name="Oxford Union"&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDWDhntzc-w| title=Glenn Close Full Address &amp; Q&amp;A Oxford Union| author=Oxford Union| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2018-05-04| access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Anchor|Reaction|Reception}} 
After its release, ''Fatal Attraction'' engendered much discussion of the potential consequences of infidelity. Some [[Feminism|feminists]], meanwhile, did not appreciate what they felt was the depiction of a strong career woman who is at the same time [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]].&lt;ref name = autogenerated1&gt;Remembering Fatal Attraction 2002 DVD Special Features&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist [[Susan Faludi]] discussed the film in ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', arguing that major changes had been made to the original plot in order to make Alex wholly negative, while Dan's carelessness and the lack of compassion and responsibility raised no discussion, except for a small number of fundamentalist men's groups who said that Dan was eventually forced to own up to his irresponsibility in that "everyone pays the piper".&lt;ref&gt;See "Fatal and Foetal Visions: The Backlash in the Movies", Chapter 5 of ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', published by Chatto &amp; Windus, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist scholars have also stated that in many ways the film has used its correlation of career woman to psychopathy in order to create its horror element. As described by Deborah Jermyn, the use of the "monstrous-feminine" as a tool in the 1980s horror genre was a way to portray a man's worst fears', where a woman has rejected familial values and reverted to hysteria, questioning the true values of woman and what it means to be feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/screen/37.3.251 |title=Rereading the bitches from hell: A feminist appropriation of the female psychopath |journal=Screen |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=251–67 |year=1996 |last1=Jermyn |first1=D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many ways that Alex (Close) portrays womanhood in a more traditional light, with the character befriending her lover's wife and drinking tea in their home, while contrastingly, his wife slowly turns more assertive and violent. The fluidity of these female characters' monstrous and fearful tendencies is what makes the "fear" more real, according to feminist study. The fact that a woman who rejects traditional womanhood for a more career-based lifestyle can swap in just a matter of moments to the "housewife", and vice-versa provides the horror that this movie begs. Women feared both becoming this career-driven "monster" and being the oblivious housewife, while men feared that their companion could in fact be both of these things at once.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The film has left an indelible impression on male viewers. Close was quoted in 2008 as saying, "Men still come up to me and say, 'You scared the shit out of me.' Sometimes they say, 'You saved my marriage.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Close says boiling that bunny saved marriages | url = http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article79973.ece | work = [[The Times]] | date = 2008-01-06 | accessdate = 2010-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film spent eight weeks at #1 in the U.S. and eventually grossed $156.6 million domestically, making the film the second-highest-grossing film of 1987 in the U.S. behind ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''. It also grossed $163.5 million overseas for a total gross of $320.1 million, making it the biggest film of 1987 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1987&amp;p=.htm | title = ''Fatal Attraction'' | publisher = ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' | accessdate = 2007-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn led to several similarly-themed psychological thrillers being made throughout the late 1980s and 1990s.

Overall, the film received positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 78% based on reviews from 46 critics, with the site's consensus "A potboiler in the finest sense, ''Fatal Attraction'' is a sultry, juicy thriller that's hard to look away from once it gets going."&lt;ref name=Tomatoes&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction (1987)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1007141-fatal_attraction/|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On [[Metacritic]], the film has a rating of 67/100 based on reviews from 16 critics.&lt;ref name=Metacritic&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatal Attraction Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/fatal-attraction|website=Metacritic|date=18 September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic analysis===
The character of Alex Forrest has been discussed by psychiatrists and film experts, and has been used as a film illustration for the condition [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="RobinsonFG"&gt;{{cite book | last = Robinson | first = David J. | title = The Field Guide to Personality Disorders | publisher = Rapid Psychler Press | year = 1999 | pages = 113 | isbn = 0-9680324-6-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character displays the behaviors of impulsivity, emotional lability, frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, frequent severe anger, [[self-harm]]ing, and changing from idealization to devaluation; these traits are consistent with the diagnosis, although generally aggression to the self rather than others is a more common feature in borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name="illness"&gt;{{cite book | title = Movies and Mental Illness: Using Films to Understand Psychopathology |vauthors=Wedding D, Boyd MA, Niemiec RM | year = 2005 | publisher = Hogrefe | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-88937-292-6 | page = 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have instead considered the character to be a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].&lt;ref name = autogenerated1/&gt;

As referenced in Orit Kamirs' ''Every Breath You Take: Stalking Narratives and the Law'', "Glenn Close's character Alex is quite deliberately made to be an [[erotomania]]c. Gelder reports that Glenn Close 'consulted three separate shrinks for an inner profile of her character, who is meant to be suffering from a form of obsessive condition known as de Clérambault's syndrome' (Gelder 1990, 93—94)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kamir | first = Orit | title = Every Breath You Take: Stalking Narratives and the Law | publisher = University of Michigan Press | year = 2001 | pages = 256 | isbn = 978-0-472-11089-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular term "bunny boiler", often used to describe an obsessive, spurned woman, derives from the scene where it is discovered that Alex has boiled the pet rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Anita|title=Fatal Attraction: My sympathy for the bunny-boiler|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10712272/Fatal-Attraction-My-sympathy-for-the-bunny-boiler.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Bunny boiler|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/bunny-boiler.html|website=phrases.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health and gender===
As Alex Forrest is portrayed as a psychotic, love-obsessed woman seeking revenge, behaviors that represent [[stalking]] are present. According to a study of 148 people conducted by Randy and Lori Sansone, over half of the people who were found guilty of stalking-related incidents also experienced [[borderline personality disorder]] among other [[mental health]] concerns. It can be noted that Alex Forrest's femininity was seen as toxic and fearful to the people in the film that she interacted with, which is a crucial representation of women as possessive and psychotic when it comes to dominance over a man. People who experience borderline personality disorder can also have higher risks of issues like [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=pmid20532158&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20532158 |pmc=2882283 |year=2010 |author1=Sansone |first1=R. A |title=Fatal attraction syndrome: Stalking behavior and borderline personality |journal=Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=42–6 |last2=Sansone |first2=L. A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, most stalking situations occur from people who were previously involved in relationships with the person who is being stalked, according to research by Spitzberg and Vekslet.&lt;ref name=pmid17619634&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17619634 |year=2007 |author1=Spitzberg |first1=B. H |title=The personality of pursuit: Personality attributions of unwanted pursuers and stalkers |journal=Violence and victims |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=275–89 |last2=Veksler |first2=A. E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Alex Forrest, her obsession was for a man that she could not have due to other circumstances in his life. These circumstances, Beth and Ellen, are his family, and though Alex and Dan did not have a deep or meaningful relationship, Alex's clinginess caused assumptions of mental health issues.

Alex's representation of poor mental health in this film shows exactly the clinginess and attachment that people with stalking behaviors present. Slitting her wrists and pretending to be pregnant are manipulative techniques that someone with a personality and attachment disorder would use to regain the desired intimacy with a former partner. Women tend to stalk former partners as well as the women associated with those former partners, much like one can see in the 1992 film ''[[Single White Female]]''.&lt;ref name=pmid11729025&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.12.2056 |pmid=11729025 |title=A Study of Women Who Stalk |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=12 |pages=2056–60 |year=2001 |last1=Purcell |first1=Rosemary |last2=Pathé |first2=Michele |last3=Mullen |first3=Paul E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Impression, Sunrise''''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Impression, soleil levant'') is a painting by [[Claude Monet]] first shown at what would become known as the "Exhibition of the Impressionists" in Paris in April, 1874. The painting is credited with inspiring the name of the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. 

''Impression, Sunrise'' depicts the port of [[Le Havre]], Monet's hometown. It is now displayed at the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmottan.fr/uk/Claude_Monet_-musee-2517 ''Impression, Sunrise'', Musée Marmottan Monet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Atelier Nadar 35BoulevardDesCapucines 1860 Nadar.jpg|thumbnail|left|The home of photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]], where the 1874 exhibition took place]][[File:Sémaphore et grues sur le port du Havre.jpg|thumbnail|right|Modern view of the port of Le Havre]]
Monet visited his hometown of [[Le Havre]] in the Northwest of France in 1872 and proceeded to create a series of works depicting the port of Le Havre. The six painted canvases depict the port "during dawn, day, dusk, and dark and from varying viewpoints, some from the water itself and others from a hotel room looking down over the port".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brettell|first1=Richard R.|title=Impression : painting quickly in France 1860-1890|date=2000|publisher=Yale Univ. Press [u.a.]|location=New Haven [u.a.]|isbn=0300084463|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Impression, Sunrise'' became the most famous in the series after being debuted in April 1874 in Paris at an exhibition by the group "Painters, Sculptors, Engravers etc. Inc."&lt;ref name="H.N. Abrams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=Impressionism : beneath the surface|date=1994|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-81092715-2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among thirty participants, the exhibition was led by [[Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Alfred Sisley]], and showed over two hundred works that were seen by about 4,000 people, including some rather unsympathetic critics.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=edited by Janis|title=Readings in nineteenth-century art|date=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-13-104142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 the painting was stolen from the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] by Philippe Jamin and Youssef Khimoun. It was recovered and returned to the museum in 1990,&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=The World's Greatest Art Heists|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/12/art-theft-museums-biz-cx_af_0212artheists.html|accessdate=16 November 2010|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=12 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put back on display in 1991.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Travel Advisory - Stolen Paintings Back in Paris Heists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/28/travel/travel-advisory-stolen-paintings-back-in-paris.html|accessdate=16 November 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 April 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Impression'' and Impressionism==
[[File:Exposition1874affiche.jpg|thumbnail|right|Catalogue for the 1874 Impressionist Exhibition ]]
Monet claimed that he titled the painting ''Impression, Sunrise'' due to his hazy painting style in his depiction of the subject: "They asked me for a title for the catalogue, it couldn't really be taken for a view of Le Havre, and I said: 'Put ''Impression''.'"  In addition to this explanation for the title of the work, art historian Paul Smith claims that Monet might have named the painting ''Impression'' to excuse his painting from accusations of being unfinished or lacking descriptive detail, but Monet received these criticisms regardless of the title.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=Impressionism : beneath the surface|date=1994|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-81092715-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the title of the painting seemed to be chosen in haste for the catalogue, the term "Impressionism" was not new. It had been used for some time to describe the effect of paintings from the [[Barbizon school]]. Both associated with the school, [[Charles-François Daubigny|Daubigny]] and [[Manet]] had been known to use the term to describe their own works.&lt;ref name="The impressionists"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Michael|title=The impressionists|date=1983|publisher=Chartwell Books|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0-7148-2230-2|page=124|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In critic [[Louis Leroy]]'s review of the 1874 exhibition, "The Exhibition of the Impressionists" for the newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]'', he used "Impressionism" to describe the new style of work displayed, which he said was typified by Monet’s painting of the same name.

Before the 1860s and the debut of ''Impression, Sunrise'', the term "impressionism" was originally used to describe the effect of a natural scene on a painter, and the effect of a painting on the viewer. By the 1860s, "impression" was used by transference to describe a painting which relayed such an effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkin|first1=John House ; with an essay by David|title=Impressionists by the sea|date=2007|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|location=London|isbn=978-1-903973-88-2|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, impression came to describe the movement as a whole.

Initially used to describe and deprecate a movement, the term Impressionism "was immediately taken up by all parties" to describe the style,&lt;ref name="The impressionists"/&gt; and Monet’s ''Impression, Sunrise'' considered to encapsulate the start of the movement and its name.

==Subject and interpretation==
[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|frameless|left]]
''Impression, Sunrise'' depicts the port of Le Havre at sunrise, the two small rowboats in the foreground and the red sun being the focal elements. In the middle ground, more fishing boats are included, while in the background on the left side of the painting are clipper ships with tall masts. Behind them are other misty shapes that "are not trees but smoke stacks of packboats and steamships, while on the right in the distance are other masts and chimneys silhouetted against the sky."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt; In order to show these features of industry, Monet eliminated existing houses on the left side of the jetty, leaving the background unobscured.

Following the defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, the regeneration of France was exemplified in the thriving port of Le Havre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Art historian Paul Tucker suggests that the contrast of elements like the steamboats and cranes in the background to the fishermen in the foreground represent these political implications: "Monet may have seen this painting of a highly commercial site as an answer to the postwar calls for patriotic action and an art that could lead. For while it is a poem of light and atmosphere, the painting can also be seen as an ode to the power and beauty of a revitalized France."&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt;

The representation of Le Havre, hometown of Monet and a center of industry and commerce, celebrates the "renewed strength and beauty of the country... Monet’s ultimate utopian statement."  Art demonstrating France’s revitalization, Monet’s depiction of Le Havre’s sunrise mirrors the renewal of France.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt;

==Style==
The hazy scene of ''Impression, Sunrise'' strayed from traditional landscape painting and classic, idealized beauty. Paul Smith suggested that with this style, Monet meant to express "other beliefs about artistic quality which might be tied to the ideologies being consolidated by the emergent bourgeoisie from which he came."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|title=Impressionism : beneath the surface|date=1994|publisher=H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-81092715-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loose brush strokes meant to suggest the scene rather than to [[Mimesis|mimetically]] represent it demonstrate the emergent Impressionist movement. In the wake of an emergent industrialization in France, this style expressed innovative individuality. Considering this, Smith claims that "Impression, Sunrise was about Monet’s search for spontaneous expression, but was guided by definite and historically specific ideas about what spontaneous expression was."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Colour===
The group of studies made from Monet’s hotel room were made from canvas with a base layer of gray in different tones. The layered effect provides depth in spite of imprecise details, creating a rich and tangible environment that seems like Le Havre, though not an exact likeness. Gordon and Forge discuss boundaries and the use of color in ''Impression, Sunrise'', claiming that
sky and water in ''Impression, Sunrise'' are hardly distinguishable, boundaries between objects are not obvious, and the paint "becomes the place" and effect, the colors of the paint melding together in "its glooming, opalescent oneness, its foggy blankness, its featureless, expectant emptiness that resembles, for the painter, an empty, uninflected canvas." They comment that the accents of blue-gray and orange cutting through the haze "are like last-minute revelations that had to wait, not only for the particular glimmer of orange to burn its way through the fog and find its reflective path onto the water and Monet’s eye but for the canvas itself, pregnant with the foggy space outside, to be ready to receive it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Robert|last2=Forge|first2=Andrew|title=Monet|date=1983|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1312-7|edition=3. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luminance===
[[Image:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant, 1872 BW.jpg|thumb|Desaturated version of the painting: the sun is virtually invisible.&lt;ref name=dalto/&gt;]]
Although it may seem that the sun is the brightest spot on the canvas, it is in fact, when measured with a photometer, the same brightness (or [[luminance]]) as the sky.&lt;ref name=dalto&gt;D'Alto, Aaron. [http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/27926177/The-Monet-Effect "Odyssey"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', December 2007. Retrieved 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Livingstone|Dr. Margaret Livingstone]], a professor of [[Neuroscience|neurobiology]] at [[Harvard University]], said "If you make a black and white copy of ''Impression: Sunrise'', the Sun disappears [almost] entirely."&lt;ref name=dalto/&gt;

Livingstone said that this caused the painting to have a very realistic quality, as the older part of the visual cortex in the brain&amp;nbsp;— shared with the majority of other mammals&amp;nbsp;— registers only luminance and not colour, so that the sun in the painting would be invisible to it, while it is just the newer part of the [[visual cortex]]&amp;nbsp;— only found in humans and other [[primate]]s&amp;nbsp;— which perceives colour.&lt;ref name=dalto/&gt;

==Criticism==
Most critics did not think ''Impression, Sunrise'' was one of the most notable pieces; it was briefly discussed only five times in all the reviews of the exhibition.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson" /&gt; However, the reviews of the exhibition and of Monet's painting both provide insight into the development of the movement and Monet's work and development as an artist.

Philippe Burty for ''La République Française'' wrote about the opening of the show, complementing the ambiance of the space and the paintings working together: "The walls of the rooms, covered in brownish red woolen fabric, are extremely well suited to paintings. The daylight enters the rooms from the sides, as it does in apartments."&lt;ref name="Stuckey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuckey|first1=edited by Charles F.|title=Monet : a retrospective|date=1985|publisher=Hugh Lauter Levin Associates|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-385-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this idyllic perspective of the exhibition was not the view of all critics. [[Louis Leroy]], for ''[[Le Charivari]]'', is often quoted in his review on Monet's work. His article "The Impressionist Exhibition" is written as a dialogue from the imaginary perspective of an old-fashioned painter, shocked at the works of Monet and his associates:

"'Ah! This is it, this is it!: he cried in front of n. 98. 'This one is Papa Vincent's favorite! What is this a painting of? Look in the catalogue.' 
'''Impression, Sunrise''.' 
'Impression-- I knew it. I was just saying to myself, if I'm impressed, there must be an impression in there… And what freedom, what ease in the brushwork! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more labored than this seascape!"&lt;ref name="Stuckey" /&gt;

Leroy's review is a covert backhand at the progressiveness of ''Impression, Sunrise'', and is often attributed with the using the term impressionism for the first time.

[[Jules Castagnary]] for ''[[Le Siècle]]'' wrote that the group of painters could be described by no other word beside the new term ''impressionists'', since they rendered the "sensation evoked by the landscape" rather than the landscape. He claimed that "The very word has entered their language: not landscape, but impression, in the title given in the catalog for M. Monet's Sunrise. From this point of view, they have left reality behind for a realm of pure idealism",  typified by Monet's ''Impression, Sunrise''.&lt;ref name="Stuckey" /&gt;

[[Théodore Duret]] wrote that rendering idealized impressions instead of landscapes is what epitomises Monet's work and the impressionist movement. Considering ''Impression, Sunrise'' and Monet's work following the 1874 exhibition, Duret wrote "it is certainly the peculiar qualities of Claude Monet's paintings which first suggested [the term impressionism]". Claiming that "Monet is the Impressionist painter par excellence", Duret argued that Monet inspired a new way of seeing and painting, that Monet was "no longer painting merely the immobile and permanent aspect of a landscape, but also the fleeting appearances which the accidents of atmosphere present to him, Monet transmits a singularly lively and striking sensation of the observed scene."&lt;ref name="H.N. Abrams"/&gt;

==Monet after ''Impression''==
In an interview with Maurice Guillemot for ''La Revue Illustrée'', Monet reflected on his handling of landscape like the port of Le Havre in consideration of the movement and the 1874 exhibition: "A landscape is only an impression, instantaneous, hence the label they’ve given us-- all because of me, for that matter. I’d submitted something done out of my window at Le Havre, sunlight in the mist with a few masts in the foreground jutting up from the ships below. They wanted a title for the catalog; it couldn’t really pass as a view of Le Havre, so I answered: "Put down ''Impression''." Out of that they got impressionism, and the jokes proliferated...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stuckey|first1=edited by Charles F.|title=Monet : a retrospective|date=1985|publisher=Hugh Lauter Levin Associates|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-385-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:'Garden at Bordighera, Impression of Morning' by Claude Monet, 1884, Hermitage.JPG|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''Garden in Bordighera, Impression of Morning'', 1884, [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
Following 1874 and the rise of the Impressionist movement, Monet recalled ''Impression, Sunrise'' by naming other works with similar titles. The subtitles recalled ''Impression, Sunrise'' in style and influence, though their subjects varied. Examples of similarly titles works are ''Effet de brouillard, impression'' in 1879, ''L’Impression'' in 1883, ''Garden at Bordighera, Impression of Morning'' in 1884, ''Marine (impression)'' in 1887, and ''Fumées dans le brouillard, impression'' in 1904. These works then seemed as a continuation of his Le Havre scene, "one of the sequence of canvases in which he was seeking to capture the most fleeting natural effects, as a display of his painterly virtuosity."&lt;ref name="Impressionists by the sea"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkin|first1=John House ; with an essay by David|title=Impressionists by the sea|date=2007|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|location=London|isbn=978-1-903973-88-2|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evoking the name of ''Impression, Sunrise'', but also providing stylistic connections, the later paintings are similarly "quite summary and economical in handling, and depict particularly hazy or misty effects" that is characteristic of Monet’s impressionism in particular.&lt;ref name="Impressionists by the sea"/&gt;

While the movement and the painting initially garnered controversy, Monet’s ''Impression, Sunrise'' gave rise to the name and recognition of the [[Impressionist]] movement, arguably exemplifying more than any other work or artist the [[Impressionist]] movement as a whole in style, subject, and influence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The '''International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus''' was a small [[Europe]]an [[avant-garde]] [[art|artistic]] tendency that arose out of the breakup of [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]], and was initiated by contact between former COBRA member [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo of the Nuclear Art Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/pata.htm The Assault On Culture book by Stewart Home chapter on College of Pataphysics, Nuclear Art, IMIB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Asger Jorn recovered from [[tuberculosis]] in the autumn of 1952, he tried for a year to restart his career in [[Denmark]]. However, in autumn 1953 he moved to [[Villars-sur-Ollon]] in [[Switzerland]]. It was here he heard of the [[Ulm School of Design|Hochschule fur Gestaltung]] in [[Ulm]].&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larkin|first1=Ruth Baumeister; Paul|title=Fraternité avant tout.

He wishes to make an academy without painting, without research into the imagination, fantasy, signs, symbols – all he wants is technical instruction. In the name of experimental artists I intend to create an International Movement For An Imaginist Bauhaus."&lt;ref name=Home&gt;{{cite book|last1=Home|first1=Stewart|title=The Assault on Culture|publisher=Unpopular Books|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
*1954: Jorn finds a copy of ''Potlatch'', the information bulletin of the [[Letterist International]] at Baj's house. He then contacts Andre-Frank Connord, who puts him in contact with [[Guy Debord]] and [[Michèle Bernstein]].
*29 September 1955: IMIB is founded in [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]], [[Italy]] by Jorn, [[Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio]], and [[Piero Simondo]].
*July 1956: One issue of ''Eristica'', edited by Simondo, appears.
*28 July 1957: IMIB fused with the Letterist International and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] to form the [[Situationist International]]. Baj was excluded from this process.

[[Image:Assemblée des six-comtés painting.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Assembly of the Six Counties'', 1890, by Charles Alexander Smith.]]

'''''L'Assemblée des six-comtés''''' (French for "The Assembly of the Six Counties"), also known as '''''Manifestation des Canadiens contre le gouvernement anglais, à Saint-Charles, en 1837''''' ("Demonstration of the [[Canadien]]s against the English government, at Saint-Charles, in 1837"), is a large [[oil painting]] executed on [[canvas]] by [[Ontario]] artist [[Charles Alexander Smith]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mnba.qc.ca/Afficher.aspx?page=1702&amp;langue=en « Je me souviens ». When Art Imagines History]", in mnba.qc.ca, retrieved Sept. 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts the [[Assembly of the Six Counties]], an event in 1837, part of the [[history of Quebec]] and the [[Patriote movement]]. It is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] in [[Quebec City]].

==Composition==
The picture includes many elements of what is known about the Patriote movement and their time. It features a number of Patriote leaders, upon the stage at the right, with accurate appearance. Patriote leader [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] is shown in a speech to the crowd. At the bottom right stand three flags. From the left, [[Flag of France|the first]] represents the influence the Patriotes received from the [[French Revolution]], the second is the [[Patriote flag]] and [[Flag of the United States|the third]] embodies the admiration of the Patriote for the [[American Revolution]]. The Patriote flag remains a visual [[leitmotiv]] across the composition.

The right field profusely displays [[maple leaves]], a symbol of the [[French Canadian]]s of the time (they have now been discarded by their modern-day [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] and [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] successors because of their appropriation by the [[Canada|Canadian federation]]). In the same section is the [[Coat of arms of Quebec]], leaning upon the wooden stage structure (one [[anachronism|anachronistic]] detail, as this version, contemporary to the painting's execution, is the first arms of Quebec post-Confederation, granted in 1868).

The crowd, mesmerized and invigorated at the same time by Papineau's much celebrated oratory skills, holds many signs reading nationalist and independence slogans. Many in attendance wear the [[tuque]]s and [[Ceinture fléchée|ceintures fléchées]] belts characteristic of the Patriote [[symbology]]. The [[Colonne de la liberté (Quebec)|Colonne de la liberté]] stands tall in the background (the one from [[Henri Julien]]'s [[:Image:Colonne de la liberte (Quebec).png|illustration]] and the contemporary replica appear much shorter). Finally, a very young girl at the immediate left-of-the-middle evocatively stares at the spectator.

==History==
Smith was commissioned to paint it for display in the chamber of the Legislative Assembly in the [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament of Quebec City]]. However, the government of [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville]] did not accept it, and the work was passed unto various owners before finally becoming part of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec collection.

Located in Room 10, it is a part of the permanent exhibition of [[Quebec history|Quebec history-related]] art called ''Je me souviens&amp;nbsp;: Quand l’art imagine l’histoire'' ("[[Je me souviens]] [motto of Quebec]. When Art Imagines History"). The picture has seen [[art conservation and restoration|restoration]]. Nowadays, a great number of books related to the Patriotes, or their era in Quebec, use the painting, often cropped, to illustrate their cover page.

In a similar fashion, initial plans to erect a statue in honour of Louis-Joseph Papineau on the Quebec City Parliament Hill were aborted because of the then-controversial aspect of what was seen as a [[revolutionary]] figure. A smaller statue was instead made for interior display in the Parliament and a monument such as the one originally envisioned was inaugurated in the 2000s.

==Subject==
{{main|Assembly of the Six Counties}}
The Assembly of the Six Counties gathered [[Patriote]] leaders and approximately 4,000 followers in [[Saint-Charles-sur-Richelieu, Quebec|Saint-Charles]], [[Lower Canada]] (present-day [[Quebec]]) on October 23 and October 24, 1837. Presided by [[Wolfred Nelson]], it is the most famous of [[Patriote popular assemblies|the various popular assemblies]] held during that year protesting the [[Russell Resolutions]]. It was a prelude to the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] of 1837 that sought the independence of a Lower Canadian republic. Speakers were united in their protest of the British colonial government, but, as one part supported economic [[boycott]]s of British products, the other appealed to an armed uprising.

'''Lao art''' has a long and eventful history.

==Ceramics==
{{main|Lao ceramics}}
Lao [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] were first uncovered in 1970 at a construction site at kilometer 3, Thadeua Road in the [[Vientiane]] area, [[Mekong Valley]], [[Laos]]. Construction was halted only temporarily, and the [[kiln]] was hastily and unprofessionally excavated over a one-month period. At least four more kilns have been identified since then, and surface evidence and topography indicate at least one hundred more in the Ban Tao Hai Village of the Jar Kilns vicinity Archaeologists have labeled the area Sisattanak Kiln Site

===Further Research:===
* The work was carried out by a team of Laotian archaeologists and Australian archaeologists.
* A large number of ceramics (sherds, debris, and intact pieces) have been found there, some decorative objects, and molded pipes.
* The scientific tests done at the geographical location of the oven outside the first compound of Vientiane suggest that this site would date from the fifteenth century.
* The uncovered objects were grouped into four kinds: raw sandstone, glazed sandstone (bowls, dishes, jars, oil lamps, vases, weights for fishing net, chess pieces), molded pipes, and Qcendi pottery (utensils, stoves, and cooking pots). 
* Sisattanak's pottery remains what archaeologists consider to be "simple", utilitarian, showing a lack of creativity on the part of the potters which would be the result of weak influences, or external competition.&lt;p role="note"&gt;'''Source:''' Don Hein: Mike Barbetti and Thongsa Sayavongkhamdy.

== Textiles ==
The production of woven and embroidered textiles is the most prolific of all traditional crafts in Laos. Almost all regions of the country are suitable for the farming of cotton and mulberry trees, which are often planted on cooperative land with a view to providing raw materials for the wider community. Textiles are made of perishable materials and only survive the millennia when preserved under exceptional circumstances. Archaeological finds point to a high level of skill and sophistication at an astoundingly early date. The first prestigious garments were probably the skins of dangerous animals worn by daring hunters. In tropical regions, the alternative to leather was the inner bark of certain trees, which was beaten until it became soft. Succeeding generations developed more flexible fibres, with the invention of spinning which was used in different parts of the world to make yarn from wool, linen, cotton, or silk. Colour is very essential to textiles. In Laos, many villages, however, produce organic dyes from plants, roots, insect, resin, and soil. Raw dye materials are crushed or sliced and then boiled to extract the colour. The sediment is removed and the remaining liquid is suitable as a dye. Dyes are absorbed into the very fibres of textiles, ensuring a much longer lifetime than paints. Of the exceptional wealth of ornamentation, four groups of motifs have been distinguished: 
# Mythical Animals under the Water: Naga, a serpent; Louang, a serpent with legs and feet like a dragon; Eua, a serpent with no crest; Nark, a crested serpent.
# Mythical Animals on Earth: Crab; Khon Khob, the frogman; Khon Thani, the gibbon person; Siho, the lion-elephant; Mom, the magical horse; Hong, the magical swan; Houng, the mythical eagle; Hadsadiling, the bird-elephant.
# Plant Designs: tree, flower, vine, seed, fruit, leaf, and geometrical shapes like zigzag line, diamond, hook, and/or star.
# Religious Motifs: Buddha head, Stupa, a temple shaped like a pyramid, and/or ancestors riding on mythological animals.

==Buddhist sculpture==
{{main|Lao Buddhist sculpture}}
[[Lao people|Lao]] artisans have, throughout the past, used a variety of media in their sculptural creations. Of the metals, [[bronze]] is probably the most common, but [[gold]] and [[silver]] images also exist. Typically, the precious metals are used only for smaller objects, but some large images have been cast in gold, most notably the [[Phra Say]] of the sixteenth century, which the Siamese carried home as booty in the late eighteenth century. It is in enshrined at Wat Po Chai in [[Nongkhai]], Thailand, just across the [[Mekong]] River from [[Vientiane]]. The Phra Say's two companion images, the [[Phra Seum]] and [[Phra Souk]], are also in Thailand. One is in [[Bangkok]] and the other is in [[Lopburi]]. Perhaps the most famous sculpture in Laos, the [[Phra Bang]], is also cast in gold, but the craftsmanship is held to be of Sinhalese, rather than Lao, origin. Tradition maintains that relics of the Buddha are contained in the image.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6228">'''Macedonian Renaissance''' is a label sometimes used to describe the period of the [[Macedonian dynasty]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (867–1056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into [[Christian art]]work.

== Concept ==
Because of problems with the term, scholars have employed alternative names to describe this period, including "renaissance" (with a small "r"), "renascence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Cormack
  | first = Robin
  | title = Byzantine Art

  | isbn =0-19-284211-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Middle Byzantine Renaissance''' or '''First Byzantine Renaissance''' (the [[Palaeologan Renaissance]] from the 13th century on being the second).  [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] refers to the art of this period.

Because the word [[Renaissance]] (''rinascita'') was created in the 15th and 16th centuries by Italian humanists to describe their own time, its use outside of that context is problematic; however, the period in question certainly did produce ideas and works of art that reflected a reassessment of classical ideals.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the topic, see Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', pp. 130-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Macedonian Renaissance'' was first used by Kurt Weitzmann in his ''The Joshua Roll: A Work of the Macedonian Renaissance''.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, Kurt. ''The Joshua Roll: A Work of the Macedonian Renaissance.'' Studies in Manuscript Illumination III, Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the architecture of Macedonia. At the same time, the manuscripts of "Paris Psalter" (cod. gr. 139, Paris, Bib. Nat. de France) were indicated as the best examples of Macedonian Renaissance by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Paris Psalterionu (Cod. gr. 139, Paris-Ulusal Kütüphane) ve Makedonyan Rönesansı (full paper text)|url = https://www.academia.edu/16355712/Paris_Psalterionu_Cod._gr._139_Paris-Ulusal_K%25C3%25BCt%25C3%25BCphane_ve_Makedonyan_R%25C3%25B6nesans%25C4%25B1_full_paper_text_|website = www.academia.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Era ==
The term “Byzantine” arose from [[Byzantium]], a city founded in the eighth century BC on the site that would become [[Constantinople]] and is now [[Istanbul]]. Being on the easternmost territory of the Roman Empire allowed the groundwork for the Macedonian Renaissance to come about. [[Latin]] was the imperial language of law and government while [[Ancient Greek]] was the language of its literature  and the religion was [[Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;.	The Oxford Handbook of Byzantine Studies edited by Elizabeth Jeffreys with John Haldon and Robin Cormack. Published 2008 by Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[West Roman Empire]] had collapsed at the outset of the [[Middle Ages]], its Eastern half, the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], was able to survive and flourish. This was due mainly to its strategic location for commerce but also to the way it was able to hold back its enemies. [[Basil I]] (867-886), the founder of the [[Macedonian Dynasty]] of Byzantine rulers, was born in [[Byzantine Thrace|Thrace]] to a peasant family said to be of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent. He was employed in the influential circles of Constantinople and was rapidly promoted by the emperor [[Michael III]] eventually becoming co-emperor.&lt;ref&gt;"Basil I".  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 13 May. 2012  &lt;https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/55030/Basil-I&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

By means of political maneuvering he was able to secure his future as emperor and then began military and diplomatic campaigns to secure the empire. He was able to regain control over [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] at the same time he was able to hold back [[First Bulgar Empire|Bulgarian]] advances into his territory. His dynasty was thus able to maintain a period of peace under which economics, philosophy, art, and culture could thrive.

This period produced a shift from the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|ban on the painting]] of religious figures to [[icon]]s being painted to reflect the more classical and naturalistic influences of art on the culture. [[Mosaic]]s such as the [[Virgin and Child]] in [[Hagia Sophia]] can still be seen today. The new style of art may have inspired Italian artists such as [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-art/byzantine-art.htm Byzantine art]&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[Italian Renaissance]].

The period also saw a proliferation of literature, such as ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' ("The Book of Ceremonies"), which focused on governance, diplomatic interactions with neighboring nations, and other customs of the time. Education had also become a priority once again and the [[University of Constantinople]] boasted scholars such as [[Michael Psellus]], who wrote the ''Chronographia'', a history of fourteen Byzantine rulers. Meanwhile, reforms in law sought to limit the power and growth of large land owners by the formation of trade guilds that allowed the state to control growth as described in the [[Book of the Eparch]].

&lt;!--TO BE ENHANCED TO A SCIENCE SECTION??:--&gt;The building [[Magnaura]] in [[Constantinople]] had already become a school in 849 and was headed by the philosopher [[Leo the Mathematician]] (c. 790 – after 869).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/HellenicMacedonia/en/EC.2.3a.html macedonian-heritage.gr: Leon the Mathematician]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his works are lost.

[[Image:Jouffret.gif|right|thumb|An illustration from Jouffret's ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions''. The book, which influenced Picasso, was given to him by Princet.]]
Princet is credited with introducing the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] and the concept of the "[[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]]" to the cubists at the [[Le Bateau-Lavoir|Bateau-Lavoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=101 |isbn=0-465-01859-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Princet brought to Picasso's attention a book by [[Esprit Jouffret]], ''Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions'' (''Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions'', 1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jouffret |first=Esprit |title=Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions et introduction à la géométrie à n dimensions |url=http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=04810001 |accessdate=2008-02-06 |year=1903 |publisher=Gauthier-Villars |location=Paris |language=French |oclc=1445172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a popularization of Poincaré's ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' in which Jouffret described [[hypercube]]s and other complex [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]] in four [[dimension]]s and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's sketchbooks for ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' illustrate Jouffret's influence on the artist's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=106–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Princet's wife left him for [[André Derain]], and he drifted away from the circle of artists at the Bateau-Lavoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robbin |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Robbin |title=Shadows of Reality, The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought |year=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-11039-1 |pages=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Princet remained close to Metzinger and participated in meetings of the [[Section d'Or]] in [[Puteaux]]. He gave informal lectures to the group, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |pages=312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princet's influence on the cubists was attested to by his contemporaries. [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] wrote, "I witnessed the birth of cubism, its growth, its decline. Picasso was the obstetrician, Guillaume Apollinaire the midwife, Princet the godfather."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vlaminck |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice de Vlaminck |date=June 6, 1942 |title=Opinions libres... sur la peinture |journal=Comédia |pages=1, 6 |quote=J'ai assisté à la naissance du cubisme, à sa croissance, à son déclin. Picasso en fut l'accoucheur, Guillaume Apollinaire la sage-femme, Princet le parrain. }} in {{cite book |last=Seckel |first=Hélène |editor=William Rubin |editor2=Hélène Seckel |editor3=Judith Cousins |title=Les Demoiselles d'Avignon |year=1994 |publisher=Museum of Modern Art |location=New York |isbn=0-87070-162-2 |pages=264 |chapter=Anthology of Early Commentary on ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Metzinger said of him, "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |pages=60 }} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |pages=167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often. Although quite young, thanks to his knowledge of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company. But, beyond his profession, it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space that had been opened up by Schlegel and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |location=Paris |isbn= |pages=43–44 }} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |pages=215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Louis Vauxcelles]] sarcastically dubbed Princet "the father of cubism":
&lt;blockquote&gt;M. Princet has studied at length non-Euclidean geometry and the theorems of Riemann, of which Gleizes and Metzinger speak rather carelessly. Now then, M. Princet one day met M. Max Jacob and confided him one or two of his discoveries relating to the fourth dimension. M. Jacob informed the ingenious M. Picasso of it, and M. Picasso saw there a possibility of new ornamental schemes. M. Picasso explained his intentions to M. Apollinaire, who hastened to write them up in formularies and codify them. The thing spread and propagated. Cubism, the child of M. Princet, was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vauxcelles |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Vauxcelles |date=December 29, 1918 |title=Le Carnet des ateliers: La Père du cubisme |journal=Le Carnet de la semaine |pages=11 }} in {{cite book |last=Henderson |first=Linda Dalrymple |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art |year=1983 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-10142-6 |page=72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duchamp told Pierre Cabanne, "We weren't mathematicians at all, but we really did believe in Princet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cabanne |first=Pierre  |title=Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp |year=1971 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |pages=39 }} in {{cite book |last=Crunden |first=Robert Morse |title=American Salons: Encounters with European Modernism, 1885-1917 |year=1993 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-506569-7 |pages=431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15234">A '''music supervisor''' is a person who combines [[music]] and visual media. According to The Guild of Music Supervisors, a music supervisor is “a qualified professional who oversees all music related aspects of film, television, advertising, video games and other existing or emerging visual media platforms as required.”&lt;ref name="Guild of Music Supervisors"&gt;Guild of Music Supervisors. {{cite web |url=http://www.guildofmusicsupervisors.com/the-role/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020208/http://www.guildofmusicsupervisors.com/the-role/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[musical theatre]] industry, a music supervisor is often responsible for managing a team of music directors working on any number of musical productions.

==Description==

A music supervisor is somebody with a broad and encyclopedic music expertise and a sophisticated knowledge of music licensing and negotiation. Typically, a music supervisor proposes previously recorded songs to the director or producer of a film, advertisement, television show, trailer, promo, video game, or any other form of visual media.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"&gt;Sobel, Ron, and Dick Weissman. Music Publishing: The Roadmap to Royalties. New York: Routledge, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A music supervisor will usually act as a liaison between the creative and business ends of the process.&lt;ref name="Baskerville, David 2006"&gt;Baskerville, David, PHD. Music Business and Career Guide.  2006. Sage Publications, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a song is approved, they approach the rights holders of that song to seek permission to license (usually creating master recording licenses and [[Synchronization rights|synchronization licenses]]) and to work out the financial details of the song’s use. In many instances, the artist or songwriter of the recorded song is given the opportunity to accept or decline the synchronization of their song.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; This position is most active within media-based industries, including live events, television, film, advertising, theatre, and video gaming.&lt;ref&gt;Wentz, Brook. Hey, that’s my music!: Music supervision, licensing, and content acquisition. 2007. Hal Leonard Books, NY NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  Music supervisors may work within production companies, film studios, networks, music supervision companies, or do freelance work.

==Job responsibilities==

A supervisor’s responsibilities are to locate, secure and oversee music related talent. They liaise between the rights holders of the recorded music involved and the director of the project they have been hired to work on. In addition, they advise, generate and work within financial parameters of the project they are hired to work on. They must deliver musical elements within a timely manner and secure legal rights of the song before it is used. The music supervisor will gather the appropriate information to list credits and, in certain cases, will manage royalty collection.

The overarching responsibility of a music supervisor is to meet the needs of a project’s director and producer. This means catering to the creative goals of a project under a strict budget: often less than 5% of a project’s total budget.

The director/producer will discuss their vision for the project with the music supervisor, and how they expect the music to enhance this vision. The visual media will then be spotted by the supervisor – a process of choosing where selected music will be inserted. Traditional spots include the main title, opening credits, and closing credits, while additional spots are incorporated to trigger emotional responses from viewers. Scores, or background music, are also an important consideration for enhancing visual media. Scores can range from the background to a dramatic scene to television bumpers – the music signifying leading into or coming back from a commercial break.

After being given or creating a budget, the supervisor must select appropriate music for the project – either by licensing existing songs/scores, or creating new songs/scores. In the selection process, a music supervisor may choose to seek the help of a third party licensing company or a music publisher, which will pitch songs to the supervisor from within their library of music. If creating new music, the supervisor may become responsible for additional roles, including securing artists or composers, facilitating the production and recording process, overseeing finances, and finalizing post-theatrical uses of the soundtrack.When using pre-existing music, the supervisor’s duties focus on the legal and financial aspects of licensing and negotiating. A large percentage of a music supervisor’s job revolves around music clearance alone.

When it comes to royalty collections, a music supervisor will sometimes be in charge of arranging this source of the selected artist's revenue. Royalties for music placements are paid out by Performance Rights Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC in the United States). In order to detect the placements an artist has made with visual media, these companies need to be aware of their placement. Depending on the type of project (ad placement, television show, etc.). the music supervisor will have to either make sure the artist is credited properly, send video clips of the placement to the publisher (which will then be sent to the proper Performance Rights Organization),or create a cue sheet of all of the songs used in the project

Many directors and producers will choose to work with a single supervisor for a project, however it varies from project to project. For example, music supervisors can be hired at an entertainment company as an “in house” staff member to manage the supervision for several projects (such as at an advertising agency). A production company may also hire a supervisor on a project-by-project basis (such as hiring one supervisor for an entire television series as seen with Gossip Girl or The O.C.). Music supervisors may also be hired on a show-by-show basis (ex. AMC’s Mad Men, which has used multiple music supervisors).

==Qualifications/background==

A music supervisor must have a wide knowledge of music and a passion for musical research.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; There is no set educational or career path to become a music supervisor.  Educational backgrounds range from Bachelor of Fine Arts in music to business degrees to no higher education at all (Baskerville).  Because the majority of the position involves music negotiations, clearances, publishing/performing deals, etc., a legal background is an excellent qualification. Some supervisors are musicians, producers, agents, or managers – experience with the music or film/television industries is a strong background upon which to build. Despite common misconceptions, musical knowledge (writing, reading, performing, composing) is not nearly as important as a familiarity with a broad range of music, including popular styles and artists, as well as the production/negotiating process itself (Baskerville). Author of ''Music Business Handbook and Career Guide'' David Baskerville notes "This is one of the few production specialties that has almost unlimited growth potential, because there [is] no universally accepted job description. The field remains wide open to people with connections and the ability to get the job done."

The proliferation of video technology has resulted in an increased demand for production companies needing to license music, and the field now accommodates many career professionals. Because of the massive expansion in the field, many colleges and universities offer courses in music supervision. For example, NYU Steinhardt’s Music Business program offers a course titled “Strategic Music and Branding”.&lt;ref name="NYU Curriculum"&gt;"Music Business Curriculum." NYU Steinhardt. New York University, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salary==

Music supervisor salaries vary depending upon the project and the hiring process.  Salaries can range from $35,000 annually at a music supervision firm, to upwards of $250,000 for a freelance supervisor per feature film (Austin). Music supervisors also have the opportunity to continue receiving funds through soundtrack royalties.  It is generally more profitable (assuming one will be regularly hired) to work freelance jobs than to work for a larger corporation. However some supervisors may choose to work within a music supervision company (such as Chop Shop Music Supervision). In addition, music supervisors who work "in house" within an entertainment, such as an advertising agency or within the music department of a production company, will earn a salary based upon their ranking and company earnings. While staff jobs with a network, studio, or production company offer more security, the recognition and pay are significantly lower.  Despite the environment, a music supervisor should always work out a contract including expectations, responsibilities, and payment before beginning a project.

==History==
Originally, music was used in silent films to hide mechanical noises within a theatre, like the projector.  Often a musician would be present to play improvised or pre-selected pieces along with the visual images on screen.&lt;ref name="Schulenberg, Richard 1999"&gt;Schulenberg, Richard.  Legal Aspects of the Music Industry: An Insider’s View. 1999. Billboard Books, New York New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the establishment of the soundtrack, and an emphasis on accompanying silent visual media with music.&lt;ref name="Schulenberg, Richard 1999"/&gt; Over time, films began hiring composers to create instrumental soundtracks to accompany films. It became apparent to studios that when a movie included a hit song, more people were likely to see it, and as a result of that, more people were likely to purchase the song recording.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; The demand for music supervisors in the production process solidified in the 1980s, and has continued to grow with the popularity of media soundtracks.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, D., Austin, C., Peterik, Jim. Songwriting for Dummies, 2nd Edition. 2010. Wiley Publishing, Inc., Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; While the use of songs not originally composed for the film did not save money, licensing a song made for a more stable understanding for the director and producer of the film what music was going to be  used in the scene. Instead of having to wait for new instrumental music to be commissioned, they could have an understanding of what recording would be used before the film was finalized. This led to an emerging need for selecting and licensing songs, which is how the position of music supervisor developed.&lt;ref name="Sobel, Ron 2008"/&gt; Taking advantage of this musical component has become an increasingly feasible marketing strategy for these media outlets, placing a growing responsibility on the music supervisor.&lt;ref name="Baskerville, David 2006"/&gt;

Over the past decade, synchronization licensing has become one of the most significant ways for an artist to gain exposure and to earn money. Finding a way to a music supervisor can give an artist the opportunity to spread their music on a platform that would expose them to a much larger audience than they may have been able to find on their own. One of the most notable synchronization collaborations was with Moby’s 1999 album Play, which was the first ever to have all of its tracks linked to a synchronization license.&lt;ref name="Organization Moby"&gt;Smith, Ethan. "Organization Moby." Wired May 2002.https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.05/moby.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The job of a music supervisor has only recently become increasingly significant and the importance of this position continues to grow. Institutions such as the Guild of Music Supervisors are promoting the understanding of music supervision. In 2007 several supervisors, in order to promote, pursue and recognize the craft of music supervision. Since 2011 guild has granted awards for excellence in the position. They encourage other institutions, such as the Hollywood Music and Media Awards, to acknowledge accomplishments in the field.&lt;ref name="Guild of Music Supervisors"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8384">[[Image:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 094.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Oil sketch ''modello'' by Tiepolo, 69 × 55 cm, for [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo_016.jpg this] five metre high altarpiece]] 
An '''Oil sketch''' or '''oil study''' is an artwork made primarily in [[oil paint]] in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or '''[[modello|modelli]]''', especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as [[printmaking]] or [[tapestry]], to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.

The [[sketch (drawing)|usual medium]] for ''modelli'' was the [[drawing]], but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.

One of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], a fine draftsman and pupil of [[Raphael]], but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing.  His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on [[panel painting|panel]], with examples in the [[National Gallery, London]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070303121519/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6594] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] being 75 and 65&amp;nbsp;cm tall respectively.  Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.
[[Image:Théodore Géricault nu masculino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Oil study of a male nude by [[Géricault]]]]
In the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]].  [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made great use of them, as working studies, and as ''modelli'' for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers.  Their degree of finish varies accordingly.  Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his [[old master print|print]] series the ''Iconographie'', and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The ''[[Magistrate of Brussels]]'', recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. 

Perhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects.  He grew up and trained in [[Genoa]], and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there.  He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or [[gouache]]s finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations.  Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion.  By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. 

A systematic producer of small ''modelli'' sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge [[altarpiece]] to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time [[Jean Fragonard]] was producing a series of virtuosic ''Figures de fantaisie'', half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Richard R.: ''Impression: Painting Quickly in France'', pages 31–2. Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:John Constable 025.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Constable]], 1827, 22 × 31 cm]]

By the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as "oil studies" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The ''esquisse'', or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the ''etude'', or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the ''croquis'', a small and gestural compositional study, and the ''ébauche'', a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, pages 31–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Constable]] made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a [[sketchbook]] on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate Britain exhibition showing Constable's large landscapes along with their full-size oil sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Eakins]], Sketch for [[The Gross Clinic]].]][[image:Study for swimming thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, 1884 ''Swimming Hole sketch'', [[oil paint|oil]] on [[fiberboard]] mounted on fiberboard, 22.1 × 27 cm., 8{{fraction|3|4}} × 10{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C..]]]][[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Géricault]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Degas]] are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in ''essence'', a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. [[Seurat]] made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of [[Impressionism]], and then [[Modernism]], the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more [[painterly]] and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting.  Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings.  Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today.  [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works "studies": examples are his [[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]] [[Tate Britain]], or his ''Study from Pope Innocent X'', auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0516/baconf.html RTE story &amp; picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open-access monograph''' is a scholarly [[monograph]] which is made freely available with a [[Creative Commons Licence|creative commons licence.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Budapest Open Access Initiative  {{!}} Budapest Open Access Initiative|url = http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/|website = www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Open access is when academic research is made freely available for anyone to read and re-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities|url=http://openaccess.mpg.de/286432/Berlin-Declaration|website=Max Planck Open Access|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[open access journals]], there are different [[business models]] for funding open-access books, including [[Article processing charge|publication charges]], institutional support, [[library publishing]], and consortium models.&lt;ref name=insights&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferwerda|first1=Eelco|title=Open access monograph business models|journal=Insights|date=2014|volume=27|doi=10.1629/2048-7754.118|url=http://uksg.metapress.com/content/e17587x1kn27p705/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2014|issn=2048-7754}}&lt;/ref&gt; OECD Publishing uses a [[freemium]] model by making its books available online in HTML with the option to purchase a print copy.&lt;ref name=insights /&gt; There is some evidence that making electronic editions of books open access can increase sales of the print edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suber|first1=Peter|title=Open access|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_(the_book)|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262517638|page=107|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While open access to journal articles has become very common, with 50% of articles published in 2011 available as open access,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Archambault|first1=Eric|last2=Amyot|first2=Didier|last3=Deschamps|first3=Philippe|last4=Nicol,|first4=Aurore|last5=Rebout|first5=Lise|last6=Roberge|first6=Guillaume|title=Proportion of Open Access Peer-Reviewed Papers at the European and World Levels—2004-2011|url=http://www.science-metrix.com/pdf/SM_EC_OA_Availability_2004-2011.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; open access to books has not yet seen as much uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Ellen|last2=Milloy|first2=Caren|title=A snapshot of attitudes towards open access monograph publishing in the humanities and social sciences – part of the OAPEN-UK project|journal=Insights|date=2012|volume=25|issue=2|doi=10.1629/2048-7754.25.2.192|url=http://uksg.metapress.com/content/727t2j1u17uvgnt2/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are dedicated open-access book publishers such as [[Open Book Publishers]] and others who publish both books and journals, such as [[Open Humanities Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonn|first1=Maria|title=Free exchange of ideas Experimenting with the open access monograph|url=http://crln.acrl.org/content/71/8/436.short|website=College &amp; Research Libraries News|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report released in 2015 by the UK's main funding body for research, the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], states the importance of open access monographs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monographs and open access: A report to HEFCE|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2015/Monographs,and,open,access/2014_monographs.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2015|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Monographs are a vitally important and distinctive vehicle for research communication, and must be sustained in any moves to open access."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monographs and open access|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/rereports/year/2015/monographs/|accessdate=21 August 2015|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pumapunku''' or '''Puma Punku''' ([[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''puma'' [[cougar]], puma, ''punku'' door, Hispanicized ''Puma Puncu'') is part of a large temple complex or monument group that is part of the [[Tiwanaku]] Site near Tiwanaku, in western [[Bolivia]]. It is believed to date to AD 536 and later.

Tiwanaku is significant in [[Inca]] traditions because it is believed to be the site where the world was created.&lt;ref name="Sage Knowledge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Birx|first=H.

The Pumapunku complex consists of an unwalled western court, a central unwalled [[esplanade]], a terraced platform mound that is faced with stone, and a walled eastern court.&lt;ref name="Isbell2004a"&gt;{{Citation

The Pumapunku is a terraced earthen mound that is faced with blocks. It is {{convert|167.36|m|abbr=off}} wide along its north–south axis and {{convert|116.7|m|abbr=off}} long along its east–west axis. On the northeast and southeast corners of the Pumapunku, it has {{convert|20|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} wide projections that extend {{convert|27.6|m|abbr=off}} north and south from the rectangular mound. 

The eastern edge of the Pumapunku is occupied by what is called the ''Plataforma Lítica.''. This structure consists of a stone terrace that is {{convert|6.75|by|38.72|m|abbr=off}} in dimension. This terrace is paved with multiple enormous stone blocks. It contains the largest stone slab found in both the Pumapunku and Tiwanaku Site, measuring {{convert|7.81|m|abbr=off}} long, {{convert|5.17|m|abbr=off}} wide and averages {{convert|1.07|m|abbr=on}} thick. Based upon the [[specific gravity]] of the red [[sandstone]] from which it was carved, this stone slab has been estimated to weigh 131 [[metric ton]]s.&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"&gt;Ponce Sanginés, C. and G. M. Terrazas, 1970, ''Acerca De La Procedencia Del Material Lítico De Los Monumentos De Tiwanaku.'' Publication no. 21. ''Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The other stonework and facing of the Pumapunku consists of a mixture of [[andesite]] and red sandstone. Pumapunku's core consists of clay, while the fill underlying selected parts of its edge consists of river sand and cobbles instead of clay. Excavations have documented "three major building epochs, in addition to small repairs and remodeling".&lt;ref name="Isbell2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vranich2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair2000"&gt;Protzen, J.-P., and S.E.. Nair, 2000, "On Reconstructing Tiwanaku Architecture:" ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians.'' vol. 59, no. 3, pp. 358-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, Pumapunku is thought to have been "unimaginably wondrous,"&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"/&gt; adorned with polished metal plaques, brightly colored ceramic and fabric ornamentation, and visited by costumed citizens, elaborately dressed priests, and elites decked in exotic jewelry. Current understanding of this complex is limited due to its age, the lack of a written record, and the current deteriorated state of the structures due to treasure hunting, [[looting]], stone mining for building stone and railroad ballast, and natural weathering.&lt;ref name="Isbell2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt;

The area within the kilometer separating the Pumapunku and [[Kalasasaya]] complexes has been surveyed using [[ground-penetrating radar]], [[magnetometry]], induced [[electrical conductivity]], and [[magnetic susceptibility]]. The geophysical data collected from these surveys and excavations have revealed the presence of numerous man-made structures in the area between the Pumapunku and Kalasasaya complexes. These structures include the wall foundations of buildings and compounds, water conduits, pool-like features, [[revetment]]s, terraces, residential compounds, and widespread gravel pavements, all of which now lie buried and hidden beneath the modern ground’s surface.&lt;ref name="Ernenweini +2007"&gt;Ernenweini, E.

Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age ==
Researchers have worked to determine the age of the Pumapunku complex since the discovery of the Tiwanaku site. As noted by Andean specialist, W. H. Isbell, professor at [[Binghamton University]],&lt;ref name="Isbell2004a"/&gt; a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon date]] was obtained by Vranich&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"/&gt; from organic material from the lowermost and oldest layer of mound-fill forming the Pumapunku. This layer was deposited during the first of three construction epochs and dates the initial construction of the Pumapunku to AD 536–600 (1510 ±25 [[Before Present|B.P.]] C14, calibrated date). Since the radiocarbon date came from the lowermost and oldest layer of mound-fill underlying the [[andesite]] and [[sandstone]] stonework, the stonework must have been constructed sometime after AD 536–600. The excavation trenches of Vranich show that the clay, sand, and gravel fill of the Pumapunku complex lie directly on the sterile middle [[Pleistocene]] sediments. These excavation trenches also demonstrated the lack of any pre-Andean [[Middle Horizon]] cultural deposits within the area of the Tiwanaku Site adjacent to the Pumapunku complex.&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"/&gt;

== Engineering ==
[[File:Pumapunkubolivia.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Detail of stone with precisely cut straight line and tooled holes within the line]]
[[File:Puma Punku7.jpg|right|thumb|An example of high-precision small holes]]
[[File:Puma Punku6.jpg|right|thumb|Stone block with a set of [[blind hole]]s of complex shape]]

The largest of these stone blocks is 7.81&amp;nbsp;meters long, 5.17&amp;nbsp;meters wide, averages 1.07&amp;nbsp;meters thick, and is estimated to weigh about 131&amp;nbsp;metric tons. The second largest stone block found within the Pumapunku is {{convert|7.90|m|abbr=off}} long, {{convert|2.50|m|abbr=off}} wide, and averages {{convert|1.86|m|abbr=off}} thick. Its weight has been estimated to be 85.21 metric tons. Both of these stone blocks are part of the ''Plataforma Lítica'' and composed of red [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt; Based upon detailed [[Petrography|petrographic]] and chemical analyses of samples from both individual stones and known quarry sites, archaeologists concluded that these and other red sandstone blocks were transported up a steep incline from a quarry near [[Lake Titicaca]] roughly {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} away. Smaller andesite blocks that were used for stone facing and carvings came from quarries within the Copacabana Peninsula about {{convert|90|km|abbr=off}} away from and across Lake Titicaca from the Pumapunku and the rest of the Tiwanaku Site.&lt;ref name="Vranich1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sangines1970"/&gt;

Archaeologists argue that the transport of these stones was accomplished by the large [[labor force]] of ancient Tiwanaku. Several theories have been proposed as to how this labor force transported the stones, although these theories remain speculative. Two of the more common proposals involve the use of [[llama]] skin ropes and the use of ramps and [[inclined plane]]s.&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair1997"&gt;Protzen, Jean-Pierre; Stella Nair, 1997, ''Who Taught the Inca Stonemasons Their Skills? A Comparison of Tiahuanaco and Inca Cut-Stone Masonry:'' The [[Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians]]. vol. 56, no. 2, pp. 146-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In assembling the walls of Pumapunku, each stone was finely cut to interlock with the surrounding stones. The blocks were fit together like a puzzle, forming load-bearing joints without the use of mortar. One common engineering technique involves cutting the top of the lower stone at a certain angle, and placing another stone on top of it which was cut at the same angle.&lt;ref name="Vranich2006"/&gt; The precision with which these angles have been used to create flush joints is indicative of a highly sophisticated knowledge of stone-cutting and a thorough understanding of [[descriptive geometry]].&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair2000"/&gt; Many of the joints are so precise that not even a razor blade will fit between the stones.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Eugene (1990). 'In Bolivia, Great Excavations; Tiwanaku Digs Unearthing New History of the New World', The Washington Post. Dec 11, 1990: d.01.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[masonry]] is characterized by accurately cut rectilinear blocks of such uniformity that they could be interchanged for one another while maintaining a level surface and even joints. However, the blocks do not have the same dimensions, although they are close.&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair1997"/&gt; The blocks were so precisely cut as to suggest the possibility of prefabrication and [[mass production]], technologies far in advance of the Tiwanaku’s Inca successors hundreds of years later.&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair1997"/&gt; Some of the stones are in an unfinished state, showing some of the techniques used to shape them. They were initially pounded by stone hammers, which can still be found in numbers on local andesite quarries, creating depressions, and then slowly ground and polished with flat stones and sand.&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair1997"/&gt;

Tiwanaku engineers were also adept at developing a civic infrastructure at this complex, constructing functional irrigation systems, hydraulic mechanisms, and waterproof sewage lines.

Tiwanaku: Ancestors of the Inca|year=2004|publisher=Denver Art Museum|location=Denver, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its layout is thought to have resembled a square.&lt;ref name="Young-Sánchez 2004"/&gt; To sustain the weight of these massive structures, Tiwanaku architects were meticulous in creating foundations, often fitting stones directly to bedrock or digging precise trenches and carefully filling them with layered sedimentary stones to support large stone blocks.&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair1997"/&gt; Modern day engineers argue that the base of the Pumapunku temple was constructed using a technique called layering and depositing. By alternating layers of sand from the interior and layers of composite from the exterior, the fills would overlap each other at the joints, essentially grading the contact points to create a sturdy base.&lt;ref name="Vranich2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair1997"/&gt;

Notable features at Pumapunku are &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;-shaped architectural cramps, which are composed of a unique copper-arsenic-nickel bronze alloy. These &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;-shaped cramps were also used on a section of canal found at the base of the [[Akapana]] pyramid at Tiwanaku. These cramps were used to hold the blocks comprising the walls and bottom of stone-lined canals that drain sunken courts. &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;-cramps of unknown composition were used to hold together the massive slabs that formed Pumapunku's four large platforms. In the south canal of the Pumapunku, the &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;-shaped cramps were cast in place. In sharp contrast, the cramps used at the Akapana canal were fashioned by the cold hammering of copper-arsenic-nickel bronze ingots.&lt;ref name="ProtzenNair1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lechtman1998"&gt;Lechtman, H.N., 1998, 'Architectural cramps at Tiwanaku: copper-arsenic-nickel bronze.' In ''Metallurgica Andina'': In Honour of Hans-Gert Bachmann and Robert Maddin, edited by T. Rehren, A. Hauptmann, and J. D. Muhly, pp. 77-92. ''Deutsches Bergbau-Museum'', Bochum, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; The unique copper-arsenic-nickel bronze alloy is also found in metal artifacts within the region between Tiwanaku and San Pedro de Atacama during the late [[Cultural periods of Peru|Middle Horizon]] around 600&amp;ndash;900.&lt;ref name="Lechtman1997"&gt;Lechtman, H.N., 1997, ''El bronce arsenical y el Horizonte Medio.

== Cultural and spiritual significance ==
It is theorized{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that the Pumapunku complex as well as its surrounding temples, the Akapana pyramid, [[Kalasasaya]], [[Putuni]], and [[Kerikala]] functioned as spiritual and ritual centers for the Tiwanaku. This area might have been viewed as the center of the Andean world, attracting pilgrims from far away to marvel in its beauty. These structures transformed the local landscape; Pumapunku was purposely integrated with Illimani mountain, a sacred peak that the Tiwanaku possibly believed to be home to the spirits of their dead.  This area was believed to have existed between heaven and Earth.  The spiritual significance and the sense of wonder would have been amplified into a "mind-altering and life-changing experience"&lt;ref name="Morell2002"&gt;Morell, Virginia (2002). ''Empires Across the Andes'' National Geographic. Vol. 201, Iss. 6: 106&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of [[hallucinogenic]] plants.  Examinations of hair samples exhibit remnants of psychoactive substances in many [[mummies]] found in Tiwanaku culture from Northern Chile, even those of babies as young as one year of age, demonstrating the importance of these substances to the Tiwanaku.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q. [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/10/081022-drug-mummies.html "Drugs Found in Hair of Ancient Andean Mummies"], ''National Geographic News,'' Oct. 22, 2008. Accessed Nov. 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;       

As was characteristic of civilizations around this time, the Tiwanaku actively incorporated [[human sacrifice]] into their culture. The remains of dismembered bodies have been found throughout the area. Ceramic artifacts depict imagery of warriors, masked with puma skulls, decapitating their enemies and holding trophy skulls, and adorned with belts of human heads with their tongues torn out.&lt;ref name="Morell2002"/&gt; It is believed that, because of certain markings on stones found at Puma Punku, the [[Gate of the Sun]] was originally part of Puma Punku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young-Sanchez|first=Margaret|title=. Tiwanaku: Ancestors of the Inca|year=2004|publisher=Denver Art Museum|location=Denver, CO|url=http://westminster.worldcat.org/title/tiwanaku-ancestors-of-the-inca/oclc/55679655&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peak and decline ==
The Tiwanaku civilization and the use of these temples appears to some to have peaked from AD 700 to 1000, by which point the temples and surrounding area may have been home to some 400,000 people.  An extensive [[infrastructure]] had been developed, including a complex [[Irrigation|irrigation system]] that extended more than {{convert|30|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} to support cultivation of potatoes, [[quinoa]], corn and other various crops. At its peak the Tiwanaku culture dominated the entire Lake Titicaca basin as well as portions of Bolivia and Chile.&lt;ref name="Kolasta1993a"&gt;Kolata, A.L. (1993) ''The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization.'' Wiley-Blackwell, New York, New York. 256 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-55786-183-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janusek2008a"&gt;Janusek, J.W. (2008). ''Ancient Tiwanaku,'' Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, United Kingdom. 362 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-521-01662-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This culture seems to have dissolved rather abruptly some time around AD 1000, and researchers are still seeking answers as to why. A likely scenario involves rapid [[Climate change|environmental change]], possibly involving an extended drought. Unable to produce the massive crop yields necessary for their large population, the Tiwanaku are argued to have scattered into the local [[mountain range]]s, only to disappear shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kolasta1993a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janusek2008a"/&gt; Puma Punku is thought to have been abandoned before it was finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young-Sánchez|first=Margaret|title=Tiwanaku: Ancestors of the Inca|year=2004|publisher=Denver Art Museum|location=Denver, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5841">The '''research-based design''' process is a research process proposed by Teemu Leinonen inspired by design theories.&lt;ref&gt;Ehn, P. &amp; Kyng, M. (1987). "The Collective Resource Approach to Systems Design". In G. Bjerknes, P. Ehn &amp; M. Kyng (Eds.), ''Computers and Democracy: A Scandinavian Challenge'' (pp. 17–57).Avebury.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D.A. (1987). ''Educating the Reflective Practitioner. Toward a New Design for Teaching and Learning in the Professions''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, H. &amp; Stolterman, E. (2003). The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World: Foundations and Fundamentals of Design Competence. New Jersey: Educational Technology Publications&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly oriented towards the building of [[prototype]]s and it emphasizes creative solutions, exploration of various ideas and design concepts, continuous testing and redesign of the design solutions. This method is also influenced by the [[Participatory design#History in Scandinavia|Scandinavian participatory design]] approach. Therefore, most of the activities take place in a close [[dialogue]] with the community that is expected to use the tools designed.

==Phases==
The process can be divided into four major phases, although they all happen concurrently and side-by-side. At different times of the research, researchers are asked to put more effort into different phases. The continuous iteration, however, asks researchers to keep all the phases alive all the time: contextual inquiry, participatory design, product design, prototype as hypothesis.

===Contextual inquiry===
{{See also|Contextual inquiry}}
Contextual inquiry refers to the exploration of the socio-cultural context of the design. The aim is to understand the environment, situation, and culture where the design takes place. The results of the contextual inquiry are better understanding of the context by recognizing in it possible challenges and design opportunities. In this phase, design researchers use [[Ethnography|rapid ethnographic]] methods, such as [[Participant observation|participatory observation]], note-taking, sketching, informal conversations, and interviews. At the same time as the field work, the design researchers are doing a focused review of the literature, benchmarking existing solutions, and analyzing trends in the area in order to develop insights into the design challenges.

===Participatory design===
{{See also|Participatory design}}
Throughout the contextual inquiry design researchers start to develop some preliminary design ideas, which would be validated during the next stage—participatory design—in workshops with different stakeholders. The participatory design sessions tend to take place with small groups of 4 to 6 participants. A common practice is to present the results as [[User scenario|scenarios]] made by the design researchers containing challenges and design opportunities. In the workshop, the participants are invited to come up with design solutions to the challenges and to bring to the discussion new challenges and solutions.

Since one of the main features of the research-based design is its participatory nature, the user's involvement is an integral part of the process. In this regard, participatory design workshops are organized during the different stages in order to validate initial ideas and discuss the prototypes at different stage of development.

===Product design===
{{See also|Product design}}
The results of the participatory design are analyzed in a [[design studio]] by the design researchers who use the feedback to redefine the design problems and redesign the prototypes. By keeping a distance from the stakeholders, in the product design phase the design researchers will get a chance to analyze the results of the participatory design, categorize them, use specific design language related to implementation of the prototypes, and finally make design decisions.

===Prototype as hypothesis===
Ultimately, the prototypes are developed to be functional on a level that they can be tested with real people in their everyday situations. The prototypes are still considered to be a hypothesis, prototypes as hypothesis, because they are expected to be part of the solutions for the challenges defined and redefined during the research. It remains to the stakeholders to decide whether they support the assertions made by the design researchers.

Research-based design is not to be confused with design-based research.&lt;ref&gt;Barab, S.A. &amp; Squire, K. (2004). Design-Based Research: Putting a Stake in the Ground. Journal of the Learning Sciences, 13(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Design-Based Research Collective. (2003). Design-based research: An emerging paradigm for educational inquiry. Educational Researcher, 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fallman, D. (2007). Why Research-Oriented Design Isn’t Design-Oriented Research: On the Tensions Between Design and Research in an Implicit Design Discipline. Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20(3), 193-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leinonen, T., Toikkanen, T. &amp; Silfvast, K. (2008). Software as Hypothesis: Research-Based Design Methodology. In the Proceedings of Participatory Design Conference 2008. Presented at the Participatory Design Conference, PDC 2008, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; In research-based design, which builds on art and design tradition, the focus is on the artifacts, the end-results of the design. The way the artifacts are, the affordances and features they have or do not have, form an important part of the research argumentation. As such, research-based design as a methodological approach includes research, design, and design interventions that are all intertwined.

'''''Saint Eulalia''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas in the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] style, created in 1885 by English artist [[John William Waterhouse]], depicting the aftermath of the death of [[Eulalia of Mérida]]. It is currently housed at [[Tate Britain]].

==History==
A very daring composition, this is one of Waterhouse's most unusual, and consequently most striking, oil paintings. The corpse is dramatically foreshortened, and the snow contrasts with Eulalia’s naked flesh – the 12-year-old girl seems singularly out of place for a Waterhouse picture.&lt;ref&gt;P. Trippi, ''J.W. Waterhouse'', Phaidon Press (2005), ''s.v.'' "St Eulalia".&lt;/ref&gt; His choice of configuration – situating the corpse across the front and leaving so much of the central canvas unoccupied – was risky but it worked: by placing all the background figures in the distance, he concentrated the viewer's gaze on the naked body.&lt;ref&gt;A. Noakes, ''Waterhouse. John William Waterhouse'', Chaucer Press (2004), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The nudity was also groundbreaking for Waterhouse – and something that could have laid him open to criticism – but his sensitive handling of the subject, the youth of the saint, and the historical context of the painting allowed him to escape the critics' pen.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. critique at [http://www.johnwaterhouse.com/view.cfm?recordid=76 johnwaterhouse.com].&lt;/ref&gt; The eye is also led to the murdered girl by the angle of the Roman guard's spear, pointing to the ropes that had bound her to the stake.

According to legend,&lt;ref&gt;See Wiki entry, "[[Saint Eulalia of Mérida]]". Also, she appears in Thieleman J. van Braght, ''Martyrs Mirror: An account of Those who Suffered in the Fourth Century'' (1660), see [http://www.homecomers.org/mirror/martyrs021.htm ''Martyrs Mirror'' excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; the snow was believed to have been sent by God as a shroud to cover the saint's nakedness; and the dove, seen flying upwards near the crowd of mourners, indicative of Eulalia's soul flying up to Heaven, was said to have flown out of her mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Quotd by Waterhouse in the exhibition catalogue (see [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=15983&amp;tabview=text Tate's entry]). Cf. also Blackburn and Holford-Strevens: ''Oxford Book of Days'', entry for 10 December.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scythian art''' is art, primarily decorative objects, such as [[jewellery]], produced by the [[nomadic]] tribes in the area known to the ancient Greeks as [[Scythia]], which was centred on the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] and ranged from modern [[Kazakhstan]] to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast of modern [[Poland]] and to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  The identities of the nomadic peoples of the [[steppes]] is often uncertain, and the term "Scythian" should often be taken loosely; the art of nomads much further east than the core Scythian territory exhibits close similarities as well as differences, and terms such as the "Scytho-Siberian world" are often used.  Other [[Eurasian nomad]] peoples recognised by ancient writers, notably [[Herodotus]], include the [[Massagetae]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Saka]], the last a name from Persian sources, while ancient Chinese sources speak of the [[Xiongnu]] or Hsiung-nu.  Modern archaeologists recognise, among others, the [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], [[Tagar culture|Tagar]], and [[Aldy-Bel culture]]s, with the furthest east of all, the later [[Ordos culture]] a little west of [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 2-3, 22-23; Bunker, 3-4, 23; for more peoples in Herodotus see [[Eurasian nomads#Chronological division|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of these peoples is collectively known as '''steppes art'''.

In the case of the [[Scythians]] the characteristic art was produced in a period from the 7th to 3rd centuries BC, after which the Scythians were gradually displaced from most of their territory by the Sarmatians, and rich grave deposits cease among the remaining Scythian populations on the [[Black Sea]] coast. Over this period many Scythians became sedentary, and involved in trade with neighbouring peoples such as the Greeks.

In the earlier period Scythian art included very vigorously modelled stylised [[animal style|animal figures]], shown singly or in combat, that had a long-lasting and very wide influence on other [[Eurasia]]n cultures as far apart as [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Celtic art|the European Celts]].  As the Scythians came in contact with the [[Greece|Greeks]] at the Western end of their area, their artwork influenced Greek art, and was influenced by it; also many pieces were made by Greek craftsmen for Scythian customers. Although we know that goldsmith work was an important area of [[Ancient Greek art]], very little has survived from the core of the Greek world, and finds from Scythian burials represent the largest group of pieces we now have.  The mixture of the two cultures in terms of the background of the artists, the origin of the forms and styles, and the possible history of the objects, gives rise to complex questions.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 1, 4-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Many art historians feel that the Greek and Scythian styles were too far apart for works in a hybrid style to be as successful as those firmly in one style or the other.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 355&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences from urbanized civilizations such as those of Persia and China, and the mountain cultures of the [[Caucasus]], also affected the art of their nomadic neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Scythian art especially Scythian [[gold]] jewellery is highly valued by museums and many of the most valuable artefacts are in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]]. Their Eastern neighbours, the [[Pazyryk culture]] in [[Siberia]] produced similar art, although they related to the Chinese in a way comparable to that of the Scythians with the Greek and Iranian cultures. In recent years, [[archeologist]]s have made valuable finds in various places within the area.

==Types of objects==
[[File:Фрагменты Пекторали.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Gold Scythian pectoral, or neckpiece, from a royal [[kurgan]] in [[Tolstaya Mogila]], [[Pokrov, Ukraine]], dated to the second half of the 4th century BC. ]]

The Scythians worked in a wide variety of materials such as gold, [[wood]], [[leather]], [[bone]], [[bronze]], [[iron]], [[silver]] and [[electrum]].  Clothes and horse-trappings were sewn with small plaques in metal and other materials, and larger ones, including some of the most famous, probably decorated shields or wagons.  Wool [[felt]] was used for highly decorated clothes, tents and horse-trappings, and an important nomad mounted on his horse in his best outfit must have presented a very colourful and exotic sight.  As nomads, the Scythians produced entirely portable objects, to decorate their horses, clothes, tents and wagons, with the exception in some areas of [[kurgan stelae]], stone [[stelae]] carved somewhat crudely to depict a human figure, which were probably intended as memorials. Bronze-casting of very high quality is the main metal technique used across the Eurasian steppe, but the Scythians are distinguished by their frequent use of gold at many sites,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 1&lt;/ref&gt; though large hoards of gold objects have also been found further east, as in the hoard of over 20,000 pieces of "Bactrian Gold" in partly nomadic styles from [[Tillya Tepe]] in [[Afghanistan]].
[[File:Fibula in the Form of a Recumbent Stag, about 400 AD, Northeastern Europe, and Stag Plaque, 400-500 BC, Scythian, western Asia, gold - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08141.JPG|thumb|The influence of Scythian art: [[Fibula_(brooch)|Fibula]] in the Form of a Recumbent Stag (below), about 400 AD, Northeastern Europe, and Stag Plaque (above), 400-500 BC, Scythian, western Asia, gold]]

Earlier pieces reflected [[animal style]] traditions; in the later period many pieces, especially in metal, were produced by Greek craftsmen who had adapted Greek styles to the tastes and subject-matter of the wealthy Scythian market, and probably often worked in Scythian territory. Other pieces are thought to be imports from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 4-10&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Scythians prospered through trade with the Greeks, they settled down and started farming. They also established permanent settlements such as a site in [[Belsk]], [[Ukraine]] believed to the Scythian capital [[Gelonus]] with craft workshops and Greek [[pottery]] prominent in the ruins. The [[Pazyryk burials]] (east of Scythia proper) are especially important because the frozen conditions have preserved a wide variety of objects in perishable materials that have not survived in most ancient burials, on the steppes or elsewhere.  These include wood carvings, textiles including clothes and [[felt]] appliqué wall hangings, and even elaborate [[tattoo]]s on the body of the so-called [[Siberian Ice Maiden]]. These make it clear that important ancient nomads and their horses, tents, and wagons were very elaborately fitted out in a variety of materials, many brightly coloured.   Their [[iconography]] includes animals, monsters and anthropomorphic beasts, and probably some deities including a "[[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]]", as well as energetic geometric motifs.  Archaeologists have uncovered felt rugs as well as well-crafted tools and domestic utensils. Clothing uncovered by archaeologists has also been well made many trimmed by embroidery and appliqué designs. Wealthy people wore clothes covered by gold embossed plaques, but small gold pieces are often found in what seem to be relatively ordinary burials.  Imported goods include a famous carpet, the oldest to survive, that was probably made in or around Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Steppes jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The "looped" antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the [[reindeer]], which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period.  The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing.  The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan [[totem]]. The most notable of these figures include the examples from:
*the burial site of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]] in the [[Kuban]] dating from the 6th century BC (Hermitage)
*[[Tápiószentmárton]] in [[Hungary]] dating from the 5th century BC, now [[National Museum of Hungary]], [[Budapest]]
*[[Kul Oba]] in the [[Crimea]] dating from the 4th century BC (Hermitage).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Loehr|Loehr, Max]], "The Stag Image in Scythia and the Far East", ''Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America'', Vol. 9, (1955), pp. 63-76, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20066973 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic form is the [[openwork]] plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, Ann, "Interpreting Scythian Art: East vs. West",
''Artibus Asiae'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1977), pp. 124-138, [[DOI 10.2307/3250196]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250196 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts &amp; personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins &amp; belts, helped to act as armour.

The use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess &amp; powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes.

The primary weapon of this horse riding culture was the bow, &amp; a special case had been developed to carry the delicate but very powerful composite bow. This case, "the gorytus", had a separate container on the outside which acted as a quiver, &amp; the whole was often decorated with animal scenes or scenes depicting daily life on the steppes. There was a marked following of Grecian elements after the 4th century BC, when Greek craftsmen were commissioned to decorate many of the daily use articles.

Scythian art has become well known in the West thanks to a series of touring loan exhibitions from Ukrainian and Russian museums, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.

==Archaeology==
[[File:HorseAttackedByTigerOrdos4th-1stBCE.JPG|thumb|left|Bronze [[Ordos culture]] plaque, 4th century BC; a horse attacked by a tiger]]
Kurgans are large mounds that are obvious in the landscape and a high proportion have been plundered at various times; many may never have had a permanent population nearby to guard them.  To counter this, treasures were sometimes deposited in secret chambers below the floor and elsewhere, which have sometimes avoided detection until the arrival of modern archaeologists, and many of the most outstanding finds come from such chambers in kurgans that had already been partly robbed.

Elsewhere the [[desertification]] of the steppe has brought once-buried small objects to lie on the surface of the eroded land, and many [[Ordos bronzes]] seem to have been found in this way.

Russian explorers first brought Scythian artworks recovered from Scythian burial mounds to [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in the early 18th century. These works formed the basis of the collection held by the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. [[Catherine the Great]] was so impressed from the material recovered from the [[kurgans]] or burial mounds that she ordered a systematic study be made of the works. However, this was well before the development of modern archaeological techniques.

[[Nikolai Veselovsky]] (1848-1918) was a [[Russian archaeologist]] specializing in Central Asia who led many of the most important excavations of kurgans in his day.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first sites discovered by modern archaeologists were the kurgans [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]], Ulagan district of the [[Altay Republic]], south of [[Novosibirsk]]. The name [[Pazyryk culture]] was attached to the finds, five large burial mounds and several smaller ones between 1925 and 1949 opened in 1947 by a Russian archeologist, [[Sergei Rudenko]]; Pazyryk is in the [[Altay Mountains]] of southern Siberia. The kurgans contained items for use in the afterlife. The famous Pazyryk carpet discovered is the oldest surviving wool pile oriental rug.
[[File:TilliaTepeCrown2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Golden crown. Treasure of [[Tillia tepe]], [[Afghanistan]].]]

The enormous hoard of "Bactrian gold" discovered at [[Tillya Tepe]] in northern [[Afghanistan]] in 1978 comes from the fringes of the nomadic world, and the objects reflect the influence of many cultures to the south of the steppes as well as steppes art.  The six burials come from the early 1st century AD (a coin of [[Tiberius]] is among the finds) and though their cultural context is unfamiliar, it may relate to the [[Indo-Scythians]] who had created an empire in north India.

Recent digs in [[Belsk]], Ukraine uncovered a vast city believed to be the Scythian capital [[Gelonus]] described by [[Herodotus]]. Numerous craft workshops and works of pottery have been found. A kurgan or burial mound near the village of [[Ryzhanovka]] in Ukraine, {{convert|75|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Kiev]], found in the 1990s has revealed one of the few unlooted tombs of a Scythian chieftain, who was ruling in the forest-steppe area of the western fringe of Scythian lands. There at a late date in Scythian culture (c. 250 - 225 BC), a recently nomadic aristocratic class was gradually adopting the agricultural life-style of their subjects. Many items of jewellery were also found in the kurgan.

A discovery made by Russian and German archaeologists in 2001 near [[Kyzyl]], the capital of the Russian republic of [[Tuva]] in Siberia is the earliest of its kind and predates the influence of Greek civilisation. Archaeologists discovered almost 5,000 decorative gold pieces including earrings, pendants and beads. The pieces contain representations of many local animals from the period including panthers, lions, bears and deer.

Earlier rich kurgan burials always include a male, with or without a female consort, but from the 4th and 3rd centuries there are number of important burials with only a female.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
[[Image:Scythian resurrection.jpg|thumb|350px|Golden plaques representing the resurrection of a dead hero (Saka culture, 5th century BC, [[Hermitage Museum]]).]]

The finds from the most important nomad burials remain in the countries where they were found, or at least the capitals of the states in which they were located when found, so that many finds from Ukraine and other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] are in Russia.  Western European and American museums have relatively small collections, though there have been exhibitions touring internationally. The Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg has the longest standing and the best collection of Scythian art.  Other museums including several local ones in Russia, in [[Budapest]] and [[Miskolc]] in Hungary, [[Kiev]] in Ukraine, the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] and elsewhere have important holdings. The ''Scythian Gold'' exhibition came from a number of Ukrainian exhibitions including the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, the Institute of Archaeology in Kiev and the State Historical Archaeological Preserve at [[Pereiaslav-Khmel'nyts'kyi]].

''Sidlaphadi'' near [[Badami]] in [[Karnataka]], is a natural rock bridge and pre historic rock shelter. It is located at about four km. in the middle of a shrub jungle near the historic town of Badami. A bridle and kutcha path through sandstone hills from Badami leads to Sidlaphadi and there is no metal road to the spot. ''Sidlaphadi'' literally means in Kannada the ''Rock of lightning'', derived from gaping holes in the natural rock arch, which was formed when a lightning struck.&lt;ref name=arun&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhat|first1=Arun|title=Struck by lightning|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/41256/ipl-2012.html|accessdate=13 August 2014|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The natural rock bridge structure looks like a ''wide arch'' between two sandstone boulders (served as a roof). The rock structure has large, gaping holes in the arch and allows sunlight to enter inside which provides the required light for interiors. It was also a shelter for hunter-gatherer prehistoric people.

There is a replica of Sidlaphadi in the Badami archaeological museum, it is dedicated to recreate Sidlaphadi and has posters to provide relevant information about the evolution of man.

There are evidences to prove that the Sidlaphadi was a dwelling of prehistoric man.

==Prehistoric rock art==

This natural rock bridge structure was studied by archaeologist Shri A. Sundar, who identified prehistoric (now fading) paintings on the roof of the arch. The blunt weapons of stone were also discovered in the area.&lt;ref name=arun/&gt;

The '''Symphony for Organ No. 6''' ('''Symphonie VI pour orgue''') in [[G minor]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 42, No. 2, is an [[organ symphony]] by [[Charles-Marie Widor]]. Completed in 1878, the composer premiered it at the [[Trocadéro#Palais du Trocadéro|Palais du Trocadéro]] as part of the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World Exhibition]]. It was first published by [[Julien Hamelle|Hamelle]] in 1879, together with the famous [[Symphony for Organ No. 5 (Widor)|Symphony for Organ No. 5]].

== History ==
Widor composed the work, one of ten organ symphonies, when he was organist at [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], a post he held from 1870. The church features a main organ by [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll]] which inspired the composer who wrote "If I had not experienced the seduction of these timbres or the mystical attraction of this wave of sound, I would never have written organ music."&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt; Widor's first four symphonies was published by J. Maho in 1872 as his Op. 13.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt; The two following symphonies were published as his Op. 42 in 1879 by [[Julien Hamelle]], Maho's successor. They were reprinted in 1887, now with the revised first four, and the new No. VII and VIII, with a foreword by the composer regarding "the style, the procedures of registration and the signs".&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt; Widor often revised his works several times even after publication.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

[[File:La salle de spectacle du Palais du Trocadéro en 1878 (6351200057).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Salle de spectacle in the [[Trocadéro#Palais du Trocadéro|Palais du Trocadéro]], model]]
Widor probably composed the Symphonie VI between his return from a visit to Bayreuth in 1876, where he attended the first [[Bayreuth Festival]], presenting the first performance of Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', and the summer of 1878. He premiered it for the inauguration of a Cavaillé-Coll organ at the [[Trocadéro#Palais du Trocadéro|Palais du Trocadéro]] in Paris on 24 August 1878 as part of the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World Exhibition]].&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

A critical edition of Symponie VI was published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 2015, based predominantly on the last edition during Widor's lifetime, 1929.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

== Structure and music ==
The work is structured in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
# Allegro
# Adagio
# Intermezzo
# Cantabile
# Final

Widor's organ symphonies are not as much a structural unit, but extended [[Suite (music)|suites]] with orchestral sound. He wrote: "The modern organ is thus symphonic in essence. The new instrument demands a new language, an ideal differing from scholastic polyphony."&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

The first movement introduces a [[chorale]]-like [[Theme (music)|theme]], and expands in both [[sonata form]] and [[Variation (music)|variations]]. A [[recitative]]-episode becomes a second theme. The second movement, in three sections, present "sensual  chromaticism", with a registration of "Gambes et Voix célestes". According to [[Albert Schweitzer]], it was inspired by Wagner's music heard in Bayreuth. The third movement serves as a [[scherzo]]. Three voices receive a specific sound by the registration "Anches et cornets de 4 et de 8", like the [[grand jeu]] of the classical [[French organ school]]. The fourth movement has a lengthy theme, of which several [[Motif (music)|motif]]s are derived. The fifth movement is a sonata-rondo, culminating in a "tumultuous coda".&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

==Plot==

Yvonne is preparing to go out to meet someone, a babysitter arrives and Yvonne leaves. Yvonne is waiting in a restaurant alone for someone, a man arrives, we do not see him, only hearing him greet her. 

Jim ([[Cillian Murphy]]) and his wife Danielle ([[Eva Birthistle]]) are hosting a dinner party one evening at which Danielle's best friend Yvonne ([[Catherine Walker (actor)|Catherine Walker]]) and her husband Chris ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]) are guests. A disagreement erupts between Yvonne and Chris, Chris taking issue with the way Yvonne discussed her seeing of him spending time with their daughters, at which Chris was angered by the implications of this and thus the assumption Danielle and Jim would make of him as a father. 

One day, Jim, locked out of his house after collecting his two children from school and his wife Danielle at work, has nowhere to go, after speaking to Danielle on the phone she suggests he visits Yvonne to collect the spare key, Jim is reluctant and believes it will be awkward due to the argument at the dinner party, he goes anyway. Jim and Yvonne chat over coffee whilst the children play together in the garden, they begin to get to know each other. During this time, Jim also learns that Chris's recent outbursts are due to mood swings he is experiencing as the result of an undisclosed brain-related illness, Chris has not yet told his children or Yvonne and swears Jim to secrecy. 

Jim and his children are sat having lunch one day in a restaurant. As the waitress Orla approaches to collect the plates, Jim queries as to whether one of the meals was supposed to include fries as they hadn't accompanied the meal, a dispute between Jim and Orla takes place and Orla swears at Jim, they leave the restaurant. 

One night, after another argument at home with Chris which results in a physical attack, Yvonne and her children take shelter at Jim and Yvonne's house overnight. The next morning, with Jim working from home and Yvonne at work and the children all at school, Jim and Yvonne talk about marriage. Yvonne confesses her feelings for Jim and they have sex in his marital bed, they soon embark on a fully fledged sexual affair, having sex regularly in a hotel room and latterly on a nearby beach where they are caught.

Yvonne having learnt both of Chris's illness and the fact it is terminal, is angry with Jim and also rejects the prospect of pursuing a relationship with hime despite her early encouragement in the affair that he leaves Danielle and she leave Chris. 

One afternoon Jim falls asleep and is late picking his children up from school, he lies to the Headteacher as to why this was, however, he is caught out later when Danielle asks why he was late and he fails to use the same excuse he did in front of his children and his children say he is lying. This arouses Danielles suspicion and she asks for the passcode to Jim's phone, he questions her intentions and refuses to give her the passcode, he later confesses to having an affair but refuses to say who with and is forced to leave the marital home. 

Danielle is later chatting to Yvonne in the kitchen, Danielle is telling Yvonne about Jim's affair none the wiser that it is Yvonne Jim has been cheating with. 

One night, Jim turns up on Yvonne's doorstep, he wants to know if Yvonne will return to him upon Chris's death and he confesses his love for her, Yvonne is annoyed at this and that Jim knew Chris was ill when he slept with her. 

Jim goes to a bar and is drinking alone, here he bumps into Orla, the waitress. They share back and forth in regards to their earlier disagreement over the meal and the philosophy of the customer always being right. Orla asks Jim to stay for a drink with her, he does. Jim wakes up next to Orla in her bed the following morning. He is woken by his phone ringing, it is Danielle informing him of the death of Chris. As Jim is dressing to leave, Orla asks to see Jim again, he is unsure and questions whether it was not just a one night stand, Orla is unimpressed and verbally abuses Jim and orders him to leave. 

At Chris's funeral, Danielle is there with her new partner, Jim's children talk positively about him and this upsets Jim as he fears he has lost his children. Jim then attacks Danielles new partner who gets the upper hand and Jim ends up in hospital, in the waiting room alone, he breaks down emotionally. 

Some time later, Yvonne is waiting in a restaurant alone, as she was at the beginning of the film, it is revealed that the person she was waiting for earlier was Jim. They both catch-up and get along, Yvonne suggests she and Jim can rekindle their relationship, Jim is now in a relationship, it is too late. 

Yvonne returns home, distraught, she cries at her front door. 

Jim returns home to Orla the waitress, who are both now in a relationship and living together, they row over where Jim has been but he is honest with her. Moments later, Jim is sat alone, Orla comforts him and they chat about the restaurant whilst cuddling on the sofa, Jim assures Orla he felt nothing for Yvonne upon seeing her again. 

A song plays over the radio, they both embrace and slow dance.

==Reception==
Harry Guerin gave the film four stars remarking 'If this film reminds us of anything, it's not to let go lightly.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/movie-reviews/2018/0424/957108-cillian-murphy-the-lonely-man-in-the-delinquent-season/|title=Cillian Murphy the lonely man in The Delinquent Season|first=Harry|last=Guerin|date=24 April 2018|website=RTE.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Times]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; Tara Brady was much more negative, giving it two stars out of five, saying "The denizens of ''The Delinquent Season'' are all ghastly and yet – despite valiant efforts from a talented ensemble cast – not quite horrid enough to be interesting or engaging. [...] O’Rowe’s stylised language – an often potent dialect that sets observational banter to [[David Mamet|Mametian]] rhythms – sounds off-key on a big screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/the-delinquent-season-a-hugely-disappointing-irish-debut-1.3473686|title=The Delinquent Season: A hugely disappointing Irish debut|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Man With the Flower in His Mouth''''' ({{lang-it|'''L'Uomo dal Fiore in Bocca'''}} {{IPA-it|ˈlwɔːmo dal ˈfjoːre im ˈbokka|}}) is a 1922 play by the Italian playwright [[Luigi Pirandello]]. It is particularly noteworthy for becoming, in 1930, the first piece of [[television]] drama ever to be produced in Britain, when a version was screened by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] as part of their experimental transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man with the Flower in his Mouth|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlytv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/technology/technology2.html|title=TV Technology 2. Television on the Air|first=Richard G|last=Elen|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The play is a one-act "dialogue" derived, with small variations, from the novella ''La Morte Adosso'' (1923). The dialogue takes place in a bar, late at night, between a man who is dying of an [[epithelioma]]
(''il fiore in bocca'') and a peaceful businessman who has missed his train. In other words, between someone who intensely lives the little time left to him and someone who is rich with time to spend idly and irresponsibly, waiting for the morning train and entirely absorbed by the banal contretemps.

The exceptional nature of the moment, for the man who feels death upon him—to use Pirandello's phrase—and the normality of it, for the one who is absorbed in the usual affairs of life with its small daily commitments, mark the two ends of the dialectic which is animated in the grand soliloquy of the protagonist.

He lucidly analyses his last sensations on earth, evoking scenes of common life, particulars of a quotidianity which are receding from him irremediably and which, for this reason, make precious the memories of even the most trivial events. In the solemnity of his solitude, he seems to have gained unexpected awarenesses of the life that is leaving him and of death. With no sense of regret or repentance, he almost seems to bitterly enjoy his unrepeatable experience marked by the echo of the end, which allows him to dedicate himself with interest to observing the anonymous life of others, in order to grasp its sense.

==Adaptations==
===1930 television version===
The BBC had been experimenting with [[John Logie Baird]]'s primitive 30-line television technology since the previous year, running test transmissions both from Baird's own premises and from their own [[radio]] headquarters at [[Savoy Hill]]. In the summer of 1930 it was decided that a drama should be produced as a new test for and demonstration of the medium, and ''The Man With the Flower in His Mouth'' was selected for use because of its short length of around half an hour, its limited cast of only three characters and its confined setting.

The production was broadcast live on the afternoon of 14 July, from a set at the Baird company's headquarters, 133 Long Acre in [[London]]. The production starred [[Earle Grey]] as 'The Man', [[Gladys Young]] as 'The Woman' and [[Lionel Millard]] as 'The Customer'. It was directed by the BBC's head of [[radio drama]] at the time, [[Val Gielgud]], and produced by [[Lance Sieveking]]. The artwork was by [[C. R. Nevinson]].

Generally regarded as a successful experiment, the production was watched at the time by [[Ramsay MacDonald]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], with his family from their official residence at [[10 Downing Street]]. Baird had installed one of his prototype 'televisors' here two months previously, so that MacDonald could view the test transmissions he and the BBC were regularly broadcasting.

===1967 re-creation===
As the 1930 production was transmitted live, no record survives of it in the archives. However, in 1967, [[Bill Elliott (television)|Bill Elliott]], a technician working at [[Granada Television]] in [[Manchester]], decided to attempt a re-creation of an extract of the play, using a replica of one of the 30-line Baird Televisiors he had constructed himself, which acted as both camera and monitor.

The 30-line signal was sufficiently low-band for Elliott to be able to record the production onto a stereo audio [[tape recorder]], thus preserving it for posterity. Although Elliott did not re-create the entire play and used amateur student actors in the roles, he did secure the services of the original production's producer, Lance Sieveking. Sieveking not only returned to produce the production in an attempt to assure as much authenticity as possible, but he was also able to provide the original artwork used in the play which was used again, and the very same 78-rpm [[gramophone record]] which had provided the music in 1930, which was also re-used.

The 1967 production survives in Elliott's hands, and a small segment was seen in the 1985 Granada documentary series ''Television'', a history of the medium.

===2007 opera===
In February 2007 an opera based on the play was premiered in [[La Monnaie|De Munt]] in Brussels. The composer was [[Luc Brewaeys]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamonnaie.be/demunt-1.0/programma/productie.jsp?id=4612 Program page at ''De Munt'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Passing of the Armies''''', full title '''''The Passing of the Armies; An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac, Based Upon Personal Reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps'''''&lt;ref&gt;The full title of the book is ''The Passing of the Armies; An Account of the Final Campaign of the Army of the Potomac, Based Upon Personal Reminiscences of the Fifth Army Corps''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38664535].&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[American Civil War]] memoir written by [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]], a renowned commander most famous for his actions on [[Little Round Top]] at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. It is an autobiographical account describing Chamberlain's experiences throughout the latter half of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], on and off the battlefield. It follows his accounts through [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]], [[Battle of White Oak Road|White Oak Road]], [[Battle of Five Forks|Five Forks]], and [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] (where Chamberlain was given the honor of accepting the [[Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House#Surrender|Confederate surrender]]).  Throughout the book, Chamberlain frequently expresses his respect for the soldiers of both the [[Confederate States of America| Confederacy]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)| Union]]. It was published by [[Putnam and Sons]] in 1915, a year after Chamberlain's death.

==Appomattox==

Respect for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, a common theme in the book, was never expressed greater than at [[Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House#Surrender|the surrender at Appomattox]]. Chamberlain recalled the events: 

''"We Formed...to face the last line of battle, and receive the last remnant of the arms and colors of that great army which ours had been created to confront for all that death can do for life."''

Chamberlain goes on to recount how the withered remnants of the armies, formerly robust and strong at the beginning of the war, met each other. The remnants of [[John Bell Hood|Hood]]'s division at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] united with the [[III Corps (Union Army)|Union Third Corps]] exchanging mutual respect. He explains how [[Longstreet's corps]] could not be greeted properly after having exchanged volleys of fire and death with each other.

'''''The World as Will and Representation''''' ('''''WWR'''''; {{lang-de|Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung}}, '''''WWV''''') is the central work of the [[List of German-language philosophers|German philosopher]] [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. The first edition was published in 1818/19,&lt;ref&gt;Although the first volume was published by December 1818, it was printed with a title page erroneously giving the year as 1819 ({{citation |last=Braunschweig |first=Yael |contribution=Schopenhauer and Rossinian Universiality: On the Italianate in Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music &lt;!--|pp=283–304--&gt; |title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor-last=Mathew |editor-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Walton |editor2-first=Benjamin |display-editors=0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-76805-4 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 297, n. 7]}}).&lt;/ref&gt; the second expanded edition in 1844, and the third expanded edition in 1859. In 1948, an abridged version was edited by [[Thomas Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann, ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung von Schopenhauer in einer gekürzten Fassung dargeboten von Thomas Mann'' (Zurich: Classen, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

==English translations==
In the English language, this work is known under three different titles. Although English publications about Schopenhauer played a role in the recognition{{who|date=February 2016}} of his fame{{who|date=February 2016}} as a philosopher in later life (1851 until his death in 1860)&lt;ref&gt;especially John Oxenford, "Iconoclasm in German Philosophy," in ''[[Westminster Review]]'', new series 3 (1853): 388–407&lt;/ref&gt; and a three volume translation by [[R. B. Haldane]] and J. Kemp, titled ''The World as Will and Idea'', appeared already in 1883–1886,&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''The World As Will and Idea'', 3 vols. transl. R. B. Haldane and J. Kemp (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1883–1886)&lt;/ref&gt; the first English translation of the expanded edition of this work under this title ''The World as Will and Representation'' appeared by E. F. J. Payne (who also translated several other works of Schopenhauer) as late as in 1958&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer "The world as will and representation", transl. by E. F. J. Payne (Indian Hills, Colorado: The Falcon’s Wing, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; (paperback editions in 1966 and 1969).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer "The world as will and representation", Courier Dover Publications (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; A later English translation by Richard E. Aquila in collaboration with David Carus is titled ''The World as Will and Presentation'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''The World as Will and Presentation'', trans. Richard E. Aquila in collaboration with David Carus (New York: Longman, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Present-day translator Richard Aquila argues that the reader will not grasp the details of the philosophy of Schopenhauer properly without this new title: "The World as Will and &lt;u&gt;Pre&lt;/u&gt;sentation". According to him, "Idea", "&lt;u&gt;Re&lt;/u&gt;presentation", and "&lt;u&gt;Pre&lt;/u&gt;sentation" are all acceptable renderings of the word ''Vorstellung'', but it is the notion of a performance or a theatrical presentation that is key in his interpretation. The world that we perceive is a "presentation" of objects in the theatre of our own mind; the observers, the "subject", each craft the show with their own stage managers, stagehands, sets, lighting, code of dress, pay scale, etc. The other aspect of the world, the Will, or "thing in itself", which is not perceivable as a presentation, exists outside time, space, and causality. Aquila claims to make these distinctions as linguistically precise as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkshirereview.newyorkarts.net/2009/06/24/presntationnew-look-at-schopenhauer/|title=It’s All in the Presentation: A New Look at Schopenhauer|publisher=|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2012-05-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130722063326/http://berkshirereview.newyorkarts.net/2009/06/24/presntationnew-look-at-schopenhauer/|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to earlier philosophical work==
[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815, second of the critical five years of the initial composition of ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'']]
The main body of the work states at the beginning that it assumes prior knowledge of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theories,&lt;ref&gt;WWR I, xv.&lt;/ref&gt; and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of [[transcendental idealism]] than any of the other later [[German Idealism|German Idealists]]. However, the book contains an appendix entitled "[[Critique of the Kantian Philosophy]]," in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant's [[ethics]] and significant parts of his [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]]. Schopenhauer demands that the introduction be read before the book itself, although it is not fully contained in this book but appeared earlier under the title ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He also states in his introduction that the reader will be at his best prepared to understand his theories if he has lingered in the school of [[Plato]] or he is already familiar with [[Indian philosophy]].

Schopenhauer believed that Kant had ignored inner experience, as intuited through the [[Will (philosophy)|will]], which was the most important form of experience.  Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian [[thing-in-itself]]. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body. According to Schopenhauer, the entire world is the representation of a single Will, of which our individual wills are phenomena. In this way, Schopenhauer's metaphysics go beyond the limits that Kant had set, but do not go so far as the rationalist system-builders who preceded Kant.  Other important differences are Schopenhauer's rejection of eleven of Kant's twelve categories, arguing that only [[causality]] was important.  [[Matter]] and causality were both seen as a union of [[time]] and [[space]] and thus being equal to each other.

Schopenhauer frequently acknowledges drawing on [[Plato]] in the development of his theories and, particularly in the context of aesthetics, speaks of the [[Platonic forms]] as existing on an intermediate [[ontology|ontological]] level between the representation and the Will.

==Development of the work==
The development of Schopenhauer's ideas took place very early in his career (1814–1818) and culminated in the publication of the first volume of ''Will and Representation'' in 1819. This first volume consisted of four books – covering his epistemology, [[ontology]], aesthetics and ethics, in order. Much later in his life, in 1844, Schopenhauer published a second edition in two volumes, the first a virtual reprint of the original, and the second a new work consisting of clarifications to and additional reflections on the first. His views had not changed substantially.

His belated fame after 1851 stimulated renewed interest in his seminal work, and led to a third and final edition with 136 more pages in 1859, one year before his death. In the preface to the latter, Schopenhauer noted: "If I also have at last arrived, and have the satisfaction at the end of my life of seeing the beginning of my influence, it is with the hope that, according to an old rule, it will last longer in proportion to the lateness of its beginning."&lt;ref&gt;WWR I, xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Will==
Schopenhauer used the word ''[[Will (philosophy)|will]]'' as a human's most familiar designation for the concept that can also be signified by other words such as  ''desire,'' ''striving,'' ''wanting,'' ''effort,'' and ''urging.'' Schopenhauer's philosophy holds that all nature, including man, is the expression of an insatiable ''will to life''.
It is through the will that mankind finds all their suffering. Desire for more is what causes this suffering. He argues that only aesthetic pleasure creates momentary escape from the Will. Although the concept of desire may be influenced by Buddhist teachings, it should not be treated as direct reference since desire is not thought to be the fundamental nature of human beings in Buddhism.

==Volume 1==

===Epistemology (Book 1)===
As mentioned above, Schopenhauer's notion of the will comes from the Kantian thing-in-itself, which Kant believed to be the fundamental reality behind the representation that provided the matter of perception, but lacked form. Kant believed that space, time, causation, and many other similar phenomena belonged properly to the form imposed on the world by the human mind in order to create the representation, and these factors were absent from the thing-in-itself. Schopenhauer pointed out that anything outside of time and space could not be differentiated, so the thing-in-itself must be one and all things that exist, including human beings, must be part of this fundamental unity.  Our inner-experience must be a manifestation of the noumenal realm and the will is the inner kernel of every being.  All knowledge gained of objects is seen as self-referential, as we recognize the same will in other things as is inside us.

===Ontology (Book 2)===
In Book 2, [[electricity]] and [[gravity]] are described as fundamental forces of the will. [[Knowledge]] is something that was invented to serve the will and is present in both human and non-human animals. It is subordinate to the demands of the will for all animals and most humans. The fundamental nature of the universe and everything in it is seen as this will. Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure is merely the sensation experienced at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.

===Aesthetics (Book 3)===
Like many other aesthetic theories, Schopenhauer's centers on the concept of [[genius]]. Genius, according to Schopenhauer, is possessed by all people in varying degrees and consists of the capacity for aesthetic experience. An aesthetic experience occurs when an individual perceives an object and understands by it not the individual object itself, but the [[Platonic form]] of the object. The individual is then able to lose himself in the object of contemplation and, for a brief moment, escape the cycle of unfulfilled desire by becoming "the pure subject of will-less knowing". Those who have a high degree of genius can be taught to communicate these aesthetic experiences to others, and objects that communicate these experiences are works of art. Based on this theory, Schopenhauer viewed Dutch [[still-life]] as the best type of painting, because it was able to help viewers see beauty in ordinary, everyday objects. However, he sharply criticized depictions of nude women and prepared food, as these stimulate desire and thus hinder the viewer from the aesthetic experience and becoming "the pure subject of will-less knowing".

Music also occupies a privileged place in Schopenhauer's aesthetics, as he believed it to have a special relationship to the will. Where other forms of art are imitations of things perceived in the world, music is a direct expression and articulation of the will.

===Ethics (Book 4)===
Schopenhauer claims in this book to set forth a purely descriptive account of human ethical behavior, in which he identifies two types of behavior: the affirmation and denial of the will.

According to Schopenhauer, the Will (the great Will that is the [[thing-in-itself]], not the individual wills of humans and animals, which are phenomena of the Will) conflicts with itself through the [[Psychological egoism|egoism]] that every human and animal is endowed with.  Compassion arises from a transcendence of this egoism (the penetration of the illusory perception of individuality, so that one can [[empathise]] with the suffering of another) and can serve as a clue to the possibility of going beyond desire and the will.  Schopenhauer categorically denies the existence of the "freedom of the will" in the conventional sense, and only adumbrates how the will can be "released" or negated, but is not subject to change, and serves as the root of the chain of [[causality|causal]] [[determinism]].  His praise for [[asceticism]] led him to think highly of [[Buddhism]] and [[Vedanta]] [[Hinduism]], as well as some monastic orders and ascetic practices found in [[catholic Church|Catholicism]].  He expressed contempt for [[Protestantism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]], which he saw as optimistic, devoid of [[metaphysics]] and cruel to non-human animals. According to Schopenhauer, the deep truth of the matter is that in cases of the over-affirmation of the will – that is, cases where one individual exerts his will not only for its own fulfillment but for the improper domination of others – he is unaware that he is really identical with the person he is harming, so that the Will in fact constantly harms itself, and justice is done in the moment in which the crime is committed, since the same metaphysical individual is both the perpetrator and the victim.

Schopenhauer discusses suicide at length, noting that it does not actually destroy the Will or any part of it in any substantial way, since death is merely the end of one particular phenomenon of the Will, which is subsequently rearranged. By asceticism, the ultimate denial of the will, one can slowly weaken the individual will in a way that is far more significant than violent suicide, which is, in fact, in some sense an affirmation of the will.

According to Schopenhauer, denial of the will to live is the way to salvation from suffering. "Schopenhauer tells us that when the will is denied, the sage becomes nothing, without actually dying."&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannan, ''The Riddle of the World'', Chapter 5, "Pessimism, Depression, and Salvation," "Salvation as Denial of the Will," p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; When willing disappears, both the willer and the world become nothing. "...[T]o one who has achieved the will-less state, it is the world of the willer that has been disclosed as 'nothing'. Its hold over us, its seeming reality, has been 'abolished' so that it now stands before us as nothing but a bad dream from which we are, thankfully, awaking."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Young, ''Schopenhauer'', Routledge, NY, 2005, Chapter Eight, "Salvation," p. 197 f.&lt;/ref&gt; As Schopenhauer wrote: "...to those in whom the will has turned and denied itself, this very real world of ours, with all its [[Sun]]s and [[Milky Way]]s, is – nothing."&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', Volume I, § 71. [...ist Denen, in welchen der Wille sich gewendet und verneint hat, diese unsere so sehr reale Welt mit allen ihren Sonnen und Milchstraßen – Nichts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy (Appendix)===
At the end of Book 4, Schopenhauer appended a thorough discussion of the merits and faults of Kant's philosophy. Schopenhauer's [[critique of the Kantian philosophy]] asserted that Kant's greatest error was the failure to distinguish between perceptual, intuitive knowledge, or insight and conceptual, discursive knowledge, or investigative thinking. One of Kant's greatest contributions, according to Schopenhauer, was the distinction of the [[phenomenon]] from the [[thing-in-itself]].

==Volume 2==
The second volume consisted of several essays expanding topics covered in the first.  Most important are his reflections on [[death]] and his theory on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], which saw it as a manifestation of the whole will making sure that it will live on and depriving humans of their [[reason]] and sanity in their longing for their loved ones. Less successful is his theory of [[genetics]]: he argued that humans inherit their will, and thus their character, from their fathers, but their intellect from their mothers and he provides examples from biographies of great figures to illustrate this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Recent genetics research might show Schopenhauer to be right.  For example, from New Scientist: "Eric 'Barry' Keverne ... and Azim Surani ... have evidence that in the mouse the mother's genes contribute more to the development of the 'thinking', or 'executive', centres of the brain, while paternal genes have a greater impact on the development of the 'emotional' limbic brain." (by Gail Vines, 03 May 1997, p 34, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420804.300-where-did-you-get-your-brains--baby-mice-may-inherit-their-mothers-wits-and-their-fathers-basicinstincts-but-what-does-this-mean-for-us-asks-gail-vines.html Where did you get your brains?])&lt;/ref&gt;  The second volume also contains attacks on contemporary philosophers such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]].

==Influence==
The first decades after its publication ''The World as Will and Representation'' was met with near silence. Exceptions were [[Goethe]] and [[Jean Paul]]. Goethe immediately started to read the [[magnum opus]] of Schopenhauer when it arrived and "read it with an eagerness as she [Ottilie von Goethe] had ''never'' before seen in him.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe told his daughter-in-law that he had now pleasure for an entire year, because he would read it completely, contrary to his custom of sampling pages to his liking. The influence of Schopenhauer can be read in [[Gespräche mit Goethe]] and {{interlanguage link|Urworte. Orphisch|de|Urworte. Orphisch}}.

In the years where the work was largely ignored, [[Jean Paul]] praised it as “a work of philosophical genius, bold, universal, full of penetration and profoundness — but of a depth often hopeless and bottomless, akin to that melancholy lake in Norway, in whose deep water, beneath the steep rock-walls, one never sees the sun, but only starts reflected.”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arthur-schopenhauer-studienkreis.de/Arthur_Schopenhauer_7/arthur_schopenhauer_7.html|title=Unsere Zeit.

This neglect came to an end in the last years of his life. Schopenhauer would become the most influentual philosopher in Germany until [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Weltschmerz"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900.|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0198768710|location=Oxford|pages=14–16|quote=Arthur Schopenhauer was the most famous and influential philosopher in Germany from 1860 until the First World War. ... Schopenhauer had a profound influence on two intellectual movements of the late 19th century that were utterly opposed to him: neo-Kantianism and positivism.

Schopenhauer set the agenda for his age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially artists were attracted to the work. No philosopher had given so much importance to art: one fourth of ''The World as Will and Representation'' is concerned with [[aesthetics]]. To be mentioned are [[Wagner]] ([[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]]), [[Arnold Schönberg|Schönberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Pamela C.|date=1984|title=Schopenhauer and Schoenberg|url=|journal=Journal of the Arnold Schoenberg Institute|volume= 8| issue =  1|pages=39–57|quote=The influence of Schopenhauer on Schoenberg's thinking can be seen in several different ways. First, the influence is reflected directly in Schoenberg's own essays, and philosophical writings about music and other matters. … Schoenberg owned almost all of the works of Schopenhauer … Schoenberg's use of his Schopenhauer volumes may be compared to his books by other philosophers: of Kant, Schopenhauer's direct intellectual forebear, he owned practically everything. Of Hegel, no books at all!|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805214/75341/sample/9780521475341wsc00.pdf Mahler: Das Lied von der Erde by Stephen Helfling]&lt;/ref&gt; who cites ''The World as Will and Representation'' as “the most profound writing on music he had ever encountered”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mahler’s Third Symphony and the Languages of Transcendence|last=Megan H. Francisco|first=|publisher=University of Washington|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].

The philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Philipp Mainländer]] both described the discovery of ''The World as Will and Representation'' as a revelation. Nietzsche commented, “I belong to those readers of Schopenhauer who know perfectly well, after they have turned the first page, that they will read all the others, and listen to every word that he has spoken.”

[[Charles Darwin]] quoted ''The World as Will and Representation'' in ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADescent_of_Man_1875.djvu/602|title=The Descent of Man|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some read ideas in it that can be found in the theory of evolution, for example, that sexual instinct is a tool of nature to ensure the quality of the offspring and that intellect is a mere means to preserve life. Schopenhauer argued in favor of transformism by pointing to one of the most important and familiar evidences of the truth of the theory of descent, the homologies in the inner structure of all the vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Arthur O.|date=April 1911|title=SCHOPENHAUER AS AN EVOLUTIONIST|jstor=27900310|journal=The Monist|volume= 21| issue =  2|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's ideas on the unconscious can be found in [[psychoanalysis]] and the works of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Whereas Jung acknowledged Schopenhauer's influence, Freud denied to have read Schopenhauer until late in life, a claim which is considered to be doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schopenhauer and Freud.|first=Young C. -  Brook A.|date=February 1994|title=Schopenhauer and Freud.|url=|journal=Int J Psychoanal.|volume=|pages=|quote=A close study of Schopenhauer's central work, 'The World as Will and Representation', reveals that a number of Freud's most characteristic doctrines were first articulated by Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer's concept of the will contains the foundations of what in Freud became the concepts of the unconscious and the id. Schopenhauer's writings on madness anticipate Freud's theory of repression and his first theory of the aetiology of neurosis. Schopenhauer's work contains aspects of what become the theory of free association. And most importantly, Schopenhauer articulates major parts of the Freudian theory of sexuality. These correspondences raise some interesting questions about Freud's denial that he even read Schopenhauer until late in life.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's discussions of language and ethics were a major influence on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the deeper preoccupation of his [Wittgenstein’s] later years remained the same as that of his youth: to complete the logical and ethical tasks begun by Kant and Schopenhauer." Allan Janik and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''Wittgenstein’s Vienna'', Chapter 7, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Moving on by way of Schopenhauer to Wittgenstein .... The only hope for the individual is to save his own soul; and even this he can do only by avoiding worldly entanglements. One of the few pieces of authentic moral advice Wittgenstein was heard to give in his later years is the maxim, ‘One must travel light.’" Allan Janik and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''Wittgenstein’s Vienna'', Chapter 8, p. 244. Also, "The only life that is happy is the life that can renounce the amenities of the world." Wittgenstein, ''Notebooks 1914–1916'', Note of August 13, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In theoretical matters, Wittgenstein’s later philosophy of the ''Philosophical Investigations'' is very different from – according to many an explicit rejection of – the philosophy of the ''Tractatus''. But since his personal life was rather clearly an attempt to live the ‘ethical’ life as conceived in the ''Tractatus'', it seems that in existential matters he did not change his mind. Given that this conception of the ethical life is so strongly influenced by Schopenhauer, it may be said that, in a way, Schopenhauer stayed with him all his life."  Julian Young, ''Schopenhauer'', Routledge, New York, 2005, p. 232 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Writer's Almanac''''' is a daily podcast and newsletter of poetry and historical interest pieces, usually of literary significance. Begun as a radio program in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Songer, ''Garrison Keillor: A Critical Companion'' ([[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2000), {{ISBN|978-0313302305}}, p. 11. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cgDNkYG5D2gC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Writer's%20Almanac%22%20keillor&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Writer's%20Almanac%22%20keillor&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kipin"&gt;David Kipen, [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-18/books/bk-24129_1_garrison-keillor "Flat, Slow and Fetching"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 18, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; it is hosted by [[Garrison Keillor]] and was produced and distributed by [[American Public Media]] through November 2017. Today it is available on Keillor's [http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/radio-categories/twa-2018/ website] and major podcast platforms. Past program sponsors include [[The Poetry Foundation]] (using funds from a large bequest from philanthropist [[Ruth Lilly]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2009-12-31-lilly-heiress_N.htm "Eli Lilly heiress Ruth Lilly dies at 94"], ''[[USA Today]]'', December 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; publisher of ''[[Poetry Magazine]]'' and The Mosaic Foundation of Rita and Peter Heydon.

Each program is at least five minutes long and begins with the phrase "And here is the Writer's Almanac for [insert date here]..." Each daily program includes vignettes about authors and other noteworthy people whose birthdays or significant events coincide with the program's date, as well as excerpts of important events in history. The program continues with one or more poems chosen by Keillor, and ends with Keillor's traditional sign-off, "Be well, do good work, and keep in touch." The program's theme music is a version of the Swedish song "Ge mig en dag", performed by [[Richard Dworsky]] on the piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everything Prairie Home: Richard Dworsky Prairie Home Companion Discography |url=http://www.richarddworsky.com/eph.html |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original theme music was from [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s [[Slavonic Dances|Slavonic Dance]], Op. 72, No. 8.&lt;ref name="kipin"/&gt;

Written by Betsy Allister, Joy Biles, Priscilla Kinter, Heather McPherson, and Holly Vanderhaar, the program was engineered and edited by Thomas Scheuzger, Noah Smith, and Sam Hudson. Production assistance was by Kathy Roach, Katrina Cicala, and Katharine Seggerman.

In 2005 the program was briefly cancelled by Kentucky public radio station [[WUKY]] due to concerns about purportedly indecent content in some of the poems. The station reinstated the program after receiving an "outpouring of support" for the show.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Topcik, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/arts/15arts.html?_r=0 "Arts, Briefly: Keillor Uncensored"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FOkrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yAUGAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=writer's-almanac%20keillor&amp;pg=5610%2C4123529 "Kentucky Station Reinstates Keillor Show After Fan Outcry"], [[Associated Press]] in ''[[Kentucky New Era]]'', August 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This program was distributed in APM's ''Classical 24'' stream and a large percentage of stations that carry it air all or mostly Classical Music during other times.

In November 2017, after allegations of inappropriate behavior by Keillor toward an individual who worked for him on a freelance basis, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] terminated its contracts with him and his private media companies. This effectively ended the distribution and broadcast of ''The Writer's Almanac'' via public radio, as well as rebroadcasts of Keillor's ''A Prairie Home Companion.''&lt;ref&gt;Angie Andresen, [https://www.mpr.org/press/2017/11/29/statement-from-minnesota-public-radio-regarding-garrison-keillor-and-a-prairie-home-compa "Statement from Minnesota Public Radio Regarding Garrison Keillor and A Prairie Home Companion"], ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'', November 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring 2018, Keillor restarted ''The Writer's Almanac'' on his [http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/radio-categories/twa-2018/ website]. In summer 2018, he added the option of subscribing to the newsletter version.

In April 2018, Minnesota Public Radio posted a message stating its intent to re-establish the online archives of ''The Writer's Almanac'' and ''A Prairie Home Companion'': {{Quote|Minnesota Public Radio has reached an agreement with Garrison Keillor to restore free public access to the online archives of ''A Prairie Home Companion'' and ''The Writer’s Almanac.''  They say that past performances of these popular shows will be returned to their respective websites: [http://prairiehome.org/ prairiehome.org] and [http://writersalmanac.org/ writersalmanac.org]. MPR will pay $275,000 for Mr. Keillor’s rights related to these historic archives and to resolve all other matters.

“These archives feature the work of thousands of talented artists, poets, and musicians,” said Jon McTaggart, president and CEO of Minnesota Public Radio and American Public Media Group. “We are pleased that these performances will once again be available to fans of these programs.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mpr.org/stories/2018/04/13/mpr-reaches-agreement-with-garrison-keillor-to-restore-public-access-to-online-archives "MPR Reaches Agreement with Garrison Keillor to Restore Public Access to Online Archives"], ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'', retrieved April 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">A '''tronie''' (16/17th-century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "face") is a common type, or group of types, of works common in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]] that shows an exaggerated [[facial expression]] or a [[stock character]] in costume.

==Definition==
[[File:Joos van Craesbeeck - The Smoker.jpg|thumb|right|270px|upright|[[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'', an example of a "tronie"]]
The term 'tronie' is not clearly defined in art historical literature. Literary and archival sources show that initially the term 'tronie' was not always associated with people. Inventories sometimes referred to flower and fruit still lifes as 'tronies'.  More common was the meaning of face or visage. Often the term referred to the entire head, even a bust, and in exceptional cases the whole body. A tronie could be two-dimensional, but also made of plaster or stone. Sometimes a tronie was a likeness, the depiction of an individual, including the face of God, Christ, Mary, a saint or an angel.  In particular a tronie denoted the characteristic appearance of the head of a type, for example a farmer, a beggar or a jester. Tronie sometimes meant so much as a grotesque head or a model such as the type of an ugly old person.  When conceived as the face of an individual and of a type a tronie's aim was to express feelings and character in an accurate manner and must therefore be expressive.&lt;ref name=tronie&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001200101_01/_zev001200101_01_0017.php Jan Muylle, ''Tronies toegeschreven aan Pieter Bruegel''], in: De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 17. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum 2001, p. 174-203 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern art-historical usage the term tronie is typically restricted to figures not intended to depict an identifiable person, so it is a form of [[genre painting]] in a portrait format.  Typically a painted head or bust only, if concentrating on the facial expression, but often half-length when featured in an exotic costume, tronies might be based on studies from life or use the features of actual sitters.  The picture was typically sold on the art market without identification of the sitter, and was not commissioned and retained by the sitter as [[portrait]]s normally were.  Similar unidentified figures treated as [[history painting]]s would normally be given a title from the classical world, for example the Rembrandt painting now known as ''Saskia as Flora''.

==History==
The genre started in the Low Countries in the 16th century where it was likely inspired by some of the grotesque heads drawn by Leonardo.  Leonardo had pioneered drawings of paired grotesque heads whereby two heads, usually in profile, were placed opposite each other in order to accentuate their diversity.  This paired juxtaposition was also adopted by artists in the Low Countries.  In 1564 or 1565 Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum are believed to have engraved 72 heads attributed to [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] that followed this paired arrangement.&lt;ref name=tronie/&gt;

This paired model was still being used by some artists in the 17th century.  For instance, the Flemish artist [[Jan van de Venne]] who was active in the first half of the 17th century painted a number of tronies juxtaposing different faces.

File:Jan van der Venne - Head of an old woman.jpg|Jan van de Venne, ''Head of an old woman''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several [[Rembrandt]] [[self-portrait]] [[etching]]s are tronies, as are paintings of himself, his son and his wives. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;This is true of modern art-historical terminology; however, historical usage is not so precise. Seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish inventories of paintings might use the term for any unidentified sitter.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  Three [[Vermeer]] paintings were described as "tronies" in the [[Jacob Dissius|Dissius]] auction of 1696, perhaps including the ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and the Washington ''[[:File:Johannes Vermeer - Young Girl with a Flute - WGA24683.jpg|Young Girl with a flute]]''.  [[Frans Hals]] also painted a number of tronies, which are now among his best-known works, including the two tronies known as ''[[Malle Babbe]]'' and the ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]'' (see gallery).

[[Adriaen Brouwer]] was one of the most successful practitioners of the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure.   His ''Youth Making a Face'' (c. 1632/1635, [[National Gallery of Art]]) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer's vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.86204.html Brouwer, Adriaen, ''Youth Making a Face''] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Genre painters often returned to the old theme of the allegory of the five senses and created series of tronies depicting the five senses. Examples are  [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]'s ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' and [[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'' which represents taste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/record=b1202823 ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' by [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]] at the [[Wellcome Library]], London&lt;/ref&gt;

The tronie is related to, and has some overlap with, the "portrait historié", a portrait of a real person '''as''' another, usually historical or [[mythological]], figure. [[Jan de Bray]] specialised in these, and many portraitists sometimes showed aristocratic ladies in particular as mythological figures.

'''''Buddy Bears''''' is the name given to painted, life-size [[fiberglass]] bear sculptures developed by  [[Klaus and Eva Herlitz]], in cooperation with  [[sculptor]] [[Roman Strobl]]. The raised arms of the standing Buddy Bears are aligned on the dissemination of friendliness and optimism, and thus mediate a positive mood.  "The Buddy Bear has become an unofficial ambassador for Germany and is a symbol of Berlin since 2001. The story of the Buddy Bears started with an artistic event in Berlin in 2001. Inspired by the idea of bringing art in the streets of a metropolis like the [[CowParade|cow parade]] in Zurich and New York."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azernews.az/culture/92771.html|title=Kapellhaus hosts "Buddy Bear" award ceremony|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Classic Buddy Bears presented far beyond Berlin’s city limits, the circle of United Buddy Bears came into being in 2002. The Exhibition travel around the world promoting  "peace, international understanding and tolerance among the nations, cultures and religions of this world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specsspaces.com/Blogger/KastleWaserman/Article/ArtisticBearHugBerlinsBuddyBears.aspx ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first activities were presented as the ''Buddy Bear Berlin Show''. In 2001, artists painted approximately 350 bears to appear in the public domain, as decorative elements in the streets of Berlin. Four different bear designs (one standing on all four paws, one standing on two legs, one standing on its head and one in a sitting position) took part in this activity in the city centre of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fruitsq.com/gs/berlin/buddy.html Buddy Bears on the streets of Berlin], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, many of the bears were sold at auctions in aid of child relief organisations.  Nowadays, these Berlin Buddy Bears are exclusively presented on private premises, in front of hotels and embassies as well as in the foyers of various office buildings.

There have already been exhibitions of the original ''Buddy Bears''  — designed by local artists — in the cities of [[Shanghai]] (2004), [[Buenos Aires]] (2005) and [[St. Gallen]] / [[Switzerland]] (2006).

''United Buddy Bears'' is an international art exhibition with more than 140 two metre tall fiberglass bears. Under the motto: "We have to get to know each other better, it makes us understand one another better, trust each other more, and live together more peacefully", more than 140 countries acknowledged by the [[United Nations]] are represented, promoting  "tolerance, international understanding and the great concept of different nations and cultures living in peace and harmony". The bears stand "hand in hand" in a "peaceful circle" ('''The Art of Tolerance'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherryelsewhere.wordpress.com/tag/united-buddy-bears/|title=The Art of Tolerance|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The bears were on display between June and November 2002, in a circle around the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. Around 1.5 million people visited this first exhibition.

On 6 November 2002, the bears were moved to new locations, including their respective countries [[Embassy|embassies]] in Berlin, or back to country that they were based on. Some of the bears were auctioned off to raise money for [[UNICEF]].

After the circle of "United Buddy Bears" had been such an overwhelming success in 2002, a new circle was created in 2003. The idea was to send the circle on a global tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/overview.html |title=Global Tour |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their global tour, the "United Buddy Bears" promote peace, love, tolerance and international understanding. The circle changes every time it reaches a new city. This is not only due to the local conditions, but also to their constantly changing order, as the bears are always set up in alphabetic order, following the local language of the host country. This always leads to new and sometimes politically very interesting proximities.

Entry to the exhibitions is always free. This makes it possible for many school classes to visit the exhibitions in the morning — as part of their lessons — to explore and learn a lot about the culture, history, landscape, economy and music of all five continents in a playful manner. During past exhibitions more than 40 million visitors have already admired the colorful United Buddy Bears.

In every metropolis, the United Buddy Bears exhibitions are supported by the government, the foreign ministries, the mayors and the UNICEF organisations. Heads of state – for example the Japanese [[Prime Minister]], [[Junichiro Koizumi]], the German [[President of Germany|Federal President]], [[Horst Köhler]] and First Lady of Egypt, [[Suzanne Mubarak]] as well as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors such as Sir [[Peter Ustinov]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080816050318/http://www.buddy-baer.com/typo3temp/pics/044b41489f.jpg ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackie Chan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackiechankids.com/files/Buddy_Bear_Factory_Visit.htm |title=Jackie Chan and the Buddy Bears |publisher=Jackiechankids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christiane Hörbiger]], [[Mia Farrow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6207/1664/1600/mia%20farrow.jpg |title=Mia Farrow and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Photos1.blogger.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iris Berben]] and [[Ken Done]] have opened these exhibitions all over the world. ''United Buddy Bears Special Ambassador'' is the actress [[Dennenesch Zoudé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/berlin-20092010/message-of-greetings.html |title=Dennenesch Zoudé and United Buddy Bears |publisher=Buddy-baer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*2003 Berlin: Having visited the exhibition in Berlin in 2002, Sir [[Peter Ustinov]] insisted that [[Iraq]] should be represented in the circle of United Buddy Bears in the future. In 2003, Iraq took part in the circle for the first time and Ustinov gave the opening address of the exhibition in the presence of more than 70 ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/uploads/media/presse_179.jpg|title=China-Net, 2003-7-29: “Ustinov gave the opening address of the exhibition in the presence of more than 70 ambassadors”|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*2005 Seoul: In the run-up to the exhibition in [[South Korea]], two artists got the permission to travel from [[North Korea]] to Germany via [[Beijing]] in order to design a United Buddy Bear in Berlin on behalf of their country. Hence it was possible that both North- and South Korea stood together ''hand in hand'' for the first time during an art exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/uploads/media/presse_619.jpg|title=United Buddy Bears Seoul Festival 2005|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Minis===
In the autumn of 2003, the circle of ''United Buddy Bears-The Minis''  — was presented in Berlin for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-bears-as-ambassadors-for-tolerance/a-19207923|title=Berlin: Bears as Ambassadors for Tolerance - DW - 22.04.2016|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this circle has been shown in [[Frankfurt/Main]], in [[Potsdam]] and at the [[Sony Center]] in Berlin — to name just a few locations.

==Aid for children in need==
Buddy Bear activities and help for children in need have formed an inseparable unit.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} New ''United Buddy Bears'' are often{{quantify|date=April 2016}} designed to replace the previous unique sculpture of a particular country. Many countries are already represented with the third or fourth bear. The previous bears designed on behalf of the respective countries are generally sold at auctions.

{{As of | 2018 | September}} donations and selling ''Buddy Bears'' at auction had generated a total of [[Euro]] 2,300,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddy-baer.com/en/charity/charity-activities/overview.html|title=Buddy Bears -&amp;nbsp;Charity Activities - Overview|website=www.buddy-baer.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in aid of UNICEF and of local organisations helping children in need.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Involved artists==
In the early years, the Bears were designed by regional artists and Berlin celebrities for the exhibition ''Art in the City''.&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''Buddy Bär Berlin Show'', page 20, 21 ff, Neptun Verlag AG, CH-8280 Kreuzlingen, {{ISBN|3-85820-152-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 onwards, thanks to support from [[Lufthansa]], [[Air Berlin]] and the [[:de:Deutscher Hotel- und Gaststättenverband|Berlin Hotel Association]], artists from all five continents took part in the
international project ''United Buddy Bears''. More than 240 artists from over 150 countries have taken part in this project to date,&lt;ref&gt;Eva und Klaus Herlitz: ''United Buddy Bears — The Art of Tolerance'', Page 52 – 357, Berlin, 2009/10, {{ISBN|978-3-00-029417-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as, for example [[Arik Brauer]], [[René Cadena Ayala]], [[:de:Hernando León|Hernando León]], [[Ibrahim Hazimeh]], [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]], [[SEO (artist)|Seo Soo-Kyoung]], [[:de:Helge Leiberg|Helge Leiberg]], [[Leda Luss Luyken]], [[Ludmila Seefried-Matějková]] – this is also echoed by the artist and UNICEF Australian National Ambassador, [[Ken Done]].

The '''VFX creative director''' is a position common in [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, and [[computer game]]s using a large amount of [[visual effects]].

For movies which are fully or partly [[computer-generated imagery|computer generated]], a VFX creative director works closely with the [[film director|director]]. On smaller VFX-intensive productions such as [[music video]]s or some [[television commercial]]s, a VFX creative director may also assume the responsibilities of the director. They are charged with making creative and aesthetic choices for visual effects. Although the role is generally more creative in nature, most VFX creative directors have a technical background and may exert a strong practical hand in production.

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of a VFX creative director are very much like those of an [[art director]], [[production designer]], or [[chief creative officer]], though with a particular focus on the computer-generated imagery of their projects. They are primarily responsible for directing and supervising the creative and technical execution of visual effects sequences, from concept to completion, including:
* [[Set extension]]s and matte painting
* [[Chroma key|Bluescreen]]ing
* [[Computer animation|Digital animation]]
* Digital effects
* [[Compositing]]

The VFX creative director may delegate responsibilities to [[visual effects supervisor]]s, visual effects editors, film [[compositing|compositors]], [[rotoscoping|rotoscope artists]], [[matte painting|matte painters]], and [[3D computer graphics|3D animators]].

VFX creative directors may therefore have input on various aspects of production, including:
* Story development and [[storyboarding]]
* Blocking, staging, locations
* Advising the director on actor movement
* [[Cinematography]]
* [[Costume]], [[makeup]], and [[Film prop|props]], particularly when there are [[special effects]] considerations

==Educational requirements==
As with much of the film industry, merit is awarded on the quality of work produced and not on academic qualifications. Bachelor's or master's degrees in film and television, digital media, design, or animation may be beneficial. There are a suite of skills and conditions that predispose an individual to successful operation as a VFX creative director:
* Experience from at least 5–10 years in the industry
* An understanding of the production process from concept to completion
* A deep familiarity with post-production pipelines, techniques, and software
* A strong balance of both creative and practical / technical skills
* Excellent communication and people-management skills
* Ability to guide and lead a team to extract their best work according to a predefined vision
* A strong grasp of all aspects of film theory

[[Image:Timbre Verigar 15 Slovenie SHS 1918.jpg|right|200px|thumb|15-[[heller (money)|heller]] value]]
'''''Verigar''''' was the first [[postage stamp]] series of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], issued in [[Slovenia]] after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] at the end of [[World War I]]. The name of the stamp series is derived from the [[Slovene language|Slovene]] word ''veriga'', meaning 'chain', and depicts a [[slave]] who has broken the chains. The scene symbolizes the freedom of the [[Slavic peoples]] from Austria-Hungary. It was designed by the academic painter [[Ivan Vavpotič]], whose model was the gymnast [[Stane Derganc]].

==Description==
The stamp design includes the abbreviated name of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs written in [[Serbian Cyrillic]] and [[Gajevica|Gaj’s Latin]] script ("Држава СХС" - "Država SHS"). The stamp design also includes an image that represents a man who has broken the chains enslaving him; he stands in front of a rising sun.

==History==
The first stamps of the series were designed in the late 1918 in [[Ljubljana]] during the short-lived [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and issued on 3 January 1919 after the creation of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. They were then published in different versions until 1920. In 1925, Vavpotič regretted the choice of the motif, because he found it kitschy.&lt;ref name="Pošta534"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.posta.si/opis-postnega-ziga/725/90-let-Verigarjev?nodeid=534 |first=Bojan |last=Bračič |language=Slovenian |title=90 let Verigarjev |trans-title=90 Years of Chainmen |publisher=Pošta Slovenije [Post of Slovenia] |date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Slovenija1993verigar.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 1993 stamp commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Verigar issue]]

==Commemoration==
On 19 March 1993, the [[Post of Slovenia|Slovenian post office]] issued a new stamp series using the ''Verigar'' man to commemorate its 75th anniversary. Another commemorative stamp was published on the 90th anniversary of the series in 2009.&lt;ref name="Pošta534" /&gt;

[[File:Books (7003021898).jpg|thumb|Monographs divided into several volumes.]]
[[File:UTC Library IMG 0680 (842085138).jpg|thumb|Journal issues bound into volumes in a library. ]]
A '''volume''' is a physical [[book]]. It may be printed or [[Codex|handwritten]]. The term is commonly used to identify a single book that is part of a larger [[wikt:collection|collection]]. Volumes are typically identified [[Sequence|sequentially]] with [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or [[Arabic numerals]], e.g. "Volume 3" or "Volume III." and is commonly abbreviated to "Vol."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Volumes may be published directly, or they may be created out of [[Bookbinding|bound]] issues. For instance, a library that subscribes to a [[Periodical literature|periodical]] and wishes to preserve it typically takes a set of the issues and has them bound into a volume.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BUNN|first=R.M.|date=January 1962|title=BINDING OF PERIODICALS IN THE NATIONAL LENDING LIBRARY|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/eb026312|journal=Journal of Documentation|volume=18|issue=1|pages=20–24|doi=10.1108/eb026312|issn=0022-0418|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIDNEY DITZION, LEVERETT NORMAN|first=|date=1956|title=Problems of Periodical and Serial Binding|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/5657/librarytrendsv4i3e_opt.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Publishing|publisher]] may also separately publish a volume out of previously published issues; this is common with [[Graphic novel|graphic novels.]] A volume may also be composed of entries, as in an [[encyclopedia]], or chapters, as in a [[monograph]]. 

The term is also used as an identifier for a sequence of periodicals. This is generally based on a single calendar year, but not always. For instance, a school magazine might start each new volume at the beginning of the academic year, or at the beginning of each term/semester. Thus, all issues published in the ''Nth'' term or year will be classified under the ''Nth'' volume.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Journalism-newspapers-magazines-2494/volume-issue.htm|title=All Experts Questions and Answers – Journalism|last=|first=|date=|website=All Experts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202011515/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Journalism-newspapers-magazines-2494/volume-issue.htm|archive-date=2010-02-02|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original function of labelling issues with a volume at publication time was to provide a standard way for libraries to later bind the issues into a physical volume.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[literature]], '''writing style''' is the manner of expressing thought in language characteristic of an individual, period, school, or nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, style is a term that may refer, at one and the same time, to both conventions that go beyond the individual writer and to singular aspects of individual writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Aquilina|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the essential elements of [[spelling]],  [[grammar]], and [[punctuation]], writing style is the choice of [[word]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] structure, and [[paragraph]] structure, used to convey the meaning effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former are referred to as ''rules'', ''elements'', ''essentials'', ''mechanics'', or ''handbook''; the latter are referred to as ''style'', or ''rhetoric''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=100,129,156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules are about ''what'' a writer does; style is about ''how'' the writer does it.  While following the rules drawn from established English usage, a writer has great flexibility in how to express a concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of good writing style is to
* express the message to the reader simply, clearly, and convincingly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|pp=85,99,112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=69,79,81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* keep the reader attentive, engaged, and interested;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1991|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|pp=21,26,112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
not to
* display the writer’s personality;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* demonstrate the writer’s skills, knowledge, or abilities;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
although these are usually evident and are what experts consider the writer’s individual style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=66,68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of words ==
[[Diction]], or the choice of ''words'', is obviously a central element in every writer’s style.  Although good diction is partly a matter of trial and error, of tinkering with sentences until they sound right, it is also a matter of following certain general preferences that careful readers and writers tend to share.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for using diction effectively in writing:
* Use a dictionary and thesaurus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=100–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=187–189,191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Seek a middle level of diction&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=176–178,181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Call things by their names&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid redundancy and circumlocution&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=166–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid clichés&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=194–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid jargon&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid obsolete, archaic, or invented words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid slang, regional expressions, and nonstandard English&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=180–181,192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=75–76,81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid qualifiers&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid fancy words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use words in their established senses&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid offensive or sexist language&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=183–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Say no more than you mean&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be as concrete as your meaning allows&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use logical terms precisely&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Put statements in positive form&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make metaphors vivid and appropriate&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=117–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prefer vivid nouns and active verbs to adjectives and adverbs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of sentence structure ==
Sooner or later, a writer will have the essential elements of formal ''sentence'' correctness under control and will want to find the best ways of making sentences convey meaning effectively:  how to phrase statements definitely, place coordinate thoughts in coordinate structures, [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] to sharpen the relation between main assertions and modifying elements, eliminate unnecessary words, vary sentence structure, maintain consistency of [[Tone (literature)|tone]], and smooth the general flow of words.  Seemingly minor improvements—the moving of a [[clause]] from one position to another, a shift from the [[Passive voice|passive]] to the [[active voice]], even a slight change in rhythm—can make the difference between drab sentences and pointed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for writing effective sentences:
* Avoid irrelevancy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make real assertions&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rely on the active voice&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coordinate to show that ideas belong together&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=110–111,116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeat words, phrases, and clauses for emphasis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make series consistent and climactic&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to show which is the main statement&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to avoid monotony&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to break up lengthy compound sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose an appropriate means of subordination&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Place subordinate elements where they will convey the exact meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate in one direction per sentence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be concise but do not omit necessary words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=222–223,226,228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Break the monopoly of declarative sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the order and complexity of sentence elements&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the length of the sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be consistent&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid distracting repetitions of sound&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Listen for sentence rhythm&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=150–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use parallel construction&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=121–124,155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keep related words together&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of paragraph structure ==
The most important unit of meaning in every literary work is the ''paragraph''.  Although each sentence conveys a thought, a literary work is not just a sequence of, say, eighty thoughts; it is rather a development of one central [[Thesis statement|thesis]] through certain steps.  Those steps are paragraphs.  Within an effective paragraph the sentences support and extend one another in various ways, making a single, usually complex, unfolding idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from outright incoherence, choppiness, or long-windedness, perhaps the most common flaw in paragraph construction is rigidity of presentation.  Having something to say, the writer merely says it—and goes on to do just the same in the following paragraph.  As a result, the reader feels, not like a participant in the writer’s thought, but like someone receiving instructions or being shown a rapid succession of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for writing effective paragraphs:
* Pursue one main idea&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Place the main idea emphatically&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose a suitable pattern of development&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=161–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=15,70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Link sentences within each paragraph&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Link each paragraph to the next&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the length of the paragraphs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Move between generality and detail&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keep things moving&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Write in paragraph blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make the first paragraph count&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=185–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* End with a strong paragraph&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Note how rewriting the familiar sentence, "[[The American Crisis|These are the times that try men’s souls.]]" by [[Thomas Paine]], changes the overall impact of the message.

:Times like these try men’s souls.
:How trying it is to live in these times!
:These are trying times for men’s souls.
:Soulwise, these are trying times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare the following passages, and note how the authors convey their messages in different manners, as a result of their choices.

''[[Hamlet]]'', Act II, Scene 2 (1599–1602) by [[William Shakespeare]]:

&lt;!-- This passage is reproduced verbatim from the play.  Please do not correct. --&gt;
:HAMLET.  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.  I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this  majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.  What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how expressed and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!  And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=1923–1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859) by [[Charles Dickens]]:

:It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dickens|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Child's Christmas in Wales#Publishing history|Memories of Christmas]]'' (1945) by [[Dylan Thomas]]:

:One Christmas was so much like another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with the heat and the cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eastman et al.|1977|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography#1955|The Strawberry Window]]" (1955) by [[Ray Bradbury]]:

:In his dream he was shutting the front door with its strawberry windows and lemon windows and windows like white clouds and windows like clear water in a country stream.  Two dozen panes squared round the one big pane, colored of fruit wines and gelatins and cool water ices.  He remembered his father holding him up as a child.  "Look!"  And through the green glass the world was emerald, moss, and summer mint.  "Look!"  The lilac pane made livid grapes of all the passers-by.  And at last the strawberry glass perpetually bathed the town in roseate warmth, carpeted the world in pink sunrise, and made the cut lawn seem imported from some Persian rug bazaar.  The strawberry window, best of all, cured people of their paleness, warmed the cold rain, and set the blowing, shifting February snows afire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradbury|1971|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]'' (1963) by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]:

:Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states.  I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham.  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.  We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.  Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.  Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial "outside agitator" idea.  Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eastman et al.|1977|p=810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writer's voice ==&lt;!-- Writer's voice links here. --&gt;
{{Distinguish|Character's voice|Grammatical voice}}

The '''writer's voice''' is a rather vague metaphorical term by which some critics refer to distinctive features of a written work in terms of spoken utterance.  The voice of a literary work is then the specific group of characteristics displayed by the narrator or poetic "speaker" (or, in some uses, the actual author behind them), assessed in terms of ''tone'', ''style'', or ''personality''.  Distinctions between various kinds of narrative voice tend to be distinctions between kinds of ''[[Narrative#Types of narrators and their modes|narrator]]'' in terms of how they address the reader (rather than in terms of their perception of events, as in the distinct concept of ''[[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]'').  Likewise in non-narrative poems, distinctions can be made between the personal voice of a private lyric and the assumed voice (the [[Persona#In literature|persona]]) of a dramatic monologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author uses sentence patterns not only to make a point or tell a story, but to do it in a certain manner that amounts to a personal signature, a characteristic way of presenting reality.  It is perfectly understandable that an aspiring writer could fall in love with the work of a brilliant literary figure (for example, [[William Faulkner]] or [[William S. Burroughs]]) and then try to emulate that literary voice, but when an amateur aims deliberately for the sort of mature voice found in seasoned professionals, the result is likely to be literarily pretentious and largely unreadable.  In fact, this sort of literary pretentiousness is a clear mark of an amateur.  A strong, distinctive, authoritative writing voice is something most fiction writers want and is something any writer can bring out in himself or herself, but oddly enough, it can’t be produced by concentrating on it, nor can it be imparted by an editor or teacher.  Such an effect is achieved simply by writing often and carefully.  Spending creative energy in the service of the way sentences read as prose is likely to be at the expense of the characters or story.  Writers should concentrate on characters and story and let their voice take care of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Browne|King|1993|pp=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing coaches, teachers, and authors of [[creative writing]] books often speak of the writer's voice as distinguished from other [[literary element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=198–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozelle|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as voice is often described vaguely, their distinction may be only superficial.  In some instances, voice is defined nearly the same as style;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozelle|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others, as [[Literary genre|genre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[literary mode]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=24,26,100,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; point of view,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mood (literature)|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pianka|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pianka|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
