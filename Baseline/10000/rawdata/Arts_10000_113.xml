Chughtai was born on 21 Sep 1894 in [[Lahore]], now in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography at Chughtai Museum website|url=http://www.chughtaimuseum.com/index.php|publisher=Chughtai Museum}}, Retrieved 16 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Lahore in the area known as 'Mohalla Chabuk Sawaran', the second son of Karim Bukhsh, in a family descended from generations of craftsmen, architects, and decorators. Chughtai briefly learnt naqqashi from his uncle Baba Miran Shah Naqqash at a local mosque.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt; After completing his education at the Railway Technical School, Lahore, in 1911, Chughtai joined the [[Mayo School of Arts, Lahore]], where Samarendranath Gupta, a pupil of [[Abanindranath Tagore]] was Vice-Principal. After leaving the school, he made a living for a while as a photographer and drawing teacher. He eventually became the head instructor in chromo-lithography at the Mayo School.&lt;ref name="Mitter1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Partha Mitter|title=Art and Nationalism in Colonial India, 1850–1922: Occidental Orientations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C|accessdate=14 April 2012|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Letter of A. R. Chugtai to Bhai Vir Singh.jpg|thumb|Letter of Chugtai to Bhai Vir Singh]]
In 1916, Chughtai's first painting in a revivalist 'oriental' style appeared in the ''Modern Review''. He had his first exhibition in 1920 at the Punjab Fine Art Society.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt; He also exhibited with the Indian School of Oriental Art during the 1920s, by which time he had become quite renowned. His work contributed greatly to Lahore's burgeoning modern art scene. Whilst he predominantly worked with watercolors, Chughtai was also a print-maker, perfecting his etching skills in London during visits in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Abdur Rahman Chughtai, 1897–1975|url=http://cmfinearts.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/abdur-rahman-chughtai-1897-1975/|publisher=Charles Moore Fine Arts}}, Retrieved 16 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt; His sketches were used in many books in Punjabi poetry by Bhai Vir Singh for illustrating his famous poems like "Kambadi Kalai" and including his famous epic "Rana Surat Singh" . Chughtai offered his gratitude to Bhai Vir Singh for becoming part of these illustrations as a young artist in his letter to him on 11.04.1929&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Rehman Chugtai's letter dtd 11/04/1929 Lahore preserved in Bhai Vir Singh Memorial House, Amritsar&lt;/ref&gt;

In his sixty years of artistic creation, Chughtai produced nearly 2000 watercolours, thousands of pencil sketches, and nearly 300 etchings and aquatints. He also wrote short stories, and articles on art. He designed stamps, coins, insignia and book covers. He was also an avid collector of miniatures and other art.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; He published three books of his own work: the ''Muraqqai-i-Chughtai'' (1928), ''Naqsh-i-Chughtai'' (c. 1935) and ''Chughtai's Paintings'' (1940).&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M. Bloom|author2=Sheila Blair|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA489|accessdate=15 April 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=489–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Muraqqa-i-Chughtai'' was a sumptuously illustrated edition of Mirza [[Ghalib]]'s Urdu poetry, with a foreword by Sir [[Muhammad Iqbal]]. It is regarded as the most significant work of Chughtai's career&lt;ref name="Dadi2010" /&gt; and in its time, was considered the finest achievement in book production in the country.
&lt;ref name="Venkatachalam1948"&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Venkatachalam|title=Contemporary Indian Painters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsPaOwAACAAJ|accessdate=15 April 2012|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Chughtai came to be regarded as one of the most famous representatives of Pakistan. Chughtai’s paintings were given to visiting heads of states. [[Allama Iqbal]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Elizabeth II]] were amongst his admirers.

Chughtai's closest associate was his younger brother Abdullah Chughtai, a scholar and researcher of Islamic art.&lt;ref name="Dadi2010" /&gt; Chughtai married twice, and had two children, a son and daughter. He died in [[Lahore]] on 17 January 1975.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt;


==Art==
Chughtai's early watercolours take off from the revivalism of the [[Bengal School of Art]] – his ''Jahanara and the Taj'', for instance, shows the influence of Abanindranath's ''The Last Moments of Shah Jahan''.&lt;ref name="Mitter1994" /&gt;  By the 1940s, he had created his own style, strongly influenced by Islamic art traditions, but retaining a feel of [[Art Nouveau]]. His subject matter was drawn from the legends, folklore and history of the Indo-Islamic world, as well as Punjab, Persia and the world of the Mughals.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Abdur Rahman Chughtai|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1365955/Abdur-Rahman-Chughtai|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}, Retrieved 16 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdur Rahman Chughtai also designed the logo for the [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) at the behest of its first general manager, [[Ubaidur Rahman]]. The logo has been tweaked and modified over the years since its inception but remains fundamentally the same. On Pakistan's independence day in 1951, he produced a set of 9 stamps, better known as 'Chughtai Art set'. At that time, this set was considered as the most beautiful stamps of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://artocraft.blogspot.com/2010/09/abdul-rehman-chughtai-his-paintings.html, Profile of Abdur Rahman Chughtai on artocraft.com website, Retrieved 16 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and gallery owner [[Salima Hashmi]] deems Chughtai one of [[South Asia]]’s foremost painters.  “He was part of the movement that started in the early part of the 20th century to establish an identity indigenous to the subcontinent,” she said. “He rejected the hegemony of the [[British Colonial]] aesthetic.”{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The '''American Artists' Congress''' (AAC) was an organization founded in February 1936 as part of the [[popular front]] of the [[Communist Party USA]] as a vehicle for uniting [[graphic art]]ists in projects helping to combat the spread of [[fascism]]. During [[World War II]] the organization was merged into the '''Artists' Council for Victory,''' which effectively spelled the end of the organization.

==Organizational history==

===Origins===

The [[Great Depression]] and the rise of fascism in the 1930s caused politics and arts to collide as cultural liberals united to work on common goals. Communist parties adopted a policy of forming broad alliances with anybody willing to oppose fascism and became known as the [[Popular Front]]. After the official formation of the United Front in 1935, artists in the U.S. began seeing themselves as the “guardians of liberal and democratic ideals” &lt;ref name="Hemingway"&gt;Andrew Hemingway, ''Artists on the Left: American Artists and the Communist Movement.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social art became significant, with 1933–38 seeing the formation of the [[John Reed Club]]s, the [[Artists Union]], the [[Harlem Artists Guild]], and the American Artists' Congress.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  Artists had an idealistic view of [[working-class culture]] and used the labor movement as a sort of prototype for their mission.  There was a shift in the patronage, subject matter, and position of the art produced during this time.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

By 1934 and 1935, it became clear that the John Reed Clubs' sectarian policies were not congruent with the Popular Front. At a meeting of the John Reed Club, the idea of an American Artists' Congress was discussed and twelve of those present were given the task of organizing it.&lt;ref name="Whiting"&gt;Cecile M. Whiting, ''Antifascism in American Art.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] was put in charge of forming its committee.  Almost all of those involved with creating the AAC were established figures of the Communist left and had some connection with the John Reed Clubs.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

===Mission===

The AAC hoped to establish a group of artists who realized that collective organization was necessary to combat [[fascism]].&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt; Politically and artistically, the congress attempted to distinguish itself from the John Reed clubs, which were specifically radical and rigidly adhered to a particular set of views.  By creating a group that was non-sectarian and tolerant of all affiliations, the AAC fit in with the goal of the Popular Front.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Julia Williams, ''Artists Against War and Fascism.'' New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the chairman of the congress stated that “The Congress does not demand any political alignments…all we ask is that artists who realize the threat of fascism come together, discuss the situation, and form an organization of artists for their own insurance…we do not want any emphasis on extreme radicalism."&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

The AAC was directed towards artists who believed that the cultural crisis was a reflection of the world economic crisis.  Their specific concerns were violations of international [[civil liberty|civil liberties]], the inadequacy of government programs, censorship, and the decline of traditional forms of patronage.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

===Early activity===

The membership brochure of the AAC read: “Membership in the Congress is open to any artist of the first rank living in the U.S. without regard to the way he paints or the subject matter he chooses to deal with in his work. The only standard for membership is whether he has achieved a position of distinction in his profession and the only requirement that he support the program of the Congress against war and fascism.”&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt; 

At the first congress meeting in 1936, the slogan was “Against War and Fascism."&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt; By the next year, the AAC toned down its platform and changed the slogan to “For Peace, for Democracy, for Cultural Progress."&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt;  The congress was anti-fascism and pro-democracy, and did not take a stance in favor of [[proletarian revolution]] as the John Reed Clubs had done. As a result, the congress attracted a wide group of artists with different backgrounds, styles, and political commitments. In November 1936, the congress claimed to have 550 members with branches in Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;  

Their first activity was to boycott the exhibition of paintings to be held in conjunction with the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Internationally, the congress denounced Nazi repression in Germany and fascist aggression in Spain and China. They condemned censorship in the home and of artwork, and put on annual anti-fascist exhibits.&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;

Due to the status of many of its members, the AAC was able to generate publicity and a greater impact in the art world.  It lobbied for a permanent federal art program, fought for a museum rental fee for exhibitors, and worked to get a showing of contemporary American art at the New York World's Fair.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  In 1938, the Republican gains of the mid-term elections caused such federal art projects to be rendered more conservative.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

===The Loyalist Movement in Spain===

Internationally, the suffering in Spain under fascism was of particular priority to the AAC.  They devoted a great deal of political and artistic efforts to the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Loyalist cause]].  The organization urged lifting the American embargo of arms to the Loyalists and revising the [[Neutrality Act of 1937]], which prohibited such aid.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  Also in 1937, they organized theme exhibitions referring to the [[Spanish Civil War]], which raised money to send ambulances, food, and clothing supplies to the Loyalists.  These exhibitions make clear that the most prominent anti-fascist artists were concentrating on the plight in Spain.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;  

Along with several organizations, the AAC formed the American Artists and Writers Ambulance Corps for Spain.  In 1939, the AAC was able to bring Pablo Picasso's painting Guernica to New York to be exhibited at the Valentine Gallery to raise money for the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt; These attempts to help the Loyalist cause created organizational motivation for antifascist artwork that depicted images in Spain.  The resulting paintings were not literal representations of the conflicting parties in Spain but images of the essence of human suffering.  The various styles of paintings reflect the diversity of the artists aesthetic tastes and techniques.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

===Dissolution===

The AAC had a close association with the Communist party and eventually experienced fundamental dissension in beliefs.  At a meeting in 1940, to the shock of many members, the Congress endorsed the [[Winter War|Russian invasion of Finland]].&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;  It was believed that this implicitly defended Hitler's position by assigning the responsibility for the war to England and France. In addition, according to a succession letter, the Congress loosened its policy of boycotting Fascist and Nazi exhibits.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt; 

At this time, 17 prominent members left the Congress, writing a letter of succession detailing why.  The AAC continued to function primarily with other organizations through 1941, but dissolved soon after U.S. entrance into the war.&lt;ref name="Whiting" /&gt;  The Congress then participated in a meeting called the Artists' Societies for National Defense, which established the Artists' Council for Victory, an organization that combined twenty-three artists' societies.&lt;ref name="Hemingway" /&gt;

[[Image:American Progress (John Gast painting).jpg|300px|thumb|''American Progress'' (1872)]]
'''''American Progress''''' is an 1872 painting by [[John Gast (painter)|John Gast]], a [[Prussia|Prussian]]-born painter, printer, and [[lithography|lithographer]] who lived and worked most of his life in [[Brooklyn]], New York. ''American Progress'', an allegory of [[Manifest Destiny]], was widely disseminated in chromolithographic prints. It is now held by the [[Autry Museum of the American West]] in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.theautry.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=M545330;type=101 Museum website entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than he painted ''American Progress'', and that he was born December 21, 1842, in [[Berlin]], and died July 26, 1896, in Brooklyn,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary in the ''Brooklyn Eagle'', July 27, 1896, p. 7, c. 2&lt;/ref&gt; little else is known about Gast's life.

== Description ==
''American Progress'' has become a seminal example of American Western art. The painting serves as an allegory for the Manifest Destiny and American [[westward expansion]]. The 12.75 by 16.75 inch painting was commissioned in 1872 by George Crofutt, a publisher of American Western travel guides, and has been frequently reproduced. The woman in the center is called "Progress", and on her head is what Crofutt calls "The Star of the Empire". Progress moves from the light-skied east to the dark and treacherous West, leading white settlers who follow her either on foot or by [[stagecoach]], horseback, [[conestoga wagon]], [[wagon train]], or riding [[steam train]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/97507547/|title=American Progress|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress lays a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] wire with one hand and carries a school book in the other. As she moves westward, indigenous people and a herd of [[American Bison|buffalo]] are seen fleeing her and the settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://picturinghistory.gc.cuny.edu/john-gast-american-progress-1872/|title=John Gast, American Progress, 1872|last=Sandweiss|first=Martha A.|date=|website=|access-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Progress'' visually portrays the process of American westward expansion. The figure of Progress is ushering an era of modernization, development, and advancement to the West, which in the painting is portrayed as a dark and savage place, especially when compared to the eastern side of the painting. But, with the ushering in of these developments, the indigenous people living in the West and their way of life is cast out.

{{Culture of the Philippines}}
The '''art of the Philippines''' refers to the works of [[art]] that have developed and accumulated in the [[Philippines]] from the beginning of civilization in the country up to the present era. It reflects to its society and non-Filipinos the wide range of cultural influences on the country's culture and how these influences honed the country's arts. The art of the Philippines can be divided into two distinct branches, namely, traditional arts, and non-traditional arts. Each branch is further divided into various categories with subcategories.

[[File:Kutkut.jpg|thumb|''Kut-kut'' is a technique combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of [[Samar|Samar Island]] between early 1600 and late 1800 AD. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—[[sgraffito]], encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space.|181x181px]]

Many of historians believed that the various cultures of the Philippine archipelago first encountered Hindu and/or Buddhist beliefs as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE,&lt;ref name="Jocano2001" /&gt; but some of recent scholarship suggests that these cultural influences mostly filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries. Present-day scholarship believes these religious and cultural influences mostly came through trade with Southeast Asian thassalocratic empires such as the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]], which had in turn had trade relationships with India.&lt;ref name="Jocano2001"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Jocano  | first = F.

Scholars such as [[Milton Osborne]] emphasise that despite these beliefs being originally from India, they reached the Philippines through Southeast Asian cultures with Austronesian roots.&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artifacts reflect the iconography of the [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] and its influences on the Philippines' early states.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Legeza, "Tantric Elements in the Philippines PreHispanic Gold Arts," Arts of Asia, 1988, 4:129–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The copper [[Buddha]]'s of [[Ma-i]] (metal relics) – "The gentleness of Tagalog customs that the first Spaniards found, very different from those of other provinces of the same race and in Luzon itself, can very well be the effect of Buddhism "There are copper Buddha's" images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Political and Historical Writings (Vol. 7) | publisher=National Historical Institute | author=Rizal, Jose | year=2000 | location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt; the people in Ma-i sound like newcomers [to this port] since they don't know where those metal statues in the jungle come from."&lt;ref&gt;Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological findings show that before the settlement of the Spaniards in the country, the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s, especially the ''Batangueños'', had attained a semblance of high civilization. This was shown by certain jewelry, made from a chambered nautilus' shell, where tiny holes were created by a drill-like tool. The ancient Batangueños were influenced by [[India]] as shown in the origin of most languages from Sanskrit and certain ancient potteries. A Buddhist image was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief from the municipality of Calatagan. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of Buddha in [[Thailand|Siam]], India, and [[Nepal]]. The pot shows [[Buddha|Buddha Amithaba]] in the [[tribhanga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html|title= tribhanga|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong [[Mahayana|Mahayanic]] orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]] was also depicted.&lt;ref&gt;http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-01-01-1963/Francisco%20Buddhist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The archipelagos of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu [[Tamils|Tamil]], [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] and Indonesian traders through the ports of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Malay-Indonesian]] islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in the Philippine archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya, followed by Majapahit. Archaeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as [[Golden Tara]]), found in [[Mindanao]] in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.&lt;ref name=govppn&gt;[http://agusandelsur.gov.ph/index/using-joomla/extensions/components/content-component/article-categories/78-demo/slides/80-golden-tara Golden Tara] Government of the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; The statue now sits in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries.

{{Quote|A study of this image was made by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, of Batavia, in 1920, who came to the conclusion that it was made by local workmen in Mindanao, copying a Ngandjuk image of the early Majapahit period – except that the local artist overlooked the distinguishing attributes held in the hand. It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century. The image is apparently that of a [[Shaivism|Sivaite goddess]], and fits in well with the name "[[Butuan]]" (signifying "[[Lingam|phallus]]").|[[H. Otley Beyer]]|1947&lt;ref name=ob&gt;H. Otley Beyer, "Outline Review of Philippine Archaeology by Islands and Provinces," Philippine Journal of Science, Vol.77,Nos.34 (July–August 1947),pp. 205–374&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Juan Francisco]] suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess [[Shakti|Sakti]] of the Siva-Buddha ([[Bhairava]]) tradition found in [[Java]], in which the religious aspect of [[Shiva]] is integrated with those found in Buddhism of Java and [[Sumatra]]. The [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], in present-day [[Agusan del Norte]] and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous [[Lumad]] nature-worships. A Hindu Tamil King of the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] was also recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco (1963), ''A Note on the Golden Image of Agusan'', Philippine Studies vol. 11, no. 3 (1963): 390—400&lt;/ref&gt; Another gold artifact, from the [[Tabon Caves]] in the island of [[Palawan]], is an image of [[Garuda]], the bird who is the mount of [[Vishnu]]. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from [[Oc Eo]], in the [[Mekong Delta]] in Southern [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=atnb/&gt; These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of [[Vietnam]] and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities.&lt;ref name=atnb&gt;Anna T. N. Bennett (2009), [http://archeosciences.revues.org/2072 Gold in early Southeast Asia], ArcheoSciences, Volume 33, pp 99–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dang V.T. and Vu, Q.H., 1977. The excavation at Giong Ca Vo site. Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology 17: 30–37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of Lumbang River near [[Laguna de Bay]] found a copper plate in Barangay Wawa, [[Lumban, Laguna|Lumban]].&lt;ref name=govppn/&gt; This discovery, is now known as the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the late 9th century CE, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist [[Antoon Postma]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese [[Medang Kingdom]], the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. Hinduism in the country declined when [[Islam]] was introduced by traders from [[Arabia]] which was then followed by Christianity from Spain.&lt;ref name=govppn/&gt; This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before.

====Batanes workshop site====
Earlier historians have posited that the earliest lingling-o artifacts found in the Philippines were created outside of the archipelago, but an expedition to the northern Philippine province of [[Batanes]], led by archeologist [[Peter Bellwood]] in the early 2000s, led to the discovery of a lingling-o workshop, complete with construction tools and fragments. The find provides evidence of indigenous Philippine manufacture of lingling-o as early as 2,500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Zafra2008"/&gt;

{{Main|Architecture of the Philippines}}
The vernacular architecture of the Philippines is diverse and developed according to the traditions, history and influences exposure experienced by each culture or society. They ranged from simple [[Nipa hut|''Bahay Kubo'']] which is the basis of all Filipino cultural architecture which gave way to houses like ''[[Bahay na bato]]'', up to the palaces such as [[Torogan]]s, fortifications like the Classical Kota's and [[Idjang]]s, Colonial Forts and mega structure such as [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] which is built from carving of the mountain walls, and Mosques in [[Mindanao]]. Architectures like Baroque was adopted to the Filipino culture, making their own interpretation through the Filipino culture climate and environment. One of the product of Filipino Baroque is the [[Earthquake Baroque]], which is especially designed to adapt to the earthquake prone environment of the Philippines.

===Weaving===
[[File:Philippine life in town and country (1905) (14788738333).jpg|thumb|right|A Filipino loom for weaving rough fabrics of abaka fiber, 1905.]]
Philippine weaving involves many threads being measured, cut, and mounted on a wooden platform. The threads are dyed and weaved on a loom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Banton.html |title=Banton Cloth : Age of Contact : Banton Is., Romblon |publisher=Nationalmuseum.gov.ph |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Spanish colonization, native Filipinos weaved using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark cloth. Textiles, clothes, rugs, and hats were weaved. Baskets were also weaved and used as vessels of transport and storage, and for hunting. These baskets were used to transport grain, store food, and catching fish.&lt;ref name="slideshare1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Trish Sotto |url=http://www.slideshare.net/TrishSotto/fa-28-weaving-history |title=Fa 28 weaving history |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also used weaving to make just about all of the clothing that was worn. They weaved rugs that they used for quilts and bedding. The quality of the quilt/bedding was based on how soft, how tight together, and the clean pattern. The patterns were usually thick stripes with different colors and with a nice pattern.

However, during Spanish colonization, Filipinos used fabric called nipis to weave white clothing. These were weaved with decorative, flower designs.&lt;ref name="slideshare1"/&gt;

===Painting===
{{Main|List of Filipino painters}}
Prehistoric cave drawings were discovered in numbers of sites in Philippines. The notable ones are those in [[Angono Petroglyphs]] is located in a shallow rock shelter. It measures 63 meters wide, 8 meters deep and a maximum height of 5 meters. It has been created due to faulting and formed in volcanic soil during the Quaternary period. There are 127 drawings in the form of animate and static figures of circular or dome-like head on top of a 'V' shaped torso distributed on a horizontal plane on the rock wall area measuring 25 meters by 3 meters. Only 51 of the total 127 drawings are distinct. Due to the complexity and plurality of the drawings, it is suggested that the drawings on the rock were not only created by a single individual. the figures engraved on the rockwall probably carved during the late Neolithic, or before 2000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5018/|title=Petroglyphs and Petrographs of the Philippines - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions clearly show stylized human figures, frogs and lizards, along with other designs that may have depicted other interesting figures but erosion may have caused it to become indistinguishable. The engravings are mostly symbolic representations and are associated with healing and sympathetic magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artesdelasfilipinas.com/archives/152/the-angono-binangonan-petroglyphs/|title=The Angono-Binangonan Petroglyphs : Philippine Art, Culture and Antiquities|website=www.artesdelasfilipinas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic paintings were introduced to Filipinos in the 16th century when the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines. During this time, the Spaniards used paintings as visual aid for their religious propaganda to spread Catholicism throughout the Philippines. These paintings, appearing mostly on church walls, featured religious figures appearing in Catholic teachings. In short, due to the Spanish occupation of the Philippines and the Church's supervision of Filipino art, the purpose of most paintings in the Philippines from the 16th to the 19th century were to aid the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="wiziq1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiziq.com/tutorial/159187-HISTORY-OF-PHILIPPINE-PAINTING |title=History Of Philippine Painting |publisher=Wiziq.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, wealthier, educated Filipinos introduced more secular Filipino art, causing art in the Philippines to deviate from religious motifs. The use of watercolour paintings increased and the subject matter of paintings began to include landscapes, Filipino inhabitants, Philippine fashion, and government officials. Portrait paintings featured the painters themselves, Filipino jewelry, and native furniture. The subject of landscape paintings featured artists' names painted ornately as well as day-to-day scenes of average Filipinos partaking in their daily tasks. These paintings were done on canvas, wood, and a variety of metals.&lt;ref name="wiziq1"/&gt;

During World War II, some painters focused their artwork on the effects of war, including battle scenes, destruction, and the suffering of the Filipino people.

===Calligraphy===
{{Main|Suyat|Calligraphy}}
The Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as [[suyat]]. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] of the [[Tagbanwa people]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]]. All four scripts were inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]], under the name ''Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)'', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/philippine-paleographs-hanunoo-buid-tagbanua-and-palawan/|title=Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of suyat scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayans|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], and the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano people]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://brideandbreakfast.ph/2015/08/12/awesome-calligraphers/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/2018/06/01/1820721/watch-how-ace-script-lettering&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sealing and Papermaking===
{{Main|Seal (East Asia)}}
[[File:Ivory seal of Butuan.jpg|thumb|The [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], dated 1002 AD, housed and displayed at the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Manila]].]]
Like [[Mongolia]], [[Taiwan]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the Philippines also had a sealing culture prior to Spanish colonization, which is reasonable as the Philippines is within the [[Sinosphere]], or East Asian cultural sphere. However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]].&lt;ref name="filipiknow.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/national-museum-of-the-philippines/|title=12 Astonishing Artifacts You Didn't Know You Could Find At The National Museum|date=5 June 2015|website=Filipiknow.net|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word "''Butwan''" through a native [[Suyat|Suyat script]]. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and palm leaves (''lontar'') for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Dr. [[H. Otley Beyer]], father of Philippine anthropology, stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, calligraphy, and literary works. Additionally, traditional handmade paper-making practices using native fibers, such as abaca, cogon, and pina have been revived by numerous organizations throughout the country.&lt;ref name="NMPHseal"&gt;[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html National Museum Collections Seals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://members.cruzio.com/~peteranddonna/2-phil.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
The religion of the [[Ifugao people]] is based on ancestor worship and the veneration of spirits and gods of nature. Rice deities are particularly revered. These bululs are activated through ritual, the bulol guardian figures are believed to contain spirits capable of ensuring abundant harvests, increasing rice yields and protecting against catastrophe. Shaped like a rice mortar, the distinctive base of the sculpture is a visual link to its spiritual purpose. The pairing of male with female is a fundamental feature of Cordilleras ancestral art. These [[Bulul]] guardians represent the harmonious union of opposing elements, the protection of communities from malevolent spirits and the promise of good fortune. Carved from auspicious red sandalwood, these sculptures are differentiated by their distinct genitalia, alluding to fertility and abundance. The figures have a rich patina of sacrificial blood and smoke resulting from their use in religious practice and life-cycle ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cordilleranmuseum.weebly.com/gallery-of-exhibits.html|title=Museum of Cordilleran Sculpture - Gallery of Exhibits|website=cordilleranmuseum.weebly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bulul is a carved wooden figure used to guard the rice crop by the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao (and their sub-tribe Kalanguya)]] peoples of northern [[Luzon]]. The sculptures are highly stylized representations of ancestors, and are thought to gain power from the presence of the ancestral spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Ifugao are particularly noted for their skill in carving bululs.&lt;ref name="Woods2006" /&gt; Bul-uls are used in ceremonies associated with rice production and with healing.
Creation of a bul-ul involves alwen bul-ul ritual by a priest to ensure that the statue gains power. The bul-ul is treated with care and respect to avoid the risk of the spirits of the ancestors bringing sickness.
The figures are placed together with the rice in the house or granaries to bring a plentiful harvest.
Bul-ul is important to Ifugaos because they believe they can protect and multiply the rice and help make the harvest abundant.

The [[Sarimanok]] is a legendary bird of the [[Maranao people]] who originate from [[Mindanao]]. It comes from the words ''sari'' and ''manok''. ''Sari'' means cloth or garment, which is generally of assorted colors. ''Manok'' means "chicken". The Sarimanok is the legendary bird that has become an ubiquitous symbol of Maranao art. It is depicted as a fowl with colorful wings and feathered tail, holding a fish on its beak or talons. The head is profusely decorated with scroll, leaf, and spiral motifs. It is said to be a symbol of good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ph.net/htdocs/education/sarimano.htm Philippine Arts and Culture: Sarimanok].

Accessed August 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; And another example of Maranao sculpture was in the Islamic tradition; the [[Buraq]] is often described as "a white animal, half-mule, half-donkey, with wings". The Prophet Muhammad rode the Buraq to fly through the heavens in a single night, a journey known as Mir'aj. Only in certain regions, such as Mindanao, is the animal depicted with a human face. Although the Buraq is not uncommon in Islamic art, sculptures of the creature seem to be unique to the Philippines. It is possible that the flourishing carving industry of religious images for Catholic Filipinos may have encouraged the making of such sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://discover.acm.stqry.com/v/foyer-islamic-world/s/a7f9f07b-8e37-4de7-87b9-ecfc4814688c|title=Buraq - Asian Civilisations Museum|first=Area360|last=Inc.|website=discover.acm.stqry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==
===Dance===
{{main|Philippine dance}}
[[File:Filipino folk dancers Pistahan festival.jpg|thumb|right|Filipino folk dancers performing at the Pistahan Festival in [[San Francisco, California]].]]
There are numerous types of Filipino dances, varying in influence, from the country's regions. Types of Filipino dance include Cordillera, Muslim, tribal, rural, and Spanish style dances. Jerrah is the most well known kind of dance in the cordillera region.
Within the Cordilleras' dances, there are the Banga, Bendayan, Lumagen/Tachok, Manmanok, Ragragsakan, Salisid, Talip, Tarektek, and Uyaoy/Uyauy. The Banga dance shows the grace and strength of women in the Kalinga tribe. Women performing the Banga balance heavy pots on their heads while dancing to beat of wind chimes. This mimics Kalinga women collecting and transporting water. Another dance, called Lumagen or Tachok, is performed to celebrate happy occasions. When Lumagen is performed, it is meant to symbolize flying birds and is musically paired to the beat of gongs. Another cordillera dance, Salisid, is the dance to show courtship. In the Salisid dance, a male and a female performer represent a rooster attempting to attract a hen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/Cynthia/philippine_dances_cordillera.htm |title=Philippine Dances Cordillera |publisher=Seasite.niu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Igorrote men performing a War Dance, A-Y-P, 1909.jpg|thumb|left|[[Igorot people|Igorot]] men performing a [[war dance]], c. 1909.]]
Tribal dances include Malakas at Maganda, Kadal Blelah, Kadal Tahaw, Binaylan, Bagobo Rice Cycle, and Dugso. Malakas at Maganda is a national folklore dance. It tells the story of the origin of the Filipino people on the islands. Another dance, called the Binaylan dance, tells the story of a hen, the hen's baby, and a hawk. In this dance, the hawk is said to control a tribe's well-being, and is killed by hunters after attempting to harm the hen's baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/Cynthia/dances/tribal_dances.htm |title=tribal dances |publisher=Seasite.niu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of traditional Filipino dances are [[Tinikling]] and [[Binasuan]] and many more. Filipinos have unique [[folk dances]] like tinikling where assistants take two long bamboo sticks rapidly and in rhythm, clap sticks for dancers to artistically and daringly try to avoid getting their feet caught between them. Also in the southern part of the Philippines, there is another dance called [[Singkil]] using long bamboo poles found in tinikling; however, it is primarily a dance showing off lavish Muslim royalty. In this dance, there are four bamboo sticks arranged in a [[tic-tac-toe]] pattern in which the dancers exploit every position of these clashing sticks. Dancers can be found trying to avoid all 4 bamboo sticks all together in the middle. They can also try to dance an entire rotation around the middle avoiding all sticks. Usually these stick dances performed in teamwork fashion not solo. The Singkil dance is identifiable with the use of umbrellas and silk clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinfonia.or.jp/~infortec/hotspots/boracay/singkil.htm|title=Hot Spots Filipino Cultural Dance - Singkil|publisher=Sinfonia.or.jp|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many towns have their own versions of the [[Holy Week in the Philippines#Senákulo|''Senakulo'']], using traditional scripts that are decades or centuries old. A version is held at the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]], sponsored by the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]]. Popular film and televisions stars often join the cast of the play. In Taguig, they popularize the modern version of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' reshown at the Fort Santiago Amphitheater for the benefit of Manileños. In [[Mexico, Pampanga]] and [[Dinalupihan, Bataan]], the actor portraying Jesus has been actually nailed to the cross to simulate Christ's passion as best and as painfully possible. Similar shows are also held in Makati and in the [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana district]] of Manila.

==Martial arts==
[[File:Grandmaster Jerry Dela Cruz.png|thumb|146px|right|[[Arnis]], a well known [[Filipino martial art]] which emphasize weapon-based fighting with the use of sticks.]]
The [[Arnis]], also known as '''Kali''' or '''Eskrima''', is the [[national sport]] and martial art of the Philippines. The three are roughly interchangeable umbrella terms for the traditional [[martial arts]] of the [[Philippines]] ("[[Filipino Martial Arts]]", or FMA) that emphasize [[martial arts weapons|weapon-based fighting]] with [[stick fighting|sticks]], [[knife fighting|knives]], [[bladed weapon]]s and various [[improvised weapon]]s as well as "open hand" or techniques without weapons. It is also known as ''Estoque'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[rapier]]), ''Estocada'' (Spanish for thrust or stab) and ''Garrote'' (Spanish for club). In [[Luzon]] they may go by the name of ''Arnis de Mano''.The indigenous martial art that the Spanish encountered in 1610 was not yet called "Eskrima" at that time. During those times, this martial art was known as ''Paccalicali-t'' to the [[Ibanags]],&lt;ref name="epanolIbanag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books/reader?id=6WE2AQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;source=ebookstore&amp;pg=GBS.PA223|title=Diccionario español-ibanag o sea Tesauro Hispano- Cagayán sacado de los manuscritos antiguos|author=Ramirez y Giraudier|date=1867|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Didya''  (later changed to ''Kabaroan'') to the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]], ''Sitbatan'' or ''Kalirongan'' to [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinenses]], ''Sinawali'' ("to weave") to the [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]], ''Calis'' or ''Pananandata'' (use of weapons) to the [[Tagalogs]], ''Pagaradman'' to the [[Hiligaynon people|Ilonggos]] and ''Kaliradman'' to the [[Cebuano people|Cebuanos]].

Other pottery used to hold remains of the deceased were decorated with anthropomorphic designs. These anthropomorphic earthenware pots date back to 5 BC. - 225 A.D and had pot covers shaped like human heads.&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum1"/&gt;

Filipino pottery had other uses as well. During the Neolithic period of the Philippines, pottery was made for water vessels, plates, cups, and for many other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.ph/permanenttraveling.php?page=classicalgoldwork |title=Metropolitan Museum of Manila, Philippines: Art for All |publisher=Metmuseum.ph |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalinga Pottery''' &lt;ref name=archaeo2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skibo|first1=J.|title=Pottery Function: A use-alteration perspective|date=1992|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramic vessels of Kalinga are divided into three types: rice cooking (ittoyom), vegetable/meat cooking (oppaya), and water storage (immosso) pots. According to Skibo, the rice cooking pots are usually larger, thinner and have a smaller opening than vegetable/meat pots. On the other hand, water storage pots have an average and uniform size and a smaller neck size.

Except for water storage pots, which have a uniform size, the other two kinds can come in three different sizes, large, medium and small. Although this is true in some cases, another larger type of vegetable/meat pot and smaller water storage pot exists.

• Manufacture of Kalinga potteries
[[File:Annual report of the Director to the Board of Trustees for the year .. (1910) (18246004349).jpg|thumb|360x360px|A group of Igorot pottery makers from Samoki, [[Mountain Province]] (c. 1910).]]
The first step in the manufacture of pots is the acquisition of the starting material, clay. The clay is then pounded, added with enough amount of water, to reach the wanted flexibility, and placed in a rotating plate. Using the hand-modeling and coil-and-scrape techniques, the height, thickness and shape of the pot is established. After this, the rim is designed by placing a wet rag on top of it and then rotating it in the other direction. Furthermore, scraping of the walls can also be done if the walls produced are too thick.

The pot, after the modeling stage, is then dried for a short period of time before the base is shaped. Also, after additional heating, small amounts of clay are added inside and outside the clay to maintain the evenness of the surface. A polishing step can also be done through the use of a polishing stone. In some cases, pots are also painted with red hematite paint for some stylized design.

'''Pottery Functions'''	&lt;ref name="archaeo2"/&gt;

Pots are ceramic vessels that are made by molding clay into its wanted shape and then leaving it in an environment with an elevated temperature thereby making it solid and sturdy. It is widely recognized as one of better tools that humans invented since it managed to store the surplus of food Neolithic humans gathered.

In the book Pottery Function: A Use-Alteration Perspective, the author, [[James Skibo]], reasoned out why the use of pots is far more advantageous than baskets and other organic containers. He said that since potteries are commonly made in clay, heat has little to none effect on the container, and its contents, and that it protects the food from moisture and pests. Furthermore, its range of storable contents is far wider than baskets and animal skins since it can store both liquid and dry goods.

Also, Rice, in his book Pottery Analysis, classified ceramic vessels into 17 categories depending on various factors that concern the use and production of the tool. One of these is the content wherein he further divided a type of pot into four depending on the state (liquid or solid) and temperature (hot or cold) of the food inside it. He also said that a ceramic has three main uses. These three are storage, processing, and transfer.

Based from these three uses that Rice gave, Skibo further characterized the usage of ceramic vessels by dividing the tool’s function into two, (1) intended use and (2) actual use.

Intended use, as the name implies, is how the tool’s supposed to be used. This is the basis of the manufacture of the ceramic vessel since the form follows the function. On the other hand, actual use is how the tool was used. This sometimes disregards the pot’s form as long it can do a specific 
function.

'''Kalinga Pottery and its Uses''' &lt;ref name="archaeo2"/&gt;
[[File:Burnay (tapayan) jars - Philippines.JPG|thumb|right|Burnay (''tapayan'') jars used as lawn ornaments.]]
In Kalinga, ceramic vessels can be used for two situations: daily life use and ceremonial use. 
Daily life uses include the making of rice from the pots and the transfer of water from nearby water bodies to their homes.

• Determining actual function of Kalinga pots

As said, a pottery sometimes has a different actual use than intended use. This is the reason why when archaeologists study the function of a pottery, they tend to focus on how the tool was actually used. They do this by studying the alterations that the pottery has. These alterations, accretion and attrition, are commonly the abrasions and scratches on the vessel. In Skibo’s study of Kalinga potteries functions, he relied on three main tests, namely (1) dissolved residue, (2) surface attrition and (3) carbon deposition.	
# Dissolved residue – This test was done to determine the organic matters that were once placed in the vessel. Through the combination of a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrophotometer, the composition of the fatty acids inside the vessel was determined. Although a complete identification of the species of plant and animals was not possible, Skibo managed to know which pots were used for rice and vegetable/ meat cooking. 	
# Surface Attrition – Skibo’s study on the attrition of the pots showed how the pot was used. By looking at the trace attritions inside the vessel, the type, frequency, angle and direction of stirring for each pot was determined. Furthermore, Skibo also concluded that two pots can be differentiated from each other, on the basis of what type of food it cooks, from the abrasions. He said that rice pots will have a little amount of stirring while the vegetable/meat pots will have numerous marks.	
# Carbon Deposition – This test, as said by Skibo, can determine the type of food cooked, how it was cooked and how the pot was placed on the flame. From this, another distinction between rice and vegetable/meat pots was established.

'''Iron Age pottery''' &lt;ref name=archaeo&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Solheim|first1=William|title=The archaeology of central Philippines: A study chiefly of the Iron Age and its relationships.|date=2002|publisher=Bureau of Print|location=Manila}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major complexes in Philippine Iron Age according to Solheim, Kalanay, Novaliches and Bau pottery complexes. Kalanay pottery complex pertains to Beyer’s Early Iron Age pottery of the Visayan Islands found in Negros and Mindoro; novaliches pottery complex to Beyer’s Early Iron Age pottery from Rizal province. Bau pottery, on the other hand, does not fit into the two previous complexes and could correspond instead to the Late Iron Age pottery.

'''Kalanay Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
[[File:Double ikat weaving from Sulu, Philippines, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|right|A double [[ikat]] weaving from [[Sulu]], made of banana leaf stalk fiber ([[Abacá]]).]]
The type site of the Kalanay pottery complex is the [[Kalanay Cave]] found in Masbate. From this site, the pottery is further subdivided into pottery types Kalanay and Bagupantao.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Paired diagonals and borders, with variations including single diagonals or verticals and borders, or wavy lines and borders
* Curvilinear scrolls and triangles
* Rectangular scroll
* Triangles, with variations including alternating triangles and borders or running triangles
* Rectangles and diagonals
* Zoomorphs
* Punctate fieldwhere areas bonded by incised lines are emphasized by punctuations or dashes
* Diagonals without borders, including a band of horizontal V’s and alternating diagonals off a center line
* Impressed crenelations
* Impressed or carved scallop design
* Impressed tool
* Carved cutouts in ring stands

Kalanay complex pottery can be divided into 16 groups according to Solheim.

# Large jars with wide necks
# Large jars with narrow necks
# Small jars
# Deep bowls
# Shallow bowls
# Very shallow bowls
# Lids
# Shallow bowls with ring stands
# Tetrapods
# Jars with angle between side and bottom
# Spherical jars with small mouths, without angle at rim
# Angular Vessels

'''Bau Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
[[File:Ifugao Fabrics.png|thumb|right|Fabric weaved from [[Ifugao]].]]
It has less variation in both form and decoration compared to the Kalanay pottery complex.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Paddle Impressed
* Tool Impressed, including simple-tool and compound-tool impressed
* Stamp Impressed
* Applique ribbons of clay

In terms of forms:

* Small jars with everted rims
* Small jars without everted rim
* Small heavy jars with flat bottom
* Cups with ring feet
* Jars with ring feet

'''Novaliches Pottery Complex''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;

Most of Novaliches pottery can be distinguished from Bau pottery and Kalanay pottery. While it shares form and decoration with Kalanay pottery, it contains more variability compared to Bau pottery. According to Solheim (2002), “it is the most sophisticated pottery that has yet been found in the Philippines”

Novaliches pottery can be diagnosed by its form being a shallow bowl with a high right-foot. The shallow bowl is generally plain but the feet are highly decorated. Majority of Novaliches pottery were well polished. The form is so symmetrical that it looks as if it was made in a potter wheel, however, examinations showed that it wasn’t.

Specific varieties of decoration are as follows:

* Cutouts
* Narrow vertical elements; carved, tool impressed, or running impressed lines
* Horizontal and diagonal elements, including simple tool impressions, compound tool impressions and carved elements
* Horizontal broadline impressed lines

Vessel forms are as follows:

* Shallow bowls with high ring stands
* Shallow bowls with low-ring stands
* Jars with low-ring stands
* Angle jars
* Jars with short necks and everted rims

'''Kalanay Cave Site''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;

The Kalanay cave site is a small burial cave. It is located at the northwest coast of Masbate.

• Kalanay Pottery

* Kalanay Plain	
* Majority (80 per cent) of the excavated vessels.
* Variations in size and shape
* Technique used in the manufacture:  Paddle-and-anvil technique 
* Differences in the base of the vessels (some have rounded bottom while some use a ring foot or a tetrapod for support).
* Large observable differences in color that is associated with the inability of the potter to control the fire, causing the uneven distribution of the heat.
 
• Kalanay Incised

* Incised around the neck, rim of a jar or the outside of a bowl in a band of repeating elements
* Little care was given so the jars appear poorly made despite its well thought out designs. This can be attributed to the possibility that the certain tradition of this pot was no longer significant to the manufacturer
* Kalanay-Impressed: simple tool and simple and compound tool
* Simple tool impressing found around the jar or bowl with a flange

• Kalanay slipped

* Forms: jars, large with wide mouth and everted rim, or small with everted rim; bowls, deep with inslanting sides, or very shallow which turned out lip
* Some were polished, some were not.

'''Bagupantao Pottery''' &lt;ref name="archaeo"/&gt;
 
• Bagupantao Plain

* Majority of the pots’ paste is red-brown in color, with gray or black as the minority. Its texture ranges from fine to medium and its thickness is usually 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in length. The common forms of the pots are jars with wide to narrow mouths and its normally large (a body diameter of 24 to 35&amp;nbsp;cm). 
* Difference between Kalanay Plain: Evenness of color and cleanness of clay
 
• Bagupantao Impressed 
 
* The type of paste is the same as Bagupantao plain, red-brown in color.  It is also highly decorated on its rim with circles, punctuations and crenellations. 
* Larger (28 –31&amp;nbsp;cm body diameter) and thicker (9-14 thickness) than Bagupantao plain.

• Bagupantao Painted
 
* The paste used is the same as Bagupantao impressed and plain but it is covered with heavy red hematite slip inside and outside of the neck.
* Thinner (2–7&amp;nbsp;mm) and smaller than Bagupantao plain.

• Extraneous Pottery - Three vessels that did not belong to the Bagupantao and Kalanay style were also found.

First pot

* Similar clay used as the Bagupantao and Kalanay vessels. The color, red-brown, was also the same, inside and out.
* Ornamented with small crystals on the paste and black flakes on the surface.
* As thin (3–8&amp;nbsp;mm) as the Bagupantao painted vessel.

Second pot

* Same size and structure as the Bagupantao pots.
* Used a different paste (fibrous texture and contained mineral inclusions)
* Heavily polished and the surface color ranges from red-brown to light gray.
* As thick as the Bagupantao plain jars (5–12&amp;nbsp;mm).

Third pot

* The paste used is chocolate-brown in color and its texture is fine.
* It is very thick (15–20&amp;nbsp;mm) when compared to the other pots.
* Poorly made because of the uneven distribution of heat to the pot (pieces break longitudinally).

==Culinary art==
{{main|Filipino cuisine}}
[[File:Halo halo1.jpg|thumb|left|A bowl of [[Halo-halo]].]]
Filipino cuisine is composed of the cuisines of 144 distinct ethnolinguistic groups found within the Philippine archipelago. The majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino cuisine are from the cuisines of the Bikol, Chavacano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, [[Kapampangan cuisine|Kapampangan]], Maranao, Pangasinan, Cebuano (or ''Bisaya''), Tagalog, and Waray ethnolinguistic tribes. The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] origins to a mixed cuisine of [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]], and [[American cuisine|American]] influences, in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the local palate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Philippine cookbook |last=Alejandro |first=Reynaldo |year=1985 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-399-51144-8 |pages=12–14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUaDoUF0tRwC&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of cavalo and People |last=Civitello |first=Linda |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location= |isbn=978-1-118-09875-2 |page=263 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwtE4v_qS4EC&amp;lpg=PT263&amp;dq=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;pg=PT263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 June 2011 |quote=Just as Filipino people are part Malay, Chinese and Spanish, so is the cuisine of their seven-thousand-island nation}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book |title=Philippines Country Study Guide |year=2007 |publisher=Int'l Business Publications |location= |isbn=978-1-4330-3970-6 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8VkaWS6xiMC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Philippine%20Cuisine%22%20influences&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 June 2011 |quote=Throughout the centuries, the islands have incorporated the cuisine of the early Malay settlers, Arab and Chinese traders, and Spanish and American colonizers along with other Oriental and Occidental accent and flavors.}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.balitapinoy.net/philippine_cuisine.html "Philippine Cuisine."] [http://www.balitapinoy.net Balitapinoy.net].

* The term '''indigenous art''' is sometimes used to refer to the utility of indigenous materials as a medium for the creation of different kinds of artworks, as with the paintings by [[Elito Circa]], a famous folk artist of Pantabangan and a pioneer in using indigenous materials as well as natural raw materials including human blood.&lt;ref name="PhilStar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/breaking-news/705010/artist-uses-own-blood-hair-paintings|accessdate=2011-07-12|title=Artist uses own blood, hair in paintings|work=The Philippine Star|publisher=Philippine Star|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Filipino painters and foreign artists were influenced by Filipino indigenous art and started using these indigenous materials, which include extracts from onion, tomato, ''tuba'' (palm wine), coffee, rust, molasses and other materials available anywhere to be used as paint.
* '''Jewelry design'''. In 2015/16, the Asia Society in New York presented an exhibit called ''Philippine Gold: Treasures of Forgotten Kingdoms.''   The exhibition presents spectacular works of gold primarily discovered over the past forty years on the Philippine islands of Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. The regalia, jewelry, ceremonial weapons, and ritualistic and funerary objects attest to the recently uncovered evidence of prosperity and achievement of Philippine polities that flourished between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, long before the Spanish discovered and colonized the region. Although the forms and styles of the majority of these works developed locally, some indicate that Philippine craftsmen had been exposed to objects from beyond their borders through the robust cultural connections and maritime trade in Southeast Asia during what was an early Asian economic boom.
* '''Kut-kut''' is a painting technique combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 AD. Kut-kut is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space.
* The '''[[tanaga]]''' is a type of Filipino poetry.
* The '''batek''' or '''batok''' is a form of indigenous tattooing of the Kalinga people in the Cordilleras. The most prominent tattoo artist in the country is [[Whang-od]], who has been known as the last mambabatok until has started mentoring her niece on the art so that the tattoo artistry of the Kalinga will continue. The art form has been critically acclaimed internationally in the United States, Germany, France, Canada, and many others.

== Filipino art housed outside the Philippines ==
Various artifacts and art pieces have either been looted or directly bought from the Philippines by various foreign entities since the Spanish colonial period. The majority of stolen or bought Philippine artifacts and art pieces were shipped into foreign hands during the American period, World War II, and post-war era, where the economy was crippled. During the post-war era, Philippine artifacts and art pieces became easy pickings for foreigners as Filipinos were forced to sell the items in extremely low prices because of the immediate need for money during an era marred with high inflation and high cost of living. These pieces include the [[Golden Tara]] (in United States possession), the [[Balangiga bells]] (in United States possession), the two remaining copies of ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' (in United States and Spain's possession), the [[Boxer Codex]] (in United States possession), and many others. Most pieces are currently under the possession of the [[United States]] and [[Spain]]. Various attempts to return stolen or looted Philippine artifacts and art pieces have been made by the Philippine government since the 1990s. The most recent is the national call to return the Balangiga bells in 2017 and the Golden Tara in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/3253243/Stolen-artefacts-point-to-lost-Philippines-tribe.html|title=Stolen artefacts point to lost Philippines tribe|first=Thomas Bell, South East Asia|last=Correspondent|date=24 October 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/160345/artifacts-looted-from-shipwreck|title=Artifacts looted from shipwreck|first=Nestor P.

'''''Becoming Jane Austen''''' was researched and written by the Jane Austen scholar [[Jon Hunter Spence]]. It chronicles a demi-biographical version of Austen's early biography based on Spence's interpretation of the novel ''Pride and Prejudice'' as possibly being modeled on Austen's real life, although Austen herself does not make this claim for her novel.

''Becoming Jane Austen'' was first published in hardcover by [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Hambledon Continuum]] in 2003.  It chronicles the early life of [[Jane Austen]], the encounters and the developing relationship between Austen and [[Tom Lefroy]], based on letters sent by Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra.  The book was used as the basis for the film ''[[Becoming Jane]]'', which was released in January 2007 (Sydney). Jon Spence was a historical consultant for the film.

A review of the book by the Jane Austen Society of North America states that, "Jon Spence’s ''Becoming Jane Austen'' is one of the best half-dozen books published on Austen in the last quarter century, at least. It is a remarkably learned book written in a remarkably lucid style and a joy to read. The research is so substantial, wide-ranging, and detailed that any conjecture Spence builds on it has the feel of bedrock itself. His interpretation of Jane Austen’s character and personality as well as of her fiction impresses the reader with his long and intimate acquaintance with the writer and her works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasna.org/bookrev/br193p23.html |title=Spence, Becoming Jane Austen |publisher=Jasna.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paperback edition of the book was published by Continuum on 14 June 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1847250467/ |title=Becoming Jane Austen (9781847250469): Jon Spence: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austen-Lefroy relationship was also used as the basis for ''Jane and Tom: The Real Pride and Prejudice'', a radio play by Elizabeth Lewis.  It was first broadcast on 1 June 2007, starring [[Jasmine Hyde]] as Austen and [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Lefroy, along with [[Penny Downie]] as Mrs Austen, [[Jane Whittenshaw]] as Mrs Lefroy, Rachel Atkins as [[Anne Lefroy]], Lynne Seamore as [[Cassandra Austen]], [[Keiron Self]] as [[John Warren (Austen family friend)|John Warren]], and Manon Edwards as Ellen, and directed by Celia De Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007llmb |title=BBC Radio 4 - Afternoon Drama, Jane and Tom: The Real Pride and Prejudice |publisher=BBC |date=1 June 2007|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Oneşti|Borzeşti]] church''' is located in [[Onești]], [[Bacău County]], [[Romania]] and it was ordered by [[Ştefan cel Mare]] to be built in 1493, with construction lasting from July 9, 1493, to October 12, 1494. Legend has it that the church was dedicated to a child killed during the invasions of the [[Tatar]]s.

The church is designed in a Moldavian style, just as the [[Războieni Church]] and the [[Piatra Neamţ Church]] (1497–1498). The murals of the church were restored in 2004. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] windows are partially destroyed.

'''Center City Opera Theater''' ('''CCOT''') is an [[opera company]] based in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Founded in 1999, CCOT is the only professional opera company in the United States whose mission is the creation of new opera works, guiding works from inception to stage through a series of workshops.  CCOT performs at numerous intimate-setting venues throughout the [[Delaware Valley|Greater Philadelphia]] area, though its mainstage performance home is the Perelman Theater at the [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.centercityoperatheater.org/wp2/?page_id=31 | title=History of CCOT | accessdate=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgU0za_YmNAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Claudia+Pinza%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW7qfAterXAhVk34MKHYWtBysQ6AEIUjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Claudia%20Pinza%22&amp;f=false|title=Philidadelphia Guide to Visual &amp; Performing Arts|author=Jim McClelland|page=16|publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since its founding in 1999 by General and Artistic Director Andrew Kurtz, CCOT has produced over four dozen operas which include newly commissioned works and traditional operas.  Through its Young Artist Program, CCOT provides professional training and performance opportunities for emerging young opera professionals (singers, directors, designers, and instrumentalists).&lt;ref name="YAP"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.centercityoperatheater.org/wp2/?page_id=82 | title=Young Artists Program | accessdate=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  CCOT’s ''OPERAtunities in Education'' in-school program works with multiple partner schools in Philadelphia and surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

In September 2008, CCOT launched ''ConNEXTions: The Next Generation of Opera'' during the Philadelphia Fringe Festival, presenting the world premieres and workshops of new works.  Creative Development Projects (CDP), directed by [[Albert Innaurato]], grew out of ''ConNEXTions'' and is an ongoing series which facilitates the production of new opera works through successive workshops, guiding a work from initial conception all the way to its world premiere.
&lt;ref name=CDP&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.centercityoperatheater.org/wp2/?page_id=654 | title=Creative Development Projects | accessdate=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, in an attempt to cultivate broader opera audiences through intimate performances, CCOT has increasingly made use of site-specific venues, such as the [[Italian Market, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Italian Market]] and the [[Comcast Center (Philadelphia)|Comcast Center]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="DPS"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.philly.com/2010-12-16/news/25293146_1_performances-shopping-mall | title=Preview for "Shops" by David Patrick Stearns | accessdate=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23488">The '''Conservation of South Asian household shrines''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation of [[Shrine|household shrines]] from [[South Asia]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]], held by either museums or private collectors, this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. South Asian shrines held in museum collections around the world are principally shrines relate to [[Hinduism|Hindu,]] [[Jainism|Jain,]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] households. Due to their original use and sacred nature, these shrines present unique [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] challenges for those tasked with their care.

==Household shrines==
===Usage===
[[File:Svu kerala.jpg|thumb|A modern Srividya adept performs Tantric puja at his home shrine. Kerala, India, 2006.]]
In all three of these religions, daily ritual devotion is a central aspect.&lt;ref name="BCentre"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Buddhism?|url=https://thebuddhistcentre.com/buddhism|website=The Buddhist Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Worship of the Goddess in South Asia|url=http://education.asianart.org/explore-resources/background-information/worship-goddess-south-asia|website=Asian Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines facilitate this practice by offering a sacred space within the home, serving as a focal point for [[meditation]] and [[Offering (Buddhism)|offerings]] to the gods and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] ones. Daily rituals at household shrines can take many forms, but often feature some of the following practices: meditation and/or [[prayer]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; ritual bathing of sculptures in water, anointing with oils,&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Samuel K.|title=Renovation, Disposal, and Conservation of  Hindu Temples and Images:  The Institutionalization of Creativity in South Indian and American Art Worlds|journal=Museum Anthropology Review|date=Fall 2009|volume=3|issue=2|pages=107–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; lighting of candles or burning of [[incense]],&lt;ref name="BCentre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JainCenter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Traditions|url=http://www.nyjaincenter.org/Traditions|website=Jain Center of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offering of flowers and/or food. Devotional practices vary not only from religion to religion, but also from person to person. The above list contains common actions, but the form of daily ritual is set by the individual. 
===Appearance and materials===
Shrines for household use vary in size, from simple tabletop setups with room for a sculpture and a few offerings&lt;ref name="AsianArt" /&gt; to full shrines taking up entire walls.&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Conserving a Tibetan Altar|url=https://www.philamuseum.org/exhibitions/243.html|website=Philadelphia Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional items and smaller shrines are typically purchased ready-made, though wealthier households often commissioned elaborate custom shrines.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Jain Shrine from India|url=https://nelson-atkins.org/events/a-jain-shrine-from-india/|website=Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though primarily made of wood and paint, household shrines sometimes feature extra adornment such as [[gold leaf]]&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WRV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Butsudan|url=http://www.wrvmuseum.org/journal/journal_ftbr_0799.htm|website=White River Journal: A Newsletter of the White River Valley Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; or leather fittings.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; In far Eastern countries, like [[China]] and [[Japan]], such shrines are often [[lacquer]]ed.&lt;ref name="WRV" /&gt;

==Damage and deterioration==
Household shrines can suffer damage from two overall sources: the materials used are at risk of deterioration particular to their nature, and the ways the shrines are used can cause specific types of wear and tear.

===Humidity=== 
As discussed, the majority of household shrines are made of painted wood, and both wood and paint are susceptible to the effects of humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite book|title=NPS Museum Handbook: Appendix N, Curatorial Care of Wooden Objects|date=2002|publisher=National Park Service|pages=N1-N28|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/Appendix%20N.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections|date=2009|publisher=The Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum, Inc.|location=Delaware|isbn=0-912724-52-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the [[relative humidity]] of the wood’s environment can cause it to swell (in increased humidity) or shrink (in decreased humidity). Extreme or prolonged swelling can result in [[Wood warping|warping]], while excess shrinkage can lead to cracks, particularly around nail or screw holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; In addition to damaging the wood, fluctuations in humidity can also deteriorate paint and other surface decoration: changes in humidity can result in loosening, flaking, and cracking paint.&lt;ref name="Getty"&gt;{{cite book|title=Painted Wood: History and Conservation; Part Four: Investigations and Treatment|date=1998|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute Publications|pages=278–397|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/paintedwood4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold leaf can dissolve in water, especially if applied with a water-soluble adhesive.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer, a layer of shellac creating a clear, hardened surface, can delaminate from the underlying paint and wood layers if changes in humidity cause the wood to flex too much.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Pests===
[[Pest (organism)|Pests]] can be attracted to the wood itself, or, in the case of shrines, to the offerings that are left on it. [[Insects]] feed on wood or burrow into it to build nests, weakening the structure and causing unsightly holes.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; The types of insects vary by region, but can include species of ants, bees, or termites.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; [[Fungi]] also feed on wood, albeit on a smaller scale, and depending on the type can cause everything from discoloration to disintegration.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

A family shrine is in less danger of [[rat]]s than the presence of food would lead one to believe, as the offerings are replaced on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; However, rats are attracted to food, and will gnaw through wood to get it,&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; leaving holes.

===Light===
Direct sunlight or artificial light, both present in a home environment, can bleach wood and paint colors and, over a long period of time, weaken or deteriorate the wood’s cellular structure.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;

===Pollutants===
Humans are, unfortunately, a source of [[pollutant]]s that can damage a family shrine. Touching the surface can leave behind oils, salts, and acids present in skin, which over time can build up on the shrine and cause staining and surface erosion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[Dirt]] and [[dust]], if not frequently removed, can scratch and erode the wood.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Ancient shrines have been found buried and accumulated significant damage from being encased in the soil.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The most common pollutant for home shrines, particular in Buddhist households, is [[smoke]]: burning incense or candles is a standard component of daily prayer, and the smoke blackens the shrine over time.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Superficial burns to the wood, though unlikely, are also possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Preventative conservation==
Protecting household shrines from further deterioration requires considering each of the agents of decay in terms of the activities of storage, handling, and display.

===Storage===
The ideal relative humidity for wooden objects is 50%; museums aim to keep the environment’s relative humidity within a few percentage points of this target; typically with no more than 10% fluctuation within a 24 hour period.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; A stable [[Temperature|temperature]] is also considered preferable, as any fluctuations directly affects relative humidity.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Conservators use an [[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] policy to reduce the threats of pests and vermin to collections, pest eradication processes are carefully selected to take into account the sacred nature of the shrines. For some religious groups, certain pest control methods such as freezing and anoxia are considered just as deadly to the sacred nature of the object as to pests;&lt;ref name="Paine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paine|first1=Crispin|title=Religious Objects in Museums: Private Lives and Public Duties|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for sacred and culturally sensitive objects|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/care-objects/indigenous-materials/caring-sacred-culturally-sensitive-objects.html|website=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, they should not be undertaken if the appropriate religious community forbids them. Lights should only be used when needed, and should be kept as dim as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Frequent careful cleanings, combined with dust covers, will reduce the danger of pollutants.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Cleaning should be done with a soft cotton cloth or cosmetic brush, and a mild [[detergent]] and water if necessary.&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt;

===Handling===
Best practice in museum handling of collection objects, such as shrines, dictates that objects be moved as little as possible. Shrines are frequently large, with intricate carvings, and there is significant risk of breakage through moving them.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt;  When handling or moving is necessary, it is done with careful planning - gloves, typically [[nitrile]] or cotton, are worn to prevent transferring pollutants on the hands to the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Display===
Lighting presents an additional challenge, since the object must be visible to viewers. Lights are kept as low as possible while still being bright enough to allow visitors to navigate the room and see the shrine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Sometimes lights will only be turned on when the shrine display is open to the public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} [[UV filter]]s are typically installed on artificial lights and window glass to prevent UV light from sun causing damage.

==Treatment==
===Research===
Due to the religious nature of household shrines, in addition to determining the extent of the damage, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] professionals advocate researching the spiritual nature of the shrine before restoration work begins. A recommended starting point is to ask why something is being conserved.&lt;ref name="WAAC"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Conservator's Approach to Sacred Art|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=September 1995|volume=17|issue=3|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn17/wn17-3/wn17-310.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple approaches to conservation and restoration, and this initial question is a preferred guideline for deciding which approach to take. There are two possible approaches to restoration of household religious objects: materials-based and values-based.&lt;ref name="Jakobi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuh Jakobi|first1=Davina|title=Choices and Decision-making in Conservation: The Implications of Conserving Religious Icons|journal=Tropos|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14–25|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420196/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials-based restoration refers simply to fixing what is broken: the materials are damaged, so they will be fixed.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based restoration is concerned with preserving the “intangible” qualities of an object—in this case, its religious properties.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; This approach involves not removing evidence of use on the object as long as it is not contributing to its deterioration.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt; Values-based is the approach most often argued for, but it is noted that a combination of the two types is frequently the most appropriate.&lt;ref name="Jakobi" /&gt;

===Wood restoration===
Wood restoration can be an invasive process: to repair warping, for example, shallow cuts are often made in the surface of the wood to allow it to be pulled back into its original position and secured in place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; Cracks can be filled with adhesive to both disguise them and prevent them from expanding,&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt; while holes or missing pieces are typically patched with [[replica]] parts.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Wood that has been bleached may be [[Wood stain|re-stained]] or inpainted to match the undamaged areas.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

===Paint restoration===
Loosened or flaking paint can be consolidated by injecting it with adhesive.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Scratches can be [[Inpainting|inpainted]],&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation and Care of Museum Collections|date=2011|publisher=MFA Publications|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-87846-729-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or repainted to reduce their appearance. Painted surfaces may be carefully cleaned with [[solvent]]s to ensure that only the grime is removed and not the paint layer underneath.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur" /&gt; Lacquer that has delaminated from the paint layer may be glued back into place.&lt;ref name="Getty" /&gt;

==Ethics==
===Conflicting ideals===
Conservation and museum display of religious objects, like household shrines, represents two [[Ideology|ideologies]] in conflict. [[Museum]]s are secular spaces, and restoration is secular work, but family shrines are sacred.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Imogen|title=Exhibiting the Exotic, Simulating the Sacred: Tibetan Shrines at British and American Museums|journal=Ateliers d'Anthropologie|date=2016|volume=43|url=http://journals.openedition.org/ateliers/10300#text}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[education]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]]-focused missions of museums and conservators are inherently at odds with the religious, family, and social functions of household altars.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=Ronald|title=Sacred objects in museum spaces|journal=Studies in Religion|date=December 1, 1992|volume=21|issue=4|pages=419–460|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000842989202100404?journalCode=sira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoring a shrine for museum display and putting it on [[Exhibition|exhibit]] affects its function: it becomes art to those outside its subject religion,&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; but to adherents it can retain its status as an object of veneration even after being removed from its original context.&lt;ref name="Caple"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caple|first1=Chris|title=Conservation Skills: Judgement, Method and Decision Making|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-18880-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to these differing principles that affect how a shrine is perceived, religious communities may have restrictions on what actions are appropriate for storage, restoration, and exhibition.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caple" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadongei|first1=Alyce|title=What about Sacred Objects?|journal=WAAC Newsletter|date=May 2006|volume=28|issue=2|pages=14–15|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn28/wn28-2/wn28-205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Buddhist writings and inscriptions show evidence of ongoing upkeep on ancient shrines and [[temple]]s, indicating a prescription within the faith to maintain holy objects.&lt;ref name="ICCROM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Conservation of Living Religious Heritage|journal=ICCROM Conservation Studies|date=2003|url=https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/ICCROM_ICS03_ReligiousHeritage_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jainic texts indicate that building a new shrine gives karmic reward, but a larger karmic reward is given for restoring an old shrine.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Hinduism, by contrast, commands that shrines and statues be worthy receptacles for the gods: if they become damaged, some Hindu groups believe, they should be ritually destroyed and replaced.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism not only vary from each other in their approaches to restoration, but groups and individuals within the religions may differ as well. As such, ethical standards state that the conservation methods undertaken for one object should not be applied to another, however similar, without consultation with the source religious community.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;

===Consultation and care===
====Traditional care====
Multiple conservation organizations, including the [[Western Association for Art Conservation]] (WAAC) and the International Centre for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments (ICCROM), state that a goal of conservation is to preserve the intangible qualities of an object as well as the tangible, physical qualities.&lt;ref name="WAAC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; To fully understand these intangible qualities, consultation with members of the religious community is necessary.

In addition to the preventative conservation methods described earlier, consultation with religious communities may disclose traditional or ritual care practices that the subject religion requires for sacred objects.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; These measure could include directives on how objects can be stored, who can handle them, and what—if any—restorative measures can be taken.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; Ritual care has the potential to prescribe religious practices to museum staff members who are not adherents of the subject religion; to avoid this, a recommended practice is active practice and passive accommodation: active practice refers to actions and behaviors with the object that can only be undertaken by a knowledgeable practitioner, while passive accommodation refers to the museum staff allowing the practitioner to conduct the practice within the museum space.&lt;ref name="Sadongei" /&gt; Conservators and other museum professionals should be prepared to conduct restoration best practices within the confines of what the religious representatives allow.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt;

====Varying approaches====
Museum and conservation professionals take several different stances on how best to approach the care of religious objects. [[The Victoria and Albert Museum]] in the United Kingdom, for example, provides all of its staff conservators with an Ethics Checklist that, among other measures, prescribes consultation with a number of interested parties before conservation begins, and asks conservators to consider how their actions will affect the “identity and significance of the object(s)”.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Appendix 1: Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Conservation Department Ethics Checklist|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Summer 2005|issue=50|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-50/appendix-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Government of Canada]] promotes an imperative of “respectful care”, wherein conservators fit their best practices into standards of care required by cultural representatives.&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt; ICCROM takes an even more culturally-centered approach, stating that the entire conservation process, including the decision to conserve, should originate with and be directed by the source religious community.&lt;ref name="ICCROM" /&gt; Others suggest that consultation can go both ways, with religious representatives educating conservationists on proper care of the shrines, while conservationists can education the faithful on what their work entails to ensure that no boundaries are overstepped.&lt;ref name="Cotte"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cotte|first1=Sabine|title=Reflections Around the Conservation of Sacred Thangkas|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|url=https://www.jcms-journal.com/articles/10.5334/jcms.1021207/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an exhibition standpoint, some recommend advocating for the religious aspects of these objects by creating more immersive museum displays that promote and explain the devotional qualities of the shrines instead of reducing them to aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Grimes" /&gt; The WAAC, for its part, advocates presenting the source community with all possible options regarding care and treatment of the object in question and letting the final decision rest with the community.&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt; As this illustrates, although the bulk of museum and conservation organizations recommend consultation with religious representatives, as yet there is no complete consensus on the best ways to ethically care for and restore religious objects.

==Case studies==
===Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art===
The [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] spent more than a year restoring a Jain household shrine that had been in storage for over 70 years.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; Analysis of the shrine revealed two paint layers underneath the surface dirt: the original layer from the 16th century, and a later coating from the 1800s.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The decision was made by the conservators to remove only the surface grime and not attempt to remove the later paint layer: Jainism gives greater spiritual reward for restoring an old shrine than building a new one, so the conservators opted not to undo the spiritual work of the individual(s) who did the 1800s repainting.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt; The shrine has been on display in the Nelson-Atkins Asian Art gallery since 2014.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

===Philadelphia Museum of Art===
The [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] acquired a one-hundred-year-old Tibetan home altar in 2004.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; At the time of acquisition, [[soot]] and oil from incense and lamp burning had built up on the surface.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; Consulting with Tibetan Buddhist sources revealed that such surface grime, though a direct result of ritual, is not in and of itself religiously significant and thus was safe to remove.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; The altar is on display in the museum’s Asian Art gallery.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt;

===Newark Museum===
The [[Newark Museum]] is also in possession of a Tibetan Buddhist altar; however, this one was built for the museum after the ritual destruction of a shrine dating from 1935.&lt;ref name="Newark"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Altar|url=https://www.newarkmuseum.org/tibetan-buddhist-altar|website=Newark Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; That shrine had also been built as a display piece for the museum and was never [[Consecration|consecrated]], but the presence of Tibetan ritual objects surrounding it had, in the opinion of religious representatives, sanctified the altar nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; When the decision was made to replace it, a deconsecration ceremony was held by a Buddhist official, and the shrine was dismantled.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The new shrine was designed and built by a Tibetan artist.&lt;ref name="Newark" /&gt;

'''Daria Morgendorffer''' is a fictional character from the [[MTV]] animated series ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Daria]]''. She was voiced in both incarnations by Tracy Grandstaff.

In 2002, Daria placed at number 41 on the list of the'' Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters'' of all Time by ''[[TV Guide]]'' for her role in the two shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters.list/index.html "''TV Guide''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603000000/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters.list/index.html |date=June 3, 2009 }}", [[CNN]], July 30, 2002. Retrieved on October 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She was also listed in AOL's 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kim|title=100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/03/02/top-tv-women-75-51/|work=AOL TV|accessdate=July 20, 2012|date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception and development==
[[Glenn Eichler]] created the Daria character.&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;{{cite news|first=Anita|last=Gates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/16/arts/television-radio-in-praise-of-the-most-unpopular-girl-at-lawndale.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title='Daria': In Praise of the Most Unpopular Girl at Lawndale|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=May 16, 1999|accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' "became successful, we ... created Daria's character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the [[Foil (literature)|foil]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Mangan|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/13512116.html?dids=13512116:13512116&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+17%2C+1997&amp;author=Jennifer+Mangan.+Special+to+the+Tribune.&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=%60DARIA%27+DELIVERS+A+BIG+DOSE+OF+SOPHIXTICATED+HUMOR&amp;pqatl=google|title='Daria': Brainy = Zany in MTV's irreverent view of 'girl humor'|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=August 17–23, 1997|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terkuhle said that he added Daria "to put [Beavis and Butt-Head] in their place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rick|last=Marin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/style/comic-cretins.html?pagewanted=2|title=Comic Cretins|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 11, 1993|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Beavis and Butt-Head''==
In Daria's first incarnation as a recurring character on ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', she formed an intelligent female foil to the two main characters. She went through three different outfits, had a stockier figure, and initially was a more expressive character; her iconic monotone voice would only develop over time. She would become more sardonic over time, but showed early on that she could hold her own against the two and could react fast to their antics.

She had a minor role in her first appearance, "Sign Here". She answered questions from Van Driessen on furriers and their treatment of animals. In her second episode with them, "Scientific Stuff", she was forced to do a science class presentation with them and turned it to her advantage by using them ''as'' the presentation's experiment. In later appearances, she would alternate between being irritated by their antics and finding their stupidity to be amusing: in "Sprout", she specifically came over to watch them fail at planting seeds, and in "Walkathon" she got them to unwittingly pledge $100 apiece on a charity walkathon. In "Sporting Goods" she gave three eye-popping gasps while Beavis and Butt-head wear eye patches as athletic supporters, which is a dramatic contrast to her monotonous behavior in the later series. She lacked the passionate hatred for them that [[Principal McVicker]] and [[Coach Buzzcut]] had and was one of the very few characters that would willingly seek them out, but did not really believe there is any hope for them either as [[David Van Driessen]] had.  On multiple occasions, she took it upon herself to explain simple concepts to them, such as informing them in "U.S. History" what graduation was (Beavis responded, "You mean, like...school ends?") and in "Sprout" that you put seeds in the ground.

In a Christmas special, it is stated that Butt-Head had been responsible for giving her a negative outlook on boys. Aside from that, she was one of the few characters that the duo never managed to drive crazy as they had with many other students and teachers. Butt-Head would sometimes treat her with some degree of respect, following her advice in "Sprout" and chuckling "Daria's ''cool!''" after she asked [[Bill Clinton]] if "you were just jerking us around" on a campaign promise.

John J. O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes Daria as "as sharp as B. &amp; B. are dimwitted."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|first=John J.|last=O'Connor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/03/arts/teen-ager-s-scornful-look-at-cuteness.html|title=Teen-Ager's Scornful Look at Cuteness|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=March 3, 1997|accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Allemang of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' described Daria in ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' "the prematurely wise girl who could be counted on to put their idiocy in perspective."&lt;ref name="Allemang"&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Allemang|title=Finally, a TV teen who comes close to feeling real FINE TUNING|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=March 19, 1999|quote=She wears bulky shapeless sweaters, hides behind thick round glasses, talks in a blasé monotone and is both the disappointment of her overachieving parents and an embarrassment to her boy-crazy sister Quinn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beavis and Butt-Head often call her "[[Diarrhea]]".&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt;

In the final episode of season 7, when the boys were believed dead, Daria expressed the sentiments that "I guess it's sad they're dead", but they did not have very bright futures to look forward to.

Daria appeared frequently in the [[Marvel Comics]] adaptation of the TV show, and also got to appear on the cover of one issue and "answer" the fan mail in two others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outpost-daria.com/ch_diarrhea.html "Daria on Beavis and Butt-head"], Outpost-Daria.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530002713/http://www.outpost-daria.com/ch_diarrhea.html |date=May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'', she appears once throughout the film with a group of students, but does not have any dialogue.

Daria's own show would never mention Beavis and Butt-Head and only named Highland once at the beginning of the first episode of season one, carried over from the original and unbroadcast pilot. Despite this, it was frequently noted in media articles about the show that it was a spin-off from ''Beavis and Butt-Head''. In an "interview" on ''CBS Early Show'' on January 21, 2002, Daria was asked by [[Jane Clayson Johnson|Jane Clayson]] if she kept in touch with Beavis and Butt-Head; she responded "I'd like to, but first they'd have to figure out that when the telephone makes that funny sound, you're supposed to pick it up and say hello".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outpost-daria.com/media_art28.html Transcript of ''CBS Daily Show'' "interview"], Outpost-Daria.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106055930/http://www.outpost-daria.com/media_art28.html |date=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As revealed in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview with Mike Judge, Daria would not return to the new episodes of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' in 2011, but she was referenced in "[[Drones (Beavis and Butt-head)|Drones]]" during a music video when Beavis assumed she had committed suicide. However, Butt-Head incredulously tells his friend "What are you talking about, Beavis? Daria didn't die, she just moved away".

== In ''Daria'' ==

In the series ''[[Daria]]'' which followed ''Beavis and Butt-head'', Daria remains bespectacled and plain. She is an unfashionably dressed, highly intellectual, entirely [[pessimism|pessimistic]] about life altogether, cynical, and sarcastic teenage girl who is portrayed as an icon of sanity in an insane household in an equally insane [[upper middle class]] [[suburb]]. She resides with her vacuous, fashion-obsessed younger sister [[Quinn Morgendorffer|Quinn]] and career-obsessed parents [[Helen Morgendorffer|Helen]] and [[Jake Morgendorffer|Jake]]. John Allemang of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said that Daria is "both the disappointment of her overachieving parents and an embarrassment to her boy-crazy sister Quinn."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; She had moved to a new school, having transferred from the one in ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. [[Glenn Eichler]] said, in relation to ''Daria'' the series, of which he was a co-creator, "I like to think that I've helped her come out of her shell."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

David L. Coddon of the ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' described Daria as "the anti-cheerleader, the un-social climber, the jaundiced eye in a cartoon world of too much makeup and superficial crayon colors." Coddon added that Daria "may look like a misfit, but the catch is that Daria's the only character on the show who 'gets it.' It's everyone else who's a misfit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|first=David L.|last=Coddon|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/70574421.html?dids=70574421:70574421&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+05%2C+2001&amp;author=David+L.+Coddon&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=Wearing+her+cynicism+well%2C+Daria+is+best-dressed+in+class&amp;pqatl=google|title=Wearing her cynicism well, Daria is best-dressed in class|newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|publisher=Nant Capital LLC|location=San Diego, California|date=April 5, 2001|accessdate=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daria states in the first episode that she does not have low [[self esteem]]: she has low esteem for everybody else.&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; Anita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "The secret of Daria's popularity (everywhere but in her own home and school) may be our collective alienation."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates says that "her tastes are a little dark."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; As an example, Gates used the fact that she reads "[[Howl]]" by [[Allen Ginsberg]] at a reading to the elderly program.&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

Eichler said, "Apparently everyone, with the exception of a very few people who were hit on the head when they were very young, felt like they were outsiders. You either identify with her as an outsider or you sort of envy her ability to navigate her life as an outsider and stay sane."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; John J. O'Connor, a television critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', said "In short, Daria is the perfect anti-Barbie Doll. Merchants of fashion and cosmetics are beneath her contempt. Her refusal to be Miss Goody Consumer borders on the truly subversive."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; He concludes that Daria "is every glorious misfit I ever knew."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt;

Allemang said that in ''Daria'', Daria "seems more tortured and neurotic, if only because it's more clear that the airheads have won."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; Daria often talks to herself. Allemang adds "in a perky-teen world with its twisted values, [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]] are the best hope of intelligent conversation."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; In addition he said "There's nothing intrinsically wrong with Daria, just because she can't or won't hang out with the cool kids."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt; John J. O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that Daria has "a withering eye" towards her classmates.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; [[Emily Nussbaum]] for ''Slate'' would praise the show for both having a character that many disaffected teenagers could relate to and for showing "the flipside of her principled withdrawal from the world: her crippling terror of rejection, a streak of ugly self-righteousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Nussbaum|authorlink=Emily Nussbaum|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2002/01/requiem_for_daria.html|title=Requiem for ''Daria'': ''Daria'' slips into the ''Ghost World'' of great high-school drama|website=[[Slate.com]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|location=New York City| |date=January 21, 2002|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daria likes to watch the fictitious television show ''Sick, Sad World''.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; Gates added that "Daria is the kind of girl who reads ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s '[[The Tell-Tale Heart|Telltale Heart]]' in class."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

Anita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' says "The Morgendorffers don't even seem to notice that Daria constantly gives them lip."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; In one scene, when Helen, her mother, says, "There's no course that can teach you to be a perfect mother," Daria responds "That's obvious."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates says that "nobody sends her to her room."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates also said that Daria's popular, self-absorbed sister [[Quinn Morgendorffer|Quinn]] is "the greatest burden on the home front."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; [[Jane Lane (Daria)|Jane Lane]], Daria's best friend, met her at a self-esteem class. Gates adds that Jane "knows all of Daria's peculiarities and still loves her."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; Gates said that Daria's "silent intense crush" on Jane's brother [[Trent Lane|Trent]] is her "only discernible weakness" and that "the absolute proof that Jane is a good friend is that she knows how Daria feels about Trent and will never, ever tell."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; In spite of her early infatuation with Trent, Daria's most significant romantic relationship is with [[Tom Sloane]], who entered the show at the end of the third season and rapidly became Jane's love interest before beginning a relationship with Daria that continued throughout the rest of the show and caused some friction between Daria and Jane.

===Movies===
The first ''Daria'' movie, ''Is It Fall Yet?'', gave the principal characters time apart from one another in parallel narratives which foreshadowed further changes in their relationships.

By the time of the finale movie ''Is It College Yet?'', Daria's character has undergone noticeable growth. She chooses to attend Raft College. She graduates from Lawndale High, winning the [[Dian Fossey]] Award "for dazzling academic achievements in face of near total [[misanthropy]]", and crowning her acceptance speech with the assertion that "there is no aspect, no facet, no moment of life that can't be improved with [[pizza]]".

== Appearance ==
Daria wears rounded thick glasses, an orange T-shirt underneath a green jacket, a black skirt, and black boots. John Allemang of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' said "to surrender is to be normal, to sacrifice your brain in the rush to be popular and wear uncomfortable shoes that make your legs look hot. Daria, as always, keeps her integrity. She wears sensible shoes, and finds her intellectual reward in not being hot."&lt;ref name="Allemang"/&gt;

In ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', Daria wears square glasses, a leather jacket, white T-shirt, a red skirt, black leggings and black boots. In the earlier episodes, she is seen wearing a brown jacket, beige skirt, green shirt and brown boots.

== MTV "host" ==

During her run on MTV, Daria would narrate or "host" special events and shows, either with a real-life presenter or with Jane. She was part of the Cool Crap Auction in 1999, giving an overview of the goods for auction and talking "live" to the winner of one prize, answering machine messages recorded by her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outpost-daria.com/ts_coolcrap.html Cool Crap Auction transcript] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711000000/http://www.outpost-daria.com/ts_coolcrap.html |date=July 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daria and Jane also hosted MTV's ''Top Ten Animated Videos Countdown'' and two ''Daria Day'' marathons of their episodes; the ''Countdown'' and second marathon segments are included on the 2010 DVD release.

==Cameos==
Daria makes a brief cameo in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "Lost in Parking Space, Part Two". She is being [[tortured]] in the basement of a [[Hot Topic]] along with other cartoon characters. She has a nail being hammered into her eye and says, "This is men's fault", in her infamous monotone and is rather indifferent to the pain.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Lost in Parking Space, Part Two]]" ''[[Drawn Together]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, at one point in the MTV animated series ''[[Undergrads]]'', Gimpy is talking to his friends via webcam when a female hacker hacks into the video stream and edits Gimpy to look like Daria.

In late 2010, following the DVD release, Daria was licensed as a voice for [[Garmin]] and [[TomTom]] GPS systems; original putdowns and jokes were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navtones.com/daria-voice-for-gps.html Navtones.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029022007/http://www.navtones.com/daria-voice-for-gps.html |date=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Carol A. Stabile and Mark Harrison, authors of ''Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture'', said that "for the cerebral, writerly types who liked television Daria was the outcast she-hero who dared to say things they were too scared to say in their teenage years."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Carol A.|last1=Stabile|first2=Mark|last2=Harrison|title=Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, New Jersey|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3USAr6i1e0C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=daria+morgendorffer#v=onepage&amp;q=daria%20morgendorffer&amp;f=false|ISBN=978-0-415-28326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Toffler, then the general manager of MTV, said in 1998 that Daria "has an attitude about parents, school, and siblings that is common to the experiences of our audience. She is a good spokesperson for MTV... intelligent but subversive."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; A 1997 ''[[The Nation]]'' article referred to Daria as "a 10th grade [[Dorothy Parker]]."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; Another critic praising the character said that she is like "a 50-year-old deadpan [[Jews|Jewish]] comic in the body of a 16-year-old."&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; Jennifer Vineyard, a writer of ''[[My Life as Liz]]'', said "Daria made it cool to be a smart chick." Vineyard added, "Just the presence of people or characters like Daria help make it cool to be yourself. There's a tendency for young girls to play dumb. Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Henry|last=Hanks|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/15/mtv.liz.go/?hpt=C2|title='My Life as Liz' and the evolution of the MTV nerd|website=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|date=February 15, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators believed that the character's [[deadpan]] humor had too much morbidity for the teenage audience. A critic said that Daria uses her "omnivorous deadpan" contempt against other people, represented a variety of "living death", and was "a [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]] in a dress" who was more dangerous than [[Marilyn Manson]].&lt;ref name="StabileHarrison186"/&gt; Anita Gates of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "And some people like her just because she says mean things. As far as I can tell, with her show well into its third season [...], Daria has never cracked a smile."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

'''''Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights''''' (also known as '''''Dirty Dancing 2''''' or '''''Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights''''') is a 2004 American [[dance]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic drama film]] directed by [[Guy Ferland]]. The film is a [[prequel]]/"re-imagining" of the 1987 [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', reusing the same basic plot, but transplanting it from upstate New York to Cuba on the cusp of the [[Cuban Revolution]].The movie was filmed in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.

==Plot==
In 1958, Katey Miller ([[Romola Garai]]), her parents ([[Sela Ward]] and [[John Slattery]]), and her younger sister Susie ([[Mika Boorem]]) arrive in Cuba during the [[Cuban revolution]]. A self-described bookworm, Katey is not very happy about having to move to a different country during her senior year of high school, as she had been planning to attend [[Radcliffe College]], although the rest of her family seem extremely pleased to be in Cuba.

Meeting several other rich American teenagers down by the pool - including James Phelps ([[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]]), the son of her father's boss -, Katey becomes disgusted when one of the teenagers insults a local waiter when he accidentally knocks over some of their drinks. Katey attempts to talk to the waiter—Javier ([[Diego Luna]]), who works at the hotel to support his family—because she feels awful about what had occurred, but he is not interested.

Katey watches a film of her mother and father dancing and wishes she could dance as well as they did. She and her father dance a bit. The next day in class, Katey is asked to read aloud from ''[[The Odyssey]]'' - a passage about love and passion. After class, James invites her to a party at the country club the next day and she accepts.

While walking home from school, she sees Javier dancing at a street party, and he offers to walk her home. They stop to listen to a street band and police show up, stopping Javier while Katey runs away.

The next day, Katey tries some of the dance moves she saw. Javier sees her and asks her to come see the real dancers Saturday night, but she says she is already going to the country club. Javier gets upset and leaves. Katey wears one of her maid's dresses to the country club party and impresses James. Katey convinces him to take her to the Cuban club where Javier is dancing with the ladies.

Javier dances with Katey while James sits at the bar. Soon he is accosted by Javier's brother, Carlos, who tells him that they will eventually kick the Americans out of Cuba. Javier comes over and argues with his brother. James takes Katey back to the car and assaults her after she refuses to kiss him. She slaps him and runs into the club, and Javier agrees to walk her home.

The next day, Katey walks by a dance class. The teacher ([[Patrick Swayze]]) asks if anyone wants to enter the big dance contest and then dances with Katey for a bit. She grabs a flyer for the competition.

While walking to the pool, James apologizes to Katey and then tells her that Susie saw Javier with her and got him fired. Katey argues with Susie and goes to find Javier. He is now working at a [[chop shop]] with Carlos. She asks him to enter the dance contest with her, but he refuses. Meanwhile, it is becoming apparent that Carlos is helping the revolutionaries.

The next day, Javier shows up at Katey's school and agrees to enter the dance contest with her. They start teaching each other dance moves and Javier convinces her to "feel the music". They practice all the time, and Katey dances some more with the dance teacher, until it is the night of the dance. Katey and Javier dance with the other couples on the floor and are chosen to go on to the next round.

Katey's parents disapprove of her relationship with Javier, but Katey reconciles with them. On the night of the contest's final round, while Katey and Javier are on the dance floor, Javier sees his brother and some revolutionaries disguised as waiters, and the police soon try to arrest them. The contest stops as everyone flees the club, and Javier has to save Carlos from the police. Javier and Carlos talk about how they miss their dad, then they hear that [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] has fled the country and join the celebration.

Later, Javier comes to the hotel and finds Katey. He takes her to the beach and they make love. The next day, Katey's parents tell her they are leaving Cuba and she has one last night with Javier. They go to the Cuban club where they first danced, and the floor is theirs. Katey's family is there to see her, and Katey narrates that she doesn't know when she will see Javier again, but this will not be their last time to dance together.

==Production==
''Havana Nights'' is based on an original screenplay by playwright and [[NPR]] host [[Peter Sagal]], based on the real life experience of producer JoAnn Jansen, who lived in Cuba as a 15-year-old in 1958-59. Sagal wrote the screenplay, which he titled ''Cuba Mine'', about a young American woman who witnessed the [[Cuban revolution]] and had a romance with a young Cuban revolutionary. The screenplay was to be a serious political romance story, documenting, among other stories, how the Cuban revolution transformed from idealism to terror. It was commissioned in 1992 by [[Lawrence Bender]], who was rising to fame with his production of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. The screenplay was bought by a film studio, which requested several rewrites before deciding not to produce the film. A decade later, Bender decided to make a ''Dirty Dancing'' [[sequel]], and the film was very loosely adapted from Sagal's script. Not a single line from Sagal's original screenplay appears in the final film and Sagal says that the only remnants of the political theme that existed in his script is a scene wherein some people are executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[This American Life]] |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |title=Radio episode #383|date=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was actress [[Romola Garai]]'s first Hollywood film and she repeatedly has cited the filming of the movie as being an extremely negative experience which caused her to re-evaluate working in Hollywood. In a 2004 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' she explained that the filmmakers "were obsessed with having someone skinny. I just thought, why didn't they get someone like Kate Bosworth, if that's what they wanted?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Craig|title=Romola Garai: Dancing Queen|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/romola-garai-dancing-queen-27395.html|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, in the midst of producer [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|sexual abuse allegations]] in Hollywood, Garai later revealed that Weinstein, whose company [[Miramax]] was co-producing the film, had required her to meet him alone in a hotel room while he was wearing only a bathrobe to obtain the part: "I had to go to his hotel room in the Savoy, and he answered the door in his bathrobe. I was only 18. I felt violated by it, it has stayed very clearly in my memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=Actor Romola Garai felt 'violated' after Harvey Weinstein encounter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/actor-romola-garai-felt-violated-after-harvey-weinstein-encounter|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 23% rating based on 108 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The website provides a brief critical consensus: "Cheesy, unnecessary remake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dirty_dancing_havana_nights |title=Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-dancing-havana-nights |title=Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Denerstein of the Denver Rocky Mountain News gave it a D+, saying: "Tries to add Cuban flavor to a familiar plot but comes up with nothing more than a bubbling stew of cliches." Peter Howell of the Toronto Star thought it to be "Charmless, clumsy and culturally offensive all at the same time" and merited it 1 out of 5 stars. Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe awarded it 2 out of 4 stars, saying: "As you might expect, the movie is as square as a sock hop." A more favorable review came from  Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who rated it B-, because "aside from the triteness of the dialogue, the mathematical predictability of the script and the muddling of numbskulled politics, DD: HN is a fairly enjoyable experience." According to Louis Hobson of Jam! Magazine, who thought the movie was worth 3.5 out of 5 stars, the main redeeming factor was the choreography: "You may have problems with the obvious, cliched story, but the dancing is incredible." That didn't convince everyone; Philip Wuntch of the Dallas Morning News thought the movie was worth no more than a C, stating that "both the dance numbers and the personal drama are largely listless." &lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|havana_nights|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dramaturgy''' is the study of [[drama]]tic composition and the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of the main elements of drama on the stage.

The term first appears in the eponymous work  ''[[Hamburg Dramaturgy]]'' (1767–69) by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Lessing composed this collection of essays on the principles of drama while working as the world's first dramaturge at the [[Hamburg National Theatre]]. Dramaturgy is distinct from play writing and directing, although the three may be practiced by one individual.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[dramatist]]s combine writing and dramaturgy when creating a drama. Others work with a specialist, called a [[dramaturge]], to adapt a work for the stage.

Dramaturgy may also be broadly defined as "adapting a story to actable form." Dramaturgy gives a performance work foundation and [[Dramatic structure|structure]]. Often the dramaturge's strategy is to manipulate a narrative to reflect the current [[Zeitgeist]] through cross-cultural signs, theater and film historical references to genre, ideology, role of gender representation etc. in the dramatization.

== Definition and history ==
Dramaturgy is a practice-based as well as practice-led discipline invented by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (the author of well known plays such as ''[[Miss Sara Sampson]]'', ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'', ''[[Minna von Barnhelm]]'', and ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'') in the 18th century. The Theater of Hamburg engaged him for some years for a position today known as "dramaturge". He was first of this kind and described his task as ‘"dramatic judge" ("dramatischer Richter") who has to be able to tell the difference between the stake the play has or the main actor or the director to make us feel comfortable or not while watching a theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. &amp; BERGHAHN, K. L. 1981. Hamburgische Dramaturgie, Stuttgart, Reclam.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1767–1770 Lessing wrote and published as result a series of criticisms titled ''Hamburg Dramaturgy (Hamburgische Dramaturgie).'' These works analyzed, criticized and theorized the German theatre, and made Lessing the father of modern dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171026/dramaturgy?anchor=ref666078 Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Lessing's ''Hamburgische Dramaturgie'' (Lessing and Berghahn, 1981) and ''Laokoon'' &lt;ref&gt;LESSING, G. E. 1766. Laokoon, Berlin, C. F. Vosst&lt;/ref&gt; and Hegel’s "Aesthetics" (written 1835–1838),&lt;ref&gt;HEGEL, G. W. F. &amp; KNOX, T. M. 1975. Aesthetics : lectures on fine art, Oxford, Clarendon Presst&lt;/ref&gt; many authors, including  Hölderlin, Goethe, Schelling, Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, started to reflect on theater, not only in Germany.,&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 18. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschelverlag Berlin; 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammer K, editor. Dramaturgische Schriften des 19. Jahrhunderts. Berlin: Henschel Verlag; 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustav Freytag summed up those reflections in his book ''The Technique of the Drama'',&lt;ref&gt;FREYTAG, G. Technique of the drama: an exposition of dramatic composition and art; an authorized translation from the 6th German ed. by Elias J. MacEwan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been translated into English and published in the late 19th century in the USA. Freytag's book is seen as the blueprint for the  first Hollywood screenwriting manuals. ''The Technique of Play Writing'' by Charlton Andrews, 1915,&lt;ref&gt;ANDREWS, C. 1915. The Technique of Play Writing, Springfield, Mass. : The Home correspondence schoolt&lt;/ref&gt; refers to European and German traditions of dramaturgy and understanding dramatic composition.

Another important work in the Western theatrical tradition is ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' by [[Aristotle]] (written around 335 BC). In this work Aristotle analyzes [[tragedy]]. Aristotle considers ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c. 429 BC) as the quintessential dramatic work. He analyzes the relations among [[Character (arts)|character]], action, and speech, gives examples of good plots, and examines the reactions the plays provoke in the audience. Many of his "rules" are referred to today as "Aristotelian drama". In ''Poetics'', Aristotle discusses many key concepts of drama, such as [[anagnorisis]] and [[catharsis]].

''Poetics'' is the earliest surviving [[Western civilization|Western]] work of [[dramatic theory]]. The earliest non-Western dramaturgic work is probably the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] work ''Natya Shastra'' (''The Art of Theatre''), written around [[Anno Dommini|500 BCE to 500 CE]], which describes the elements, forms and narrative elements of the ten major types of ancient Indian dramas.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. ''Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director''. University of Melbourne: Melbourne. p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides. The dramaturge is the resident expert on the physical, social, political, and economic milieus in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphorical expressions in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.&lt;ref&gt;Terry McCabe. ''Mis-Directing the Play: An Argument Against Contemporary Theatre''. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional dramaturges may participate in many phases of play production including casting of the play, offering in-house criticism of productions-in-progress, and informing the director, the cast, and the audience about a play’s history and its current importance. In America, this type of dramaturgy is sometimes known as Production Dramaturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. 1997. Soundings in the Dramaturgy of the Australian Theatre Director University of Melbourne. Melbourne. p9.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutional or production dramaturges may make files of materials about a play's history or social context, prepare program notes, lead post-production discussions, or write study guides for schools and groups. These actions can assist a  director in integrating textual and acting criticism, performance theory, and historical research into a production before it opens.&lt;ref&gt;Cardullo, Bert. ''What is Dramaturgy?'' New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright==
Since dramaturgy is defined in a general way and the function of a dramaturge may vary from production to production, the copyright issues regarding it in the United States have very vague borders.

In 1996, there was debate based on the question of the extent to which a dramaturge can claim ownership of a production, such as the case of [[Jonathan Larson]], the author of the musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and Lynn Thomson, the dramaturge on the production. Thomson claimed that she was a co-author of the work and that she never assigned, licensed or otherwise transferred her rights. She asked that the court declare her a co-author of ''Rent'' and grant her 16% of the author's share of the royalties. Although she made her claim only after the show became a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway hit]], the case is not without precedent. For instance, 15% of the royalties of ''[[Angels in America]]'' go to playwright [[Tony Kushner]]'s dramaturge. On June 19, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original court's ruling that Thomson was not entitled to be credited with co-authorship of ''Rent'' and that she was not entitled to royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/in2/everythingisrent/articles/americantheatre5.html Scott. T. Cummings, ''American Theatre'', October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The case was ultimately settled out of court with Thomson receiving an undisclosed sum after she threatened to remove her material from the production.

[[Image:dust jacket.jpg|thumb|right|A dust jacket, propped up and partially unfolded for illustration]]
The '''dust jacket''' (sometimes '''book jacket''', '''dust wrapper''' or '''dust cover''') of a book is the detachable outer cover, usually made of paper and printed with text and illustrations. This outer cover has folded flaps that hold it to the front and back [[book cover]]s. Often the back panel or flaps are printed with biographical information about the author, a summary of the book from the publisher (known as a [[blurb]]), and/or critical praise from celebrities or authorities in the book's subject area. In addition to its promotional role, the dust jacket protects the book covers from damage. However, since it is itself relatively fragile, and since dust jackets have practical, aesthetic, and sometimes financial value, the jacket may in turn be wrapped in another jacket, usually transparent, especially if the book is a [[public library|library]] volume.

== Early history ==
Before the 1820s, most books were published as unbound sellers and were generally sold to customers either in this form, or in simple bindings executed for the bookseller, or in bespoke bindings commissioned by the customer. At this date, publishers did not have their books bound in uniform "house" bindings, so there was no reason for them to issue dust jackets. Book owners did occasionally fashion their own jackets out of [[leather]], [[wallpaper]], fur, or other material, and many other types of detachable protective covers were made for [[codex|codices]], [[manuscript]]s, and [[scroll]]s from ancient times through the [[Middle Ages]] and into the modern period.

At the end of the 18th century publishers began to issue books in plain paper-covered boards, sometimes with a printed spine-label; this form of binding was intended to be temporary. Some collections of loose prints were issued at this period in printed paper wrappings, again intended to be temporary. In the first two decades of the nineteenth century, publishers started issuing some smaller books in bindings of printed paper-covered boards, and throughout the 1820s and 1830s some small popular books, notably annual gift-books and almanacs, were issued in detachable printed [[card stock|pasteboard]] sheaths. These small boxes are sometimes loosely and erroneously referred to as the first dust jackets. True publisher's bindings in cloth and leather, in which all, or a substantial part of, an edition were bound, were also introduced shortly before 1820, by the innovative publisher [[William Pickering (publisher)|William Pickering]].

===Oldest dust jackets===
After publishers' [[Bookbinding#Hardcover binding|cloth bindings]] started coming into common use on all types of books in the 1820s, the first publishers' dust jackets appeared by the end of that decade. The earliest known examples were issued on English literary annuals which were popular from the 1820s to the 1850s. These books often had fancy bindings that needed protection. The jackets that were used at this time completely enclosed the books like [[wrapping paper]] and were sealed shut with [[wax]] or [[glue]].

The oldest publishers' dust jacket now on record was issued in 1829 on an English annual, ''Friendship's Offering'' for 1830. It was discovered at the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford by Michael Turner, a former curator and Head of Conservation at the Library. Its existence was announced by Oxford in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/24/earliest-dust-jacket-library "Earliest-known book jacket discovered in Bodleian Library"] (Michelle Pauli, guardian.co.uk, Friday 24 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It is three years older than the previous oldest known jacket, which was discovered in 1934 by the English [[Bookman (reading)|bookman]] [[John Carter (author)|John Carter]] on another English annual, ''The Keepsake'' for 1833 (issued in 1832).&lt;ref&gt;Carter, author of the classic ''ABC for Book Collectors'', reported his find in the September 22, 1934, issue of ''Publisher's Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt; Both jackets are of the type that completely enclosed the books.

Most jackets of this type were torn when they were opened and then discarded like gift-wrapping paper; they were not designed to be reused, and surviving examples are known on only a handful of titles. The scarcity of jackets of this type, together with the lack of written documentation from publishers of the period, makes it very hard to determine how widely these all-enclosing jackets were used during the period from 1820 to 1850, but they were probably common on ornately bound annuals and on some trade books.

The earliest known dust jackets of the modern style, with flaps, which covered just the binding and left the text block exposed, date from the 1850s, although this type of jacket was probably in at least limited use some years earlier. This is the jacket that became standard in the publishing industry and is still in use today. It is believed that flap-style jackets were in general use by the 1880s, and probably earlier, although the number of surviving examples from the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s is too small to prove exactly when they became ubiquitous, and again, there are no known publishers' records that document the use of dust jackets during these decades. There are, however, enough surviving examples from the 1890s to state unequivocally that dust jackets were all but universal throughout that decade. They were probably issued more often than not by the 1860s and 1870s in Europe, Great Britain, and the United States.

==Late 19th and early 20th centuries==
[[File:Hermione - dust jacket.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Dust jacket of ''Hermione and her Little Group of Serious Thinkers'' by [[Don Marquis]], an early work of humour, produced in 1916.]]

Throughout the nineteenth century, nearly all dust jackets were discarded at or soon after purchase. Many were probably discarded in bookstores as the books were put out for display, or when they were sold; there is evidence that this was common practice in England until World War I. The period from the 1820s to 1900 was a golden age for publishers' decorative bookbinding, and most dust jackets were much plainer than the books they covered, often simply repeating the main elements of the binding decoration in black on cream or brown paper. For this reason, most people preferred to display their books in their bindings, much as earlier generations had displayed their library books in their gold-tooled individual bindings, usually in leather or [[vellum]]. Even late in the nineteenth century there were still some publishers who were not using dust jackets at all (the English publisher [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] is one example). Some firms, such as subscription houses which sold millions of cheap books [[door-to-door]], probably never used them.

Cloth dust jackets became popular late in the nineteenth century. These jackets, with the outer cloth usually reinforced with an underlayer of paper, were issued mostly on ornate gift editions, often in two volumes and often with a [[slipcase]]. Other types of publishers' boxes were also popular in the second half of the nineteenth century, including many made to hold multi-volume sets of books. The jackets on boxed volumes were often plain, sometimes with cutouts on the spine to allow the title or volume numbers of the books to be seen.

After 1900, fashions in, and the economics of, publishing caused book bindings to become less decorative, and it was cheaper for publishers to make the jackets more attractive. By around 1920, most of the artwork and decoration had migrated from the binding to the dust jacket, and jackets were routinely printed with multiple colors, extensive advertising and blurbs; even the underside of the jacket was now sometimes used for advertising.

As dust jackets became more attractive than the bindings, more people began to keep the jackets on their books, at least until they became soiled, torn, or worn out. One bit of evidence that indicates when jackets became saved objects is the movement of the printed price from the spine of the jacket to a corner of one of the flaps. This also occurred in the 1910s and early 1920s. When jackets were routinely discarded at point of purchase, it did not matter where the price was printed (and many early jackets were not printed with any price), but now if book buyers of the 1910s and 1920s wanted to save the jacket and give a book as a gift, they could clip off the price without ruining the jacket.

=== Supplementary bands ===
In Japan, both hardcover and softcover books frequently come with two dust jackets – a full-sized one, serving the same purpose as in the West (it is usually retained with the book), and a thin "[[Obi (publishing)|obi]]" ("belt"; colloquially "belly band" in English), which is generally disposed of and serves a similar function to 19th century Western dust jackets.

Similar bands occasionally appear in the west, for example in [[Palookaville (comics)|Palookaville]] #20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.shelfari.com/my_weblog/2010/11/graphic-novel-friday-enter-the-new-palookaville.html Graphic Novel Friday: Enter the New Palookaville], Alex Carr, ''Shelfari,'' November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==As collectible items==
Dust jackets from the 1920s and later were often decorated in [[art deco]] styles which are highly prized by collectors. Some of them are worth far more than the books they cover. The most famous example is the jacket on the first edition of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], published in 1925. Without jacket, the book brings $1,000 or so. With the jacket it can bring $20,000 or $30,000 or more, depending on condition. One copy in a near mint jacket was listed for sale in 2009 for half a million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1042916914&amp;searchurl=imagefield.x%3D11%26imagefield.y%3D7%26kn%3Dfitzgerald%26prl%3D10.00%26sortby%3D1%26sts%3Dt listing at ABEbooks.com], unsold as of April, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable jackets are usually those on the high spots of literature. Condition is of paramount importance to value. Other examples of highly prized jackets include those on most of Ernest Hemingway's titles, and the first editions of books such as Harper Lee's ''To Kill A Mockingbird,'' J. D. Salinger's ''Catcher in the Rye'' and Dashiell Hammett's ''The Maltese Falcon'', among many others. Prices for dust jackets have become so inflated in recent years that even early reprints of certain titles in jacket can command good prices. Conversely, if the book itself is unimportant, or at least has little demand, the jacket is usually of little value either, but nearly all surviving pre-1920 jackets add some additional value to the book they cover.

Some collectors and dealers, in an effort to increase the value of a [[first edition]] that has lost its original jacket, will take a jacket from a later printing and "marry" it to the earlier one. This practice persists because some customers will pay more for a first edition in a later jacket than they would for a jacketless copy. However, switching jackets muddles the bibliographical record and creates a [[forgery]] of sorts.

The main theme of the film is life of [[Kosovo Serbs]] in small isolated [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|ethnic enclaves]].&lt;ref name="balkaninsight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/film-on-kosovo-serbs-in-bid-for-oscar-09-04-2015 |title=Film on Plight of Kosovo Serbs Bids for Oscar |work=Balkan Insight |date=7 September 2015 |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film follows a young Serbian boy named Nenad, who was living in a ghetto that was the product of a previous war. Rather than having a linear plot line, the film focuses on the different unfortunate events in Nenad's life, sometimes revisiting past events. Specifically, the events are:
* Nenad is driven to school each day in an armoured car. This is due to the discrimination against him by everyone not living in his enclave. There is only one teacher at his school and he is also the only student. However, his teacher later leaves the war-torn place, and his school trips end.
* Nenad witnesses his grandfather die.
* Nenad gets mixed up with some bad friends. After swimming with them, his clothes fall into the river and are lost. As a result he is whipped by his father.
* A man attempts to steal Nenad's father's cattle and Nenad's father attempts to shoot him. The police arrive and arrest Nenad's father and confiscate all of his illegally owned weapons, which were kept in a box under his bed. The police offer Nenad's father a chance at employment at the police station, but he turns it down.
* Nenad's hostile friends trap him under a giant bell for refusing to play a game, and the leading boy (Baskim) pulls out a pistol and shoots the bell. This causes the bullet to ricochet and hit Baskim.
* Baskim's family questions him about who shot him. Baskim responds, "A Serb." Baskim's family and their gang set the Serbian enclave on fire, trapping Nenad under the bell tower. The heat and smoke nearly suffocates Nenad. Baskim feels guilt for trapping Nenad and revisits the bell where Nenad is trapped.
* Nenad's family decides they want a new life and end up moving to [[Belgrade]] after they free Nenad from under the bell. Nenad is not used to a school with many people and as a result he does not perform well socially.

'''Europeana 1914–1918''' is a major project to digitise and publish primary and secondary historical sources on the [[World War I|First World War]]. It is coordinated by [[Europeana]], as part of a broader program to digitise European cultural heritage.

The collection is composed of three major elements. The first, also titled '''Europeana 1914–1918''', gathers digitised memorabilia and personal stories from individuals, including a series of public workshops where material can be scanned or photographed. The second, '''Europeana Collections 1914–1918''', is a coordinated digitisation program by ten major libraries across eight European countries. The third element, '''EFG1914''', is a project to digitise a substantial number of wartime silent films through the [[European Film Gateway]].

==Background==

The Europeana 1914–1918 project was publicly announced in 2011, as "Europeana Collections 1914–1918: Remembering the First World War", with the goal of digitising over 400,000 source items from thirteen institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/13/first-world-war-british-library|title=Europe's archived trove of rare Great War documents goes online|date=13 November 2011|work=Observer|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan called for around 425,000 digitised items from the partner institutions. This would sit alongside 27,000 items (mostly photographs from the UK and France) already in Europeana, and include around 75,000 items already digitised but not yet added to Europeana. The focus was to be on "special collections" – manuscripts, artwork, rare books, maps, music, etc. – with the goal that most material provided would be rare or unique. Material would be hosted by the institutions but accessible through an aggregated service, and where possible copyright issues would be resolved to ensure maximal reusability of material.&lt;ref name="dow-12"&gt;{{citation|title=Description of Work: Europeana Collections 1914–1918 (version 1.2)|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-collections-1914-1918/outcomes/-/document_library_display/fTO5/view/0/61602|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the project was anticipated to cost around 5.4 million euro, the bulk of which was due to 3.1 million euro in staffing costs at the partner institutions and 1 million in costs for sub-contracted digitisation. (The bulk of digitisation was carried out in-house.)

Material from "Collections" was released to the Europeana site as it was digitised and uploaded, with the first collections (newspapers from Austria and photographs/magazines from Italy) released in March 2012. The first public events to showcase these digitised collections began in 2013, continuing through release in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/events/|title=Europeana Collections 1914–1918: Events|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public "Europeana 1914–18" project opened for online submissions and began the first public roadshow events in March 2011. These events invited members of the public to bring physical artefacts or documents to be digitised, and to record information or stories connected to them. 51 sessions were run across Europe up to December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-1914-1918|title=Europeana 1914–1918: Background|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public initiative used the Community Collection Model founded by Stuart Lee and Kate Lindsay at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Stuart|last2=Lindsay|first2=Kate|title=If You Build It, They Will Scan: Oxford University’s Exploration of Community Collections|journal=Educause Quarterly|date=30 July 2009|volume=32|issue=2|url=http://er.educause.edu/en/Articles/2009/7/If-You-Build-It-They-Will-Scan-Oxford-Universitys-Exploration-of-Community-Collections|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used for [http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/ The Great War Archive]. The University of Oxford was a partner in Europeana 1914–1918, providing support in the development of the online platform and training to all institutions running roadshow events.

==Release and reception==
[[File:Hitlertextcard.jpg|thumb|A postcard sent by [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1916, digitised at a public roadshow in 2012.]]

The main public-facing portal for the overall project (&lt;tt&gt;europeana1914-18.eu&lt;/tt&gt;) was launched at the [[Berlin State Library]] on 29 January 2014 by [[Monika Grütters]], the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media. At the time of launch, the site had around 400,000 digitised items from the partner institutions, alongside 90,000 "personal" items and 660 hours of film.&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradley|first=Phil|url=http://www.infotoday.eu/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Europeana-1914-1918-the-untold-stories-and-offical-histories-94710.aspx |title=Europeana 1914–1918: the untold stories and official histories|work=Information Today|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public reaction to the collections has often highlighted individual items or small collections. For example, digitised correspondence from the British Library's [[India Office]] collections has been used to highlight the involvement of Indian soldiers, particularly on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/21/found-translation-indias-first-world-war|title=The last post: letters home to India during the first world war|first=Daljit|last=Nagra|date=21 February 2014|work=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/india/the-forgotten-indian-soldiers-of-wwis-european-battlefields|date=9 March 2014|title=The forgotten Indian soldiers of WWI's European battlefields|first=Samanth|last=Subramanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early find during the public digitisation project was a postcard (''right'') sent by [[Adolf Hitler]] to a fellow soldier while recuperating in hospital, which attracted a great deal of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News Online|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17908150|title=Hitler postcard found in World War I project|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fear and Bullets''''' is an album created through a collaboration between [[James O'Barr]] and longtime friend [[John Bergin]] as a [[soundtrack]] to O'Barr's [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Crow]]''. It was originally released in 1994 along with a limited edition hardcover copy of the graphic novel.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Trust-Obey-Fear-And-Bullets/release/361632|title=Trust Obey - Fear And Bullets|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release also coincided with the publicity received from [[The Crow (1994 film)|the film]].

In 1999, ''Fear and Bullets'' was re-released with a new cover, almost all the songs completely re-recorded or remixed, and the addition of two new tracks (but other two were removed).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Trust-Obey-Fear-And-Bullets/release/260068|title=Trust Obey - Fear And Bullets|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release included previously unreleased drawings by O'Barr.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

A '''first-person narrative''' is a [[narrative mode|mode of storytelling]] in which a narrator relays events from their own [[Narration#Narrative point of view|point of view]] using the [[grammatical person|first person ]] {{no wrap| i.e. "I" or "we", etc.}}&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview: First-person narrative|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095820156|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be narrated by a first person [[protagonist]] (or other [[focal character]]), first person re-teller, first person witness,&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; or first person peripheral (also called a peripheral narrator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Literature Glossary - First-person Narration|url=http://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/first-person-narration.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanzel1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanzel, F.K.|title=A Theory of Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvs3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=13 March 1986|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-31063-5|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of a first person protagonist narrator is [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847),&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; in which the [[title character]] is also the narrator telling her own story,&lt;ref name=schmoop1&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Eyre Narrator Point of View|url=http://www.shmoop.com/jane-eyre/narrator-point-of-view.html|website=Shmoop|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examples of Writing in First Person|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-writing-in-first-person.html#OlI0VVEcAI4abdEW.99|website=YourDictionary|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This device allows the audience to see the narrator's [[mind's eye]] view of the [[fictional universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evers|first1=Stuart|title=The dangers of first-person narrative|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/may/13/thedangersoffirstpersonnar|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is limited to the narrator's experiences and awareness of the true state of affairs. In some stories, first-person narrators may relay dialogue with other characters or refer to information they heard from the other characters, in order to try to deliver a larger point of view.&lt;ref name=schmoop1/&gt; Other stories may switch the narrator to different characters to introduce a broader perspective. An [[unreliable narrator]] is one that has completely lost credibility due to ignorance, poor insight, personal biases, mistakes, dishonesty, etc., which challenges the reader's initial assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiehardt|first1=Ginny|title=How to Recognize and Create an Unreliable Narrator|url=https://www.thebalance.com/the-unreliable-narrator-in-fiction-1277141|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=The Balance|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point of view device==
The telling of a story in the grammatical first person, i.e. from the perspective of "I." An example would be [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', which begins "Call me Ishmael."&lt;ref name=Perdue&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/terms/firstperson.html "First Person Narration", Perdue University College of Liberal Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narration often includes an embedded listener or reader, who serves as the audience for the tale.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt; First-person narrations may be told by a person directly undergoing the events in the story without being aware of conveying that experience to readers; alternatively, the narrator may be conscious of telling the story to a given audience, perhaps at a given place and time, for a given reason.

===Identity===
A story written in the first person can be told by the main character, a less important character witnessing events, or a person retelling a story they were told by someone else. This point of view is often effective in giving a sense of closeness to the character.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Point of View and Narrative Voice|url=http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/fiction/pov.html|website=Literary Analysis|publisher=Ohio University|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability===
First-person narration presents the narrative through the perspective of a particular character. The reader or audience becomes aware of the events and characters of the story through the narrator's views and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://signbook.persiangig.com/document/literature/theory/raavi1.pdf Ranjbar Vahid. ''The Narrator'', Iran:Baqney. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As a participant in events, the conscious narrator, is an imperfect witness by definition, unable to fully see and comprehend events in their entirety as they unfurl, not necessarily objective in their inner thoughts or sharing them fully, and furthermore may be pursuing some hidden agenda. In some cases, the narrator may give or withhold information based on his own experience.

Character weaknesses and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration is how much time has elapsed between when the character experienced the events of the story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. Are they just trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. [[Unreliable narrators]] are not uncommon.

In the first-person-plural [[Narrative mode|point of view]], narrators tell the story using "we". That is, no individual speaker is identified; the narrator is a member of a group that acts as a unit. The first-person-plural point of view occurs rarely but can be used effectively, sometimes as a means to increase the concentration on the character or characters the story is about. Examples include:

* [[William Faulkner]]'s short story "[[A Rose for Emily]]" (Faulkner was an avid experimenter in using unusual points of view; see also his ''[[Spotted Horses]]'', told in third person plural).
* [[Frank B. Gilbreth]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]'s memoir ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]''.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "Crate."
* [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[Man Plus]]''.
* [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s ''[[The Virgin Suicides]]''.
* [[Karen Joy Fowler]]'s ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club]]''.
* [[Joshua Ferris]]'s ''[[Then We Came to the End]]''.
* [http://thenormalschool.com/fiction/ Heidi Vornbrock Roosa's short story "Our Mother Who Art."]

Other examples include ''[[Twenty-Six Men and a Girl]]'' by [[Maxim Gorky]], ''The Treatment of Bibi Haldar'' by [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], ''During the Reign of the Queen of Persia'' by [[Joan Chase]], ''Our Kind'' by [[Kate Walbert]], ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], and ''We Didn't'' by [[Stuart Dybek]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E3DF1538F93BA25757C0A9629C8B63|title=We the Characters|publisher=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-25|date=April 18, 2004 | first=Laura | last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-person narrators can also be multiple, as in [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s ''[[In a Grove]]'' (the source for the movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'') and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner's]] novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. Each of these sources provides different accounts of the same event, from the point of view of various first-person narrators.

There can also be multiple co-principal characters as narrator, such as in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The first chapter introduces four characters, including the initial narrator, who is named at the beginning of the chapter. The narrative continues in subsequent chapters with a different character explicitly identified as the narrator for that chapter. Other characters later introduced in the book also have their "own" chapters where they narrate the story for that chapter. The story proceeds in linear fashion, and no event occurs more than once, i.e. no two narrators speak "live" about the same event.

The first-person narrator may be the principal character or one who closely observes the principal character (see [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' or [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', each narrated by a minor character). These can be distinguished as "first person major" or "first person minor" points of view.

The narrator can be the [[protagonist]] (e.g., [[Lemuel Gulliver|Gulliver]] in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''), someone very close to him who is privy to his thoughts and actions ([[Dr. Watson]] in [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories), or an ancillary character who has little to do with the action of the story (such as Nick Carraway in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''). Narrators can report others' narratives at one or more removes. These are called "frame narrators": examples are Mr. Lockwood, the narrator in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' by [[Emily Brontë]]; and the unnamed narrator in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. Skilled writers choose to skew narratives, in keeping with the narrator's character, to an arbitrary degree, from ever so slight to extreme. For example, the aforementioned Mr. Lockwood is quite naive, of which fact he appears unaware, simultaneously rather pompous, and recounting a combination of stories, experiences, and servants' gossip. As such, his character is an unintentionally very unreliable narrator, and serves mainly to mystify, confuse, and ultimately leave the events of Wuthering Heights open to a great range of interpretations.

A rare form of first person is the first person omniscient, in which the narrator is a character in the story, but also knows the thoughts and feelings of all the other characters. It can seem like third person omniscient at times. A reasonable explanation fitting the mechanics of the story's world is generally provided or inferred, unless its glaring absence is a major plot point. Two notable examples are ''[[The Book Thief]]'' by [[Markus Zusak]], where the narrator is [[Death]], and ''[[The Lovely Bones]]'' by [[Alice Sebold]], where a young girl, having been killed, observes, from some post-mortem, [[Out-of-body experience|extracorporeal]] viewpoint, her family struggling to cope with her disappearance. Typically, however, the narrator restricts the events relayed in the narrative to those that could reasonably be known. Novice writers may make the mistake of allowing elements of omniscience into a first-person narrative unintentionally and at random, forgetting the inherent human limitations of a witness or participant of the events.

==Autobiography==
In [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]], the first person narrator is the character of the author (with varying degrees of historical accuracy). The narrator is still distinct from the author and must behave like any other character and any other first person narrator. Examples of this kind of narrator include [[Jim Carroll]] in ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]'' and [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]] in ''[[Timequake]]'' (in this case, the first-person narrator is also the author). In some cases, the narrator is writing a book—"the book in your hands"—and therefore he has most of the powers and knowledge of the author. Examples include ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' by [[Umberto Eco]], and ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' by [[Mark Haddon]]. Another example is a fictional "Autobiography of James T. Kirk"  which was "Edited" by David A. Goodman who was the actual writer of that book and playing the part of James Kirk (Gene Roddenberry's '''Star Trek''') as he wrote the novel.

==Detective fiction==
Since the narrator is within the story, he or she may not have knowledge of all the events. For this reason, first-person narrative is often used for [[detective fiction]], so that the reader and narrator uncover the case together. One traditional approach in this form of fiction is for the main detective's principal assistant, the "Watson", to be the narrator: this derives from the character of [[Doctor Watson|Dr Watson]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

==Forms==
First-person narratives can appear in several forms; interior monologue, as in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Notes from Underground]]''; dramatic monologue, also in [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]''; or explicitly, as [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]].''

Other forms include temporary first-person narration as a [[story within a story]], wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character.

==Styles==
With a first person narrative it is important to consider how the story is being told, i.e., is the character writing it down, telling it out loud, thinking it to themselves? And if they are writing it down, is it something meant to be read by the public, a private diary, or a story meant for one other person? The way the first person narrator is relating the story will affect the language used, the length of sentences, the tone of voice and many other things. A story presented as a secret diary could be interpreted much differently than a public statement.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

First-person narratives can tend towards a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|Interior monologue]], as in [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The whole of the narrative can itself be presented as a [[false document]], such as a diary, in which the narrator makes explicit reference to the fact that he is writing or telling a story. This is the case in [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. As a story unfolds, narrators may be aware that they are telling a story and of their reasons for telling it. The audience that they believe they are addressing can vary. In some cases, a [[frame story]] presents the narrator as a character in an outside story who begins to tell his own story, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

First-person narrators are often [[unreliable narrator]]s since a narrator might be impaired (such as both Quentin and Benjy in Faulkner's ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''), lie (as in ''[[The Quiet American]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], or ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' series by [[Gene Wolfe]]), or manipulate their own memories intentionally or not (as in ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' by [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], or in [[Ken Kesey]]'s [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'']]). [[Henry James]] discusses his concerns about "the romantic privilege of the 'first person'" in his preface to ''[[The Ambassadors]]'', calling it "the darkest abyss of [[Romanticism|romance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goetz |first=William R. |title=Henry James and the Darkest Abyss of Romance |year=1986 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=0-8071-1259-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=35807&amp;pageno=11 ''The Ambassadors'' (p. 11) on Project Gutenberg] Accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a multi-level narrative structure is [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which has a double framework: an unidentified "I" (first person singular) narrator relates a boating trip during which another character, Marlow, uses first person to tell a story that comprises the majority of the work. Within this nested story, it is mentioned that another character, Kurtz, told Marlow a lengthy story; however, its content is not revealed to readers. Thus, there is an "I" narrator introducing a storyteller as "he" (Marlow), who talks about himself as "I" and introduces another storyteller as "he" (Kurtz), who in turn presumably told his story from the perspective of "I".

==Film==
First person narration is more difficult to achieve in film; however, voice-over narration can create the same structure.&lt;ref name=Perdue/&gt;

The '''Government College of Art &amp; Craft''' in [[Kolkata]] is one of the oldest Art colleges in India. It was founded on August 16, 1854 at Garanhata, [[Chitpur]], "with the purpose of establishing an institution for teaching the youth of all classes, industrial art based on scientific methods." as the School of Industrial Art. The institute was later renamed as the Government School of Art and in 1951 it became the Government College of Art &amp; Craft.&lt;ref name=bagal&gt;Bagal, Jogesh Chandra (1966). ''History of the Govt. College of Art and Craft'' in the ''Centenary: Government College of Art &amp; Craft, Calcutta'', Calcutta: Government College of Art &amp; Craft, pp. 1–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The school opened on August 16, 1854 at Garanhata as a private art school. The school was shifted to the building of [[Mutty Lall Seal]] in Colootola in November, 1854. In 1859, Garick joined as Head Teacher. In 1864, it was taken over by the government and on June 29, 1864 [[Henry Hover Locke]] joined as its principal. It was soon renamed as the Government School of Art. Locke made a comprehensive scheme of Curriculum of studies for the institution. The venue of the school was shifted to 166, Bowbazar Street in the 1880s. After the death of Locke on December 25, 1885 M. Schaumburg became the new principal. A new post of an Assistant Principal was created and on January 29, 1886 an Italian artist O. Ghilardi joined the post. In February, 1892 the institute was shifted to its present site adjacent to the [[Indian Museum]]. After the death of its principal, Jobbins [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] joined the school as its principal on July 6, 1896.&lt;ref name=bagal/&gt;

===Havell, Brown and Abanindranath===
[[Ernest Binfield Havel]] was the principal from 1896 to 1905. He attempted to reform teaching to emphasise Indian traditions, leading to the emergence of the style known as the [[Bengal school of art]]. [[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] was the next principal, who took over from the officiating Principal Abanindranath Tagore on January 12, 1909. He served as Principal up to 1927.&lt;ref name=bagal/&gt; From August 15, 1905 to 1915, [[Abanindranath Tagore]] was the Vice-Principal of the college, and worked towards developing an ''Indian style of Art'', which gave birth to the [[Bengal school of art]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624035401/http://www.indiaeducation.ernet.in/insitutions/PROFILE.ASP?no=U00336 Govt. College of Art and Craft]. indiaeducation.ernet.in&lt;/ref&gt; an agenda that was to be pursued at the [[Kala Bhavan]], [[Shantiniketan]].

===Mukul Dey as principal===
On July 11, 1928 [[Mukul Chandra Dey]] became the principal. In October 1931, it started its quarterly magazine, ''Our Magazine'', which published the reproductions of the works of its students and the faculty. Mukul Dey was Principal of the institute till 1943.&lt;ref name=bagal/&gt;

===Chintamoni Kar as principal===
For a long period in the 60s and 70s, the it was headed by [[Chintamoni Kar]], who was appointed Principal on August 1, 1956.&lt;ref name=bagal/&gt;

The '''''Gualino Madonna''''' is a painting attributed to Italian late medieval artist [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Duccio|publisher=Silvana Editore|year=2003|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Galleria Sabauda]] of Turin, northern Italy.

==History==
The provenance of the panel is unknown. In 1910 it was sold on the Florence antiquary market covered by a 16th-century repainting, which was removed in 1920. In 1925 it was acquired by the Turinese entrepreneur and collector [[Riccardo Gualino]] who, in 1930, gave it to the Galleria Sabauda. In 1933-1959 it was in London, after which it returned to the Turinese museum.

The work is not signed, and has been attributed, among the others, to [[Cimabue]]. Now it is unanimously assigned to Duccio, belonging to his early career, when he was influenced by Cimabue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">'''Judenporzellan''' (literally "Jewish Porcelain") is a designation for inferior [[porcelain]] produced by the [[Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin|Royal Porcelain Factory]] owned by [[Frederick the Great]] in the late 18th century. In order to increase business, he decreed in 1769 that a tax on Jews in the form of coerced purchases from his factory would be levied on Jews in order to obtain marriage, death, business and other certificates and permits (Glueck 1998). Some accounts claim that the twenty porcelain monkeys belonging to the heirs of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] (1729–1786) are Judenporzellan (Hartmann 2006), although some authorities doubt the authenticity of these family stories based on chronology and provenance—at least one of the monkeys is of [[Meissen]] manufacture (Todd 2003).

The cuteness culture, or ''kawaii'' aesthetic, has become a prominent aspect of [[Japanese popular culture]], entertainment, [[Japanese street fashion|clothing]], [[Japanese cuisine|food]], toys, personal appearance and mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Lee, "[http://uniorb.com/ATREND/Japanwatch/cute.htm Inside Look at Japanese Cute Culture]" (September 1, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
[[File:Kawaii lolita manga.jpg|thumb|left|Cute manga drawing using kawaii basis (illustration by Daya Wyrd)]]
The word ''kawaii'' originally derives from the phrase {{lang|ja|[[:wikt:顔映し|顔映し]]}} ''kao hayushi'', which literally means "(one's) face (is) aglow," commonly used to refer to flushing or blushing of the face. The second morpheme is [[cognate]] with ''-bayu'' in [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9C%A9%E3%81%84 ''mabayui''] (眩い, 目映い, or 目映ゆい) "dazzling, glaring, blinding, too bright; dazzlingly beautiful" (''ma-'' is from 目 ''me'' "eye") and ''-hayu'' in ''omohayui'' (面映い or 面映ゆい) "embarrassed/embarrassing, awkward, feeling self-conscious/making one feel self-conscious" (''omo-'' is from 面 ''omo'', an archaic word for "face, looks, features; surface; image, semblance, vestige"). Over time, the meaning changed into the modern meaning of "cute", and the pronunciation changed to {{lang|ja|かわゆい}} ''kawayui'' and then to the modern {{lang|ja|かわいい}} ''kawaii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:かわいい|work = 語源由来辞典 (Dictionary of Etymology) |language=Japanese|url=http://gogen-allguide.com/ka/kawaii.html |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛い|work = デジタル大辞泉 (Digital Daijisen) |language=Japanese|url=http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/46843/m0u/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84/ |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛いとは|work = 大辞林第3版(Daijirin 3rd Ed.) |language=Japanese|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84 |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly written in [[hiragana]], {{lang|ja|かわいい}}, but the [[ateji]], {{lang|ja|可愛い}}, has also been appended. The [[kanji]] in the ateji literally translates to "able to be loved, can/may love, lovable."

==History==
===Original definition===
[[File:JapaneseSchoolGirl-Sobuline-2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] girl, identified by her shortened skirt. The soft bag and teddy bear that she carries are part of ''kawaii''.]]
The original definition of ''kawaii'' came from Lady Murasaki's ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', where it referred to pitiable qualities.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; During the Shogunate period under the ideology of neo-Confucianism, women came to be included under the term ''kawaii'' as the perception of women being animalistic was replaced with the conception of women as docile.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; However, the earlier meaning survives in the modern Standard Japanese adjectival noun かわいそう ''kawaisō'' (often written with ''ateji'' as 可哀相 or 可哀想) "piteous, pitiable, arousing compassion, poor, sad, sorry" (etymologically from 顔映様 "face / projecting, reflecting, or transmitting light, flushing, [[blushing]] / seeming, appearance"). Forms of ''kawaii'' and its derivatives ''kawaisō'' and ''kawairashii'' (with the suffix ''-rashii'' "-like, -ly") are used in modern dialects to mean "embarrassing/embarrassed, shameful/ashamed" or "good, nice, fine, excellent, superb, splendid, admirable" in addition to the standard meanings of "adorable" and "pitiable."

===Cute handwriting===
The rise of [[cuteness]] in [[Japanese culture]] emerged in the 1970s as part of a new style of writing.&lt;ref name="kinsella"&gt;Kinsella, Sharon. 1995. "Cuties in Japan" [http://www.kinsellaresearch.com/new/Cuties%20in%20Japan.pdf] accessed August 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many teenage girls began to write laterally using [[mechanical pencil]]s.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional [[Japanese writing]] that varied in thickness and was vertical.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; The girls would also write in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

These pictures would be inserted randomly and made the writing difficult to read.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; As a result, this writing style caused a lot of controversy and was banned in many schools.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; During the 1980s, however, this new "cute" writing was adopted by [[magazines]] and [[comics]] and was put onto packaging and advertising.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

From 1984 to 1986, {{nihongo|Kazuma Yamane|山根一眞|Yamane Kazuma}} studied the development of cute handwriting, which he called Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting, in depth.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; This type of cute Japanese handwriting has also been called: {{nihongo|marui ji|[[:wikt:丸い|丸い]][[:wikt:字|字]]}}, meaning "round writing", {{nihongo|koneko ji|[[:wikt:小猫|小猫]]字}}, meaning "kitten writing", {{nihongo|manga ji|[[:wikt:漫画|漫画]]字}}, meaning "comic writing", and {{nihongo|burikko ji|[[:wikt:鰤|鰤]][[:wikt:子|子]]字}}, meaning "fake-child writing".&lt;ref&gt;Skov, L. (1995). Women, media, and consumption in [[Japan]]. Hawai'i Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was commonly thought that the writing style was something that teenagers had picked up from [[comics]], he found that teenagers had come up with the style themselves, spontaneously, as an underground trend. His conclusion was based on an observation that cute handwriting predates the availability of technical means for producing rounded writing in comics.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

===Cute merchandise===
[[File:Japanese kawaii doll.jpg|thumb|left|''Kawaii'' doll]]
{{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of Cool Japan, says cute fashion in Japan can be traced back to the [[Edo period]] with the popularity of [[netsuke]].&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;''TheAge.Com:'' "Japan smitten by love of cute" http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/cool-or-infantile/2006/06/18/1150569208424.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this growing trend, companies such as [[Sanrio]] came out with merchandise like [[Hello Kitty]]. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as [[Gudetama]] and [[Aggretsuko]]. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks in addition to their cute aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Breed of Kawaii – Characters Who Get Us|url=https://www.umamibrain.com/single-post/2017/09/18/The-New-Breed-of-Kawaii-%25E2%2580%2593-Characters-Who-Get-Us|website=UmamiBrain|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as [[Seiko Matsuda]], who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124094006/http://jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }} URL accessed February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Asia'': Young Japan: She's a material girl http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990503/style1.html&lt;/ref&gt; No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.

==Aesthetics==
[[File:Girls in Harajuku --- Kawaii?.jpg|thumb|Kawaii styled luggage]]
{{nihongo|Soichi Masubuchi|増淵宗一|Masubuchi Sōichi}}, in his work ''Kawaii Syndrome'', claims "cute" and "neat" have taken precedence over the former Japanese aesthetics of "beautiful" and "refined".&lt;ref name="Shiokawa"&gt;Shiokawa. "Cute But Deadly: Women and Violence in Japanese Comics". ''Themes and Issues in Asian Cartooning: Cute, Cheap, Mad and Sexy''. Ed. John A. Lent. Bowling Green, Kentucky: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1999. 93–125. {{ISBN|0-87972-779-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural phenomenon, [[cuteness]] is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of [[Japanese culture]] and national identity. {{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of ''[[Cool Japan]]'', believes that "cuteness" is rooted in Japan's harmony-loving culture, and {{nihongo|Nobuyoshi Kurita|栗田経惟|Kurita Nobuyoshi}}, a sociology professor at [[Musashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], has stated that "cute" is a "magic term" that encompasses everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan.&lt;ref name=ap2006&gt;Quotes and paraphrases from: {{cite news|title=Cuteness a hot-selling commodity in Japan|author=Yuri Kageyama|date=June 14, 2006|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061401122.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender performance===
Japanese women who feign kawaii behaviors (e.g., high-pitched voice, squealing giggles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merry White|title=The material child: coming of age in Japan and America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vom1N-653voC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=29 September 1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08940-2|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that could be viewed as forced or inauthentic are called ''[[burikko]]'' and this is considered a [[Gender performativity|gender performance]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;"You are doing ''burikko''!: Censoring/scrutinizing artificers of cute femininity in Japanese," Laura Miller in ''Japanese Language, Gender, and Ideology: Cultural Models and Real People'', edited by Janet Shibamoto Smith and Shigeko Okamoto, Oxford University Press, 2004. In Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neologism]] developed in the 1980s, perhaps originated by comedian {{nihongo|Kuniko Yamada|山田邦子|Yamada Kuniko}}.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Physical attractiveness===
In Japan, being cute is acceptable for both men and women. A trend existed of men shaving their legs to mimic the [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. Japanese women often try to act cute to attract men.&lt;ref name="Bremmer" /&gt; A study by Kanebo, a cosmetic company, found that Japanese women in their 20s and 30s favored the "cute look" with a "childish round face".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt; Women also employ a look of innocence in order to further play out this idea of cuteness. Having large eyes is one aspect that exemplifies innocence; therefore many Japanese women attempt to alter the size of their eyes. To create this illusion, women may wear large [[contact lens]]es, [[false eyelashes]], dramatic eye makeup, and even have an [[East Asian blepharoplasty]], commonly known as double eyelid surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=RiRi|first=Madame|title=Some Japanese customs that may confuse foreigners.|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/some-japanese-customs-that-may-confuse-foreigners|publisher=Japan Today|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idols===
[[File:Japan Expo 2012 (3).jpg|thumb|[[Momoiro Clover Z]] performing at [[Japan Expo]]]]
{{nihongo|[[Japanese idol|Idols]]|アイドル|aidoru}} are media personalities in their teens and twenties who are considered particularly attractive or cute and who will, for a period ranging from several months to a few years, regularly appear in the mass media, e.g. as singers for [[Pop music|pop]] groups, bit-part actors, TV personalities (''[[tarento]]''), models in photo spreads published in magazines, advertisements, etc. (But not every young celebrity is considered an idol. Young celebrities who wish to cultivate a rebellious image, such as many rock musicians, reject the "idol" label.) [[Speed (Japanese band)|Speed]], [[Morning Musume]], [[AKB48]], and [[Momoiro Clover Z]] are examples of popular idol groups in Japan during the 2000s &amp; 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/aj201208290008 |title=Momoiro Clover Z dazzles audiences with shiny messages of hope |work=[[The Asahi Shimbun]] |date=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024003154/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201208290008 |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cute fashion===
====Lolita====
[[File:Pink gothlolita.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sweet Lolita]] fashion in Japan]]
[[Lolita fashion]] is a very well-known and recognizable style in Japan. Based on Victorian fashion and the [[Rococo]] period, girls mix in their own elements along with gothic style to achieve the porcelain-doll look.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls who dress in Lolita fashion try to look cute, innocent, and beautiful.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"/&gt; This look is achieved with lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holson|first=Laura|title=Gothic Lolitas: Demure vs. Dominatrix|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweet Lolita]] is a subset of Lolita fashion that includes even more ribbons, bows, and lace, and is often fabricated out of pastels and other light colors. Another subset of Lolita fashion related to "sweet Lolita" is Fairy Kei. Head-dresses such as giant bows or bonnets are also very common, while lighter make-up is also used to achieve a more natural look. Curled hair extensions, sometimes accompanied by eyelash extensions, are also popular in helping with the baby doll look.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emmeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes such as fruits, flowers and sweets are often used as patterns on the fabrics used for dresses. Purses often go with the themes and are shaped as hearts, strawberries, or stuffed animals. ''Baby, the Stars Shine Bright'' is one of the more popular clothing stores for this style and often carries themes. Mannerisms are also important to many Sweet Lolitas. Sweet Lolita is not only a fashion, but also a lifestyle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is evident in the 2004 film ''[[Kamikaze Girls]]'' where the main Lolita character, Momoko, drinks only tea and eats only sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitani|first=Koki|title=Kamikaze Girls|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416220/|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decora====
[[File:Rainbow Decora.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Decora fashion]]
Decora is a style that is characterized by wearing lots of "decorations" on oneself. It is considered to be self-decoration. The goal of this fashion is to become as vibrant and characterized as possible. People who take part in this fashion trend wear accessories such as multicolor hair pins, bracelets, rings, necklaces, etc. By adding on multiple layers of accessories on an outfit, the fashion trend tends to have a childlike appearance. It also includes toys and multicolor clothes.

====Kawaii men====
Although kawaii is typically a female-dominated fashion, there are men who decide to partake in this trend. Some men decide to transform themselves into women, more specifically kawaii women. They are able to transform themselves by wearing wigs, false eyelashes, applying makeup, and wearing kawaii female clothing.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suzuki |first=Kirin |title=Makeup Changes Men |url=http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |publisher=Tokyo Kawaii, Etc |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100514/http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen predominately in male entertainers, such as Torideta-san, a DJ who transforms himself into a kawaii woman when working at his nightclub.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

Japanese pop stars and actors often have longer hair, such as [[Takuya Kimura]] of [[SMAP]]. Men are also noted as often aspiring to a [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. While it doesn't quite fit the exact specifications of what cuteness means for females, men are certainly influenced by the same societal mores - to be attractive in a specific sort of way that the society finds acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennette|first=Colette|title=It's all Kawaii: Cuteness in Japanese Culture|url=http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/18/its-all-kawaii-cuteness-in-japanese-culture/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way both Japanese men and women conform to the expectations of Kawaii in some way or another.

===Products===
The concept of ''kawaii'' has had an influence on a variety of products, including candy, such as [[Hi-Chew]], [[Koala's March]] and [[Hello Panda]]. Cuteness can be added to products by adding cute features, such as hearts, flowers, stars and rainbows. Cute elements can be found almost everywhere in Japan, from big business to corner markets and national government, ward, and town offices.&lt;ref name="Bremmer"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-06-24/in-japan-cute-conquers-all ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', "In Japan, Cute Conquers All"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cute Inc."&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/cute.html | title= Cute Inc.| publisher=WIRED|date=December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies, large and small, use cute mascots to present their wares and services to the public. For example:
[[File:Ana.b747.pokemon.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[Pokémon Jet|All Nippon Airways Boeing 747 with a Pokémon livery]]]]
[[File:JNR C11 227 20140824 001.jpg|thumb|[[JNR Class C11]] locomotive repainted as [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], Japan, 2014]]
* [[Pikachu]], a character from ''[[Pokémon]],'' adorns the side of ten [[All Nippon Airways|ANA]] passenger jets, the [[Pokémon Jet]]s.
* [[Resona Holdings|Asahi Bank]] used [[Miffy]] (Nijntje), a character from a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] series of children's picture books, on some of its ATM and credit cards.
* The [[prefectures of Japan]], as well as many cities and cultural institutions, have cute [[mascot]] characters known as [[yuru-chara]] to promote tourism. [[Kumamon]], the [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] mascot, and [[Hikonyan]], the city of [[Hikone]] mascot, are among the most popular.&lt;ref name="Top Ten Japanese Character Mascots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingfukuoka.com/2012/01/13/top-ten-japanese-character-mascots/ |title=Top Ten Japanese Character Mascots |publisher=Finding Fukuoka |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Japan Post]] "Yū-Pack" mascot is a stylized mailbox;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post.japanpost.jp/navi/main.htm Japan Post site showing mailbox mascot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221113156/http://www.post.japanpost.jp/navi/main.htm |date=2006-02-21 }} URL accessed April 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; they also use other cute mascot characters to promote their various services (among them the Postal Savings Bank) and have used many such on postage stamps.
* Some [[police]] forces in Japan have their own [[moe (slang)|moe]] mascots, which sometimes adorn the front of [[kōban]] (police boxes).
* [[NHK]], the public broadcaster, has its own cute mascots. [[Domo (NHK)|Domokun]], the unique-looking and widely recognized NHK mascot, was introduced in 1998 and quickly took on a life of its own, appearing in [[Internet memes]] and fan art around the world.
* [[Sanrio]], the company behind [[Hello Kitty]] and other similarly cute characters, runs the [[Sanrio Puroland]] [[theme park]] in Tokyo, and painted on some [[EVA Air]] [[Airbus A330]] jets as well. Sanrio’s line of more than 50 characters takes in more than $1 billion a year and it remains the most successful company to capitalize on the cute trend.&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;

''Cute'' can be also used to describe a specific [[fashion|fashion sense]]&lt;ref name="Kwest"&gt;''Time Asia'': "Arts: Kwest For Kawaii".

Ruffles and pastel colors are commonly (but not always) featured, and accessories often include toys or bags featuring anime characters.&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;

====Non-''kawaii'' imports====
[[File:Kawaii goods.jpg|thumb|left|Kawaii goods outlet in 100 yen shop]]
There have been occasions in which popular Western products failed to meet the expectations of ''kawaii'', and thus did not do well in the Japanese market. For example, [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] dolls did not sell well in Japan, because the Japanese considered their facial features to be "ugly" and "grotesque" compared to the flatter and almost featureless faces of characters such as [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; Also, the doll [[Barbie]], portraying an adult woman, did not become successful in Japan compared to Takara's [[Licca-chan|Licca]], a doll that was modeled after an 11-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt;

Kawaii has gradually gone from a small subculture in Japan to an important part of Japanese modern culture as a whole. There is an overwhelming amount of modern items featuring kawaii themes, not only in Japan, but worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ (Research Paper) Kawaii: Culture of Cuteness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118001552/http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ |date=2013-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And characters associated with kawaii have an astounding popularity these days. We can see the "global cute" by the billion-dollar sellers like [[Pokémon]] and [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Roach, Mary. "Cute Inc." Wired Dec. 1999. 01 May 2005 https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/cute_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt; "Fueled by Internet subcultures, Hello Kitty alone has hundreds of entries on eBay, and is selling in more than 30 countries, including [[Argentina]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Taiwan]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Japan has become a powerhouse in the kawaii industry and images of [[Doraemon]], [[Hello Kitty]], [[Pikachu]], [[Sailor Moon]] and [[Hamtaro]] are popular in mobile phone accessories. However, Professor Tian Shenliang says that Japan's future is dependent on how much of an impact kawaii brings to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm 卡哇伊熱潮 扭轉日本文化&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301054943/http://epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm |date=2013-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Foreign Ministry has also recognized the power of cute merchandise and have sent three 18-year-old women overseas in the hopes of spreading Japanese culture around the world. The women are dressed in uniforms and maid costumes that are commonplace in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinataiwan.org/wh/sdgl/200904/t20090402_861472.htm|title=日本的"卡哇伊文化"_中国台湾网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii manga and magazines have brought tremendous profit to Japanese press industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.huanqiu.com/asia/2011-09/1969974_2.html|title=“萌文化”在日本大行其道_旅游_环球网|first=|last=王力|website=go.huanqiu.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the worldwide revenue from the computer game and its merchandising peripherals are closing in on $5 billion, according to a [[Nintendo]] press release titled "It's a Pokémon Planet".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Influence upon other cultures==
{{tone|section |date=July 2013}}
Kawaii products are seemingly gaining more popularity beyond the borders of Japan into other Asian markets, and it's seemingly becoming more popular in the [[United States|US]], especially among the young anime and manga fans as well as among those who are influenced by Japanese culture. Cute merchandise and products are especially popular in other parts of [[East Asia]], such as [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asian]] countries like the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90086?tid=relatedcl|title=Cute Power!|date=7 November 1999|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian Masuda, owner of 6%DOKIDOKI and a global advocate for kawaii influence, takes the quality from Harajuku to Western markets in his stores and artwork. The underlying belief of this Japanese designer is that "kawaii" actually saves the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Kataoka, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The infusion of kawaii into other world markets and cultures is achieved by introducing kawaii via modern art; audio, visual, and written media; and the fashion trends of Japanese youth, especially in high school girls.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"&gt;Tadao, T.

The dissemination of Japanese youth fashion and "kawaii culture" is usually associated with the Western society and trends set by designers borrowed or taken from Japan.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"/&gt; With the emergence of China, South Korea and Singapore as economic centers in Asia, the Kawaii merchandise and product popularity has shifted back to the East. In these Asian markets, the kawaii concept takes on various forms and different types of presentation depending on the target audience.

[[Taiwanese culture]], the government in particular, has embraced and elevated kawaii to a new level of social consciousness. The introduction of the A-Bian doll was seen as the development of a symbol to advance democracy and assist in constructing a collective imagination and national identity for Taiwanese people. The A-Bian dolls are kawaii likeness of sports figure, famous individuals, and now political figures that use kawaii images as a means of self-promotion and potential votes.&lt;ref&gt;[1]A-Bian Family. http://www.akibo.com.tw/home/gallery/mark/03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the A-Bian doll has allowed Taiwanese President Chen staffers to create a new culture where the "kawaii" image of a politician can be used to mobilize support and gain election votes.&lt;ref&gt;Chuang, Y. C. (2011, September). "Kawaii in Taiwan politics". ''International Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies'', 7(3). 1–16.

Japanese popular "kawaii culture" has had an effect on Singaporean youth. The emergence of Japanese culture can be traced back to the mid-1980s when Japan became one of the economic powers in the world. Kawaii has developed from a few children's television shows to an Internet sensation.&lt;ref&gt;[2]All things Kawaii. http://www.allthingskawaii.net/links/&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese media is used so abundantly in Singapore that youths are more likely to imitate the fashion of their Japanese idols, learn the Japanese language, and continue purchasing Japanese oriented merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Hao, X., Teh, L.L. (2004). "The impact of japanese popular culture on the Singaporean youth". ''Keio Communication Review'', 24. 17–32. Retrieved from: http://www.mediacom.keio.ac.jp/publication/pdf2004/review26/3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asian countries of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand either produce kawaii items for international consumption or have websites that cater for kawaii as part of the youth culture in their country. Kawaii has taken on a life of its own, spawning the formation of kawaii websites, kawaii home pages, kawaii browser themes and finally, kawaii social networking pages. While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things kawaii, artists and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme.&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"&gt;Rutledge, B. (2010, October). I love kawaii. ''Ibuki'' Magazine. 1–2. Retrieved from: http://ibukimagazine.com/lifestyle-/other-trends/212-i-love-kawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii has truly become "greater" than itself. The interconnectedness of today's world via the Internet has taken kawaii to new heights of exposure and acceptance, producing a kawaii "movement".&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"/&gt;

The Kawaii concept has become something of a global phenomenon. The aesthetic cuteness of Japan is very appealing to people globally. The wide popularity of Japanese kawaii is often credited with it being "culturally odorless". The elimination of exoticism and national branding has helped kawaii to reach numerous target audiences and span every culture, class, and gender group.&lt;ref&gt;Shearin, M. (2011, October). Triumph of kawaii. William &amp; Mary ideation. Retrieved from: http://www.wm.edu/research/ideation/ideation-stories-for-borrowing/2011/triumph-of-kawaii5221.php&lt;/ref&gt; The palatable characteristics of kawaii have made it a global hit, resulting in Japan's global image shifting from being known for [[Japanese rock garden|austere rock gardens]] to being known for "cute-worship".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

In 2014 the ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]] entered "kawaii" into their then latest edition, defining as a "Japanese artistic and cultural style that emphasizes the quality of cuteness, using bright colours and characters with a childlike appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/29761389|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Kawaii culture in the UK: Japan's trend for cute|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lead paragraph''' (sometimes shortened to '''lead'''; also spelled '''lede''') is the opening [[paragraph]] of an article, essay, book chapter, or other written work that summarizes its main ideas.&lt;ref name=mavensword20001128/&gt;

==Types of leads==
[[News style#Lead|Journalistic leads]] emphasize grabbing the attention of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peha &amp; Lester |title=Be a Writer: Your Guide to the Writing Life!: Proven Tips and Powerful Techniques to Help Young Writers Get Started |page=125 |publisher=Leverage Factory |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFMagLZx2vIC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=lede+newspaper&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=swajR-7mHI3azATIk7DzCA&amp;sig=01ouafTz7WfhQLt1up7epCRZ1JU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In journalism, the failure to mention the most important, interesting or attention-grabbing elements of a story in the first paragraph is sometimes called "burying the lead". Most standard news leads include brief answers to the questions of [[5 Ws|who, what, why, when, where, and how]] the key event in the story took place. In newspaper writing, the first paragraph that summarizes or introduces the story is also called the "blurb paragraph", "teaser text" or, in the United Kingdom, the "standfirst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spark |first1=David |last2=Harris |first2=Geoffrey |title=Practical Newspaper Reporting |date=2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |isbn=9781473903340 |pages=89, 90, 94, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leads in essays summarize the outline of the argument and conclusion that follows in the main body of the essay. [[Encyclopedia]] leads tend to define the subject matter as well as emphasize the interesting points of the article. [[feature story|Features]] and general articles in [[magazine]]s tend to be somewhere between journalistic and encyclopedian in style and often lack a distinct lead paragraph entirely. Leads and [[book]] [[foreword]]s vary enormously in length, intent and content.

==Other introductions==
In [[journalism]], there is the concept of an introductory or summary line or brief paragraph, located immediately above or below the headline, and typographically distinct from the body of the article.&lt;ref name=Standfirst&gt;{{cite web|title=Standfirst|url=http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/standfirst/|work=[[Double-Tongued Dictionary]]|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be referred with a variety of terms, including: the ''standfirst'' (UK),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''rider'',{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ''kicker'' (US),&lt;ref name=Standfirst/&gt; ''bank head(line)'', ''deck'', ''dek'', or ''subhead'' (US).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} (See {{slink|News style|Terms and structure}}.)

==Spelling==
The term is sometimes spelled "lede",&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lede |title=Lede |work=Merriam-Webster Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc |location=Chicago, IL, US |date=2012|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a claim it was a historical spelling intended to distinguish it from the [[homograph]] [[lead]], a metal commonly used in typesetting in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=mavensword20001128&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001128 |title=The Mavens' Word of the Day: lede |author="Carol" (author unidentifiable) |work=RandomHouse.com |at="Maven's Word of the Day" blog (defunct as of 2012) |publisher=Random House/Bertelsmann |location=New York |date=November 28, 2000 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219122848/http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20001128 |archivedate=19 February 2012 }}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the spelling "lede" first appears in journalism manuals in the [[1980]]s, well after lead typesetting's heyday.&lt;ref name=Owens20110918&gt;{{cite web|url=http://howardowens.com/lede-vs-lead/ |title=lede-vs-lead |author="Owens, Howard" |work=HowardOwens.com |publisher=Owens Press |location=New York |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=2016-06-28 |deadurl=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metz1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Metz|title=Newswriting: from lead to "30"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IxbAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-617514-8|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyons1965"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Martin Lyons|title=Reporting the news: selections from Nieman reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VuJZAAAAMAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyde2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant Milnor Hyde|title=Newspaper Editing - A Manual for Editors, Copyreaders and Students of Newspaper Desk Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9n381QZO_qYC|date=November 2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4437-2632-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl G.

This is a '''list of house types'''. [[House]]s can be built in a large variety of configurations. A basic division is between free-standing or [[Single-family houses]] and various types of attached or [[Multi-family residential|multi-user dwellings]]. Both may vary greatly in scale and amount of accommodation provided. Although there appear to be many different types, many of the variations listed below are purely matters of [[design|style]] rather than spatial arrangement or scale. Some of the terms listed are only used in some parts of the [[English-speaking world]].

* '''[[Duplex house]]''': commonly refers to two separate [[House|residences]], attached side-by-side, but the term is sometimes used to mean stacked apartments on two different floors (particularly in urban areas such as New York and San Francisco). (See [[#Two decker|Two decker]]) The duplex house often looks like either two [[house]]s put together, or as a large single home, and both legally and structurally, literally shares a wall between halves. The duplex home can appear as a single townhouse section with two different entrances, though the occasional duplex with a shared common entrance and entry hall have been constructed. The jargon terms "triplex" and "four-plex" are contrived names that refer to similar structures with three or four housing units, or floors if referring to apartments, and again the characteristic sharing of [[Load-bearing wall|structural walls]], as are the [[#Townhouse|townhouse]] and [[six pack (house)|six pack]] forms that adapted the savings in materials and costs of a shared load bearing wall.
{{anchor|Two family home|two-family house}}
* '''Two-family home''' or '''two-family house''': the generic American [[real estate business]] jargon for a small apartment house or a [[duplex house]] that contain two dwelling units. In advertisements, "two-family home" is the generally used jargon.
* '''[[#Two decker|Two decker]]''' (a Double decker building plan): since real-estate advertising generally specifies correctly whether the two-family home is a [[duplex (building)|duplex-house type]] these are usually more desirable for both rentals or purchases.

== Attached single-unit housing ==
* '''[[Byre-dwelling]]''': farmhouse with people and livestock under one roof.
* '''[[Connected farm]]''': type of farmhouse common in New England.
* '''[[Housebarn]]''': combined house and barn, see article for many types.

== Attached multi-unit housing ==
{{main|Multi-family residential}}

Specific terms under various American federal, state, or local laws dealing with fair housing, truth in advertising, and so forth, have been prescribed and engender specific legal meanings. For example, in American housing codes, all "apartments" must contain a kitchen, bathing facilities, and a sleeping area, or else that term may '''''not''''' be used. This generates various differences within the English-speaking world, and the terms such as "single-family", "two-family", or "three-family" building, residence, house, home, or property can be generic and thus convey little or no building plan (style of building) information. Such terminology is most common in advertising and real-estate markets that offer leasing of such units, or sales of such buildings.

* '''[[Apartment]]:''' a relatively self-contained housing unit in a building which is often rented out to one person or a family, or two or more people sharing a lease in a partnership, for their exclusive use. Sometimes called a ''flat'' or ''digs'' (slang). Some locales have legal definitions of what constitutes an apartment. In some locations, "apartment" denotes a building that was built specifically for such units, whereas "flat" denotes a unit in a building that had been originally built as a single-family house, but later on subdivided into some multi-unit house type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmentchicagoweb.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160800/http://apartmentchicagoweb.com/ |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dormitory-styling providing additional privacy has been found to promote the retention of trained personnel in the all-volunteer [[Armed Forces of the United States]].
* '''[[Basement apartment]]:''' an apartment located below street level, underneath another structure—usually an apartment building, but possibly a house or a business.
* '''[[Brownstone]]:''' a [[New York City]] term for a rowhouse: see [[rowhouse]].

The standard type contains a kitchenette or basic cooking facilities in a combined bedroom/living area, with a separate bathroom and lavatory shared between a number of rooms. Once common in older Victorian properties in British cities, they are less frequently found since the 1980s as a result of tenancy reforms, property prices and renovation grants that favour the refurbishment of such properties into self-contained flats for leasehold sale.
* '''[[Choultry]]:''' a South-Indian Hindu-[[Caravanserai]]
* '''Close:''' Term used in Glasgow for high density [[slum]] housing built 1800-1870.

There is a common stairway in the front and often in the back providing access to all the flats. 2-Flats and sometimes 3-flats are common in certain older neighborhoods.
* '''Four Plus One:''' an apartment building consisting of four stories above a parking lot. The four floors containing the apartment units are of wood-frame and masonry construction. It was particularly popular in [[Chicago]] during the 1960s and 1970s, especially on the city's north side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgottenchicago.com/features/defining-the-four-plus-one/ |title=Defining the Four Plus One &amp;#124; Forgotten Chicago &amp;#124; History, Architecture, and Infrastructure |publisher=Forgotten Chicago |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lofts created in such are locally supported by [[column]]s and [[bearing wall]]s and not part of the overall original load bearing structure.
* '''Maisonette:''' an apartment / flat on two levels with internal stairs, or which has its own entrance at street level.
* '''Mess:''' a building or flat with single bedroom per tenant and shared facilities like toilets and kitchens.

When board is provided (no longer common), a common dining time and schedule is imposed by the landlord who in such cases also serves as an [[innkeeper]] of sorts. In Australia and the United States, any housing accommodation with 4 or more bedrooms can be regarded as a rooming house if each bedroom is subject to individual tenancy agreements. In the U.S., rooming house lease agreements typically run for very short periods, usually week to week, or a few days at a time. Transient housing arrangements for longer term tenancies are implemented by a "rider" on a case by case basis, if local laws permit.
* '''[[Rowhouse]]''' (USA); also called "'''Terraced home'''" (USA); also called "'''Townhouse'''": 3 or more houses in a row sharing a "party" wall with its adjacent neighbour.

* '''Six-pack:''' in [[New England]] (USA), this refers to a [[stick-built]] block of 6 apartments comprising (duplexed) two three story [[#Triple decker|Triple decker]]s built side by side sharing one wall, a common roof, lot, yards (lawns and gardens, if any), parking arrangements, and basement, but possessing separately metered electric, and separate hot water and heating or air conditioning.

However this is also the UK term for a "rowhouse" regardless of whether the houses are identical or not.
** '''[[Back-to-back houses|Back-to-back]]:''' terraced houses which also adjoin a second terrace to the rear. They were a common form of housing for workers during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[England]].
* '''[[Tower block]]''' or '''Apartment tower''': a high-rise [[apartment building]].
* '''[[Townhouse]]:''' also called '''Rowhouse''' (US). In the UK, a townhouse is a traditional term for an upper class house in London (in contrast with [[country house]]), and is now coming into use as a term for new terraced houses, which are often three or more stories tall and may include a garage on the ground floor.

** {{anchor|Two decker}} '''Two decker:''' a two family house consisting of stacked apartments that frequently have similar or identical floor plans. Some two deckers, usually ones starting as single-family homes, have one or both floors sub-divided and are therefore three or four-family dwellings. Some have external stairways giving a totally separate entrance, and some, usually those which have been a single-family house now sub-divided, are similar to the ''Maisonette'' plan but sharing a common external 'main entrance' door and lock, and a main internal hall with stairways letting to the separate apartments. (For additional characteristics, also see [[#Multifamily home features|Multifamily home features]] below.)
* '''[[Tyneside flat]]:''' a pair of single-storey flats in a two-storey terrace, distinctively with two separate front doors to the street rather than a shared lobby. Notably found on [[Tyneside]], North Eastern England.

Operas were at first staged in the [[Provincial Theatre Building]] at [[Congress Square]], at the site of today's [[National Philharmonics Building]]. The Ljubljana Opera House was built in 1892. The Provincial Theatre ({{lang|sl|Deželno gledališče}}, the predecessor of the Ljubljana SNG Opera and Ballet, until 191 shared premises with the German Theatre ({{lang-de|Deutsches Theater}}), which then moved to the [[Ljubljana National Drama Theatre|Ljubljana Drama Theatre]].

[[File:Mary Delany (née Granville) by John Opie.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Mary Delany by [[John Opie]], 1782.]]

'''Mary A Delany''' (née '''Granville''') (14 May 1700 – 15 April 1788) was an English artist, letter-writer, and [[Blue Stockings Society (England)|Bluestocking]], equally famous for her "paper-mosaicks" and her lively correspondence.

==Early life==
Mary Delany was born at [[Coulston]], Wiltshire, the daughter of Colonel Bernard Granville by his marriage to Mary Westcombe, loyal [[Tory]] supporters of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart Crown]]. She was also a niece of [[George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne]], her father's brother.  Mary had one older brother, Bernard (1699), known as Bunny; a younger brother Bevil, born between 1702 and 1706, and a sister, Anne (1707).&lt;ref&gt;M. Peacock, 'Mrs Delany begins her life's work' in ''The Paper Garden'' (2010) beginning at p. 72; Dewes ( 1940)&lt;/ref&gt; When Mary was young, her parents moved the family to London, and Mary attended a school taught by a French refugee, Mademoiselle Puelle. Mary came into close contact with the Court when she was sent to live with her aunt, Lady Stanley, who was childless&lt;ref&gt;Dewes 1940, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; the intention being that she would eventually become a [[Maid of Honour]].&lt;ref name="hayden"&gt;Hayden, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

While living with Lady Stanley, Mary became learned in, "English, French, history, music, needlework and dancing..."&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt; Mary came in contact with [[Handel]] while at the household, listening to music he had composed; this contact with Handel would stay with Mary for the rest of her life; she was a close personal friend and loyal supporter of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;Dewes 1940, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's plans to become a [[lady in waiting]] were ruined by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s death in 1714, which led to a change in power, and a [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] on the throne, supported by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]s.  The Granvilles moved to a manor at [[Buckland, Gloucestershire|Buckland in Gloucestershire]], where they were quite isolated from English society.  However, Mary was able to continue her education and her pursuit of paper cutting, which had developed at an early age.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

Near the end of 1717 Mary was invited to stay with her uncle, Lord Lansdowne, in [[Wiltshire]].  She was introduced to [[Alexander Pendarves]] during this stay, and it soon became clear that her family had an interest in a marriage between the two.  Pendarves was Member of Parliament for [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]] and 60 years old, whereas Mary was just 17.  In February 1718 she was unhappily married to him, a marriage brought on by her parents' financial dependence on Lord Lansdowne, and Lord Lansdowne's hope to have political influence through the nuptials.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

==Married life==

The Pendarveses left for [[Roscrow Castle]] near [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in west [[Cornwall]] in April; once settled, Mrs Pendarves was able to enjoy the great views that Roscrow offered, and was able to get in quite a bit of riding.  Mr Pendarves's [[gout]] grew worse as the year progressed, and in the second year of their marriage, Mrs Pendarves was forced to nurse her ailing husband.  In 1721, the two took a house in London and there, though Mr Pendarves began to drink excessively, Mrs Pendarves was able to be reunited with many of her old friends.  In 1724, Mr Pendarves died suddenly in his sleep, leaving his young wife a widow.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt; Mr Pendarves had not altered his will after his marriage, and so Mrs Pendarves did not inherit what remained of his estate. "Mr. Pendarves, concerned with the bottle that allowed him to forget the loss of part of his fortune, had had no time to consider settling the rest of it on his wife."&lt;ref&gt;Dewes 1940, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her lack of resources, widowhood provided new opportunities for Mrs Pendarves.  Widows, unlike unmarried women, were able to move freely in society, and for the first time in her life, Mrs Pendarves was able to pursue her own interests without the oversight of any man.  Perhaps because of her own unhappy marriage, she was not satisfied with the options available to women in the 18th century. She wrote, {{quote|Why must women be ''driven to the necessity'' of marrying?  a state that should always be a matter of ''choice''!  and if a young woman has not fortune sufficient to maintain her in the situation she has been bred to, what can she do, but marry?"&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;}}  Mrs Pendarves was a very perceptive woman, "She judged everything and everybody for herself; and, while ridiculing all empty-headed or vain insipidity, whether fashionable or eccentric, was always ready to applaud the unusual, if sincere and worthy.  She was eager in the acquisition of knowledge of all kinds to the end of her life..."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, R. Brimley. ''Mrs. Delany'' (London: Stanley Paul &amp; Co. Ltd. 1925) p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because she had no home of her own, after her first husband's death, Mrs Pendarves spent time living with various relatives and friends. To begin with, she lived with her aunt and uncle Stanley, and after her aunt's death, she spent time in Ireland with the family of her friend Mrs Donellan.  In Ireland, Mrs Pendarves made the acquaintance of [[Patrick Delany (theologian)|Dr Patrick Delany]], an Irish clergyman who was already married to a rich widow. It was not until 1743, two years after the death of his first wife, that on a trip to London Dr Delany proposed to Mrs Pendarves, much to the dismay of her family.  She chose to take Dr Delany as her husband, and the two were married in June 1743.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

The Delanys passed a year in London before moving to [[Dublin]], where Dr Delany had a home. They also rented [[Mount Panther]] in [[County Down]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Kingsley |first=Nicholas |title=Annesley of Castlewellan, Mount Panther and Donard Lodge, Earls Annesley |publisher=Landed families of Britain and Ireland |date=14 November 2014 |url=https://landedfamilies.blogspot.com/2014/11/147-annesley-of-castlewellan-mount.html |accessdate=24 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during their first year in the house Patrick was made [[Dean of Down]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Cotton (divine) |title=Fasti Ecclesiæ Hibernicæ: The Succession of the Prelates and Members of the Cathedral Bodies in Ireland: Volume 3 |publisher=Hodges and Smith |year=1849 |location=Dublin |pages=228 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-cpW80vLPcC&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both husband and wife were very interested in botany and gardening: {{quote|"Their mutual pleasure in their garden at Delville near Dublin in particular, his encouragement of her gardening, painting, shell-work and needlework resulted in a surge of activity in a variety of media in all of which the basic theme was the flower, whether in stocking the Delville garden, painting garden landscapes, decorating interiors with shells, or working embroideries."&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  After twenty-five years of marriage, most of it spent in Ireland, Dr Delany died in Bath, England, on 6 May 1768 at the age of eighty-four, and Mrs Delany, now sixty-eight, found herself, once again, a widow.&lt;ref&gt;Paston, George. ''Mrs. Delany (Mary Granville): a memoir, 1700–1788'' (Edinburgh: G. Richards, 1900) p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

As a widow, Mary Delany spent even more of her time at [[Bulstrode Park|Bulstrode]], the home of her close friend, [[Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland|Margaret Bentinck, Dowager Duchess of Portland]]. The two shared a kinship in botany, often going out to look for specific specimens.  It was during her frequent stays at [[Bulstrode Park|Bulstrode]] with the Duchess that Mary became acquainted with two well-known botanists of the time [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander]].  This contact with the botanists only encouraged Mary's interest in botany and also encouraged the knowledge on which many of her flower paper-cuttings are based.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt;

==Career as an artist==

Mary Delany had always been an artist, but during her marriage to Dr Delany she had the time to hone her skills.  She was also a gardener, and did needlework, drawing, and painting; but was best known for her paper-cutting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"For these 'mosaicks' are coloured paper representing not only conspicuous details but also contrasting colours or shades of the same colour so that every effect of light is caught".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; She struck up a friendship with [[Letitia Bushe]], a watercolourist and miniaturist, with whom she embarked on a number of artistic projects.&lt;ref name=Connolly&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connolly|first1=S. J.|title=A Woman's Life in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Case of Letitia Bushe|journal=The Historical Journal|date=2000|volume=43|issue=2|pages=433–451|jstor=3021036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1771, a widow in her early 70s, Mary began on [[decoupage]], a fashion with ladies of the court. Her works were detailed and botanically accurate depictions of plants.  She used [[tissue paper]] and hand colouration to produce these pieces. She created 985 of these works, calling them her "Paper Mosaiks {{sic}}",&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; from the age of 71 to 88, when her eyesight failed her.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2009, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"With the plant specimen set before her she cut minute particles of coloured paper to represent the petals, stamens, calyx, leaves, veins, stalk and other parts of the plant, and, using lighter and darker paper to form the shading, she stuck them on a black background.  By placing one piece of paper upon another she sometimes built up several layers and in a complete picture there might be hundreds of pieces to form one plant.  It is thought she first dissected each plant so that she might examine it carefully for accurate portrayal..."&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mary became well known, and donors began to send her flowers to cut.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden 1980, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; They can still be seen in the [[King's Library#Enlightenment exhibition|Enlightenment Gallery]] at the [[British Museum]] today.  Upon her death, "The ten volumes of Mrs. Delany's ''Flora'' were inherited by Lady Llanover, the daughter of Georgina Mary Ann Port.  Lady Llanover, who died in 1896 at the age of ninety-four, bequeathed these volumes to the British Museum..."&lt;ref&gt;Vulliamy 1935, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

When her patroness, the Dowager Duchess, died, [[King George III]] and [[Queen Charlotte]] gave her a small house at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and a pension of 300 pounds a year.  Mrs. Delany had become familiar with Queen Charlotte while living in the house at Windsor, becoming an important part of the inner circle of the court.&lt;ref name="hayden" /&gt; The King and Queen, great supporters of her paper-cutting, "...always desired that any curious or beautiful plants should be transmitted to Mrs. Delany when in blossom."&lt;ref&gt;Vulliamy 1935, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frances Burney]] (Madame D'Arblay) was introduced to her in 1783, and frequently visited her at her London home and at Windsor, and owed to her friendship her court appointment. Delany, in her eighties at this time, had a reputation for cutting out and making the intricate paper mosaics ([[collage]]s) now in the [[British Museum]]. She had known many of the luminaries of her day, had corresponded with [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Sir Joseph Banks]], and Young, and left a detailed picture of polite English society of the 18th century in her six volumes of ''Autobiography and Letters'' (ed. [[Lady Llanover]], 1861–1862). [[Edmund Burke|Burke]] calls her "a real fine lady, the model of an accomplished woman of former times".

In 1980, a descendant of Mary Delany's sister Anne, Ruth Hayden, published a book on Delany's work: ''Mrs. Delany and Her Flower Collages'', which was reissued in 2000 as ''Mrs. Delany: Her Life and Her Flowers'' (British Museum Press).

The [[Ulster Museum]] in Belfast holds an embroidered bedcover by Mrs Delaney, one of the only complete pieces of embroidery made by her.

An '''obelisk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|b|əl|ɪ|s|k}}; from {{lang-grc|ὀβελίσκος}} ''obeliskos'';&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)beli/skos|ὀβελίσκος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|obelisk}}&lt;/ref&gt; diminutive of {{lang|grc|ὀβελός}} ''obelos'', "[[Spit (cooking aide)|spit]], nail, pointed pillar"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)belo/s|οβελός|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a tall, four-sided, narrow tapering monument which ends in a pyramid-like shape or [[pyramidion]] at the top. These were originally called ''tekhenu'' by their builders, the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] who saw them used the Greek term 'obeliskos' to describe them, and this word passed into [[Latin]] and ultimately [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Rosalie F.|title=Ancient Egyptians: People of the Pyramids|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195122213|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gw5prEJQq10C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Tekhenu+%22+egyptian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FJAdU_iHNcPxhQeY9oGQDg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tekhenu%20%22%20egyptian&amp;f=false|author2=Charles Baker |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient obelisks are [[monolith]]ic; that is, they consist of a single stone. Most modern obelisks are made of several stones; some, like the [[Washington Monument]], are buildings.

The term ''[[stele]]'' is generally used for other monumental, upright, [[inscription|inscribed]] and sculpted stones.

[[File:Pylons and obelisk Luxor temple.JPG|thumb|[[Pylon (architecture)|Pylon]] of the Temple of Luxor with the remaining obelisk (of two) in front (the second is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris).]]
[[File:Heliopolis200501.JPG|thumb|right|Obelisk of Pharaoh [[Senusret I]], Al-Maalla area of [[Al-Matariyyah]] district in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|modern Heliopolis]].]]

Obelisks were prominent in the architecture of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, who placed them in pairs at the entrance of the [[Egyptian temple|temples]]. The word "obelisk" as used in English today is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because [[Herodotus]], the Greek traveller, was one of the first classical writers to describe the objects. A number of&lt;!-- can't find a current source, 19th century sources say more --&gt; ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the "[[Unfinished Obelisk]]" found partly hewn from its quarry at [[Aswan]]. These obelisks are now dispersed around the world, and fewer than half of them remain in Egypt.

The earliest [[temple]] obelisk still in its original position is the {{convert|20.7|m|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} {{convert|120|MT|ST|adj=on|lk=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/cairo.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks: Cairo |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; red granite Obelisk of [[Senusret I]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|XIIth]] [[List of Egyptian dynasties|Dynasty]] at [[Al-Matariyyah]] in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|modern Heliopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Obelisk |volume=19 |page=945 |first=Francis Llewellyn |last=Griffith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obelisk symbolized the sun god [[Ra]], and during the brief religious reformation of [[Akhenaten]] was said to be a petrified ray of the [[Aten]], the sundisk. It was also thought that the god existed within the structure.

[[Benben]] was the mound that arose from the primordial waters [[Naunet|Nu]] upon which the creator god [[Atum]] settled in the creation story of the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|Heliopolitan creation myth]] form of Ancient Egyptian religion. The Benben stone (also known as a pyramidion) is the top stone of the Egyptian pyramid. It is also related to the Obelisk.

It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Blackwell Gary and Richard Talcott, "Stargazing in Ancient Egypt", ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'', June 2006, pp. 62–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[pyramid]] and obelisk might have been inspired by previously overlooked astronomical phenomena connected with [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]: the [[zodiacal light]] and [[sun pillar]]s respectively.

The Ancient Romans were strongly influenced by the obelisk form, to the extent that there are now more than twice as many obelisks standing in Rome as remain in Egypt. All fell after the Roman period except for the [[St. Peter's Square#Obelisk|Vatican obelisk]] and were re-erected in different locations.

The largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome. [[Herod the Great]] imitated his Roman patrons and set up a red granite Egyptian obelisk in the hippodrome of his new city [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] in northern [[Judea]]. This one is about {{convert|40|ft|m}} tall and weighs about {{convert|100|MT|ST}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highskyblue.web.fc2.com/caesarea.htm|title=Caesarea Obelisk |publisher=Highskyblue.web.fc2.com |date=18 June 2001 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered by archaeologists and has been re-erected at its former site.

In [[Constantinople]], the Eastern [[Emperor Theodosius]] shipped an obelisk in AD 390 and had it set up in his [[hippodrome]], where it has weathered [[Crusade]]rs and [[Seljuks]] and stands in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome square]] in modern [[Istanbul]]. This one stood {{convert|95|ft|m}} tall and weighing {{convert|380|MT|ST}}. Its lower half reputedly also once stood in Istanbul but is now lost. The Istanbul obelisk is {{convert|65|ft|m}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/istanbul.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks: Istanbul |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome is the obelisk capital of the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The most well-known is probably the {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; The obelisk had stood since AD 37 on its site on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica:
:"The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

Re-erecting the obelisk had daunted even [[Michelangelo]], but [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect it in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project.

The obelisk, half-buried in the debris of the ages, was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dellªobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&amp;word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. – NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.

Three more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: the one behind [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (1587), the giant obelisk at the [[Lateran Basilica]] (1588), and the one at [[Piazza del Popolo]] (1589).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-117|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel – Titelansicht – ETH-Bibliothek Zürich (NEBIS) – e-rara|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinità dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]]. Another obelisk in Rome is sculpted as carried on the back of an [[elephant]]. Rome lost one of its obelisks, the [[Boboli obelisk]] which had decorated the temple of Isis, where it was uncovered in the 16th century. The Medici claimed it for the [[Villa Medici]], but in 1790 they moved it to the [[Boboli Gardens]] attached to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]], and left a replica in its stead.

Several more Egyptian obelisks have been re-erected elsewhere. The best-known examples outside Rome are the pair of {{convert|21|m|ft|adj=on}} {{convert|187|MT|ST|adj=on}} [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]]s in London ({{convert|69|ft|m|order=flip|disp=or}}) and New York City ({{convert|70|ft|m|order=flip|disp=or}}) and the {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} {{convert|227|MT|ST|adj=on}} [[Luxor Obelisk|obelisk at]] the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/world.html|title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; A World of Obelisks |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyrian===
Obelisk monuments are also known from the [[Assyria]]n civilization, where they were erected as public monuments that commemorated the achievements of the Assyrian king.

The [[British Museum]] possesses four Assyrian obelisks:

The [[White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I]] (named due to its colour), was discovered by [[Hormuzd Rassam]] in 1853 at [[Nineveh]]. The obelisk was erected by either [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1050–1031 BC) or [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king’s seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.

The Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments. The surviving parts of the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing to the king from Syria and the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=366799&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Rassam+Obelisk&amp;page=1|title=Collection object details|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Obelisk]] was discovered by [[Sir Austen Henry Layard]] in 1846 on the citadel of Kalhu. The obelisk was erected by [[Shalmaneser III]] and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, [[Jehu]] the Israelite and Sua the Gilzanean, giving gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III’s annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.

The Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh. Only the top of this [[monolith]] has been reconstructed in the British Museum. The obelisk is the oldest recorded obelisk from Assyria, dating to the 11th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=277955&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Broken+Obelisk&amp;page=1|title=Collection object details|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axumite (Ethiopia)===
[[Image:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|[[King Ezana's Stele]] in [[Axum]].]]
A number of obelisks were carved in the ancient [[Axumite Kingdom]] of today northern [[Ethiopia]]. Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.

The largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})&lt;ref&gt;"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World" edited by Chris scarre 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in "stelae fields".

===Ancient Roman===
[[Image:Örme dikilitaş.JPG|thumb|The Walled Obelisk in [[Sultanahmet Square]]]]
The Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style. Examples include:

*Arles, France —the [[Arles Obelisk]], in Place de la République, a 4th-century obelisk of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin
*[[Benevento]], Italy — Roman obelisks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museodelsannio.com/museo/sezioni/iside/obelisco.htm|title=museodelsannio.com|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highskyblue.web.fc2.com/benevento.htm|title=Domitian Obelisk|website=highskyblue.web.fc2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Munich —  obelisk of Titus Sextius Africanus, [[:de:Staatliches Museum Ägyptischer Kunst|Staatliches Museum Ägyptischer Kunst]], [[Kunstareal]], 1st century AD, {{convert|5.8|m}}
*Rome — there are five ancient Roman obelisks in Rome. ''See [[List of obelisks in Rome]].''

===Byzantine===
*[[Walled Obelisk]], Hippodrome of Constantinople. Built by [[Constantine VII]] Porphyrogenitus (905–959) and originally covered with gilded bronze plaques.

===Pre-Columbian===
The prehistoric Tello Obelisk, found in 1919 at ''[[Chavín de Huantar]]'' in [[Peru]], is a monolith stele with obelisk-like proportions. It was carved in a design of low relief with Chavín symbols, such as bands of teeth and animal heads. Long housed in the ''[[Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú]]'' in [[Lima]], it was relocated to the ''Museo Nacional de Chavín'', which opened in July 2008. The obelisk was named for the archeologist [[Julio C. Tello]], who discovered it and was considered the "father of Peruvian archeology."  He was America's first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] archeologist.&lt;ref name="iowa"&gt;[http://www.uiowapress.org/books/2009-spring/burger.htm Richard L. Burger, Abstract of "The Life and Writings of Julio C. Tello"], University of Iowa Press, accessed 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erection experiments==
In late summer 1999, Roger Hopkins and [[Mark Lehner]] teamed up with a [[NOVA (TV series)]] crew to erect a 25-ton obelisk. This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August–September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.

First Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html "Dispatches"], NOVA&lt;/ref&gt; Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].

One experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.

The final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15° had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations. It seems to have been supported by a 3,000-year-old [[papyrus]] [[scroll]] in which one scribe taunts another to erect a monument for "thy lord". The scroll reads "Empty the space that has been filled with sand beneath the monument of thy Lord."&lt;ref&gt;[[NOVA (TV series)]] ''Secrets of Lost Empire II'': "Pharaoh's Obelisks"&lt;/ref&gt; To erect the obelisks at Luxor with this method would have involved using over a million cubic meters of stone, mud brick and sand for both the ramp and the platform used to lower the obelisk.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile'', New York: TIME/Life, 1993, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; The largest obelisk successfully erected in ancient times weighed {{convert|455|MT|ST}}. A {{convert|520|MT|ST|adj=on}} stele was found in [[Axum]], but researchers believe it was broken while attempting to erect it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7306">'''Process art''' is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'' ([[work of art]]/[[found object]]), is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, patterning, and moreover the initiation of actions and proceedings.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing'' and how actions can be defined as an actual work of art; seeing the art as pure human expression. Process art often [[logical consequence|entails]] an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Movement==
Process art has been entitled as a creative movement in the US and Europe in the mid-1960s. It has roots in Performance Art, the [[Dada]] movement and, more traditionally, the drip paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]], and in its employment of [[serendipity]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, [[improvisation]], and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; The ephemeral nature and insubstantiality of materials was often showcased and highlighted, as is demonstrated in this review of [[William Basinski]] and his work titled ''The Disintegration Loops I-IV'' by Joe Tangari for [[Pitchfork Media]]: &lt;blockquote&gt; You are slowly being destroyed. It's imperceptible in the scheme of a day or a week or even a year, but you are aging, and your body is degrading. As your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to live, they also release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and cause you to grow progressively less able to perform as you did at your peak. By the time you reach 80, you will literally be full of holes, and though you'll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel their collective effect. Aging and degradation are forces of nature, functions of living, and understanding them can be as terrifying as it is gratifying.

It's not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think William Basinski's ''Disintegration Loops'' are a step toward that understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this force of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical matter, made manifest in music. During the summer of 2001, [[William Basinski]] set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops he'd had in storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of preservation began to devour the tapes he was saving. As they played, flakes of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head, wiping out portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as they progressed, the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the destruction of Basinski's old music.

In essence, Basinski is improvising using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the result is the most amazing piece of processmusic I've ever heard, an encompassing soundworld as lulling as it is apocalyptic.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/ (accessed: Saturday, February 16, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The process art movement and the [[environmental art]] movement are directly related:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Process Artists engage the primacy of organic systems, using perishable, insubstantial, and transitory materials such as dead rabbits, steam, fat, ice, cereal, sawdust, and grass. The materials are often left exposed to natural forces: gravity, time, weather, temperature, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Source: http://www.artandculture.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ACLive.woa/wa/movement?id=1037  (accessed:  Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In process art, as in the [[Arte Povera]] movement, nature itself is lauded as art; the symbolization and representation of nature, often rejected.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Antecedent===
The process art movement has precedent in indigenous rites, shamanic and religious rituals, cultural forms such as [[sandpainting]], [[sun dance]], and the [[tea ceremony]] are fundamentally related pursuits.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Aspects of the process of the construction of a [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] sand [[mandala]] (a [[subset]] of sandpainting) of [[Medicine Buddha]] by monks from [[Namgyal Monastery]] in Ithaca, New York that began February 26, 2001 and concluded March 21, 2001 has been captured and web-exhibited&lt;ref&gt;Source:  http://www.ackland.org/art/exhibitions/buddhistart/construction.htm (accessed: Monday, December 22, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; by the Ackland's Yager Gallery of Asian Art. The dissolution of the mandala was on June 8, 2001.

===Relationship to other disciplines and movements===
Process art shares fundamental features with a number of other fields, including the [[Expressive therapies | expressive therapies]] and [[Transformative arts| transformative arts]], both of which pivot around how the creative process of engaging in artistic activities can precipitate personal [[Introspection | insight]], individual healing, and [[Social change | social change]], independent of the perceived value attributed to the obejct of creation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Additionally, process art is integral to [[Arts-based research| arts-based research]], which uses creative process and artistic expression to investigate subjects that resist description or representation through other modes of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, T. and Eisner, E., Arts Based Research. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA: Sage, (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; McNiff, S., Art-Based Research. London, UK: Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2013}}
'''''Rashomon''''' is the name of several different stage productions, all ultimately derived from works by [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]].

==Source material==
[[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s two short stories "[[Rashomon (short story)|Rashomon]]" (1915), also known as "The Rashomon Gate", and "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), also known as "The Cedar Grove", were famously fused and adapted as the basis for [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s award-winning film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950), screenplay by Kurosawa and frequent collaborator [[Shinobu Hashimoto]]. In 1951 the film won an honorary International Academy Award, following the success of the film in winning a [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in the same year. The Kurosawa and Hashimoto screenplay deviates from Akutagawa's original stories in a number of ways, most notably by allowing a note of hope to triumph over Akutagawa's dark pessimism. 

Neither Akutagawa's story nor any of the plays based on it share anything with the popular traditional [[Rashōmon (Noh play)]] (c.1420) about a man who climbs the [[rajōmon]] gate to see if a demon is on top of it.

This 1959 Broadway adaptation by [[Fay Kanin|Fay]] and [[Michael Kanin]] ran for six months (January–June) at the Music Box Theatre, New York, starring husband and wife [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Claire Bloom]]. The Kanins' production was nominated for three Tony awards.

The Kanins' somewhat sentimental script sticks closely to the film, including elements added by Kurosawa that do not appear in Akutagawa's original short stories. The Kanins later went on to write the film screenplay for the Western ''[[The Outrage]]'', which also credits Kurosawa and Akutagawa (but not Hashimoto). ''The Outrage'' was one of several Westerns based on Kurosawa's films, most notably [[John Sturges]]' ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', adapted from Kurosawa's historical epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954), and [[Sergio Leone]]'s ground-breaking "[[Spaghetti western|Spaghetti Western]]" ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964). The Kanins' script was also staged on U.S. television as a "Play of the Week" (1960).

[[East West Players]] presented the first intimate staging of the Kanins' script, as their inaugural production in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastwestplayers.org/about_us/about_us.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717082523/http://www.eastwestplayers.org/about_us/about_us.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern adaptations of ''Rashomon'' have gone back to Akutagawa's original stories.

===Ivor Benjamin===
Ivor Benjamin's 1988 adaptation is from original translations by Jane Guaschi, then a language student at Sheffield University, U.K., and stays closer to the bleaker viewpoint of Akutagawa than the Kanins' version. This adaptation received its international premiere by [Storytellers Theatre Company] (no longer in operation), Ireland, 2005, for which the tour was nominated for two ESB/Irish Times 2005 Theatre Awards: [[Liam Halligan (director)|Liam Halligan]] for Best Director and [[Chisato Yoshimi]] for Best Costume Design.

The script has also been performed at Jackson's Lane Theatre, London, UK (1988), the University of the Philippines (2000), in Ashland, Oregon, USA (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050106/ENTERTAIN/301069990 |title=The truth is slippery in ?

The '''Rossano Gospels''', designated by '''042''' or '''Σ''' (in the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbering), ε 18 ([[Biblical manuscript#Von Soden|Soden]]), at the [[Rossano Cathedral|cathedral]] of [[Rossano]] in [[Italy]], is a 6th-century [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]] written following the reconquest of the [[Italian peninsula]] by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Also known as  '''Codex purpureus Rossanensis''' due to the reddish-purple (''purpureus'' in [[Latin]]) appearance of its pages, the [[codex]] is one of the oldest surviving [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the [[New Testament]]. The manuscript is famous for its prefatory cycle of miniatures of subjects from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', arranged in two tiers on the page, sometimes with small [[Old Testament prophet portrait]]s below, prefiguring and pointing up to events described in the New Testament scene above.

== Description ==
The now incomplete [[codex]] contains the text of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the majority of the [[Gospel of Mark]], with only one lacuna (Mark 16:14-20).&lt;ref name = Gregory&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gregory | first = Caspar René | authorlink = Caspar René Gregory | title = Textkritik des Neuen Testaments, Vol. 1 | publisher = J.C.

Like the [[Vienna Genesis]] and the [[Sinope Gospels]], the Rossano Gospels are written in silver ink on purple dyed [[parchment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M.

The large ({{nowrap|300 mm}} by {{nowrap|250 mm}}) book has text written in a {{nowrap|215 mm}} square block with two columns of twenty lines each. There is a prefatory cycle of illustrations which are also on purple dyed parchment.

It contains the [[Epistula ad Carpianum]], tables of the κεφάλαια (''tables of contents'') before each Gospel, τίτλοι (''titles'') at the top of the pages, numbers of [[Ammonian Sections]], and references to the [[Eusebian Canons]].&lt;ref name = Gregory/&gt;

== Text ==
The text of the Codex agrees generally with the [[Byzantine text-type]] in close relationship to the [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus]]. The Rossano Gospels, along with the manuscripts [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus|N]], [[Sinope Gospels|O]], and [[Codex Beratinus|Φ]], belong to the group of the [[Purple parchment|Purple Uncials]] (or purple codices). [[Kurt Aland|Aland]] placed all four manuscripts of the group (the Purple Uncials) in [[Categories of New Testament manuscripts|Category V]].&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book

In [[Matthew 1:11]] it has the additional reading τον Ιωακιμ, Ιωακιμ δε εγεννησεν (''Joakim, Joakim begot'') — [[Codex Campianus|M]] [[Codex Nanianus|U]] [[Codex Koridethi|Θ]] [[Family 1|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[Minuscule 33|33]] [[Minuscule 258|258]] [[Minuscule 478|478]] [[Minuscule 661|661]] 954 [[Minuscule 1216 (Gregory-Aland)|1216]] 1230 1354 1604 [[Lectionary 54]] syr&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; geo.&lt;ref&gt;UBS3, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Matthew 23:25]] it reads ακαθαρσιας for ακρασιας, a reading supported by [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]], the [[Syriac Sinaiticus]] manuscript, and [[Coptic versions of the Bible|Coptic version]].&lt;ref&gt;UBS3, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Currently the manuscript is dated by the [[INTF]] to the 6th century.&lt;ref name = INTF&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/ListeHandschriften.php?ObjID=20042 |title=Liste Handschriften |publisher=Institute for New Testament Textual Research |accessdate=16 March 2013 |location=Münster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex was discovered in 1879 in the Italian city of [[Rossano]] by [[Oskar Leopold von Gebhardt|Oskar von Gebhardt]] and [[Adolf Harnack]], in the sacristy of [[Rossano Cathedral]].&lt;ref name = Gregory/&gt;

On 9 October 2015 the international [[UNESCO]] Committee, inscribed the Codex Purpureus Rossanensis in the register memory of the world, in [[Abu Dabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexrossanensis.it/en/unesco/|website=Codex Purpureus Rossanensis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sakka''' or '''Saqqa''' ({{lang-ar|سكا}}) is a village to the southeast of [[Damascus]], on the edge of the [[Ghouta]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} north west of [[Damascus International Airport]] in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Burns2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Burns|title=Damascus: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTs77Ft6FXQC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=20 January 2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-27105-9|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tell Sakka''' is a man-made [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] in the neighborhood that has been excavated by [[Ahmed Taraqji]] on behalf of the [[Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Taraqji, A., "Nouvelles decouvertes sur les relations avec 1'Egypte a Tell Sakka et a Keswe, dans la region de Damas," Bulletin de la Societe Francaise d'Egyptologie 144:27-43, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remains of a palace was found and dated to between 1800 and 1600 BCE.

The first [[cuneiform]] tablet recovered in the Damascus area was found at Tell Sakka.

'''The Art Genome Project''' is the search technology behind [[Artsy (website)|Artsy]].

The Art Genome Project's search technology is the product of an ongoing art-historical study—undertaken by a team of contributors with art-historical backgrounds at Artsy—seeking to define the characteristics which distinguish and connect works of art, architecture, ancient artifacts and design.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Its primary aim is to provide Artsy users dynamic search categories and explain similarities among art and artists. Currently, there are 1000+ "[[genes]]" (i.e. attributes of art) in the project’s taxonomy, including art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumgeek.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/interview-matthew-israel-on-the-art-genome-project/|title=Interview: Matthew Israel on The Art Genome Project|work=museum geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes are the product of Artsy’s team and their engagement with (and feedback from) the museums, galleries, curators, critics and art historians present on Artsy’s platform.

There are two general parts of the project: 1) Conceiving and defining such characteristics, referred to as "[[gene]]s," and 2) Applying these genes to artists and artworks—creating "[[genome]]s" for both—for the artsy.net site.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Importantly, unlike tags, which are binary, genes are applied with values ranging from 0 to 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_artsy/all/1|title=Art.sy's 'Genome' Predicts What Paintings You Will Like - WIRED|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seminarstogo.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/the-art-genome-project/|title=The Art Genome Project|work=Seminars To Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value indicates the degree of relevance of a gene to an artist or work of art. While not seen by users, such gene values account for the strength of a relationship between artists and artworks. It also enables similarity to be expressed in a more nuanced way&lt;{{cn|date=March 2018}} than it might be with just tags because one can weigh various attributes of an artist or work of art to establish which might be the most or less important. Furthermore, such nuance allows for matching potential collectors with artworks based on their tastes and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/11/mf_artsy/all/1|title=Art.sy's 'Genome' Predicts What Paintings You Will Like - WIRED|work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artsy’s "genes" create various opportunities for discovering and learning about the artist and artworks. If users search for an artist, they can see "related" artists and if they search for an artwork, they can see "related" artworks. Genes (with definitions) also appear on their own pages and provide the backbone for Artsy’s Browse page.

The Art Genome Project provides [[metadata]] for search (and similarity) results based on the principles of [[information retrieval]] (TF/IDF) and presents results in a [[User experience design|UX]]-driven search product.

Matthew Israel, an art historian, is the Director of The Art Genome Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://matthewisraelprojects.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedents for The Art Genome Project ==

The Art Genome Project has often been compared to [[Pandora Radio|Pandora's]] [[Music Genome Project]], and was originally developed in consultation with Pandora’s Joe Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/artsy-launch/|title=Two Years In Coming, Art.sy Finally Brings Pandora’s Genome Project To The Wacky World Of Art|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html?pagewanted=1&lt;/ref&gt; Both aim to create comprehensive (though by no means exhaustive) analyses of types of art by identifying a set of criteria, which both call "genes". These are both broadly applicable to their respective art forms, as well as useful for generating interesting connections for users. Importantly, while The Art Genome is currently one extensive list of genes for all works of art, Pandora has separate genomes (lists of genes) for each genre of music.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The Music Genome Project and TAGP are examples of [[Big Data]], which is a sector of [[algorithm]]ic technology that synthesizes data to predict what users will prefer. Artsy’s genome is user facing, allowing users to navigate genes manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/2013/04/22/retooling_history.html|title=Retooling history|work=domusweb.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] also makes customized recommendations to users based on the qualities of the movies that they enjoy. [[Amazon (website)|Amazon Art]] makes suggestions to users based on their browsing and purchasing history.

Museums and galleries as well as other online art image databases, such as [[Google Art Project]] and [[Artstor]], digitize artworks for public access, but beyond providing basic metadata (artist, title, date, medium) these databases do not extensively classify works of art or create connections between them.

== The Art Genome Project and Other Taxonomies for Artwork ==

Art historians, libraries and image archives have long used classification systems, art cataloging standards or metadata, and created taxonomies, such as The Getty Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/|title=Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (Getty Research Institute)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to systematize the description of artworks. Classification is one of the major foundations of the discipline of art history.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Most college and university art history surveys are based on such an idea of classification, to provide students with a way of grasping the history of art and a jumping-off point for more focused research. Unlike other types of classification, The Art Genome's taxonomy was designed for the purposes of establishing similarities between artists and artworks.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

=== Genes versus Tags ===

In the words of Matthew Israel, Director of The Art Genome Project, "Genes are not tags — though we have many tags on the site — because tags are binary (something is either tagged "dog" or not). Genes, in contrast, can range from 0-100, thus capturing how strongly a gene applies to a specific artist or artwork. This nuanced connection between works of art is impossible with a simple tagging mechanism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quora.com/What-is-The-Art-Genome-Project&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, The Art Genome Project does incorporate over 6000 tags for content (iconography) in artwork as well as certain materials and mediums, which do not need the nuance of genes.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Reception ==

=== Positive Reception ===
Digtalmeetsculture.net calls TAGP "user-friendly," "intelligent and orchestrated behind the scenes by the Artsy experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/artsy-all-the-world%E2%80%99s-art-freely-accessible/|title=ARTSY, all the world’s art freely accessible|work=Digital meets Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex.com highlighted genes in their article "15 Awesome Genes on Artsy"  to show "just how incredible their project is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/art-design/2012/11/15-awesome-genes-on-artsy/|title=15 Awesome Genes on Artsy|author=Cedar Pasori|work=Complex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New York Times, the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum|Cooper-Hewitt]] Museum’s director of new and emerging media Seb Chan said, "sites like Art.sy were not meant to replace museums, galleries or books, but rather to help the public, especially art neophytes, stretch the boundaries of their taste. ‘You shouldn’t need to be a scholar to discover works of art that you might be fascinated by,’ he said. ‘You go to museums and you browse — chancing upon things is what it’s all about. The Art Genome is another way of creating serendipitous connections.’"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Olivares praised The Art Genome’s comprehensiveness, objectivity and ability to accommodate future revisions: "Unlike books, which can only be modified between editions, the website is made of millions of layers of edits that can be reworked at any time… [and] [u]nlike the opinionated and subjectively ordered history book, this neutral and re-configurable database will allow us to access any work of art or design, within any imaginable order, and instantly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/2013/04/22/retooling_history.html|title=Retooling history|work=domusweb.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Criticism around The Art Genome Project centers on "its classification system, which rubs some artists the wrong way."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have questioned the accuracy of the connections made through genes: "'I don't think what I am doing has anything to do with [[Cindy Sherman]],' says British artist Jonathan Smith after being told the site links his work to hers via a staged-photography gene. 'That sounds like something a programmer would think of."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Anita. "Works for Me: A Recommendation Engine Takes On Fine Art." Time Magazine (June 4, 2012), 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have highlighted the subjective nature of genes and expressed a concern that they might be applied reductively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/artsy-is-mapping-the-world-of-art-on-the-web.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bathers''''' (French: ''Les Baigneuses'') is an oil painting on canvas made between 1918 and 1919 by the French painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. After being given to the State by his three sons in 1923, it is currently kept at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.

There are two groups of naked women: two models lying in the foreground plus three bathers in the background, on the right. One of the models of this painting is [[Catherine Hessling|Andrée Hessling]], who became the first wife of Renoir's son, [[Jean Renoir|Jean]]. The natural setting displayed in the painting was the large garden of the house owned by the painter in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pierre-Auguste Renoir — ''Les Baigneuses'' |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/peinture.html |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |language=French |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the painting, Renoir removed any reference to the contemporary world and showed "a timeless nature". The theme of the bather is predominant in the final season of Renoir's paintings: the women portrayed by the painter are free and uninhibited. These bathers are "melted in the nature and the forms merge with the trees, flowers and the shares of red water".&lt;ref name="Flammarion"&gt;{{cite book |title=Renoir — Les classiques de l'art |publisher=Flammarion |year=2005 |place=Paris |language=French |isbn=2-08-011445-X |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting received criticism because of "the enormousness of the legs and arms, the weakness of flesh, and the pinkish color of the models".&lt;ref name="Flammarion"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">{{nihongo|'''''Mushi mezuru himegimi''''', or '''''The Lady who Loved Insects'''''|虫めづる姫君}}, is the twelfth-century [[Japanese literature|Japanese tale]] of one who defies [[Norm (sociology)|social convention]] and breaches the [[decorum]] expected of a [[Heian period|Heian]] court lady. It is one of ten [[short stories]] in the collection ''[[Tsutsumi Chūnagon Monogatari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |pages=xxii |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The [[protagonist]] befriends insects, names her attendants after them, and engages in [[Japanese poetry|poetic exchanges]] involving furry caterpillars, leading to [[laughter]] on the part of others. Portrayed as even more [[Eccentricity (behaviour)|eccentric]] is her disregard for her [[Physical attractiveness|physical appearance]]: she leaves her hair [[Hairstyle|untrimmed]]; has [[depilation|unplucked]] eyebrows; neglects to [[Ohaguro|blacken her teeth]]; and allows herself to be seen by men. 'Oh, how regrettable! Why does she have such a weird mind'. When an incipient love affair comes to an end along with the tale it is of little surprise to any of the observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |pages=41–69, esp. p.63 |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[Donald Keene]] has suggested that, while the [[Reader-response criticism|reader]] may be attracted by her independence of mind, the author was probably trying to [[satirize]] those with eccentric behaviour and unconventional tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Seeds in the Heart: Japanese Literature from Earliest Times to the Late Sixteenth Century]] |author=[[Donald Keene|Keene, Donald]] |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1999 |page=542 |isbn=0-231-11441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Backus argues that the modern reader may prefer her independence and naturalness to the "excessive artificiality of the Heian conception of feminine beauty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |page=43 |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also draws parallels with the vernacular [[setsuwa]] tradition and anecdotes told of [[List of Daijō Daijin#Heian Period|Fujiwara Munesuke]] (1077–1162), the 'Bee-Keeping Minister', who gave his favourites names such as "Long Legs", "Short Horns", and "Speckled Wings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Riverside Counselor's Stories: Vernacular Fiction of Late Heian Japan |author=Backus, Robert L. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=1985 |pages=45f. |isbn=0-8047-1260-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michele Marra also refers to Fujiwara Munesuke, again links the tale with setsuwa that similarly challenge [[Imperial Court in Kyoto|court]] orthodoxy, and suggests that the story may see [[Sacca|Buddhist truth]] preferred to the values of the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] aristocracy at the end of the [[Heian period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Aesthetics of Discontent: Politics and Reclusion in Medieval Japanese Literature |author=Marra, Michele |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |year=1991 |pages=63–69, esp. p. 69 |isbn=0-8248-1364-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Persistence of Memory''''' ({{lang-ca|La persistència de la memòria}}) is a 1931 [[painting]] by artist [[Salvador Dalí]], and one of his most recognizable works. First shown at the [[Julien Levy Gallery]] in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in [[New York City]], which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff editor|title=Dali, The Flamboyant Surrealist|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z2lcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tVYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=dal%C3%AD%20melting%20watch&amp;pg=4025%2C4123936|accessdate=20 June 2011|newspaper=The Vindicator|date=28 January 1989|quote=The death of Salvador Dali evokes the image of his most famous painting, ''Persistence of Memory''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes referred to by more descriptive (though incorrect) titles, such as "Melting Clocks", "The Soft Watches" or "The Melting Watches".{{by whom?|date=June 2017}}

==Description==
The well-known [[surrealist]] piece introduced the image of the soft melting [[pocket watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Kirsten|title=Essential Dalí|year=1999|publisher=;Dempsey Parr|isbn=978-1-84084-509-9|quote=It includes the first appearance of what is perhaps his most enduring image: the 'soft watch'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It epitomizes Dalí's theory of "softness" and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time. As [[Dawn Adès]] wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order".&lt;ref&gt;Ades, Dawn. Dalí. Thames and Hudson, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of special relativity]]. Asked by [[Ilya Prigogine]] whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a [[Camembert]] melting in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Salvador Dali |date=2008 |title=The Dali Dimension: Decoding the Mind of a Genius |format=DVD |publisher=Media 3.14-TVC-FGSD-IRL-AVRO|url=http://www.dalidimension.com/eng/index.html|quote=Surprisingly, Dalí said that his soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert cheese melting in the sun. The painter insisted on this explanation in his reply letter to Prigogine, who took it as Dalí's reaction to Einstein's coldly mathematical theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange "monster" (with a lot of texture near its face, and lots of contrast and tone in the picture) that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The figure can be read as a "fading" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition. One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.

The orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danilian symbolism I Salvador Dalí I Espace Dalí|url=http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|website=daliparis.com|accessdate=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925181611/http://daliparis.com/en/salvador-dali/dalinian-symbols|archive-date=25 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA I Salvador Dalí.

The fly appears to be casting a human shadow as the sun hits it. ''The Persistence of Memory'' employs "the exactitude of realist painting techniques"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7qeHVrQ5X-MC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Persistence+of+Memory+Dali+dream+surrealism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7ejjTdHmO8zOgAeOqfGYBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=exactitude%20realist%20painting%20techniques&amp;f=false "Dali's dream environments were represented through the exactitude of realist painting techniques, like those found in his ''Persistence of Memory'' (1931)." ''Surrealism and Architecture'', by Thomas Mical; Psychology Press, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.

The craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of [[Cap de Creus]] peninsula in north-eastern [[Catalonia]]. Many of Dalí's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/salvador-dali-surreal.html Salvador Dali.

==Versions==

Dalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]]'' (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], while the original ''Persistence of Memory'' remains at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. Dalí also produced various [[lithograph]]s and [[sculpture]]s on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are the ''Persistence of Memory'', the ''Nobility of Time'', the ''Profile of Time'', and the ''Three Dancing Watches''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture Dalis Sculpture Editions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708222040/http://www.dalisculptureeditions.com/Index.asp?Sez=Sculpture |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timelines of [[invention]]s display the development and progression of art, design, architecture, music and literature

==Invention in art, design and architecture==

''dates may be approximations''

* 350,000 BCE – [[Paint]] was invented by early man.  Pigment and paint grinding equipment was found in a cave at Twin Rivers near Lusaka, Zambia.
* 31,000 BCE – Representational painting was invented.  Murals of stampeding bulls, cantering horses, red bears and woolly rhinoceros are found in the [[Chauvet Cave]]s in France.
* 22,000 BCE – [[Sculpture]] was invented by [[Paleolithic]] tribes who created the female statuette called the [[Venus of Willendorf]], found in near Willendorf, Austria.
* 4000 BCE – [[Papyrus]], the precursor to [[paper]], was invented by the Egyptians by pounding flat woven mats of reeds.
* 2500 BCE – Egyptian blue pigment was invented by Egyptian chemists using a mixture of limestone (calcium oxide), malachite (copper oxide) and quartz (silica) fired to about 800–900 degrees Celsius.
* 500 BCE – [[Encaustic painting|Encaustic]] paints are invented by Greek artists by mixing colored pigments and wax.
* 450 BCE – Depicting the illusion of three-dimensional form on a two-dimensional surface was invented with the [[chiaroscuro]] painting technique that employs highlights and shadows.
* 250 BCE – [[Glassblowing]] was invented by Syrian craftsmen in Babylonia.
* 105 – [[Paper]] was invented by Ts’ai Lun, a Chinese court official.
* 650 – [[Porcelain]] was invented by Chinese artists in the Tang Dynasty as a fired mixture of kaolin (a clay) and petuntse (a feldspar).
* 1306 – A more naturalistic means of representational painting was invented by [[Giotto di Bondone]] using depth, perspective and temporal realism to present a single moment in time.
* 15th century – A [[cupola]] or dome which did not require a framework supporting its curves was invented by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].  To transport the large stones to the construction site, Brunelleschi invented a unique boat capable of moving heavy cargo upriver and was granted exclusive rights to use his boat to move heavy loads, patent rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15th century – [[Linear perspective]] was invented with work by Filippo Brunelleschi, and a treatise on perspective theory by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].   Perspective is a method for depicting the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.&lt;ref&gt;ArtLex at www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Li.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1420 – The use of a single, consistent light source in painting with figures painted to appear three-dimensional was invented by the Italian artist [[Masaccio]] (Tommaso di Giovanni).  See his 1427 painting, "Tribute Money".
* 1485 – [[Sfumato]], a painting technique in which an atmospheric or blurry effect is created with minute transitions between color areas, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci.  Sfumato is seen in Leonardo's "Virgin on the Rocks" and "[[Mona Lisa]]".
* 1503 – [[Surrealism]] was invented by Flemish artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]] with his triptych "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]".
* 1774 – [[Jasperware]], a dense vitreous pottery that could be turned on a lathe, was invented by [[Josiah Wedgwood]].
* 1816 – The photograph was invented by Joseph [[Nicephore Niepce]] using paper coated with [[silver chloride]] "fixed" with nitric acid.
* 1816 – a resolution contrast technique of painting and drawing was invented by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] who used it to depict faces in high resolution with the rest of the image in low resolution, as for example in his drawing "Mrs. Charles Badham".
* 1861 – The color photograph was invented by physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]].
* 1863 – Multiple subject painting was invented by [[Édouard Manet]].  His "[[Le dejeuner sur l'herbe]]" presents four disconnected figures not looking at one another, lighted from different directions.  Dejeuner sur l'herbe also has a disconnected background-to-foreground perspective that eliminates the middle ground.
* 1865 – [[Chromolithograph]] prints were invented by [[Jules Chéret]].
* 1872 – Serial photomontage, the precursor to [[motion pictures]], was invented by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] by using multiple cameras to photograph moving objects.

* 1882 – Multiple time depiction was invented by Édouard Manet in his ''"[[A Bar at the Folies-Bergère]]"'', which depicts a bar scene from two points in space at two different moments in time.
* 1884 – [[Pointillism]] was invented by [[Georges Seurat]], who created entire paintings using small dots of pure unmixed color.
* 1886 – [[Trompe l'oeil]] was invented by [[William Michael Harnett]], an American painter.
* 1888 – A technique of portraying a subject from different perspectives and of distorting subject matter in painting was invented by [[Paul Cézanne]].
* 1891 – A technique of unfreezing time in still images was invented by [[Claude Monet]], who painted the same subject at many different times during the day, showing how it appeared differently largely due to the change in natural light.  He painted the cathedral at Rouen at 40 different times of the day and he painted the same haystack at 20 different moments in a year.
* 1902- A technique of indeterminate time was invented in painting by Paul Cézanne in his painting "Mont Sainte-Victorie", in which the sources and direction of light are not discernible.
* 1902 – The [[teddy bear]] was invented by Morris and Rose Michtom based on a cartoon of a bear saved by President Theodore Roosevelt.
* 1903 – The 3-D (three-dimensional) movie was invented by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] with their one-minute film "L’Arrivée du Train".
* 1904 – [[Fauvism]] was invented by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]] and others.
* 1907 – A variety of special effects for film were invented by [[Georges Méliès]] in his film ''[[Tunneling the English Channel]]'', including stop-motion photography, split-screen photography, [[stop action animation]] and the combination of live action with full-scale mechanical backgrounds.
* 1915 – The multistable image was invented by W. E. Hill, with his drawing "My Wife and My Mother-in-Law", an image that can present either a young woman or an older woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Patenting Art and Entertainment'' by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1908 to 1917 – [[Cubism]] was invented by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]].  In Cubist artworks, the subject, whether it be a figure or a still life, is broken up and reassembled, and presented from multiple views simultaneously.  Cubism revolutionized western art, and influenced other art forms like music and literature.
* 1912 – [[Collage]] was invented by Picasso with his "Still Life with Chair Caning".  Attaching a material from the real world that was not ever used in high art into a painting violated what was previously considered the integrity of the artwork.  Collage was a new process for making art, a new art form, and it expanded the definition of art.
* 1912 – The [[Construction]] was invented by Picasso when he created "Guitar" in 1912 by joining parts together.  This additive image-making process was new to western sculpture which was previously made using subtractive processes like carving stone or wood, or modeling clay which may have then been cast in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/pablo-picasso.html |title=Pablo Picasso. Art, life, and world of modern |publisher=Moodbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – the [[Readymade]] was invented and exhibited by [[Marcel Duchamp]], "The Fountain" an upturned urinal signed by the artist.  The Readymade expanded the definition of art and of an artist.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11&amp;region=na#/Key-Events |title=The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1917 – [[De Stijl]] a kind of art based on pure geometry was invented by [[Theo van Doesburg]].
* 1926 – [[Science fiction]] movies were invented by [[Fritz Lang]] with his movie ''Metropolis'', which incorporates dynamic visual and special effects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1928 – [[Welded sculpture]], a new medium, a new process and a new art form, was invented by Pablo Picasso and Julio Gonzalez, opening up the solid form of sculpture to negative space and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;World History of Art by Hugh Honour, Laurence King Publishing 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1928 – [[Mickey Mouse]] was created by Walt Disney.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1929 – [[Film noir]] was invented by [[Josef Sternberg]] with his film ''Thunderbolt''.
* 1932 – The [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] was invented by [[Alexander Calder]].
* 1936 – A device that greatly speeds up the process of making cartoons and enables them to appear more realistic was invented and patented by [[Walt Disney]], who used it to create the classic ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' in 1937.  Refer to US Patent 2,201,689.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1947–50 – Painting was reinvented by [[Jackson Pollock]] whose novel method of spontaneously dripping and splattering paint from a can onto unscratched canvas laid out on the floor brought about an expanded understanding of pure abstraction and of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Jackson_Pollock.html |title=and also Michael Kimmelman www.NY Times.com "A Drip by Any Other Name", February 12, 2006 |publisher=Manythings.org |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1948 – The [[Glass House]] by the architect [[Philip Johnson]] reduced building down to its most basic elements: a horizontal slab on the ground, vertical supports, a flat roof and transparent glass wrapped around it.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1952 – Stain painting, in which liquid paint soaks and bleeds into the fabric of unprimed canvas, was invented by [[Joan Miró]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] who influenced [[Helen Frankenthaler]], as seen in her painting "Mountains and Sea" of 1952.
* 1959 – the first public "[[happening]]" was produced by Allan Kaprow at the Reuben Gallery in New York.  A happening is defined by Kaprow as a choreographed event that facilitates interactions between objects including performers and visitors.  Happenings were influenced by Jackson Pollock's process of action painting, Dada and the teachings of John Cage on chance and indeterminacy.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;

A '''tondo''' (plural "tondi" or "tondos") is a [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] term for a [[Circle|circular]] work of art, either a [[painting]] or a [[sculpture]]. The word derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''rotondo,'' "round."  The term is usually not used in English for small round paintings, but only those over about 60&amp;nbsp;cm (two feet) in diameter, thus excluding many round [[portrait miniature]]s – for sculpture the threshold is rather lower.

==History==
Artists have created tondi since [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]. The circular paintings in the centre of [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Development of vase painting|painted vases]] of that period are known as tondi, and the inside of the broad low winecup called a ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' also lent itself to circular enframed compositions.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. van der Grinten, ''On the Composition of the Medallions in the Interiors of Greek Black- and Red-Figured Kylixes''. Amsterdam 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The style was revived in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in Italy, where it may have developed from the smaller [[desco da parto]] or birthing tray.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-the-adoration-of-the-kings "''The Adoration of the Kings'', about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli"], National Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has been less common. In [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', the ship's wire railing curving round the figures helps enclose the composition within its tondo shape.

The background scene is consolidated or omitted, and to a large extent, unimportant. While the background may be visible in tondo paintings, in tondo relief carvings the background is not seen. [[Andrea della Robbia]] and other members of his family created glazed terracotta ''tondi'' that were often framed in a wreath of fruit and leaves and which were intended for immuring in a stuccoed wall. In [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]], Florence, 1421–24,  Andrea della Robbia provided glazed terracotta babes in swaddling clothes in tondos with plain blue backgrounds to be set in the [[spandrel]]s of the arches.

In the sixteenth century the painterly style of ''istoriato'' decoration for [[maiolica]] wares was applied to large circular dishes (see also [[Charger (table setting)|charger]]).

The tondo has also been used as a design element in [[architecture]] since the [[Renaissance]]; it may serve centered in the gable-end of a [[pediment]] or under the round-headed [[arch]] that was revived in the fifteenth century.

Although the earliest true Renaissance, or late Gothic painted tondo is Burgundian, from [[Champmol]]  (of a ''Pietá'' by [[Jean Malouel]] of 1400-15, now in the [[Louvre]]), the tondo became fashionable in 15th century [[Florence]], with [[Botticelli]] painting many examples, both [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and narrative scenes.  [[Michelangelo]] employed the circular tondo for several compositions, both painted and sculpted, including ''The Holy Family with the infant St. John the Baptist'', the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' at the [[Uffizi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/michelangelo/holy_family.jpg.html|title=Michelangelo, The Doni Tondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Raphael]].

The infrequently-encountered synonym ''[[rondo]]''&lt;ref name="Artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/  Artlex.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; much more usually refers to a musical form.

The '''''Vocation of the Apostles''''' is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]],  executed in 1481–1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
In 1481 a group of  Florentine painters left for Rome, where they had been called as part of the reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as early as the Spring of 1481, along with [[Pietro Perugino]], who was already there.
[[File:Domenico ghirlandaio, chiamata degli apostoli 02.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail of the figures on the right.]]
The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of [[Moses]] and those of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], as a sign of continuity between the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first alleged bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in  a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome.

Two frescoes are certainly  by Ghirlandaio, the ''Vocation of the Apostles'' and the ''Resurrection'', which was  repainted in the late 16th century due to extensive damage. A third, ''[[The Crossing of the Red Sea (Sistine Chapel)|The Crossing of the Red Sea]]'', in the "Stories of Moses" wall, has been assigned to one among Ghirlandaio, [[Biagio d'Antonio]] or [[Cosimo Rosselli]].

==Description==
[[File:Calling of the Apostles (detail) GHIRLANDAIO, Domenico 1481.JPG|thumb|240px|Detail of the characters on the right, with John Argyropoulos in the center.]]
The scene of the Vocation shows, above a lake in a wide mountainous valley, the fishermen [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] (on the left) in the moment in which they are called by Jesus, who stands on the shore. A few moments later, the two are behind Jesus on the opposite shore (on the right), while the latter calls  James and John, who are restoring the nets on their father Zebedee's boat, in the center of the scene.

In the foreground are Peter and Andrew, already dressed in cloaks with their traditional colors (yellow or orange for Peter, green for Andrew). They are kneeling beside Christ who solemnly blesses them. An original element of the fresco is the presence of a multitude of beholders, portrayed in contemporary clothes. Their faces were those of the Florentine community in Rome, who resided near the church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]].

At the left is a white bearded man, perhaps a literate from [[Constantinople]] who was also used as model  for the ''[[St. Jerome in His Study (Domenico Ghirlandaio)|St. Jerome in His Study]]'' in the [[church of Ognissanti]] in [[Florence]]. At the center, just behind Jesus, is the portrait of [[Diotisalvi Neroni]], who had taken refuge in Rome after plotting against [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici]]. Another exile from Constantinople is [[John Argyropoulos]], who appears on the right. Other characters on the right are members of the [[Tornabuoni]] family.

It is the nation’s oldest and largest theater company dedicated to developing, producing and promoting the work of female-identified theater artists at every stage in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3369451|title=The Women's Project &amp; Productions, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829033607/https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3369451|archive-date=2017-08-29|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Lisa McNulty serves as the Producing Artistic Director and Michael Sag serves as the Managing Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/MTCs-Lisa-McNulty-Named-New-Producing-Artistic-Director-of-Womens-Project-Theater-20140723|title=MTC's Lisa McNulty Named New Producing Artistic Director of Women's Project Theater|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/michael-sag-joins-wp-theater-as-managing-director|title=Michael Sag Joins WP Theater as Managing Director|work=[[Playbill]]|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
WP Theater was founded in 1978 by Julia Miles to address the conspicuous underrepresentation of women artists working in the American theater. Miles was producing at [[The American Place Theatre]], an Off-Broadway theater dedicated to producing new work by American writers. Miles began as Assistant Manager at The American Place Theatre in 1964 and advanced in the ranks to Associate Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backstage.com/news/julia-miles-wpps-founder-reviews-career/|title=Julia Miles: WPP's Founder Reviews Career|work=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, she noted the lack of plays written by women being produced by The American Place Theatre in comparison to those written by men. Under a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], Miles created The Women’s Project under the umbrella of The American Place Theatre to encourage the development of female playwrights and directors and to provide a forum for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/03/archives/choices-opens-womens-program.html|title=‘Choices’ Opens Women's Program|last=Times|first=Special To The New York|date=1978-12-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its first nine years, WP Theater staged its productions in the basement of The American Place theatre. In 1987, the project left The American Place Theatre and became an independent organization, known today as WP Theater. In 1998, the project bought a church at 424 West [[55th Street (Manhattan)|55th Street]], also the site of Theater Four,&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelminn.net/newyork/theatres/midtown/julia-miles-theatre/index.html Julia Miles Theater / Theatre Four], michaelminn.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb venue|156|Theater Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was named the [[Julia Miles Theater]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/21689/julia-miles-theater Julia Miles Theater], nyc-arts.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb venue|67|Julia Miles Theater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WP Theater aims to empower artists who have historically been marginalized for their gender or gender expression to reach their full potential. The fundamental components of WP Theater are the Mainstage Season, the WP Lab and Pipeline Festival, and the annual Women of Achievement Awards gala.

WP Theater artist alumni include [[Billie Allen]], [[Anne Bogart]], [[Pearl Cleage]], [[Eve Ensler]], [[María Irene Fornés]], [[Pam MacKinnon]], [[Dominique Morisseau]], [[Lynn Nottage]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Diane Paulus]], [[Sarah Ruhl]], [[Anna Deavere Smith]], and [[Rebecca Taichman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's Project Theater Production History|url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/Feb08/women.cfm|newspaper=American Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors who have performed in WP Theater productions include [[Tony Award]] winners and nominees [[Michael Cerveris]], [[Kathleen Chalfant]], [[Colleen Dewhurst]], [[Tammy Grimes]], [[Cherry Jones]], [[Tonya Pinkins]], [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]], [[Thomas Sadoski]], and [[Frances Sternhagen]], [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners and nominees [[Linda Hunt]], [[Kim Hunter]], and [[Mary McDonnell]], and [[Emmy Award]] winners and nominees [[Ruby Dee]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Jimmy Smits]], and [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]].

== Productions ==
Since 1978, WP Theater has produced more than 600 Off-Broadway plays and developmental projects and has partnered with a number of other New York theater companies for co-productions, including [[Playwrights Horizons]] and [[The New Group]]. Often, WP Theater produces plays that are New York premieres or world premieres. These include ''Bright Half Life'' written by [[Tanya Barfield]] and directed by [[Leigh Silverman]], ''Stuffed'' by [[Lisa Lampanelli]], ''Or,'' by [[Liz Duffy Adams]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]'s only play, ''Freshwater'', directed by Anne Bogart.

WP Theater's first production was ''Choices'', a one-woman show that was adapted from the works of [[Colette]], Virginia Woolf, [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Adrienne Rich]], and [[Joan Didion]], amongst others. It was conceived by writer [[Patricia Bosworth]] and adapted by Bosworth, director Caymichael Patten, and actress [[Lily Lodge]]. ''Choices'' ran from November 30 to December 17, 1978, in the American Place Theatre basement. Julia Miles said the production "explores the choices that women have. Hopefully, there are now more of those choices and women are more definite about what they are." After the production opened, [[Mel Gussow]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "''Choices'' serves as a brief introduction to the artistic energy of literary women. Given the variety of versatile people who are engaged in the 'Women's Project', we look forward to the plays, playwrights and directors that should emerge from the American Place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/11/archives/stage-choices-womens-anthology-artistic-energy.html|title=Stage: ''Choices'', Women's Anthology|last=Gussow|first=Mel|date=1978-12-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-31|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, WP Theater produced ''Still Life'', a documentary-style play about the aftermath of the Vietnam War written and directed by Emily Mann. The production featured Mary McDonnell, Timothy Near, and John Spencer and earned four [[Obie Award|Obie Awards]], including the award for Best Production.

One of WP Theater’s most heralded productions is [[A... My Name Is Alice|''A...My Name is Alice'']], a [[revue]] of songs and sketches conceived and directed by [[Julianne Boyd]] and [[Joan Micklin Silver]]. The production earned the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Best Revue in the 1983/84 season, and featured songs and scenes penned by [[Winnie Holzman]], [[Marta Kauffman]], [[Anne Meara]], and others.

WP Theater has worked closely with Cuban-American playwright, [[María Irene Fornés]], since its inception. Fornés, a [[Pulitzer Prize]] nominee and nine-time Obie Award winner, is known for her avant-garde and experimental plays. WP Theater has produced three Fornés plays, including ''Abingdon Square'', which earned the 1988 Obie for Best New American Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/542/|title=María Irene Fornés by Allen Frame|website=bombmagazine.org|access-date=2017-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901025357/http://bombmagazine.org/article/542/|archive-date=2017-09-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Lab ==
The Lab is a two-year residency for female-identified playwrights, directors and producers. Members of the Lab are selected through a highly competitive application and interview process. The Lab provides its members with a vital professional network, entrepreneurial and leadership training, rehearsal space, and opportunities for the development and production of bold new work for the stage.

The Lab began as the Directors Forum, created in 1983. In 1992, WP added the Playwrights Lab. The Producers Lab was added in 2006 to enhance the collaborative nature of the residency.

The Lab has two main goals: to cultivate the work of the participating artists and to give them the tools they need to succeed in the industry. In addition to developing their own unique work, Lab artists collaboratively create a culminating residency production. Since 2016, Lab members’ work has been showcased at the biennial Pipeline Festival. For the month-long Pipeline Festival, groups of three—one writer, one director, and one producer—come together to collaborate on a piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/womens-project-showcases-new-works-at-pipeline|title=Women’s Project Showcases New Works at Pipeline {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2016, Lab members would devise new work, showcased in a production at the end of the residency term. These productions include ''The Architecture of Becoming'' (2014), ''We Play for the Gods'' (2012), ''Global Cooling: The Women Chill'' (2009), ''Corporate Carnival'' (2008), and ''Girls Just Wanna Have Fund$'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/aliens-with-extraordinary-skills-freshwater-and-global-chill-set-for-womens-project-season-com-151882|title=Aliens with Extraordinary Skills, Freshwater and Global Chill Set for Women's Project Season {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/we-play-for-the-gods-with-annie-golden-and-erika-rolfsud-debuts-off-broadway-com-194169|title=We Play for the Gods, With Annie Golden and Erika Rolfsud, Debuts Off-Broadway {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/arts/08wfc.html|title=At the World Financial Center, a Circus Breaks Out|last=Mcgee|first=Celia|date=2008-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2004, the Lab did not function on a two-year rotation.

Under the auspices of WP Theater, the 2008/2010 Lab Playwrights published ''Out of Time and Place'', a two-volume anthology of plays, including contributions from 11 Lab playwrights and an introduction by [[Theresa Rebeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vWcoAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=out+of+time+and+place+theresa+rebeck#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Out of Time &amp; Place: An Anthology of Plays by the Women's Project Playwrights Lab|last=Clements|first=Alexis|last2=Evans|first2=Christine|date=2010|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780578060163|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Lab artists continue to work together long after their official residency ends, and WP Theater continues to advocate for its Lab alumnae by brokering agents, providing references, and submitting their work to theaters around the country. WP Theater also hires many Lab artists for main stage productions.

'''Walk the Plank''' are a British group of artists, theatre makers, pyrotechnicians and event engineers who specialise in outdoor arts/theatre, touring performance and [[pyrotechnic]]s. 

Their shows are on land and on water and often mix performance, music, lighting, visual images, fire, and [[fireworks]]. The company was established by John Wassell and Liz Pugh in 1991, who identified a [[niche market]] for a touring theatre ship, and other aquatic shows on the waterways. The company's work began when the pair purchased a touring [[theatre]] ship, the MV ''Fitzcarraldo''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The company's work has now extended far beyond the ship and they work on delivering shows and events, varying in scale from intimate to epic. Walk the Plank have produced work for Toronto’s [[Wintercity Festival]], [[Singapore Festival]], [[Euro 2004]], [[Tall Ships 2005]], [[Centerparcs]], Sir [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Commonwealth Games]], as well as multiple city and local councils. Perhaps their most well known credit are the opening and closing ceremonies for Liverpool's Capital of Culture celebrations.

Their administrative base is in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Greater Manchester]] and they have workshop facilities in Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall.

Their work often involves community engagement and they are known for scheduling and leading participation elements which fit the context of the event they are organising.

==Event management and consultancy==
The company's Senior Management Team (including co-founders John Wassell and Liz Pugh and Project Directors Andy Stratford and Billie Klinger) are trusted advisers in the areas of outdoor arts and cultural events.

==MV Fitzcarraldo==
The ''Fitzcarraldo'' [http://www.walktheplank.co.uk/wtp/index.php?page=nauticalia] was built in 1971 in [[Sandnessjøen]], Norway for [[TFDS]] as the MV Bjarkøj. She was 20 years a general cargo and passenger ferry working the islands around [[Tromsø]] in north [[Norway]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In December 1991 Walk the Plank purchased the ship, renaming it the ''Fitzcarraldo''. The ship was registered British in 1992, the same year of its first British national tour. Its hold was adapted as a theatre. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Each summer, from 1992 to 2006 the ''Fitzcarraldo'' set sail from the [[Albert Dock]], [[Liverpool]] and toured ports and harbours in [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Audiences of up to 125 people can sit the aft deck to watch as the hatches rise and the cargo holds are [[Crane (machine)|crane]]d open.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In 2000, 's co-production (with  Company) of "Moby Dick" won Best Fringe Production at the [[Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards]]. Jim Burke also won the Best New Play award for this adaptation. 

In 2003 the ship went on a national tour to 19 ports with a stage adaption of [[Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea]], to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dorset Echo'', 23 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Evening News'', 2 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; At first the audience sits on the [[quayside]], and the ''Fitzcarraldo'' represents the ''Abraham Lincoln''; later they sit in the ''Fitzcarraldo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hold, which represents the inside of the ''Nautilus'', or occasionally the seabed.

Currently, due to mechanical deterioration to some of its driving components the ship resides in the [[Canning Dock]], which is part of Liverpool's [[Albert Dock]] complex, and is used as a static venue for many events including parties, [[cabaret]] evenings, live music, and drama.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Walk the Plank are currently making plans to sell the Fitzcarraldo, in order to focus on delivering large scale outdoor events, creating touring performance and continue to provide pyrotechnics elements and firework displays to both public sector and private corporate organisations.

==WTP Pyrotechnics==
'''WTP Pyrotechnics''' is a [[limited company]] who donate all their profits to Walk the Plank. This is a major source of income for Walk the Plank other than arts grants and donations. WTP Pyrotechnics creates [[fireshows]], [[firework]] displays, site-specific work, and outdoor spectacles – producing work in landlocked and waterside locations. They have created shows on canals and rivers, in harbours and parks and town centres in the UK and abroad.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Past projects include site-specific events, fireshows and aquatic spectacle, working with [[pyrotechnics]], machines, music, large images, and mobile structures, performance, and fire; usually, one-off specially-commissioned pieces created for a particular site or occasion. The work is often on, near, or by water, but they work inland also.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''William Hogarth''' [[FRSA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|g|ɑr|θ}}; 10 November 1697 – 26 October 1764) was an English painter, [[Printmaking|printmaker]], pictorial [[satire|satirist]], [[Social criticism|social critic]], and editorial [[cartoonist]]. His work ranged from [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] portraiture to [[comic strip]]-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art – dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps best known being his moral series ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' and ''[[Marriage A-la-Mode (Hogarth)|Marriage A-la-Mode]]''.  Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as "Hogarthian".&lt;ref&gt;According to Elizabeth Einberg, "by the time he died in October 1764 he had left so indelible a mark on the history of British painting that the term 'Hogarthian' remains instantly comprehensible even today as a valid description of a wry, satirical perception of the human condition." See the exhibition catalog, ''Hogarth the Painter'', London: Tate Gallery, 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth was born in [[London]] to a lower middle-class family. In his youth he took up an apprenticeship where he specialised in engraving. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of outstanding debts; an event that is thought to have informed William's paintings and prints with a hard edge.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth, vol. 1: The 'Modern Moral Subject', 1697–1732'' (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by French and Italian painting and engraving,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Antal]], ''Hogarth and His Place in European Art'' (London 1962); Robin Simon, ''Hogarth, France and British Art: The rise of the arts in eighteenth-century Britain'' (London 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth's works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual,&lt;ref&gt;Bernd W. Krysmanski, ''Hogarth's Hidden Parts: Satiric Allusion, Erotic Wit, Blasphemous Bawdiness and Dark Humour in Eighteenth-Century English Art'' (Hildesheim, Zurich and New York: Georg Olms 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; mostly of the first rank of realistic portraiture. They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation.

==Early life==
[[File:William Hogarth by Roubiliac, 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|upright|''William Hogarth'' by [[Roubiliac]], 1741, National Portrait Gallery, London]]
William Hogarth was born at Bartholomew Close in London to Richard Hogarth, a poor [[Latin]] school teacher and textbook writer, and Anne Gibbons. In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in [[Leicester Fields]], where he learned to engrave [[trade card]]s and similar products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=6193 Ellis Gamble Biographical Details]. The British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. H. K. Wright. [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-2ulEAQAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1 The Journal of the Ex Libris Society, Volume 3] (A &amp; C. Black, Plymouth, 1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw.  Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking [[coffee house]] at [[St John's Gate]], was [[debtor prison|imprisoned for debt]] in [[Fleet Prison]] for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1 (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth became a member of the [[Rose and Crown Club]], with [[Peter Tillemans]], [[George Vertue]], [[Michael Dahl]], and other artists and connoisseurs.&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Katherine, 'Lens [Laus] family (per. c. 1650–1779), artists' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

{{See also|List of works by William Hogarth}}

By April 1720, Hogarth was an [[engraver]] in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms, shop bills, and designing plates for booksellers.

In 1727, he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the ''Element of Earth''. Morris heard that he was "an engraver, and no painter", and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the [[Westminster Hall#Westminster Hall|Westminster Court]], where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728. In 1757 he was appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] to the King.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 3 (New Brunswick 1993), pp. 213–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early works===
[[File:HogarthWanstead.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''[[The Assembly at Wanstead House]]''. [[Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney|Earl Tylney]] and family in foreground]]
Early satirical works included an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows [[Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is "Who'l Ride". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the [[South Sea Company]], which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early works include ''The Lottery'' (1724); ''The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons'' (1724);  ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print ''Masquerades and Operas'' (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] of the Swiss impresario [[John James Heidegger]], the popular Italian [[Opera|opera singers]], [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]'s pantomimes at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and the exaggerated popularity of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]'s protégé, the architect and painter [[William Kent]]. He continued that theme in 1727, with the ''Large Masquerade Ticket''. In 1726 Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings for [[Samuel Butler (1612–1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''. 
[[File:William Hogarth - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self-Portrait'' by Hogarth, ca. 1735, [[Yale Center for British Art]].]] These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best book illustrations.

In the following years he turned his attention to the production of small "[[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]]s" (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from {{convert|12|to|15|in}} high). Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were ''The Fountaine Family'' (c.1730), ''The Assembly at Wanstead House'', ''The House of Commons examining Bambridge'', and several pictures of the chief actors in [[John Gay]]'s popular ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1, pp. 172–185, 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his real low-life and real-life subjects was [[Sarah Malcolm]] whom he sketched two days before her execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/hogarth/hogarth-room-guide-room-8 Sarah Malcolm], The Hogarth Room, The Tate, retrieved 7 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of [[John Dryden]]'s ''The Indian Emperor, or The Conquest of Mexico'' (1732–1735) at the home of [[John Conduitt]], master of the mint, in [[Hanover Square, London|St George's Street, Hanover Square]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 2 (New Brunswick 1992), pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogarth's other works in the 1730s include ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'' (1733), ''Southwark Fair'' (1733), ''The Sleeping Congregation'' (1736), [[Before and After (Hogarth)|''Before'' and ''After'']] (1736), ''Scholars at a Lecture'' (1736), ''The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks)'' (1736), ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'' (1736), ''[[The Four Times of the Day]]'' (1738), and ''[[Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn]]'' (1738). He might also have printed ''Burlington Gate'' (1731), evoked by [[Alexander Pope]]'s Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;See Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moralizing art===

====Harlot's and Rake's Progresses====
[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;hl=en p.192] "PLATE VIII. ... Britannia 1763"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B.

In 1731 Hogarth completed the earliest of his series of moral works, a body of work that led to significant recognition. The collection of six scenes was entitled ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'' and appeared first as paintings (now lost)&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 21–26.&lt;/ref&gt; before being published as engravings.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 121–126.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Harlot's Progress'' depicts the fate of a country girl who begins prostituting&amp;nbsp;– the six scenes are chronological, starting with a meeting with a bawd and ending with a funeral ceremony that follows the character's death from venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, Dan (2010). ''London's Sinful Secret: The Bawdy History and Very Public Passions of London's Georgian Age''. Macmillan. pp. 19–20. {{ISBN|1429919566}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural series was an immediate success and was followed in 1733–1735 by the sequel ''[[A Rake's Progress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For the paintings, see Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 74–81. For the engravings, see Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 132–139.&lt;/ref&gt; The second instalment consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from prostitutes, and gambling&amp;nbsp;– the character's life ultimately ends in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]]. The original paintings of ''A Harlot's Progress'' were destroyed in the fire at [[Fonthill Abbey|Fonthill House]] in 1755; the oil paintings of ''A Rake's Progress'' (1733–34) are displayed in the gallery room at [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rake's Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the success of ''A Harlot's Progress'' and ''A Rake's Progress'' resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734|Engravers’ Copyright Act]] (known as ‘Hogarth's Act’), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verhoogt|first1=Robert|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-century Prints After Lawrence Alma-tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|date=2007|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9053569138|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriage à-la-mode====
[[Image:Marriage A-la-Mode 2, The Tête à Tête - William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 2. The Tête à Tête|Shortly After the Marriage]]'' (scene two of six).]]
[[File:Marriage A-la-Mode 4, The Toilette - William Hogarth.jpg|thumbnail|''Marriage à-la-mode'', ''[[Marriage à-la-mode: 4. The Toilette|After the old Earl's funeral]]'' (scene four of six)]]

In 1743–1745, Hogarth painted the six pictures of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Judy Egerton, ''Hogarth's 'Marriage A-la-Mode' '', London: The National Gallery 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; a pointed skewering of upper-class 18th-century society. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.

Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire – a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey – of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] for murdering her husband.

[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl ... The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counselor, who kills him, and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London), where the counselor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral: don’t listen to evil silver-tongued counselors; don't marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money; don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband; don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.&lt;ref&gt;Thackeray, William Makepeace, ''The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Industry and Idleness====
[[Image:William Hogarth - Industry and Idleness, Plate 1; The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms.png|thumb|right|''Industry and Idleness'' Plate 1, The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms]]
In the twelve prints of ''[[Industry and Idleness]]'' (1747)&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes [[Sheriff of London|Sheriff]] (plate 8), [[Alderman]] (plate 10), and finally the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins "at play in the church yard" (plate 3), holes up "in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute" after turning [[highwayman]] (plate 7) and "executed at Tyburn" (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the [[gallows]] by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, most from the [[Book of Proverbs]], such as for the first plate of "Industry and Idleness, shown here, "Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4  The hand of the diligent maketh rich."

====Beer Street and Gin Lane====
[[Image:GinLane.jpg|''[[Gin Lane]]''|thumb]]

Later prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']] (1751).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth engraved ''Beer Street'' to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage, English [[beer]], in contrast to ''Gin Lane'', in which the effects of drinking gin are shown – as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society.&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Hallett, ''The Spectacle of Difference'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), pp.198–222.&lt;/ref&gt; People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in ''Beer Street'', while in ''Gin Lane'' they are scrawny, lazy and careless. The woman at the front of ''Gin Lane'', who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour, who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/11202643/Hogarth-the-father-of-the-modern-cartoon.html "Hogarth, the father of the modern cartoon", ''The Telegraph'', 13 May 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The prints were published in support of the [[Gin Act 1751]].

Hogarth's friend, the magistrate [[Henry Fielding]], may have enlisted Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act: ''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'' were issued shortly after his work ''An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings'', and addressed the same issues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx "William Hogarth, Beer Street and Gin Lane, two prints", British Museum.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115252/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/w/william_hogarth,_beer_street.aspx |date=31 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Four Stages of Cruelty====
Other prints were his outcry against inhumanity in ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' (published 21 February 1751),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition (London: The Print Room 1989), nos. 168–179.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals which he saw around him and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled ''Reward of Cruelty'', the murderer is shown being dissected by scientists after his execution.  The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 [[Act of Parliament]] allowing for the dissection of executed criminals who had been convicted for murder.

===Portraits===
[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Richard III, 1745]]
[[File:Hogarth, William - Portrait of a Man - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a Man, 1741]]

Hogarth was also a popular [[portrait painter]]. In 1745 he painted actor [[David Garrick]] as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was paid £200, "which was more", he wrote, "than any English artist ever received for a single portrait." In 1746 a sketch of [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat]], afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Ellis. (1994) ''Painting in Britain 1530–1790''. 5th edn. New Haven and London: [[Yale University Press]], p. 175. {{ISBN|0300058330}}&lt;/ref&gt; he created a truthful, vivid full-length portrait of his friend, the philanthropic [[Thomas Coram|Captain Coram]] for the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and his unfinished oil sketch of a young fishwoman, entitled ''[[The Shrimp Girl]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]),&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; may be called masterpieces of [[British painting]]. There are also portraits of his wife and his two sisters, and of many other people, among them Bishop [[Benjamin Hoadly|Hoadly]] and Bishop [[Thomas Herring|Herring]].

===Historical subjects===
For a long period of his life, Hogarth tried to achieve the status of [[history painter]], but had no great success in this field.

====Biblical scenes====
Examples of his history pictures are ''The Pool of Bethesda'' and ''The Good Samaritan'', executed in 1736–1737 for [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]];&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press 2016), nos. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moses brought before Pharaoh's Daughter'', painted for the [[Foundling Hospital]] (1747, formerly at the [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now in the [[Foundling Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paul before Felix'' (1748) at [[Lincoln's Inn]];&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; and his altarpiece for [[St. Mary Redcliffe]], [[Bristol]] (1755–56).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Gate of Calais====
''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' (1748; now in [[Tate Britain]]) was produced soon after his return from a visit to France.&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] wrote that Hogarth had run a great risk to go there since the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;he went to France, and was so imprudent as to be taking a sketch of the drawbridge at [[Calais]]. He was seized and carried to the governor, where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several [[caricatures]] of the French; particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the ''Lion d'argent'', the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it. They were much diverted with his drawings, and dismissed him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Back home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the [[French people|Frenchmen]], as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a "soldier's hand upon my shoulder", running him in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwgIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22William+Hogarth%22&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA63,M1 p.63] "in one corner introduced my own portrait"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other later works===

Notable Hogarth engravings in the 1740s include ''[[The Enraged Musician]]'' (1741), the six prints of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' (1745; executed by French artists under Hogarth's inspection), and ''The Stage Coach or The Country Inn Yard'' (1747).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 152, 158–163, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745 Hogarth painted a self-portrait with his pug dog [[Trump (dog)|Trump]] (now also in [[Tate Britain]]), which shows him as a learned artist supported by volumes of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749, he represented the somewhat disorderly English troops on their ''[[March of the Guards to Finchley]]'' (formerly located in [[Thomas Coram Foundation for Children]], now [[Foundling Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', no. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others works included his ingenious ''[[Satire on False Perspective]]'' (1754);&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, no. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; his satire on canvassing in his ''[[Humours of an Election|Election]]'' series (1755–1758; now in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]]);&lt;ref&gt;Einberg, ''William Hogarth: A Complete Catalogue of the Paintings'', nos. 214–217.&lt;/ref&gt; his ridicule of the English passion for [[cockfighting]] in ''The Cockpit'' (1759); his attack on [[Methodism]] in ''[[Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism]]'' (1762); his political anti-war satire in ''The Times'', plate I (1762); and his pessimistic view of all things in ''Tailpiece, or The Bathos'' (1764).&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 206, 210a, 211, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:Analysis of Beauty Plate 1 by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' plate 1 (1753)]]
Hogarth wrote and published his ideas of artistic design in his book ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' (1753).&lt;ref&gt;William Hogarth, ''The Analysis of Beauty'' (1753), ed. Ronald Paulson, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-300-07346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he professes to define the principles of beauty and grace which he, a real child of [[Rococo]], saw realized in serpentine lines (the [[Line of Beauty]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/r/rococo|title=Rococo – Art Term {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some of Hogarth's adherents, the book was praised as a fine deliverance upon aesthetics; by his enemies and rivals, its obscurities and minor errors were made the subject of endless ridicule and caricature.&lt;ref&gt;Timbs, John (1881). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gF5JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq= ''Anecdote Lives of William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, Henry Fuseli, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and J.M.W. Turner'']. R. Bentley. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects===
Hogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, [[tavern]]s, and public buildings, and sold in [[old master print|printshop]]s. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the [[ballad opera]], the [[bourgeois tragedy]], and especially, a new form of [[fiction]] called the [[novel]] with which authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: "painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage", as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.

He drew from the highly moralizing [[Protestant]] tradition of Dutch [[genre painting]], and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English [[broadsheet]] and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.

===Parodic borrowings from Old Masters===
When analysing the work of the artist as a whole, [[Ronald Paulson]] says, "In ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', every single plate but one is based on [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]]'s images of the story of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] and the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]." In other works, he parodies [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent [[God]] who intervenes in the lives of people and produces [[miracle]]s. Indeed, Hogarth was a [[Deist]], a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a "comic history painter", he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, "beaten" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s then-current ideal of the [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classical Greek]] male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, "Who but a bigot, even to the [[antiques]], will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] doth but coarsely imitate."

==Personal life==

On 23 March 1729 Hogarth married Jane Thornhill, daughter of artist Sir [[James Thornhill]].

Hogarth was initiated as a [[Freemason]] before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards' Lodge; the latter still possesses the 'Hogarth Jewel' which Hogarth designed for the Lodge's Master to wear.&lt;ref&gt;See references in [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner11.html this biography].&lt;/ref&gt; Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth's work, most notably 'Night', the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''.

His main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in [[Chiswick]] in 1749, the house now known as [[Hogarth's House]] and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123103341/http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2018-01-23|title=Hogarth’s House {{!}} Hounslow.info|date=2018-01-23|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/031005/n031005_24.htm |title=Camden New Journal |author=Joel Taylor |work=camdennewjournal.co.uk |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children. He was a founding Governor of the [[Foundling Hospital]].

Among his friends and acquaintances were many English artists and satirists of the period, such as [[Francis Hayman]], [[Henry Fielding]], and [[Laurence Sterne]].

==Death==
[[File:William Hogarth's tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of William and Jane Hogarth]]

Hogarth died in London on 26 October 1764 and was buried at [[St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick]], London. His friend, actor [[David Garrick]], composed the following inscription for his tombstone:

{{poemquote|Farewell great Painter of Mankind
Who reach'd the noblest point of Art
Whose pictur'd Morals charm the Mind
And through the Eye correct the Heart.

If Genius fire thee, Reader, stay,
If Nature touch thee, drop a Tear:
If neither move thee, turn away,
For Hogarth's honour'd dust lies here.}}

==Influence and reputation==
Hogarth's works were a direct influence on [[John Collier (caricaturist)|John Collier]], who was known as the "Lancashire Hogarth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hignett|first=Tim|publisher=George Kelsall Publishing|year=1991|title=Milnrow &amp; Newhey: A Lancashire Legacy|isbn=0-946571-19-8|location=[[Littleborough, Greater Manchester|Littleborough]]|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of Hogarth's prints throughout Europe, together with the depiction of popular scenes from his prints in faked Hogarth prints, influenced Continental book illustration through the 18th and early 19th centuries, especially in Germany and France. He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth's influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.

Hogarth's paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, [[Gavin Gordon (composer)|Gavin Gordon]]'s 1935 ballet ''[[The Rake's Progress (ballet)|The Rake's Progress]]'', to choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]], was based directly on Hogarth's series of paintings of that title. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1951 [[opera]] ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', with libretto by [[W. H. Auden]], was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth's engravings also inspired the [[BBC radio]] play ''The Midnight House'' by Jonathan Hall, based on the [[M. R. James]] ghost story "[[The Mezzotint]]" and first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2006.

[[Russell Banks]]' short story "Indisposed" is a fictional account of Hogarth's infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in [[Nick Dear]]'s play ''[[The Art of Success]]'', whilst he is played by [[Toby Jones]] in the 2006 television film ''[[A Harlot's Progress (film)|A Harlot's Progress]]''.

[[Hogarth's House]] in [[Chiswick]], west London, is now a museum; it abuts one of London's best known [[road junction]]s – the [[Hogarth Roundabout]]. In 2014 both Hogarth's House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.
