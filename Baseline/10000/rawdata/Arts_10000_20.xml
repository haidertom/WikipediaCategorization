'''''A Garden of Glass''''' refers to a [[stained glass window]] in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam]], designed and installed for the [[silver jubilee]] of [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] in 2005, by the artist Marc Mulders.

In 2004 the National Committee for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Beatrix was formed.&lt;ref name="overheid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0016368/2004-02-18|title=Regeling - Instellingsbesluit Nationaal Comité Zilveren Regeringsjubileum Koningin Beatrix - BWBR0016368|website=wetten.overheid.nl|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee settled on a stained glass window in the Nieuwe Kerk as a fitting memorial as that is the location where the Queen was inaugurated.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2005/04/29/ramen-mulders-tekenen-onze-tijd-10488593-a146729 "Ramen Mulders tekenen onze tijd"], ''[[NRC Handelsblad|nrc.nl]]'', 29 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The window is made up of 40 individual panels that include various mushrooms, flowers and butterflies.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; It hangs opposite the commemorative window from 1995 celebrating 50 years of freedom.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; A book was published the same year by Lien Heyting about the window, explaining the symbolism of the various figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tuin-van-glas-herdenkingsraam-zilveren-regeringsjubileum-koningin-beatrix-2005/oclc/993519991 Een tuin van glas herdenkingsraam Zilveren Regeringsjubileum Koningin Beatrix 2005], on [[worldcat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year Marc Mulders made a stained-glass window commemorating the re-opening of [[Museum Catharijneconvent]] with the theme [[Apocalypse]] and on 2 September 2016 he made a stained-glass window commemorating [[Erasmus]] which was installed in the [[Janskerk, Gouda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintjan.com/het-erasmusglas-van-marc-mulders/ Het Erasmusglas van Marc Mulders], church website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10945">'''Accessible housing''' refers to the construction or modification (such as through renovation or [[home modification]]) of housing to enable independent living for persons with disabilities. [[Accessibility]] is achieved through architectural design, but also by integrating accessibility features such as modified furniture, shelves and cupboards, or even electronic devices in the home.

In Canada, Flexhousing is a concept that encourages homeowners to make renovations that modify their house over time to meet changing accessibility needs. The concept supports the goals of enabling "homeowners to occupy a dwelling for longer periods of time, perhaps over their entire lifetimes, while adapting to changing circumstances and meeting a wide range of needs"; Universal Housing in the United States and Lifetime Homes in the United Kingdom are similar concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Flexhousing(TM)? |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_001.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502193828/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_001.cfm |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain applies the most widespread application of home access to date. In 1999, Parliament passed Section M, an amendment to residential building regulations requiring basic access in all new homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Doors to Be Swept Away in New Rules for Builders", Rachel Kelley, [[The Times]], December 5, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the 1988 Amendments to the [[Fair Housing Act]] added people with disabilities, as well as familial status, to the classes already protected by law from [[discrimination]] (race, color, gender, religion, creed, and country of origin). Among the protection for people with disabilities in the 1988 Amendments are seven construction requirements for all multifamily buildings of more than four units first occupied after March 13, 1991. These seven requirements are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fair Housing First, a website sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/ref&gt;
#An accessible building entrance on an accessible route,
#Accessible common and public use areas,
#Doors usable by a person in a wheelchair,
#Accessible route into and through the dwelling unit,
#Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls in accessible locations,
#Reinforced walls in bathrooms for later installation of grab bars, and
#Usable kitchens and bathrooms.

Access is typically defined within the limits of what a person sitting in a wheelchair is able to reach with arm movement only, with minimal shifting of the legs and torso. Lighting and thermostat controls should not be above and power outlets should not be below the reach of a person in a wheelchair.

Sinks and cooking areas typically need to be designed without cupboards below them, to permit the legs of the wheelchair user to roll underneath, and countertops may be of reduced height to accommodate a sitting rather than standing user. In some cases two food preparation areas may be combined into a single kitchen to permit both standing and wheelchair users.

In spite of these advancements, the housing types where most people in the United States reside&amp;nbsp;– single-family homes&amp;nbsp;– are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act, or any other federal law with the exception of the small percentage of publicly funded homes impacted by [[Section 504]] of the Rehabilitation Act. As a result, the great majority of new single-family homes replicate the barriers in existing homes.

==Renovations for accessibility==

Homeowners may be challenged by the need to find renovators familiar with accessible design issues. The federal government of Canada and the provincial governments work jointly to share the cost of offering reimbursement programs for homeowners in need of house renovations for accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Adaptations for Seniors' Independence |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_004.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610205814/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/prfinas/prfinas_004.cfm |archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs improve the ability of homeowners to fund house modifications, through renovating existing houses.

==Adaptations and accommodations==

Many [[ranch style home]]s and [[manufactured home]]s utilize a main floor slightly raised above ground level, but have an overall flat layout with either a [[Basement#Crawl space|crawlspace]] or slightly raised [[basement]] below for plumbing, electrical, and heating systems. These homes can be relatively easily modified to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers, with the installation of a long low-rise ramp outside the building, up to the house entrance, placed over the existing stairway. This ramp can then be removed at a later time, reverting to the stairway entrance if the handicapped access is no longer necessary.

[[Split level home]]s tend to be designed with multiple internal stairways and half-floor landings inside the building. There may be an entrance area inside the building at ground level, with stairs inside the entrance that immediately go up and down from the ground level. These homes are difficult to accommodate inexpensively since there is often no space available inside the structure to install long sloping wheelchair ramps to access the various floors. It may be possible to retrofit [[stair lift]]s into the stairwells or [[wheelchair lift]]s into balconies near the stairwell.

Multi-story homes can sometimes be accommodated by installing a private [[residential elevator]], which is usually much less expensive and has fewer design and layout requirements than a full commercial elevator. Homebuilders can in some cases plan for a future residential elevator by designing closet spaces in each floor stacked vertically with the same dimensions and location. At a later time the closet floors and ceilings are removed and the elevator equipment is installed into the open shaft.

Below are some current suggested architectural features of a universally-accessible house:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FlexHousing(TM) features a room-by-room demonstration |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_005.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503222532/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/buho/flho/flho_005.cfm |archivedate=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging in place and accessibility==

A growing trend among senior citizens is to "age in place", reflecting a desire to retain independence for as long as possible. Adaptations for seniors take into account the most common physical impairments affecting the elderly. For example, a common cause of serious injury for seniors is falling inside the home. Adding handrails and [[grab bars]] throughout the home, particularly in bathrooms and along stairways, helps reduce the risk of falling. Other adaptations that improve accessibility for seniors include: easy-to-reach work and storage areas in the kitchen; reaching devices to grab objects on high shelves; lever handles on doors; [[toilet seat riser]]s; walk-in showers; and bathtub and shower seats.

===Alzheimer disease and housing adaptations===

[[Alzheimer disease]] presents specific challenges for caregivers, who need to make the home as accessible as possible to the elderly resident, while keeping safety features in mind. Removable stove switch knobs, locks on kitchen cabinets, electric kettles with automatic shut-off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety in the kitchen |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/index.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610212818/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/index.cfm |archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and adding lighting to eliminate shadows in the house can all help caregivers to reduce dangers to the person with Alzheimer disease. Other features that can improve the well-being of the elderly person can include marking doors with conspicuous and distinct signs or objects such as ribbons or wreaths, can assist memory. Adding a cot or bed to the main floor of the house to allow the elderly person to rest without climbing stairs to a bedroom can be helpful to the Alzheimer patient. Furniture and clutter can also be removed to make the house more safe for an elderly person inclined to pace or wander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacing, wandering and confusion |url=http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/athoaldi_007.cfm |publisher=Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611012925/http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/co/maho/adse/athoaldi/athoaldi_007.cfm |archivedate=June 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aliza Olmert''' ({{lang-he|עליזה אולמרט}}; born 1946) is an Israeli artist, photographer, author and social worker. She is married to former Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Aliza olmert 1.jpg|thumb|right|Laura Bush welcomes Aliza Olmert]]

Aliza Olmert was born in a [[displaced persons camp]] in [[Eschwege]], [[Germany]]. Her parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors from [[Łódź]], [[Poland]]. She immigrated to Israel with her family in 1949, grew up in [[Ramat Gan]], and served as an instructor in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981971.html |title=That Midas touch |work=Haaretz}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met her husband, [[Ehud Olmert]], at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where she was studying social work.&lt;ref name=Shabi&gt;{{cite news |work=The Guardian |title=The unlikely first lady |author=Rachel Shabi |date=5 May 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/05/israel1 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmerts live in Jerusalem's [[Katamon]] neighborhood. They have five children (including [[Shaul Olmert]]), one of them adopted.&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

=== Art career ===
In 1985–1988, at the age of 40, Olmert studied environmental design at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]]. In Israel, Olmert has exhibited at the Museum on the Seam in Jerusalem, the Museum of Israeli Art in Ramat Gan, the Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv and the Tel Aviv Artists' House.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; Her work has also been exhibited in Japan, Uruguay, Italy, Britain, Poland, Argentina and New York.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt; In March 2008, she was awarded the Steiger Prize in Germany.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

===Politics===

Olmert espouses left-wing politics, and has been accused of influencing her husband's political views. Olmert dislikes the political limelight, and says that their most difficult period as a couple was 1993–2003, when Ehud was mayor of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=Shabi /&gt;

She is said to support [[Meretz]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Berger, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/international/middleeast/13israel.html How a Zionist Hawk Grew His New Dovish Feathers], ''New York Times'' (13 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social welfare ===
Olmert is active in social programs promoting child welfare. She is the chairman of Or Shalom and Tlalim, which aid children at risk and families with homebound sick children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nir Magal |date=14 May 2006 |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3250714,00.html |publisher=Ynet |script-title=he:עליזה אולמרט: לא אוותר על הבריחות לתל אביב |language=Hebrew |trans-title=Aliza Olmert: I will not give up on escapes to Tel Aviv |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olmert is also a member of the Action Committee for Children of Foreign Workers.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMidas /&gt;

'''Antitheatricality''' is any form of opposition or hostility to [[theater]]. Such opposition is as old as theater itself and can be found in all cultures {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, suggesting a deep-seated ambivalence in human nature about the dramatic arts. Jonas Barish's 1981 book, ''{{'}}The Antitheatrical Prejudice{{'}}'', was, according to one of his [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] colleagues, immediately recognized as having given intellectual and historical definition to a phenomenon which up to that point had been only dimly observed and understood. The book earned the American Theater Association's Barnard Hewitt Award for outstanding research in theater history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/07/arts/jonas-barish-76-scholar-of-theater-history.html|title=Jonas Barish, 76, Scholar of Theater History|last=Pace|first=Eric|date=7 April 1998|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish and some more recent commentators treat the anti-theatrical, not as an enemy to be overcome, but rather as an inevitable and valuable part of the theatrical dynamic.

Antitheatrical views have been based on philosophy, religion, morality, psychology, aesthetics and on simple prejudice. Opinions have focussed variously on the art form, the artistic content, the players, the lifestyle of theater people, and on the influence of theater on the behaviour and morals of individuals and society. Anti-theatrical sentiments have been expressed by government legislation, philosophers, artists, playwrights, religious representatives, communities, classes, and individuals.

The earliest objections to theatrical performance were made by Plato around 380 B.C. and re-emerged in various forms over the following 2,500 years. Plato's philosophical objection was that theatrical performance was inherently distanced from reality and therefore unworthy. Church leaders would  rework this argument in a theological context. A later aesthetic variation, which led to closet drama, valued the play, but only as a book. From Victorian times, critics complained that self-aggrandizing actors and lavish stage settings were getting in the way of the play.

Plato's moral objections were echoed widely in Roman times, leading eventually to theater's decline. During the Middle Ages, theatrical performance gradually re-emerged, the mystery plays accepted as part of church life. From the 16th century onwards, once theater was re-established as an independent profession, concerns were regularly raised that the acting community was inherently corrupt and that acting had a destructive moral influence on both actors and audiences. These views were often expressed during the emergence of Protestant, Puritan and Evangelical movements.

The evaluation of historic anti-theatrical attitudes can itself be influenced by the cultural setting and vantage point from which that evaluation takes place, resulting in quite different opinions. What might be seen as irrational prejudice from one vantage point might be interpreted as a rational judgement from another.

==Plato and ancient Greece{{Anchor|Plato and ancient Greece}}==

[[File:Portrait of Plato; bust. Wellcome M0005618.jpg|thumb|Plato, theater's first critic]]

==={{Anchor|Plato and ancient Greece}}Athens===

Around 400 B.C. the importance of [[Greek drama]] to [[ancient Greek culture]] was expressed by [[Aristophanes]] in his play, ''[[The Frogs]],'' where the chorus leader says, "There is no function more noble than that of the god-touched Chorus teaching the city in song".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Kinney Williams|title=Empire of Ancient Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMCOqlnV41wC&amp;pg=PA87|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0315-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theater and religious festivals were intimately connected.

Around 380 B.C. [[Plato]] became the first to challenge theater in the ancient world. Although his views expressed in [[Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] were radical, they were aimed primarily at the concept of theater (and other mimetic arts). He did not encourage hostility towards the artists or their performances. For Plato, theater was philosophically undesirable, it was simply a lie. It was bad for society because it engaged the sympathies of the audience and so might make people less thoughtful. Furthermore,the representation of ignoble actions on the stage could lead the actors and the audience to behave badly themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kpey7HX8CXQC&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=antitheatricality&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q=antitheatricality&amp;f=true|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Modernism|last=Lewis|first=Pericles|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521828093|location=|pages=193|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mimesis ===
{{See also|Mimesis}}Philosophically, acting is a special case of [[mimesis]] (''μίμησις''), a Greek term that describes imitation, especially when its object is to represent a greater reality. Plato explains this by using an illustration of an everyday object. First there is a universal truth, for example, the abstract concept of a bed. The carpenter who makes the bed creates an imperfect ''imitation'' of that concept in wood. The artist who paints a picture of the bed is making an imperfect ''imitation'' of the wooden bed. The artist is therefore several stages away from true reality and this is an undesirable state. Theater is likewise several stages from reality and therefore unworthy. The written words of a play can be considered more worthy since they can be understood directly by the mind and without the inevitable distortion caused by intermediaries.

Psychologically, mimesis is considered as formative, shaping the mind and causing the actor to become more like the person or object imitated. Actors should therefore only imitate people very much like themselves and then only when aspiring to virtue and avoiding anything base. Furthermore, they must not imitate women, or slaves, or villains, or madmen, or 'smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, boatswains, or the like'.

=== Aristotle ===
In ''The'' ''Poetics'' (Περὶ ποιητικῆς) c. 335 BC, Aristotle argues against Plato’s objections to ''mimesis'', supporting the concept of ''catharsis'' (cleansing) and affirms the human drive to imitate. Frequently, the term that Aristotle uses for ‘actor’ is ''prattontes'', suggesting ''praxis'' or real action, as opposed to Plato’s use of ''hypocrites'' (ὑποκριτής) which suggests one who 'hides under a mask', is deceptive or expresses make-believe emotions. Aristotle wants to avoid the hypothetical consequence of Plato’s critique, namely the closing of theaters and the banishment of actors. Ultimately Aristotle’s attitude is ambivalent; he concedes that drama should be able to exist without actually being acted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-S43g4iqD0UC&amp;pg=PT9|title=Stage Fright: Modernism, Anti-Theatricality, and Drama|author=Martin Puchner|first=|date=1 April 2003|publisher=JHU Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8018-7776-6|location=|page=9ff.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plutarch ===

The ''[[Moralia]]'' of [[Plutarch]], written in the first century, contain an essay (often given the title, ''Were the Athenians More Famous in War or in Wisdom?'') which reflects many of Plato's critical views but in a less nuanced way. Plutarch wonders what it tells us about the audience in that we take pleasure in watching an actor express strongly negative emotions on stage, whereas in real life, the opposite would be true.&lt;ref name="Barish"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Antitheatrical Prejudice|last1=Barish|first1=Jonas|date=1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520052161|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

==Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity==

=== Rome ===
Unlike Greece, theatre in Rome was distanced from religion and was largely led by professional actor-managers.  From early days the acting profession was marginalised and, by the height of the [[Roman Empire]], considered thoroughly disreputable. In the first century A.D., [[Cicero]] declared, "dramatic art and the theatre is generally disgraceful". During this time, permanent theater-building was forbidden and other popular entertainments often took theater's place. Actors, who were mainly foreigners, freedmen and slaves, had become a disenfranchised class.They were forbidden to leave the profession and were required to pass their employment on to their children.

[[Mime]]s included female performers, were heavily sexual in nature and often equated with [[prostitution]]. Attendance at such performances, says Barish, must have seemed to many Romans like visiting the brothels, "equally urgent, equally provocative of guilt, and hence equally in need of being scourged by a savage backlash of official disapproval".&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|38–43}}

=== Christian attitudes ===
Early Christian leaders, concerned to promote high ethical principles amongst the growing Christian community, were naturally opposed to the degenerate nature of contemporary Roman theatre. However, other arguments were also advanced.
[[File:Tertullian's Prescription Against Hereticks.jpg|left|thumb|'''Tertullian, second century Christian teacher and critic of theater''']]
In the second century, [[Taitian|Tatian]] and later [[Tertullian]], put forward [[Ascetical theology#Fathers and Doctors of the Church|ascetic]] principles. In ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Tertullian argued that even moderate pleasure is to be avoided and that theater, with its large crowds and deliberately exciting performances, led to "mindless absorption in the imaginary fortunes of nonexistent characters". Absorbing Plato’s concept of mimesis into a Christian context, he also argued that acting was an ever-increasing system of falsifications. "First the actor falsifies his identity, and so compounds a deadly sin. If he impersonates someone vicious, he further compounds the sin." And if physical modification was required, say a man representing a woman, it was a "lie against our own faces, and an impious attempt to improve the works of the Creator".&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|44–49}}

In the fourth century, the famous preacher [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]] again stressed the ascetic theme. It was not pleasure but the opposite of pleasure that brought salvation. He wrote that "he who converses of theatres and actors does not benefit [his soul], but inflames it more, and renders it more careless... He who converses about hell incurs no dangers, and renders it more sober."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

[[St. Augustine|Augustine of Hippo]], his North African contemporary, had in early life led a hedonistic lifestyle which changed dramatically following his conversion. In his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]],'' echoing Plato, he says about imitating others: "To the end that we may be true to our nature, we should not become false by copying and likening to the nature of another, as do the actors and the reflections in the mirror ... We should instead seek that truth which is not self-contradictory and two-faced."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|57,58}} Augustine also challenged the cult of personality, maintaining that hero worship was a form of idolatry in which adulation of actors replaced the worship of God, leading people to miss their true happiness.

{{Quote|text="For in the theatre, dens of iniquity though they may be, if a man is fond of a particular actor, and enjoys his art as a great or even as the very greatest good, he is fond of all who join with him in admiration of his favorite, not for their own sakes, but for the sake of him whom they admire in common; and the more fervent he is in his admiration, the more he works in every way he can to secure new admirers for him, and the more anxious he becomes to show him to others; and if he find anyone comparatively indifferent, he does all he can to excite his interest by urging his favorite's merits. If, however, he meet with anyone who opposes him, he is exceedingly displeased by such a man's contempt of his favorite, and strives in every way he can to remove it. Now, if this be so, what does it become us to do who live in the fellowship of the love of God, the enjoyment of whom is the true happiness of life...?"|sign=|source=}}

==Theatre and church in the Middle Ages==
[[File:ChesterMysteryPlay 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting an early Chester mystery play]]
Around AD 470, as Rome declined, the Roman Church increased in power and influence, and theater was virtually eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Rob, ''Theatre, A Crash Course'', East Sussex, 2003, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, theatrical performance re-emerged as part of church life, telling Bible stories in a dramatic way; The aims of the church and of theater had now converged and there was very little opposition..

One of the few surviving examples of anti-theatrical attitude is found in ''A Treatise of Miraclis Pleyinge,'' a fourteenth-century sermon by an anonymous preacher. The sermon is generally agreed to be of [[Lollard]] inspiration. It is not clear if the text refers to the performance of [[mystery plays]] on the streets or to [[liturgical drama]] in the church. Possibly the author makes no distinction. Barish traces the basis of the preacher's prejudice to the lifelike immediacy of the theater, which sets it in unwelcome competition to everyday life and to the doctrines held in schools and churches. The preacher declares that since a play's basic objective is to please, its purpose must be suspect because [[Christ]] never laughed. If one laughs or cries at a play it is because of the "pathos of the story". One's expression of emotion is therefore useless in the eyes of God. The playmaking itself is at fault. "It is the concerted, organized, professionalized nature of the enterprise that offends so deeply, the fact that it entails planning and teamwork and elaborate preparation, making it different from the kind of sin that is committed inadvertently, or in a fit of ungovernable passion."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|66–70}}

==16th and 17th century{{Anchor|16th and 17th century}}==
[[File:Thomas Becon.jpg|thumb|Thomas Becon c. 1511–1567, early Protestant critic of the theatricality of the Mass|left]]

=== Theatricality in the church ===
In 1559, [[Thomas Becon]], an English priest, wrote ''The Displaying of the Popish Mass'', an early expression of emerging Protestant theology, while in [[Marian exiles|exile]] during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1pXAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR12|title=The Early Works of Thomas Becon: Being the Treatises Published by Him in the Reign of King Henry VIII|author=Becon|first=Thomas|date=1559|publisher=University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|page=xii|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument was with the Church and the ritualised theatricality of the mass. "By introducing ceremonial costume, ritual gesture, and symbolic decor, and by separating the clergy from the laity, the church has perverted a simple communal event into a portentous masquerade, a magic show designed to hoodwink the ignorant." He believed that in a mass with too much pomp, the laity became passive spectators, entertained  in a production that became a substitute for the message of God.&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|161, 165}}

=== English Renaissance theatre ===
{{See also|English Renaissance theatre}}The first English theatres were not built until the last quarter of the 16th century. This was a time of enormous talent, resulting in far greater interest in theatre. One in eight Londoners regularly watched performances of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Jonson and others, an attendance rate only matched since by cinema around 1925–1939.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (2003) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

As theatre grew, so did anti-theatricality. Critics agree that the objections were to [[performance|live performances]], rather than to dramatic work itself or to its writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael O'Connell|title=The Idolatrous Eye: Iconoclasm and Theater in Early-Modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxmuqf7B2REC&amp;pg=PA34|date=13 January 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534402-8|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some objectors made a clear exception for [[closet drama]]s, especially those that were religious or had religious content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marta Straznicky|title=Privacy, Playreading, and Women's Closet Drama, 1550-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1bxX66o_30C&amp;pg=PA16|date=25 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations of Plato's reasoning on mimesis re-emerged.  One problem was the representation of rulers and the high-born by those of low birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Thornton Burnett|author2=Adrian Streete|author3=Ramona Wray|title=The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAKrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267|date=31 October 2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3524-5|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social class was regarded as immutable.

[[File:Ben Jonson by George Vertue 1730 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Ben Jonson, 1730, playwright and challenger of theatrical conventions]]

Another issue was that of effeminization. The [[boy player]] who performed a female role was singled out because he took on female clothing and gesture. Both [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] used cross-dressing as significant themes within their plays, further provoking anxieties about sexual identity. Laura Levine (1994) explores this issue at great depth in ''Men in Women's Clothing: Anti-theatricality and Effeminization, 1579-1642.'' In 1597 [[Stephen Gosson]] said that theatre 'effeminized' the mind. Four years later [[Philip Stubbs|Philip Stubbes]] claimed that male actors who wore women's clothing could 'adulterate' male gender.   Further tracts followed culminating, fifty years later, with [[William Prynne]] who described a man for whom the wearing of women's clothing had caused him to 'degenerate' into a woman.  Prynne's writing may have hastened theatre closure. Levine suggests these opinions reflect a deep anxiety, a view that male identity must be permanently reinforced by male behaviour and clothing, otherwise it will simply collapse into the feminine.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Levine,&amp;nbsp;''Men in Women's Clothing: Anti-theatricality and Effeminization,''&amp;nbsp;Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Men_in_Women_s_Clothing.html?id=RTU4AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosson and Stubbs were both playwrights. The renowned playwright, Ben Jonson, can also be considered anti-theatrical and even anti-anti-theatrical, highlighting the deep-seated ambivalence of the times. He was against the use of theatrical costume because it lent itself to unpleasing mannerisms and an artificial triviality.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|151}} Jonson, in his plays, rejected the Elizabethan theatricality that often relied on special effects. His aim was to restore the true nature of theatre after its long bondage to false conventions.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|134–135}} His own [[court masques]], for which he was well known, were expensive, exclusive spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brocket|first1=Oscar G.|title=History of the Theatre: Foundation Edition|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Boston, New York, San Francisco|isbn=0-205-47360-1|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had his work collected for a [[folio]] printing in 1616, a more lasting medium than the stage.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|138}}

Barish identifies Jonson as belonging to the Christian-Platonic-Stoic tradition "that finds value embodied in what is immutable and unchanging, and tends to dismiss as unreal whatever is past and passing and to come". His plays feature characters who remain silent or static in the face of great obstacles; other characters are foolish in their embracing of a changing world.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|143–5}} Jonson put typical anti-theatrical arguments into the mouth of his [[Puritan]] preacher Zeal-of-the-Land-Busy, in ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]],'' including the Puritan view that men mimicking women was forbidden in the [[Bible]], for in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 22 verse 5, the text states that "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God." [KJV]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Milling|author2=Peter Thomson|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_cGBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA464|date=23 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65040-3|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barish|first1=Jonas|title=The Antitheatrical Prejudice|journal=Critical Quarterly|date=1966|volume=8|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puritan opposition===
{{main|Histriomastix}}[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Prynne cropped.jpg|thumb|William Prynne – author of Histriomastix (1633) a culmination of the Puritan attack on English theatre|left]]William Prynne's  encyclopedic ''[[Histriomastix|Histriomastix''':''' The Player's Scourge, or Actor's Tragedy,]]'' represents the culmination of the Puritan attack on English Renaissance theatre&amp;nbsp;and on celebrations such as&amp;nbsp;[[Christmas]], the latter being derived from pagan Roman festivals. Although a particularly acute and comprehensive attack which emphasised spiritual and moral objections, it represented a common anti-theatrical view held by many during this time.

Prynne's outstanding objection to theater was that it encouraged pleasure and recreation over against work, and that its excitement and effeminacy increased sexual desire.&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|83–85, 88}}

Published in 1633, the ''Histriomastix'' scourged many types of theater in broad, repetitious, and fiery ways. The title page reads:

{{Quote|text="Histrio-mastix. The players scourge, or, actors tragædie, divided into two parts. Wherein it is largely evidenced, by divers arguments, by the concurring authorities and resolutions of sundry texts of Scripture, that popular stage-playes are sinfull, heathenish, lewde, ungodly spectacles, and most pernicious corruptions; condemned in all ages, as intolerable mischiefes to churches, to republickes, to the manners, mindes, and soules of men. And that the profession of play-poets, of stage-players; together with the penning, acting, and frequenting of stage-playes, are unlawfull, infamous and misbeseeming Christians. All pretences to the contrary are here likewise fully answered; and the unlawfulnes of acting, of beholding academicall enterludes, briefly discussed; besides sundry other particulars concerning dancing, dicing, health-drinking, &amp;c. of which the table will informe you."|sign=|source=}}

===1642–1660 Theatre closure===
{{main|1642 London theatre closure}}
By 1642, the Puritan view prevailed. As the [[First English Civil War]] got underway, London theaters were closed down.

Initially, the theatres performed many of the plays of the previous era, though often in adapted forms, but soon, new genres of&amp;nbsp;[[Restoration comedy]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Restoration spectacular]]&amp;nbsp;evolved. A Royal Warrant from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who loved the theatre, brought English women onto the stage for the first time, putting an end to the practice of the 'boy player' and creating an opportunity for actresses to take on 'breeches' roles. This, says historian Antonia Fraser, meant that Nell Gwynn, Peg Hughes and others could show off their pretty legs in shows more titillating than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Women's Lot in Seventeenth-Century England,'' vol. 2, London,1984, p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[George Norman Clark|George Clark]]&amp;nbsp;(1956) said the best-known fact about Restoration drama was that it was immoral. The dramatists mocked at all restraints. Some were gross, others delicately improper. "The dramatists did not merely say anything they liked: they also intended to glory in it and to shock those who did not like it."&lt;ref&gt;Clark,&amp;nbsp;George &amp;nbsp;(1956) ''The Later Stuarts, 1660-1714'', Clarendon Press, Oxford. 2nd ed. p 369&lt;/ref&gt; Antonia Fraser (1984) took a more relaxed approach, describing the Restoration as a liberal or permissive era.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Women's Lot in Seventeenth-Century England,'' vol. 1, 1984, pp. 365-6&lt;/ref&gt; Her perspective possibly reflected the different vantage point of 1980s society compared to that of the 1950s.

The satirist, Tom Brown (1719) wrote, 'tis as hard a matter for a pretty Woman to keep herself honest in a Theatre as 'tis for an Apothecary to keep his treacle from the Flies in Hot Weather, for every Libertine in the Audience will be buzzing about her Honey-Pot...'&lt;ref&gt;''Brown, Thomas, 'Letters from the Dead to the Living''', 1719, cited in Fraser, 1984, vol 2, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The Restoration ushered in the first appearance of the casting couch in English social history. Most actresses were poorly paid and needed to supplement their income in other ways. Of the eighty women who appeared on the Restoration stage, twelve enjoyed an ongoing reputation as courtesans, being maintained by rich admirers of rank (including the King); at least another twelve left the stage to become 'kept women' or prostitutes. It was generally assumed that thirty of the women who had brief stage careers came from the brothels and had later returned to them. About a quarter of the actresses were considered to live respectable lives, most being married to fellow actors.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.H. ''All the King's Ladies, Actresses of the Restoration'', Chicago, 1958, pp. 109-192, quoted in Fraser, 1984 vol 2, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraser reports that 'by the 1670s a respectable woman could not give her profession as "Actoress" and expect to keep either her reputation or her person intact...&amp;nbsp; The word actress had secured in England that raffish connotation which would linger round it, for better or for worse, in fiction as well as in fact, for the next 250 years.'&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Women's Lot in Seventeenth-Century England,'' Vol. 2, 1984, p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century Europe==

Jansenism was the moral adversary to the theater in [[France]], and in that respect similar to Puritanism in England. However, Barish argues, "the debate in France proceeds on an altogether more analytical, more intellectually responsible plane. The antagonists attend more carefully to the business of argument and the rules of logic; they indulge less in digression and anecdote."&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|193}}

===Jansenism===

[[Jansenism|Jansenists]], rather like the Calvinists, denied the freedom of human will stating that "man can do nothing—could not so much as obey the ten commandments—without an express interposition of grace, and when grace came, its force was irresistible". Pleasure was forbidden because it became addictive.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|200–201}} According to [[Pierre Nicole]], a distinguished Jansenist, the moral objection was, not so much about the makers of theater, or about the vice-den of the theater-space itself, or about the disorder it is presumed to cause, but rather about the intrinsically corrupting content. When an actor expresses base actions such as lust, hate, greed, vengeance, and despair, he must draw upon something immoral and unworthy in his own soul. Even positive emotions must be recognised as mere lies performed by [[hypocrites]]. The concern was a psychological one for, by experiencing these things, the actor stirs up heightened, temporal emotions, both in himself and in the audience, emotions that need to be denied. Therefore, both the actor and audience should feel ashamed for their collective participation.&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|194, 196}}

By imitating others, including the good, all things are reduced to ideas and caricatures of themselves. Even with the intent of betterment, imitation leads directly to confusion.

===Rousseau===

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], the Genevan philosopher, held the primary belief that all men were created good and that it was society that attempted to corrupt. Luxurious things were primarily to blame for these moral corruptions and, as stated in his ''Discourse on the Arts'', ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'' and ''Letter to d'Alembert'', the theater was central to this downfall. Rousseau argued for a nobler, simpler life free of the "perpetual charade of illusion, created by self-interest and self-love".The use of women in theater was disturbing for Rousseau; he believed women were designed by nature especially for modest roles and not for those of an actress. "The new society is not in fact to be encouraged to evolve its own morality but to revert to an earlier one, to the paradisal time when men were hardy and virtuous, women housebound and obedient, young girls chaste and innocent. In such a reversion, the theater—with all it symbolizes of the hatefulness of society, its hypocrisies, its rancid politeness, its heartless masqueradings—has no place at all."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|257–258, 282, 294}}
[[File:ShortView1698.png|thumb|Anti-theatrical pamphlet by Jeremy Collier (1698) an expression of post-Restoration views]]

==18th century==
By the end of the 17th century, the moral pendulum had swung back. Contributory factors  included the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]'s dislike of the theatre, and the lawsuits brought against playwrights by the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]] (founded in 1692). When [[Jeremy Collier]] attacked playwrights like [[William Congreve|Congreve]] and [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh]] in his ''[[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage]]'' in 1698, accusing them of profanity, blasphemy, indecency, and undermining public morality through the sympathetic depiction of vice, he was confirming a shift in audience taste that had already taken place.

=== Censorship ===
Censorship of stage plays had been exercised by the [[Master of the Revels]] in England from [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]] until the [[London theatre closure 1642|order]] closing theatres in 1642, closure remaining until the Restoration in 1660. In 1737, a pivotal moment in theatrical history, Parliament enacted the [[Licensing Act 1737|Licensing Act]], a law to censor plays on the basis of both politics and morals (sexual impropriety, blasphemy, and foul language). It also limited spoken drama to the two patent theatres. Plays had to be licensed by the Lord Chamberlain.  Parts of these law were enforced unevenly. The act was modified by the [[Theatres Act 1843]], which led later to the building of many new theatres across the country. Censorship was only finally abolished by the [[Theatres Act 1968|Theatres Act]] in 1968. (As the new medium of film developed in the 20th Century, the 1909 [[Cinematograph Act 1909|Cinematograph Act]] was passed. Initially a health and safety measure, its implementation soon included censorship. In time the [[British Board of Film Classification]] became the ''de facto'' [[Film censorship in the United Kingdom|film censor]] for films in the United Kingdom.)

=== Early America ===

In 1778, just two years after declaring the United States as a nation, a law was passed to abolish theater, [[gambling]], [[horse racing]], and [[cockfighting]], all on the grounds of their sinful nature. This forced theatrical practice into the American universities where it is also met with hostility, particularly from [[Timothy Dwight IV]] of [[Yale University]] and [[John Witherspoon]] of [[Princeton College]].&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|296}} The latter, in his work, ''Serious Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Stage'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/aseriousinquiry00millgoog|title=Serious Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the stage|last=Witherspoon|first=John|date=1812|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined similar arguments to his predecessors, but added a further moral argument that as theater was truthful to life, it was therefore an improper method of instruction. "Now are not the great majority of characters in real life bad? Must not the greatest part of those represented on the stage be bad? And therefore, must not the strong impression which they make upon the spectators be hurtful in the same proportion?"&lt;ref name=Barish/&gt;{{rp|297}}

=== William Wilberforce ===
[[File:Wilberforce john rising.jpg|left|thumb|William Wilberforce (1790) politician, anti-slavery leader, and advocate for evangelical Christianity]]

[[William Wilberforce]], a renowned English politician, had been a theatre-goer in his youth but, following an evangelical conversion while a [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]], gradually changed his attitudes, his behaviour and his lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Hague, William. William Wilberforce: The Life of the Great Anti-Slave Trade Campaigner (2008) (Kindle Locations 1354-). HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, he became a prime leader of the movement to stop the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals and Methodists in the highly popular anti-slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Christopher Leslie (2006), ''Moral Capital: Foundations of British Abolitionism'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 386-387&lt;/ref&gt; Wilberforce expressed his views on authentic faith in ''A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians, in the Middle and Higher Classes in this Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity'' (1797).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Prevailing-Christians-Contrasted-Christianity-ebook/dp/B0082VXMU4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517158431&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=A+Practical+View+of+the+Prevailing+Religious+System+of+Professed+Christians,+in+the+Middle+and+Higher+Classes+in+this+Country,+Contrasted+with+Real+Christianity|title=A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians, in the Middle and Higher Classes in this Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity.|last=Wilberforce|first=William|publisher=Kindle edition|year=1797|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=Section V.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish summarises Wilberforce's description of contemporary theatre as 'a place haunted by debauchees bent on gratifying their appetites, from which modesty and regularity had retreated, while riots and lewdness were invited to the spot where God's name was profaned, and the only lessons to be learned were those Christians should shun like the pains of hell.'&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|303}} The general tone of Wilberforce's argument is less contentious than Barish's summary would suggest and is only a small part of a wider call towards a true godliness. Wilberforce approaches theatricals tentatively, 'I am well aware that I am now about to tread on very tender ground; but it would be an improper deference to the opinions and manners of the age altogether to avoid it. There has been much argument concerning the lawfulness of theatrical amusements'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|202}} Wilberforce also urged potential playgoers to consider the destructive impact of theatre on the moral and spiritual welfare of vulnerable actors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|209}} Biographer and politician, [[William Hague]], says of Wilberforce,&lt;ref&gt;Hague, Ch. 19 (Kindle Locations 9286-9291)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=His ambitious and energetic promotion of his views may well have contributed to the changed social conventions which dominated the Victorian age after his death, creating a British society very different from the licentious London against which he had revolted in the 1780s.

As theatre grew, so also did theatre-based anti-theatricality.

=== Art versus theatre{{Anchor|Art versus theatre}} ===
[[File:Charles Lamb.jpg|thumb|Charles Lamb, Romantic writer and advocate of closet theatre]]
Various notables including [[Lord Byron]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Konstantin Stanislavsky]], [[Eleonora Duse|the actress Eleonora Duse]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], regarded the uncontrollable narcissism of [[Edmund Kean]] and those like him with despair. They were appalled by the self-regarding mania that the theatre induced in those whose lot it was to parade, night after night, before crowds of clamorous admirers. Playwrights found themselves driven towards closet drama, just to avoid the corruption of their work by self-aggrandizing actors.

For Romantic writers such as [[Charles Lamb]], totally devoted to [[Shakespeare]], stage performances inevitably sullied the beauty and integrity of the original work which the mind alone could appreciate. The fault of the theater lay in its superficiality. The delicacy of the written word was crushed by histrionic actors and distracting scenic effects.&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|326–9}} In his essay ''On the Tragedies of Shakespeare, Considered with Reference to Their Fitness for Stage Representation'', Lamb states that "all those delicacies which are so delightful in the reading...are sullied and turned from their very nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/27/21.html|title=On the Tragedies of Shakspere Considered with Reference to Their Fitness for Stage Representation|last=Lamb|first=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian philosopher [[Auguste Comte]], although a keen theater-goer, like Plato, banned all theater from his idealist society. Theater was a "concession to our weakness, a symptom of our irrationality, a kind of placebo of the spirit with which the good society will be able to dispense".&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|323}}

The advent of [[Modernism]] would lead to a completely fresh and trenchant anti-theatricalism, beginning with attacks on [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] who could be considered the 'inventor' of [[avant-garde]] theatricalism. Wagner became the object of Modernism's most polemic anti-theatrical attackers. [[Martin Puchner]] states that Wagner, 'almost like a stage diva himself, continues to stand for everything that may be grandiose and compelling, but also dangerous and objectionable, about the theatre and theatricality.' Critics have included [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Michael Fried]]. Puchner argues that 'No longer interested in banishing actors or closing down theaters, modernist anti-theatricalism does not remain external to the theater but instead becomes a productive force responsible for the theater's most glorious achievements'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Eileen Fisher (1982), describes the anti-theatrical as "spats, self criticism from theater practitioners and fine critics. Such 'prejudices' are usually based upon aesthetic dismay at our theaters' rampant commercialism, general triteness, boring star-system, narcissism, and overreliance on Broadway-style spectacle and razzmatazz."&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Eileen|date=1982|title=[Review of The Antitheatrical Prejudice by Jonas Barish]|journal=Modern Drama|volume=25|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church versus theatre ===
'Psychomachia' applies even more to.the battle of Church versus Stage. The Scottish Presbyterian Church's exertions concerning Kean were more overtly focussed on the spiritual battle. The English newspaper,''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', sometimes known as the ''Actor's Bible,'' reported:&lt;ref&gt;Theatrical Recollections, ''The Era'', 23 November 1856&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text="It is well-known that the Kirk of Scotland, strict, if not somewhat stern in its observances, is utterly opposed to all theatrical exhibitions; in fact, amusement of any kind is in direct opposition to the gloomy Calvinistic tenets on which the Presbyterian Kirk is based. Kean's arrival in Edinburgh made a great stir [c.1820]. In Auld Reekie, the more rigid viewed his coming with anything but pleasure. Many really pious and well-meaning teachers of the word were very strenuous in their exertions to prevent their flocks being contaminated by a visit under such strong temptations. A certain clergyman was extremely anxious to prevent any collision between the lambs of the elect and the children of Satan, as he conscientiously believed his followers and the Corps Dramatique to be, and earnestly cautioned the major part of his flock, particularly his own family, not to go near the theatre."|sign=|source=}}In 1860, the report of a sermon, a now occasional but still ferocious attack on the morality of the theatre, was submitted to ''The Era''  by an actor, S. Price: {{Quote|text="Sir, knowing your valuable paper to be the only medium through which the 'poor player' can defend himself and his honest calling against the bigotry, slander, and unchristian misrepresentations of certain reverend mawworms who occasionally attack the Drama and its expounders, I venture to forward you this communication... These aforesaid mawworms, creaming over with a superabundance of piety, and blinded by too much zeal, forget their divine calling, and stem to profit little by the divine behest which bears reference to evil-speaking and slander."|sign=|source=}}
According to Price, who had attended the service, the minister declared that the present class of professionals, with very few exceptions, were dissipated in private and rakish in public, and that they pandered to the depraved and vitiated tastes of playgoers.&amp;nbsp;Furthermore, theatre managers "held out the strongest inducements to women of an abandoned character to visit their theatres, in order to encourage the attendance of those of the opposite sex."&lt;ref&gt;'The Theatre! Is the Stage Condusive to Morality?', ''The Era'', 4 March 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the opposition was even more intense and ubiquitous.The ''Encyclopedie théologique'' (1847) records: "The excommunication pronounced against comedians, actors, actresses tragic or comic, is of the greatest and most respectable antiquity... it forms part of the general discipline of the French Church... This Church allows them neither the sacraments nor burial; it refuses them its suffrages and its prayers, not only as infamous persons and public sinners, but as excommunicated persons... One must deal with the comedians as with public sinners, remove them from participation with holy things while they belong to the theater, admit when they leave it."&lt;ref name="Barish" /&gt;{{rp|321}}

[[Walter Scott]] drew attention to vantage point when he recalled that a grand-aunt had asked him to get her some books by Restoration playwright [[Aphra Behn]] that she remembered from her youth. She later returned the books, recommending they be burnt and saying, "Is &amp;nbsp;it not a very odd thing that I, an old woman of eighty and upwards, sitting alone, feel myself ashamed to read a book which, sixty years ago, I have heard read aloud for the amusement of large circles, consisting of the first and most creditable society in London."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/STELLA/STARN/prose/WSCOTT/LIFE/chap12.htm|title=Chapter 12 - The Life of Scott|last=Lockhart|first=J.

In [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814), Sir Thomas Bertram gives expression to social anti-theatrical views. Returning from his slave plantations in Antigua, he discovers his adult children preparing an amateur production of [[Elizabeth Inchbald]]'s ''[[Lovers' Vows|Lovers Vows]].''  He argues vehemently, using statements such as "unsafe amusements" and "noisy pleasures" that will "offend his ideas of [[decorum]]" and burns all unbound copies of the play. [[Fanny Price]], the heroine judges that the two leading female roles in ''Lovers Vows'' are "unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty". ''Mansfield Park'', with its strong moralist theme and criticism of corrupted standards, has generated more debate than any other of Austen's works, polarising supporters and critics. It sets up an opposition between a vulnerable young woman with strongly held religious and moral principles against a group of worldly, highly cultivated, well-to-do young people who pursue pleasure without principle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41409993|title=Jane Austen : a life|last=Tomalin|first=Claire.|publisher=Viking|year=1997|isbn=|edition=Penguin 1998|location=London|pages=226–234|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austen herself was an avid theatregoer  and an admirer of actors like Kean.

=== Building bridges ===

==== Earlier divergence of church and stage ====
An editorial in ''The Era'', quoted a contemporary writer outlining the history of the divergence of Church and Stage following the Middle Ages, and arguing that the conflict was unnecessary: 
{{Quote|text="So long as the drama had been content to be mainly the echo of the pulpit, some bond of sympathy, however slight, continued to exist between priests and players. But as soon as the theatre claimed to have a voice of its own, to have its own aims and objects, its own field of enterprise, its own mode of action, that bond was broken. The functions of the church were found to be different from those of the theatre; and because their functions were different the fatal fallacy, which has been, and still is, the cause of so much misunderstanding, sprang at once into existence, that therefore their interests must be opposed."|sign=|source='Clerical Showmen', The Era, 13 November 1886}}In the second half of the 19th century, Evangelical Christians established many societies for the relief of poverty. Some were created to help working women, particularly those whose occupation placed them in 'exceptional moral danger'. Evangelical groups tended towards 'charity' for the oppressed. 'Christian Socialists', distinctively different, (as in the ''Church and Stage Guild'') were more likely to direct their energies towards what they considered to be the root causes of poverty.

==== 1873 The Theatrical Mission ====
The Theatrical Mission was formed by two Evangelicals in 1873 to support vulnerable girls employed in travelling companies, the first being a group in a company that went on tour after performing their pantomime at the Crystal Palace.&amp;nbsp; By 1884, the Mission was sending out some 1,000 supportive letters a month.&amp;nbsp; They then opened a club, '[[William Macready|Macready]] House', in [[Henrietta Street, Covent Garden|Henrietta Street]], close to the London theatres, that provided cheap lunches and teas, and later, accommodation.&amp;nbsp;They looked after children employed on the stage and, for any girl who was pregnant, encouraged her to seek help from the Theatre Ladies Guild which would arrange for the confinement and find other work for her after the baby was born.&lt;ref&gt;Heasman, Kathleen ''Evangelicals in Action'' London 1962 p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The Mission attracted royal patronage. Towards the end of the century, an undercover journalist from ''The Era'' investigated Macready House, reporting it as 'patronising to the profession' and sub-standard.&lt;ref&gt;Opinions are expressed in ''The Era,''&amp;nbsp;10 February 1900, and on other dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1879, ''The Era'', responding to a resurgence of interest in religious circles about the Stage, reported a lecture defending the stage at a Nottingham church gathering. The speaker noted increased tolerance amongst church people and approved of the recent formation of the ''Church and Stage Guild''. For too long, the clergy had referred to theatre as the 'Devil's House'.

{{See also|William Morton (theatre manager)#'Church and Stage'}}
[[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]] was a provincial theatre manager in England whose management experience spanned the 70 years between 1865 and 1935. He often commented on his experiences of theatre and cinema, and also reflected on national trends. He challenged the church when he believed it to be judgmental or hypocritical. He also strove to bring quality entertainment to the masses, though the masses did not always respond to his provision. Over his career, he reported a very gradual acceptance of theatre by the 'respectable classes' and by the church. Morton was a committed Christian though not a party man in religion or politics. A man of principle, he maintained an unusual policy of no-alcohol in all his theatres.

==== 1860s bigotry ====
Morton commented in his memoirs, "At this period there was more bigotry than now. As a rule the religious community looked upon actors and press men as less godly than other people."&lt;ref&gt;'Early Days at Southport', Morton, William (1934).&amp;nbsp;''I Remember. (A Feat of Memory.)''. Market-place. Hull: Goddard. Walker and Brown. Ltd, pp. 40-44.

It also reported that many had considered Morton's profession "a wasteful extravagance which lured young people from the narrow path they should tread".&lt;ref name="One Hundred And Fifty' p. 4"&gt;'One Hundred And Fifty',&amp;nbsp;''Hull Daily Mail,''&amp;nbsp;24 January 1938 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1910 The same goal ====
Morton stated in a public lecture held at Salem Chapel that he censured clergy "when they go out their way to preach against play-acting and warn their flock not to see it".&lt;ref&gt;'Mr. Morton on Amusement',&amp;nbsp;''The Era''&amp;nbsp;,5 March 1910 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In another lecture he said that "the Protestant Church took too prejudiced a view against the stage. Considering their greater temptations I do not consider that actors are any worse than the rest of the community. Both the Church and the Stage are moving to the same goal. No drama is successful which makes vice triumphant. Many of the poor do not go to church and chapel, and but for the theatre they might come to fail to see the advantage in being moral".&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Secrets Of Success, "The Father Of Hull Theatres"',&amp;nbsp;''Hull Daily Mail,''&amp;nbsp;15 November 1910,&amp;nbsp; p. 7 {Lecture given by William Morton at the Fish Street Memorial Schoolroom}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1921 Actor's Church Union ====
Morton received a circular from a Hull vicar, Rev. R. Chalmers. It described his small parish as full of evil-doing aliens, the crime-plotting homeless and a floating population of the theatrical profession. Said&amp;nbsp;''The Stage'', this "represents a survival of that antagonistic spirit to the stage which the work of the Actors' Church Union has done so much to kill".&lt;ref&gt;'Hull has a Hell—',&amp;nbsp;''The Stage,''&amp;nbsp;17 March 1921 p.14&lt;/ref&gt; (Chalmers was noted for his charitable work so the real issue may have been more about poor communication.)

==== 1938 Greater tolerance ====
Morton lived to see greater tolerance. On his hundredth birthday the ''Hull Daily'' ''Mail'' said Morton was held in great respect, "even by those who would not dream of entering any theatre.  Whatever he brought for his patrons, grand opera, musical comedy, drama, or pantomime, came as a clean, wholesome entertainment."&lt;ref name="One Hundred And Fifty' p. 4"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1531">'''The Art Museum Partnership''' (2005&amp;ndash;2012) was a [[New York City]]-based [[non-profit organization]] that provided the nonprofit [[art museum]]s with educational opportunities that facilitate the sharing of information, resources, and collections. The Partnership was primarily established to benefit the small to medium-sized museums that comprise the largest segment in the field. However, larger museums were encouraged to participate, since the challenges in the field are universal and all participants benefit from the knowledge of their peers. The Art Museum Partnership was open to the leaders of all nonprofit art institutions regardless of size or focus.

'''The Directors Forum''' was the signature program of the Art Museum Partnership. The two-and-a-half-day annual conference for museum directors featured panel discussions with some of the most distinguished professionals in the art world. It was held October at renowned museums and cultural institutions in New York City. The goal of this annual conference was to engage museum leaders throughout the nation in an exchange of views on issues of mutual concern.

The '''Art Research Center''' is an independent not-for-profit association in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. In its early days, members included architects, artists, composers, designers, writers and others. Its work was connected with the exploration of abstract Neo-[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], by both individuals and groups.{{r|leo}} The association grew out of an earlier [[Artist-run space|collaborative art gallery project]], and was started by [[Thomas Michael Stephens]] in 1964. The first exhibition was held in 1966.{{r|armin|page=190}} In 1969, Stephens, with Jon Brees Thogmartin and Nancy Ann Stephens, took work by eight artists of the group to the fourth [[New Tendencies]] exhibition in [[Zagreb]], at that time in [[Yugoslavia]]; the works were displayed as a group, forming a cohesive whole.{{r|armin|page=190}}

The Art Research Center's first exhibition ran from October 29, 1966 to January 31, 1967 at a branch of the Kansas City public library. Seven members participated in the first ARC exhibition.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

== The ARC Welders ==
The Art Research Center often recruited artists and musicians to participate in live music concerts.  These concerts included improvised ensemble works by the "ARC Welders."  The ARC Welders in general, consisted of the musicians who happened to be participating in any given event.

At least one of the ARC Welders concerts received favorable reviews from ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Cornelius Ary Renan ''' (1857-1900)  was a French Symbolist painter and anti-clerical social activist.

==Career==
Renan was the son of the Breton scholar [[Ernest Renan]], who pioneered modern secular study of the life of [[Jesus]]. His mother was the daughter of painter [[Hendrik Scheffer]] and the niece of painter [[Ary Scheffer]], after whom he was named. Renan followed his grandfather and great-uncle into a career as an artist, becoming associated with the [[Symbolist movement]]. He studied with Elie Delaunay and [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] (a one time student of his grandfather). He also became a close friend of [[Gustave Moreau]].

Suffering from a physical disability, Ary Renan nevertheless travelled widely, to Asia and Algeria. He also spent a lot of time in Brittany. He exhibited work from 1880. His works are influenced by his travels and by Symbolist poetry.

The [[Musée de la Vie Romantique]] in Paris holds a significant number of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-David Jumeau-Lafond, ''Les Peintres de l'Âme, le Symbolisme idéaliste en France''.&lt;/ref&gt;  His Symbolist masterwork The Diver – The Coral Fisherman, 1882, was purchased by the Columbus Museum of Art (Ohio) in 2014.

==Political activity==
Renan followed his father as a leader of the secularist movement in Brittany. He co-founded the organisation ''Bretons de Paris'', along with [[Armand Dayot]]. It evolved into the [[Bleus de Bretagne|Ligue des bleus de Bretagne]] which grew in Brittany from dissatisfaction with the conservative and clerical bias of the existing [[Breton Regionalist Union]], founded a few months earlier. However, Renan died shortly after its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Loic Thomas, "Armand Dayot et la ligue des bleus de Bretagne", ''Colloque - les Bleus de Bretagne de la revolution a nos jours'', Archives departmental de Saint-Brieuc, 1990, pp. 351-62&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aspire''' (stylized as '''ASPiRE''') is an American [[cable television]] network targeting [[African American]] audiences launched by [[Magic Johnson]] on June 27, 2012.

==History==

==Business plan==
The focus of the network will be "positive, uplifting images of African Americans", according to Johnson. The station intends to deliver films, music and comedy, with a combination of acquired projects and original programming. The programming will include performing arts and shows about faith.&lt;ref name=LltlaTn/&gt;  The show is intended to provide a forum for African American producers and performers.&lt;ref name=MJSDCTTHItCTR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/21/magic-johnson-sean-diddy-combs-toss-their-hats-into-the-cable-tv-ring/|title=Magic Johnson, Sean 'Diddy' Combs Toss Their Hats Into the Cable TV Ring|accessdate=February 24, 2012|date=February 21, 2012|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Gray, Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson is partnering with the [[Gospel Music Channel]]. Johnson said the following about the network: "Aspire will be a network that encourages and challenges African-Americans to reach for their dreams," adding that it "will celebrate our heritage, our groundbreaking achievements and the fearless talent that has shaped American culture."

[[Carl Nielsen]]'s '''''At the Bier of a Young Artist''''' (''Ved en ung Kunstners Baare'') for string orchestra, FS 58, was written for the funeral of the Danish painter [[Oluf Hartmann]] in January 1910.

==Background==
 
Oluf Hartmann was the son of composer [[Emil Hartmann]] and the brother of Bodil Neergaard, the lady of [[Fuglsang Manor]], a gathering place for musicians and artists on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]]. Hartmann died on Sunday, 16 January 1910. By the following Wednesday, Nielsen had completed the draft of his "Andante lamentoso". Perhaps originally written for string quartet, the piece was later adapted by the composer for string orchestra.&lt;ref name="Bier"&gt;Niels Bo Foltmann, "At the Bier of a Young Artist", Orchestral Works 2, [http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/cnu/forord_kilder.html Carl Nielsen Edition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409070144/http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/cnu/forord_kilder.html |date=April 9, 2010 }}, ''Royal Danish Library''. Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-minute piece in [[E-flat minor]] was first performed by the Gade Quartet at Oluf Hartmann’s funeral on 21 January in the chapel at [[Holmens Cemetery|Holmen’s Cemetery]] in [[Copenhagen]]. By April 1912, Nielsen had adapted it for strings in connection with an Easter concert he conducted at the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] in Copenhagen. He conducted the piece on several other occasions during his lifetime and it was also played at his funeral on 9 October 1931 by his son-in-law [[Emil Telmányi]]'s chamber orchestra.&lt;ref name="Bier"/&gt;   

The piece has been known under different names. It was first entitled "Andante doloroso" for the concerts in Copenhagen in 1912 and then it became known as "Andante dolorosa (Ved en ung Kunstners Baare)" or "Andante dolorosa (At the Bier of a Young Artist)".&lt;ref name="Bier"/&gt;

==Music==

Writing in connection with Deutsche Grammophon's recording by the Emerson String Quartet, Anthony Burton writes: "In the dark key of E flat minor, with an initially subdued middle section in D major and a calm major-key ending, it has a poignant intensity quite remarkable for a work of its modest duration".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/special/insights.htms?ID=emerson-intimatevoices Anthony Burton, "Northern Voices"], ''Deutsche Grammophon''. Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Battle of Orsha''''' is a painting of the [[Battle of Orsha]], which was fought on September 8, 1514 between the allied forces of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Jagiellon Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (to the right hand side of the painting) against the [[Vasili III]]'s army of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] (left) as part of the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]].

The painting, the only work of its kind in Polish Renaissance painting, is in the [[National Museum in Warsaw]]. The anonymous "Master of the Battle of Orsha" was probably one of the court painters-cartographers, from his technique and style probably an artist from the circle of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. Meticulous details suggest the artist was himself a witness to the battle. There is a self-portrait of the artist as an unarmed figure in German costume (near bottom, right of centre), sitting on a tree stump on the bank of the [[Dnieper river]], looking at the battle, while framing his fingers to compose a view.

According to one hypothesis the author of the picture was the German artist [[Hans Krell]], court painter of [[Louis II of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=120|title=Polish Commonwealth Treasures: On the History of Polish Collecting from the 13th Century to the Late 18th|author1=Dorota Folga-Januszewska |author2=Andrzej Rottermund |author3=Lech Majewski |publisher=Wydawca Bosz |year=2008 |isbn=8387730815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
The image shows a [[bird's eye view]] of several stages of the battle; the same characters appearing in different places - Hetman [[Konstanty Ostrogski]] is shown three times. Details of equipment and weapons and portraits of the commanders have been recreated realistically and with great accuracy, showing, among others, such scenes as emptying water from armor after crossing the river. Some scenes verge on the grotesque; others emphasize the cruelty of the battle.

The image has not been preserved in its entirety. Careful analysis suggests that it was initially taller and included the horizon. Its asymmetrical composition suggests that 1/5 of the width was trimmed from the left. The two conflicting columns of heavy infantry, presumably once the center of the image, are now shifted to the left. The established date of the image is 1520-1534.

'''Birley Old Hall''' is a small [[English country house]] situated in the Birley Edge area of the City of [[Sheffield]], England. The hall stands in an exposed situation at almost 200 metres above sea level on Edge Lane, some six km NW of the city centre and has been designated a Grade II [[listed building]] by [[English Heritage]] as has the Falconry which stands in the garden.

==History==
The hall was constructed in two phases, the easterly facing wing was constructed in the [[Late Middle Ages]] when it was known as “Byrlay Edge”, it was built with an oak [[cruck]] frame with an exterior of squared stone. Part of the cruck frame can be seen on the Edge Lane side of the original wing. In 1705 J. Carr added a new and more impressive south facing wing at right angles to the original. The 1705 extension has been described as having “restrained elegance” and included the construction of a [[gazebo]] in the garden, called the Falconry. The hall underwent some alterations and additions during the late 18th and mid 19th centuries, including a two-storey addition to the original wing.

The hall was used briefly as a [[Youth Hostel]] in the 1940s and was purchased by [[Sheffield City Council]] after [[World War II]]. In 1959 the council leased the building to the [[steel]] manufacturers Daniel Doncaster and Sons as offices and the hall was extensively restored. The hall and Birley Edge lost much of its rural isolation in the 1960s when the Fox Hill council housing estate was constructed on land to the immediate south. The hall returned to use as a  private dwelling in the early 1980s and once more was totally restored during its conversion back to residential use.&lt;ref name="redfern"&gt;''"Sheffield‘s Remarkable Houses"'', Roger Redfern, The Cottage Press, {{ISBN|0 9519148 3 9}}, Page 16 Gives historical details of hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the house has features such as large fireplaces dating from the 1600s, along with exposed original stone work in one of the lounges and larger bedrooms.

==Architecture==
The hall is constructed from locally quarried squared stone and is L shaped, the 1705 building has a coped date stone above the main door with the inscriptionS “JC 1705” and “DD 1959”. The roofs are [[gable]]d and [[Hip roof|hipped]]. The building has a mixture of [[mullion]]ed, [[Sash window|sash]] and [[Casement window|casement]] windows.&lt;ref name="images 1"&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=457540  Images of England] Gives architectural details of hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="images 2"&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=457541 Images of England] Gives architectural details of Falconry.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Boating on the River Epte''''' (also known as '''''The Canoe on the Epte''''') is an 1890 [[oil painting]] by [[France|French]] [[impressionist]] artist [[Claude Monet]]. It is currently housed at the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]].

Between 1887 and 1890 Monet concerned himself with portraying scenes from the River [[Epte]], which bathed this property at [[Giverny]]. The sisters [[Suzanne Hoschedé|Suzanne]] and [[Blanche Hoschedé Monet|Blanche Hoschedé]] posed for this series of pictures, their late father being banker [[Ernest Hoschedé]], a patron of the arts and collector of [[Monet]], and their mother, [[Alice Hoschedé|Alice]], who became Monet’s second wife. This series began with ''La Barque Rose'' (private collection) and also worthy of mention are canvases ''La Barque à Giverny'' ([[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris]]) and ''En Barque'' ([[National Museum of Western Art]], [[Tokyo]]). The [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] picture, which also has a preparatory study, was mentioned by the artist himself on a letter to critic and friend Geffroy, dated June 22, 1890: “I am again vexed by things that are impossible to do: water with undulating vegetation on the bottom”.&lt;ref name="LOBELLO"&gt;Lobello, 2008, pp. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact one of the more singular characteristics of ''The Canoe on the Epte'' in the Monet context is the proximity of the water, which assumes at the lower part of the composition an almost tactile reality, as if the painter for once did not want to depict the luminous reflections of its surface, but its depth. Although it belongs to a series, the masp work is in this particular a unique case. [[Monet]] here announces materiality, and it is necessary to remember that this new visual dimension of water will only be obtained again over thirty years later in his paintings of the 1918-1924 period. His friendship with photographer Nadar and his genuine interest in photography explain the framing of the composition as well as the out-of-focus effect produced by the movement of the boat on the water to be seen in the Hoschedé sisters. In addition, a possible source of the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] composition, as has been detected, is the [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] engraving, titled ''Woman Collecting Lotus Flowers''.&lt;ref name="LOBELLO" /&gt;

'''''By the Seashore''''' is a painting by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] completed in 1883 and now housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].

== History ==
Renoir made a trip to [[Italy]] in 1881-82 and was deeply influenced by [[Renaissance art]]. After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from [[impressionism]]. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere.

Late in the summer of 1883, Renoir spent about a month in [[St. Peter Port]], the capital of [[Guernsey]], and admired the rocks, cliffs and stunning view of [[Moulin Huet Bay]] in [[St Martin's, Guernsey|St. Martin]]. He painted the starts of fifteen pictures during his stay, most of which were finished later in his [[Paris]] studio. Guernsey lies 48&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of mainland Normandy. Both share the same geology and Guernsey fulfills the "by the sea" criterion in the exhibition title.

However, ''By the Seashore'' is thought to have been painted in the artist's studio. The beach depicted here is probably not in the Channel Islands but near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast. The model was [[Aline Charigot]], his then girlfriend, whom he married in 1890. The arc of the sitter's dark eyebrows and saucily tilted nose in that pleasant, rosy-cheeked face are common to works by Renoir.

==Provenance==
The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan since 1929 from the bequest of Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer.

The [[navel]] has been historically subject to many [[customs]], [[fashion]]s and taboos. Various cultures view the sexual and cultural significance of the navel differently, and these views have changed over time, which has shaped social mores relating to the navel in [[fashion design|design of clothing]] and social traditions and practices.

==Western culture==
The public exposure of the male and female [[midriff]] and bare navel has been [[taboo]] at times in [[Western culture]]s, being considered [[Modesty|immodest]] or [[indecent]]. It was banned in some jurisdictions,&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news|title=New code may reveal navel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eLtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gFMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3939,2026891&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=Mohave Daily Miner|date=24 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some arguing that it simulated an "[[erogenic]] [[Body orifice|orifice]]". Eventually, only female navel exposure was banned and not male because, it was argued, the simulation or upward displacement from vagina to navel was commonplace and obvious in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elaine Perez Zickler|title=Elizabeth Bronfen, The Knotted Subject: Hysteria and Its Discontents |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Spring2001/Bronfen.html |volume=2 |number=2 |date=Spring 2001 |journal=Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community perceptions have changed and exposure of female midriff and navel is more accepted today and in some societies or contexts it is both fashionable and common, though not without its critics. The exposure of the male navel has not been as controversial nor as common, and is usually in the context of barechestedness. Exposure of the navel by females is commonly associated with the popularization of the [[bikini]], of the [[crop top]] and [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise clothing]].

===Film===
In the United States, the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], or Hays Code, enforced after 1934, banned the exposure of female navel in Hollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Moseley |first1=Rachel |title=Fashioning Film Stars: Dress, Culture, Identity |date=2005 |publisher=British Film Institute |isbn=978-1-8445-7067-6 |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dVkAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=navel }}

Marilyn Monroe was allowed to expose her navel in ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962) and later commented, "I guess the censors are willing to recognize that everybody has a navel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bob Thomas|title=Mystique endears 30 years after death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cSdZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CUcNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5273,3224419&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=The Union Democrat|date=24 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Andress]], appearing as [[Honey Rider]] in the 1962 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', wore her iconic [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], which exposed her midriff and navel. However, when [[Annette Funicello]] was cast in her first beach movie ''[[Beach Party]]'' (1963), [[Walt Disney]], who held her contract, insisted that she only wear modest bathing suits and keep her navel covered, to preserve her wholesome persona, though she was the only one of the ample number of young women in the film not bikini-clad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Myth of the Hidden Navel | url=http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/TheMythoftheHiddenNavel.html | accessdate=20 February 2012 | publisher=Beachpartymoviemusic.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103012357/http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/themythofthehiddennavel.html# | archive-date=3 January 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1967 film ''[[Follow That Camel]]'', actress [[Anita Harris]] wore a jewel on her navel for a belly dance sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lenika Cruz|title=Taylor Swift and the Fraught History of Navel-Gazing|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/taylor-swift-and-the-fraught-history-of-navel-gazing/384811/|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=The Atlantic|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should You Believe?|url=http://www.shira.net/costuming/costuming-fact-or-fiction.htm|website=Shira.net|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hays Code was abandoned soon after, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency had also waned by the 1960s. With the withdrawal of the Code and the change to a classification regime, the ban on the exposure of parts of the human body that had previously been regarded as immodest or indecent was withdrawn; and with it there was an increasing level of body exposure over time. The exposure of the navel ceased to be controversial in the context of a general increase in nudity.

During the late 1980s, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s heroines began exposing more skin as well. In the 1989 animated film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', the animated lead protagonist, [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]], flashed her navel while wearing only fins and seashells, a first in Disney's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Bradley |agency=Dallas Morning News |title=Disney animators give Pocahantas the sexiest cartoon image ever |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DyJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hDsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3796,2488695&amp;dq=navel+sexuality&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Beaver County Times |location=Beaver, Pennsylvania |date=12 July 1995 |quote=And in 1989's "The Little Mermaid," rebellious teenager Ariel flashed her navel (a Disney first) wearing little more than fins, a couple of seashells, and some cleavage. |accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, American columnist [[Kathleen Parker]] in an article about [[Katharine Hepburn]] once commented, "Young movie-going girls today don't have access to many in the mold of Katharine Hepburn. Instead by mall observations most are Britney wannabes—hip-hugged, tattooed, pierced and out there. The female navel has become the refrigerator man's continental divide.

===Fashion===
Exposed midriff is associated with the [[crop top]], often in association with [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise clothing]]. Another way that the navel may be exposed is via a deep [[plunging neckline]] dress or top that drops below the natural waist line.

Contrarily, advice columnist [[Ann Landers]] commented, "Navels are neither sexy nor obscene. I do not believe any female of good taste would wear an outfit where her navel shows.

The importance of the navel is such that for Czech model [[Karolína Kurková]], who does not have a navel, the magazine and catalogue art directors routinely airbrush one in for her during post-production. They keep a collection of belly button shots in different positions, and Photoshop them on to her whenever she's doing a bikini picture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1086567/Victorias-Secret-model-Karolina-Kurkova-riddle-missing-belly-button.html Victoria's Secret model Karolina Kurkova and the riddle of her missing belly button].

Displays of the female navel commenced with the introduction of the [[bikini]] in 1946, designed by [[Louis Réard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/articles/article/4918259/114188.htm |title=The Evolution of the Two Piece Swimsuit |date=1 December 2008 |publisher=Glamoursurf Vintage Swimwear and Lingerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; though two-piece swimsuits that exposed the midriff but covered the navel appeared in the 1930s. Réard could not find a model who would dare wear his brief design, so he hired [[Micheline Bernardini]], a 19-year old [[striptease|nude dancer]] from the [[Casino de Paris]], as his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html |title = Michele Bernadini: The First Bikini |first = Judson |last = Rosebush |work = Bikini Science |accessdate = 17 September 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927084552/http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html |archivedate = 27 September 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily Mitchell, [http://www.time.com/time/international/1996/960701/fashion.html "The Bikini Turns 50"], 1 July 1996, Volume 148, No. 1, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The uptake of the new-style swimsuit was very slow, and even then the bikini was not regarded as suitable clothing beyond the beach or pool. During the 1960s, [[Mary Quant]]'s designs featured exposed navels and bare midriffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nadeane Walker|title=Quant Fashions Don't Reveal Everything|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1hwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6p8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2095,4915935&amp;dq=navel+reveal&amp;hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=21 October 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exposure of the male navel was limited well into the 1960s. The swimwear covered the lower abdomen and usually the navel. Occasionally the swimwear would be worn immediately below the navel. The swimwear evolved to longer legs and lower waist line. Male swimwear could not be worn above the navel nor below the knee in events of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Popke |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/high-school-swimming-moves-forward-after-suit-ban.html |title=High School Swimming Moves Forward After Suit Ban |publisher=AthleticBusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American football====
Males often wear no shirt with lower rise shorts during practice. This was somewhat upheld during practice of [[American football]], which was carried over to wearing [[crop top|cropped]] jerseys during 1980s telecasts. Cropped jerseys became dormant for 20 years until male athletes returned to midriff exposure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Marissa Payne |date=29 August 2015 |title=Ohio State's Ezekiel Elliott wants to trademark 'hero in a half-shirt' |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/08/29/ohio-states-ezekiel-elliott-wants-to-trademark-hero-in-a-half-shirt/}}&lt;/ref&gt; for comfort purposes.

The navel is mentioned as an important element of a woman's beauty in the [[Song of Songs]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;Murphy Ronald E (1992) "Song of songs, Book of", in The Anchor Bible Dictionary, vol 6. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annotation"&gt;Dobbs-Allsopp F. W. (2001) Annotation and commentary on "Song of Solomon" in 'The New Oxford Annotated Bible' (with the Apocrypha. Third Edition (Ed) Coogan, M.D. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. page 966 from pages 959–968&lt;/ref&gt; It contains imagery similar to that in the love songs of [[ancient Egyptian literature]].&lt;ref name="Murphy"/&gt; Song of Songs 7:2 states, "Your navel is a rounded bowl."&lt;ref name="NRSV"&gt;''The New Oxford Annotated Bible''. New Revised Standard Version. Oxford: Oxford University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The verse preceding the line mentioning the navel (Song of Songs 7:1) states, "your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand",&lt;ref name="NRSV"/&gt; ) and the verse following states, "Your belly is a heap of wheat."&lt;ref name="NRSV"/&gt; Thus, the description of the navel is placed textually in between the description of the curves of a woman through [[thigh]] and the [[stomach]] or [[midriff]].&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt; "Belly" also suggests the womb, and the combination of the imagery of the womb with that of wheat suggests the link between eroticism and fertility through the imagery of the navel and curvaceous thighs.&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt; These passages also celebrate a curvaceous stomach and midriff and plumpness as aspects of female [[physical attractiveness]].&lt;ref name="Annotation"/&gt;

In the ancient Mediterranean, [[Hebrew]], [[Israelites|Israelite]] and [[Middle Eastern]] [[worldview]], it was a common belief that shrines, important places such as cities or capitals, or other such places of prominence had a position of centrality to the world and hence equated to the child-bearing, life-giving navel of a mother.&lt;ref name="Sperling"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=D |year=1976 |chapter=Navel of the earth |title=The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible: An Illustrated Encyclopedia (Supplementary Volume) |editor=Keith Crim |editor2=Victor Paul Furnish |editor3=Lloyd Richard Bailey Sr. |display-editors = 3 |editor4=Emory Stevens Bucke |location=Nashville |publisher=Abingdon Press |pages=622–623 |isbn=978-0687192694}}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains constituted what could be regarded as important [[Maternal bond|bond]] that linked the universe.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; Thus [[Nippur]], the ancient city of the [[Mesopotamian people]], was often described as the "navel".&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; This suggested to the prominence of the location and the way it was seen to function as a place of centrality and as a link between earth and the heavens and the Universe.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; The [[Greeks]] thought that the conical stone ''[[Omphalos]]'' ("navel") located at [[Delphi]] was the center of the earth.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt;

In a similar vein, in the [[Jewish]] ''[[Midrashim]]'' it is stated, "God created the world like an [[embryo]]. Just as the embryo begins at the navel and continues to grow from that point, so too the world. The Holy One, blessed be he, began the world from its navel. From there it was stretched hither and yon. Where is its navel? [[Jerusalem]]. And its (Jerusalem's) navel itself? The altar."&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jellinek, Beth ha-Midrash, V, 63{{Full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage describes how the centrality of the ancient city of Jerusalem and of the altar of the [[Temple of Jerusalem|ancient temple of Jerusalem]] within cosmic framework was equated to the navel of a mother and the source of life.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; This is also seen in the [[Book of Jubilees]] 8:19 and [[Book of Enoch]] 26:1 where it is describes [[Mount Zion]] as "The center of the navel of the earth".&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; In [[Samaritan]] tradition [[Mount Gerizim]] is described as the navel of the earth, the only place that was not submerged in the [[Rain|deluge]] of the story of [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; The phrase "navel of the earth" is used in (Ezek 38:12; Judg 9:37) [[Aramaic]] ''tibbur'' ("navel") and is also mentioned in Ezek 16:4.&lt;ref name="Sperling"/&gt; According to Samaritan tradition, [[Adam]] was made from the dust of Mount Gerizim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gaster T.

===Early times===
Japan has long had a special regard for the navel. During the early [[Jōmon period]] in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolizes the center of where life begins. On many middle Jomon figurines, the significance of the navel was emphasized with an indentation or hole. Sometimes, the importance of the navel was further enhanced by connecting with a line from the navel towards the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Nelly Naumann]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yrla4QyhFasC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=navel+japan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=l-7kTsmJEaX50gHu_YiGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK#v=snippet&amp;q=navel%20chest&amp;f=false |title=Japanese prehistory: the material and spiritual culture of the Jōmon period |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |year=2000 |isbn=9783447043298 |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Japanese poems feature many references to the female navel.

A similar type festival is held at [[Shibukawa]], north of Tokyo. The idea was formed based on the location of Shibukawa, which is also referred to as the "Belly Button of Japan". The festival is based on a traditional Japanese form of entertainment where revelers paint a face on their torsos and stomachs to appear as a head. A ''[[kimono]]'' is wrapped around the waist, and the person's real head is hidden by a large cloth hat. The belly button is traditionally painted into a mouth. In recent years, modern motifs and Japanese anime designs have appeared in the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Muramoto, Hiroyuki.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a visible navel was very rare.

In 2004, the [[President of Indonesia]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] spoke out against exposed navels, saying, "Indonesian women, who are known for their courtesy, should refrain from exposing their midriffs or belly buttons, which now seems to be taken for granted. There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography." He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, citizens were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy. A week later, a cabinet minister quoted Yudhoyono as saying that he felt "disturbed and uneasy" to see television shows in which women exposed their navels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartafpost.com/news/2004/12/22/contemplating-susilo039s-navel-fixation.html "Contemplating Susilo's navel fixation"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

In 2006, Agus Suwage, an Indonesian artist, installed his Pinkswing Park exhibit at [[Jakarta]]'s international biennale.The exhibit was surrounded by massive panels with multiple pictures of a near-naked man and woman frolicking in a park. Within days of the exhibition's launch, Islamic fundamentalists had descended on the biennale, forcing its closure and demanding prosecutions.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, the fashion trend among young South Korean women for wearing cropped [[T-shirt]]s that leave the midriff exposed had started, due to the hot climatic conditions. The trend spread to create changes in female fashion such that when a policeman in [[Gwangju]] arrested two young women for flaunting their belly buttons in the street, the judge threw the case out, ruling that the flashing of a female navel was not indecent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Navel-flashing Ruled Decent|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-09/features/9410090491_1_south-korea-sexual-harassment-suit-navel|accessdate=22 March 2015|agency=The Economist Newspaper Limited|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=9 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further became popular due to Korean pop culture, where [[K-pop]] stars started wearing body piercings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cara Ribeiro|title=Top 10 Idols with Piercings|url=http://blog.ningin.com/2011/10/07/top-10-idols-with-multiple-piercings/|website=Ningin|accessdate=22 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315032310/http://blog.ningin.com/2011/10/07/top-10-idols-with-multiple-piercings/#|archive-date=15 March 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and midriff-exposing shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rachel|title=Interview: SPICA talks about their comeback and lip-sync|url=http://www.hellokpop.com/news/interview-spica-talks-about-their-comeback-and-lip-sync/|accessdate=22 March 2015|work=HelloKpop|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1997, the South Korean broadcaster [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]] announced tough new rules for pop stars appearing on TV.

The '''Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces''' ({{lang-da|Slots- og Kulturstyrelsen}}) is an agency under the aegis of the [[Ministry of Culture of Denmark|Danish Ministry of Culture]]. The agency carries out the cultural policies of the Danish government within the visual and performing arts, music, literature, museums, historical and cultural heritage, broadcasting, libraries and all types of printed and electronic media. It works internationally in all fields, and increased internationalisation of Danish arts and cultural life is a top priority. The Danish Agency for Culture was founded on 1 January 2002 when the Danish Heritage Agency, the Danish Arts Agency and the Danish Agency for Libraries and Media merged. The Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces was founded on 1 January 2016 by a fusion of the Danish Agency for Culture and the Danish agency ''[[:da:Styrelsen for Slotte &amp; Kulturejendomme|Styrelsen for Slotte &amp; Kulturejendomme]]''.

== Responsibilities ==
=== Sites and monuments ===
Ancient sites and monuments include burial mounds, rock carvings, runic stones, road tracks, military fortifications, castles, ruins, etc. Underwater sites, including shipwrecks more than a hundred years old, are also covered. Construction sites often reveal ancient settlements and burial finds. Many towns have cultural layers from Medieval times to the present.

All sites and monuments are protected from destruction under the Danish Museum Act which is administered by the Heritage Agency.

The Heritage Agency does not own any sites and monuments itself, though it manages the restoration of selected megalithic tombs and Medieval ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/english/sites-and-monuments/ |title=Sites and monuments |publisher=Danish Heritage Agency |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To the extent that the State owns listed buildings, they are owned and administrated by the [[Danish Palaces and Properties Agency|Palaces and Properties Agency]].

=== Listed buildings ===
[[File:Arne Jacobsen benzintank Moerke.jpg|thumb|200px|The still operating [[Skovshoved Petrol Station|Skovshoved Filling Station]], class A listed ]]
There are more than 9,000 listed buildings in Denmark while another 300,000 have been deemed "worthy of preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/english/listed-buildings/ |title=Listed Buildings |publisher=Danish Heritage Agency |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heritage Agency is responsible for listed buildings, while the local authorities are responsible for buildings worthy of preservation. Most listed and preserved buildings are privately owned.

Status as listed is not restricted to very old or very grand buildings. Eligibility extends to everything from castles and mansions to town halls, prisons, farmhouses, factories, warehouses and filling stations.

=== Museums ===
The State owns approximately 10 museums (some of which have departments spread out over many locations), and approximately 120 are approved to receive State subsidies. The Heritage Agency does not run any museums itself, but provides funding and supervises all State-subsidised museums and most of the State-owned museums. These museums are subject to the Danish Museum Act and must comply with a number of its requirements in order to receive funding.

A State-subsidised museum can be an independent institution or it can be owned by one or more local authorities or by an association designed to run it. A private museum cannot be approved for State subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/english/museums/ |title=Museums |publisher=Danish Heritage Agency |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registers ==
=== National Register of Sites and Monuments ===
The National Register of Sites and Monuments (Danish: Kulturhistorisk Centralregister) is a register of all known sites, monuments and archaeological finds. It holds information on more than 165,000 sites, of which some 7,000 are shipwrecks and submarine Stone Age settlements.

In 1873, the [[National Museum of Denmark]] embarked on  a project to map all burial mounds, megalithic tombs, runic stones and other archaeological sites in Denmark. This mapping is the basis of the current digital register.

Under the Danish Museum Act, museums have an obligation to report new finds and activities to the Heritage Agency. This increases the register considerably every year. The register can be accessed here: "Sites and Monuments".  It is in Danish only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/english/sites-and-monuments/register/ |title=Register |publisher=Danish Heritage Agency |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Danish Museums' Collections Registers ===
Museums owned or subsidised by the State must report their collections to two national registers maintained by the Heritage Agency. Both registers are accessible online and hold information on the cultural heritage museums' collections of objects and materials, and the works held by art museums.&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/english/museums/register/ |title=Art register |publisher=Danish Heritage Agency |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Danish Cultural Heritage Register ===
Established in 2004, the register of the cultural heritage museums' collections holds information on approximately two million objects. The register provides a national overview that makes it easier for the museums to coordinate and prioritise their investigations and collections.&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt;

=== Danish Art Register ===
The central register of works of art in Danish museums and collections was established in 1985 and went online in 1996. The register holds information on approximately 100,000 works by Danish and international artists. In addition, it provides access to a digital edition of Weilbach's Dictionary of Danish artists and international artists who have worked in Denmark. Link to the Art in Danish Museums database here (partly in English).&lt;ref name="Register" /&gt;

'''Davi Cheng''' is artist and graphic designer from Hong Kong who combines traditional methods of drawing and painting with advanced digital design techniques.

==Biography==
Davi Cheng was born in Hong Kong into a Christian/Protestant extended family. Her great-grandfather converted to Christianity in 1896 at the First Congregational Church in Territorial Arizona while he was working as a documented laborer. He returned to China in 1902 to spread the Gospel, and Cheng's family remained there until her family immigrated to the United States when she was 14 years old. 

Davi earned a B.A. in Biological Sciences from [[University of California, Berkeley]] with the intention of pursuing a career in the medical field. Instead she gravitated toward art, making detailed sketches and drawings of wildlife. After graduating and working in business for a few years, Cheng went back to school to study computer graphic design. As a visual artist she combines traditional methods of drawing and painting by hand with advanced digital design techniques. She also works as a graphic designer in corporate and nonprofit contexts.

The themes in Cheng's art emerge from her Chinese heritage and her deep engagement with Jewish texts and traditions from a progressive and multicultural perspective. She is a longtime member and past president of [[Beth Chayim Chadashim|Congregation Beth Chayim Chadashim]] (BCC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About BCC|url = http://www.bcc-la.org/about/|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles, and part of the Be'chol Lashon (In Every Tongue)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Be'chol Lashon {{!}} Advocating for the Growth and Diversity of the Jewish People {{!}} Home|url = http://www.bechollashon.org/|website = www.bechollashon.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; international network celebrating Jewish diversity.

Cheng's work is published in ''Women of the Book''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women of the Book: Davi Cheng: Pekudei|url = http://womenofthebook.org/artists/davi-cheng/|website = womenofthebook.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2015), a visual Torah scroll created by 54 Jewish women artists from around the world. Cheng's original interpretation of the Torah portion parshat [[Pekudei]], a pen and ink painting on parchment, was inspired by her Hong Kong childhood superheroes and by images of clouds in ''[[Journey to the West]]'', one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature.

Another painting, "Burning Bush I," was published on the cover of ''Asian Jewish Life''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Art Work by BCC Member Davi Cheng on the cover of Asian Jewish Life magazine {{!}} BCC People|url = http://bcc-la.org/people/art-work-by-bcc-member-davi-cheng-on-the-cover-of-asian-jewish-life-magazine/|website = bcc-la.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine (June 2015, issue 16); on ''The Jewniverse'', "Chinese Art with a Jewish Twist (Or, Jewish Art with a Chinese Twist)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese Art With a Jewish Twist (Or, Jewish Art With a Chinese Twist) {{!}} Jewniverse|url = http://thejewniverse.com/2015/chinese-art-with-a-jewish-twist-or-jewish-art-with-a-chinese-twist/|website = thejewniverse.com|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Ilana Sichel (June 8, 2015); and on ''My Jewish Learning'', "Seamlessly Chinese and Jewish"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seamlessly Chinese and Jewish|url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/jewish-and/seamlessly-chinese-and-jewish/|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Davi Cheng (June 1, 2015).

Cheng designed BCC synagogue's permanent stained glass window installation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BCC's new home|url = http://www.bcc-la.org/about/new-home/|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the centerpiece of which refers to the biblical story of the [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]]. Along with three other artists, she also fabricated and installed all twelve panes (measuring 30" x 40" each). She has created other art works for the sanctuary, collaborating with Jerry Hanson on a set of stained glass Ark doors and a solar-powered ''Ner Tamid'' ("eternal light") made with more than a thousand one-inch glass squares.

==Personal life==
Cheng plays trumpet and French horn and co-founded and performs in Beth Chayim Chadashim's Klezmer band, Gay Gezunt, and also sings in the synagogue's choir. She lives with her spouse Bracha Yael Cheng in Los Angeles.

The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the southern edge of [[Schenley Plaza]], opposite [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|The Carnegie Institute]], and is the home of Pitt's History of Art and Architecture Department, Studio Arts Department, and the Frick Fine Arts Library. Before its front steps is [[Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain]].

==History==
[[File:Frick Fine Arts Building - Pitt - IMG 0762.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Clay Frick]] portrait by [[Malvina Hoffman]] on the facade of the building]]
The Frick Fine Arts Building sits on the site of the former [[Schenley Park Casino]], Pittsburgh's first multi-purpose arena with an indoor ice skating rink, sat on the location of the building before burning down in December 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/SchenleyPark.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627195733/http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/SchenleyPark.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building itself is a gift of [[Helen Clay Frick]] (1888–1984), daughter of the Pittsburgh industrialist and art patron [[Henry Clay Frick]] (1849–1919). She established the [[Fine Arts]] Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 1926 and continued to fund it through the 1950s, when she first made a commitment to create a separate structure to house it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/ffab.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627200101/http://www.haa.pitt.edu/resources/documents/ffab.pdf |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Land for the project was donated to the university by the City of Pittsburgh.

In early negotiations with the University of Pittsburgh, Miss Frick asked that successors to the [[New York City|New York]] architects [[Carrère and Hastings]] design the new facility after the Italian [[palazzo]] its firm had built in [[Manhattan]] for her father some fifty years earlier. Eventually, however, both parties agreed to Burton Kenneth Johnstone Associates as the architects. Its design is modeled after [[Pope Julius III]]'s (1487–1555) [[Villa Giulia]] in [[Rome, Italy]]. The building is constructed of white limestone and marble with a terracotta tile roof around a central courtyard. An octagonal cupola, which caps the central rotunda, rises 45 feet above the ground.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The building houses the University of Pittsburgh's Department of History of Art and Architecture, and contains classrooms, an open cloister, an art gallery, a 200-seat auditorium, as well as a research library. Construction began in 1962 and the building was opened in May 1965.

By the late 1960s Miss Frick, unhappy that the university did not conform to her restrictions on management of both the department and the new building, severed her ties with the University of Pittsburgh. She responded by creating a new venture, [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center|The Frick Art Museum]], on the property of her ancestral home, Clayton, a few miles east in Pittsburgh's [[Point Breeze, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Point Breeze]] neighborhood. That museum operates today as a part of the [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center]] complex.

==Building use and features==
[[File:Art gallery at the Frick Fine Arts Building 2.jpg|thumb|The Nicholas Lochoff Cloister of Frick Fine Arts Building]]
The Frick Fine Arts Building consists of classrooms, a library, and art galleries around an open cloister and contains a {{convert|45|ft|m}} high octagon capped by a pyramidal roof.&lt;ref name="TokerNewPortrait"&gt;{{cite book |title=Pittsburgh: A New Portrait |first=Franklin |last=Toker |year=2009 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |location=Pittsburgh, PA |page=335 |ISBN=0-8229-4371-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted 1965 low relief portrait of Henry Clay Frick by [[Malvina Hoffman]] in limestone sits above the entrance to the building. Hoffman was 79 years old when she accepted the commission. She could not sculpt it herself because union rules prevented sculptors from working on a relief attached to a building. However, she climbed up on the scaffolding to oversee the completion of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicartpittsburgh.org/pdf_files/PAPP_Oakland_Walking_Tour.pdf |title=Office of Public Art - Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council |publisher=Publicartpittsburgh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/uag/Art-Anytime-Page/Pittsburgh-Sculpture/Hoffman-Frick-Pages/index.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610121238/http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/uag/Art-Anytime-Page/Pittsburgh-Sculpture/Hoffman-Frick-Pages/index.htm |date=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the main entrance, a neon work by contemporary Chinese artist [[Gu Wenda]] is installed in the lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haa.pitt.edu/node/494|title=History of Art and Architecture: Permanent Collection|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building also contains a 200-seat auditorium that is used for lectures, performances, and special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidde.pitt.edu/classrooms/fkart_125.html|title=Media Enhanced Classrooms: Frick Fine Arts 125|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Center or Instructional Development &amp; Distance Education|date=September 30, 2011|accessdate=February 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608053358/http://www.cidde.pitt.edu/classrooms/fkart_125.html|archivedate=June 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nicholas Lochoff Cloister==
[[File:FrickFineArtsLibrary.jpg|thumb|upright|The Frick Fine Arts Library]]
The [[Nicholas Lochoff Cloister]] is a main feature of the Frick Fine Arts Building. Its large paintings of [[Italian art|Italian]] masterpieces are scale reproductions that were commissioned in 1911 from [[Nicholas Lochoff]] by the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts (now the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]]). Lochoff worked slowly and carefully. Only a few paintings were completed and sent back to [[Russia]] by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. Lochoff, unable to return because of new communist regime, felt compelled to sell off the paintings. Buyers included [[Harvard University]] and the Frick Art Reference Library in New York. Miss Frick acquired the entire collection, however, after Lochoff's death, with the help of art critic [[Bernard Berenson]]. In 2003, the paintings were cleaned and restored by Christine Daulton. Also in the gallery are noted [[Carrara]] marble reproductions of 14th century [[Annunciation]] figures by sculptor [[Alceo Dossena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=amwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7276%2C900049 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712004825/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9cNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=amwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7276,900049 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=Pitt Fakes Given New Importance |first=Donald |last=Miller |date=1968-12-05 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in Frick Fine Arts Building, this two-story library houses a circulating research collection serving the Department of the History of Art and Architecture. The Collection contains over 90,000 volumes and subscribes to more than 350 journals in relevant fields and is ranked among the top 10 fine art libraries in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/frick/fine_arts.html |title=Frick Fine Arts Library - University Library System - University of Pittsburgh |publisher=Library.pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525110603/http://www.library.pitt.edu/libraries/frick/fine_arts.html |archivedate=2012-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.pitt.edu/tour/tour-060.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819184916/http://www.umc.pitt.edu/tour/tour-060.html |date=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The library's reading room is constructed of fruit wood paneling and cabinetwork with gold leaf trim designed by Italian craftsmen.  The library is further appointed by wrought iron balcony railings, terracotta tile flooring, maple tables with matching Windsor chairs, and ceiling-high windows furnishing views of [[Schenley Park]].

'''Genre''' ({{ety|fr|genre|kind, sort}}) is any form or type of [[communication]] in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed upon conventions developed over time. Genre is most popularly known as a [[Category of being|category]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.

Genre began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[Poetry]] ([[ode]]s,  [[Epic poetry|epics]], etc.), [[prose]], and [[performance]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.

In later periods{{when?|date=March 2018}} genres proliferated and developed in response to changes in audiences and creators.  Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.

Genre suffers from the ills of any classification system. It has been suggested{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as because of the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents{{who?|date=March 2018}} argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

==Visual arts==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|A genre painting (''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder) ]]

The term ''genre'' is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in [[art history]] has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. [[Genre painting]] is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches{{spaced ndash}}in other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. These are distinguished from [[staffage]]: incidental figures in what is primarily a [[landscape art|landscape]] or architectural painting. ''Genre painting'' may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper, and other specialized types of paintings such as [[still-life]], landscapes, [[marine painting]]s and animal paintings.

The concept of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries.  It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the [[Académie française]] which held a central role in [[academic art]]. The genres in hierarchical order are:
* [[History painting]], including narrative religious mythological and allegorical subjects
* [[Portrait painting]]
* Genre painting or scenes of everyday life
* Landscape (landscapists were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]) and cityscape
* [[Animal painter|Animal painting]]
* [[Still life]]

==Literature==
{{Literature}}
{{Main article|Literary genre|List of literary genres}}
A literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by [[literary technique]], [[setting tone|tone]], [[Content (media)|content]], or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, [[young adult fiction|young adult]], or [[children's literature|children's]].  They also must not be confused with format, such as [[graphic novel]] or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) [[epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[comedy]], [[novel]], and [[short story]]. They can all be in the genres [[prose]] or [[poetry]], which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as [[satire]] might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general [[cultural movement]] of the [[historical period]] in which they were composed.  In [[popular fiction]], which is especially divided by genres, [[genre fiction]] is the more usual term.

In [[literature]], genre has been known as an intangible [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].  This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever.The earliest recorded systems of genre in [[Western world|Western history]] can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of ''The Architext'', describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and [[Epic (genre)|epic]] (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). [[Lyric poetry]], the fourth and final type of [[Greek literature]], was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse.  Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis.

Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]] (superior-dramatic dialogue), [[epic poetry|epic]] (superior-mixed narrative), [[comedy]] (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and [[parody]] (inferior-mixed narrative). Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the [[Romanticism|romantic period]], replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to "dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…" (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.

Genette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse" (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.

==Film==
{{main article|Film genre}}
The basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the [[feature film]] and most [[cartoon]]s, and [[documentary]].  Most dramatic feature films, especially from [[Hollywood]] fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the [[Western film|Western]], [[war film]], [[horror film]], [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy film]], [[musical film|musical]], [[crime film]], and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical.

==Music==
{{main article|Music genre}}
A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 "Genre"]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There are numerous genres in Western [[classical music]] and [[popular music]], as well as [[musical theatre]] and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern [[rock music]], that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the "appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them".&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. According to Green, "Beethoven's ''Op. 61'' and Mendelssohn's ''Op. 64'' are identical in genre&amp;nbsp;– both are violin concertos&amp;nbsp;– but different in form. However, Mozart's ''Rondo for Piano, K. 511'', and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his ''Mass, K. 317'' are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Form in Tonal Music |last=Green |first=Douglass M. |year=1965 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc |isbn=0-03-020286-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or "basic musical language".&lt;ref name=Pete&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music |last=van der Merwe |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist) |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-316121-4 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, Allan F.
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3526163 "Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre"]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.

Several music scholars have criticised the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that "music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds."&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"/&gt;

==Popular culture and other media==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as [[video game genres]]. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes.  The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.

==Linguistics==
In [[philosophy of language]], genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Bakhtin's basic observations were of "speech genres" (the idea of [[heteroglossia]]), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as "formal letter" and "grocery list", or "university lecture" and "personal anecdote"). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of [[Georg Lukács]] also touches on the nature of [[literary genre]]s, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. [[Norman Fairclough]] has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are "different ways of (inter)acting discoursally" (Fairclough, 2003: 26).

A text's genre may be determined by its:

# Linguistic function.
# Formal traits.
# Textual organization.
# Relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text (Charaudeau and Maingueneau, 2002:278–280).

==Rhetoric==
In the field of [[rhetoric]], genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, A. S., &amp; Mary Jo Reiff. (2010). [http://wac.colostate.edu/books/bawarshi_reiff/ Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.] chs. 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. R. (1984). Genre as social action. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 70(2), 151–167.&lt;/ref&gt; work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on [[Lloyd Bitzer]]'s concept of rhetorical situation,&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L. F. (1968). The Rhetorical Situation. Philosophy and Rhetoric, 1(1), 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on [[Alfred Schütz]],&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, A., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1973). The Structures of the Life-World. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; she reasons that these recurring responses become "typified" – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these "typified rhetorical actions" (p.&amp;nbsp;151) are properly understood as genres.

Building off of Miller, [[Charles Bazerman]] and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of "genre systems",&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, C. (1994). Systems of Genre and the Enactment of Social Intentions. In Genre and the New Rhetoric (pp. 79–101). London/Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of "genre ecologies".&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, C., &amp; Zachry, M. (2000). Genre Ecologies : An Open-System Approach to Understanding and Constructing Documentation. ACM Journal of Computer Documentation, 24(3), 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with [[activity theory]], David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. R. (1995). Activity theory and its implications for writing instruction. In J. Petraglia (Ed.), Reconceiving writing, rethinking writing instruction (pp. 51–78). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic "mutt genres" that are often of little use outside of composition courses.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, E. (2009). "Mutt Genres" and the Goal of FYC: Can we Help Students Write the Genres of the University? College Composition and Communication, 60(4), 765–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by [[Plato]]. Plato divided [[literature]] into the three classic genres accepted in [[Ancient Greece]]: [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[prose]]. [[Poetry]] is further subdivided into [[epic poetry|epic]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], and [[drama]]. The divisions are recognized as being set by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of [[poetry]].

===Classical and Romance genre theory===
The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle#Rhetoric and poetics|Aristotle]]. [[Gérard Genette]] explains his interpretation of the history of genre in "The Architext". He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the [[drama]]; pure narrative, the [[dithyramb]]; and a mixture of the two, the [[Epic (genre)|epic]]. Plato excluded [[lyric poetry]] as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of [[mode (literature)|mode]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], and [[Medium (communication)|medium]] can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]], [[Epic (genre)|epic]], [[comedy]], and [[parody]].

Genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. [[Lyric poetry]], once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third "Architext", a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to "dominate all the literary theory of [[German romanticism]]" (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel's]] triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse".

==Culture==
Genre is embedded in [[culture]] but may clash with it at times. There are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre. Anthony Pare's studied Inuit social workers in "Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions and Ideology". In this study, Pare described the conflict between the genre of Inuit social workers' record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre. Amy Devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay, "A Theory of Genre" by adding "culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible" (Devitt 24).

Genre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components. Genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously; people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society. Devitt touches on Miller's idea of situation, but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal. Individuals may find themselves shaping the rhetorical situations, which in turn affect the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation. Because the social workers worked closely with different families, they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field. Giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community.

==Audiences==
Although genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.

Genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as [[magazine]]s and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.

The term may be used in categorizing [[web page]]s, like "news page" and "fan page", with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like [[Vivísimo]] try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.

==Subgenre==
A subgenre is a [[Hierarchy|subordinate]] within a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subgenre|title=subgenre|publisher=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subgenre|title=Subgenre|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a [[fantasy]] story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of [[dark fantasy]]; whereas another fantasy story that features [[magic sword]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would belong to the subgenre of [[sword and sorcery]].

The '''Golden Age of Finnish Art''' coincided with the national awakening during the time 1880&amp;ndash;1910. Themes during the period were often influenced by ''[[Kalevala]]'' and were visible in [[Art in Finland|visual arts]], [[Finnish literature|literature]], [[Music of Finland|music]] and [[Architecture of Finland|architecture]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://neba.finlit.fi/kalevala/index.php?m=81&amp;s=82&amp;l=1 | title = Kalevala - Suomen taiteen kultakausi | publisher = Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central figure of the time was [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]. Other notable figures were [[Pekka Halonen]], [[Albert Edelfelt]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Eino Leino]], [[Helene Schjerfbeck]], [[Eero Järnefelt]], [[Emil Wikström]] and [[Eliel Saarinen]].

Finnish art became known also in Europe at [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris 1900]] World Fair, where Finnish pavilion was one of the most popular pavilions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kumu.ekm.ee/en/the-golden-age-of-finnish-art/ | title = The Golden Age of Finnish Art | publisher = Art Museum of Estonia | access-date = 2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idital''' is a form of [[Saura painting]](ikons) associated with the [[Sora people|Saura tribals]] in the [[Odisha|state of Odisha]] in [[India]] and mostly found in [[Rayagada district|Rayagada]], Gajapati and Koraput districts of Orissa. The tribal deity "IDITAL" (also ''edital'') commands great religious devotion from the tribal people. Each Idital contains various symbols and signs and convey special meaning for which it is meant. Few examples of iditals are (1) Jodisum and Jananglasum, 
  
==Origin and History==

Seven out of sixty two tribes of Orissa decorate their wall with mural paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vaishalisethi.com/aboutart.html "About Soura Art"]&lt;/ref&gt; Souras are specially famous for their rich veriety of paintings based on religious and ceremonial themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/orissareview/jan2005/englishPdf/Souras_Paintings.pdf " The Souras &amp; their Panoramic Paintings"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissatourism.org/orissa-paintings.html "Odisha (Orissa) Paintings"]&lt;/ref&gt; They have invariably religious association for which they are called italons or ikons. Ikons were originally painted on the walls of the Saura's adobe huts. Ikons are worshipped during special religious and cultural occasions such as child-birth, harvest, marriage and the construction of a new house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110119/jsp/orissa/story_13459472.jsp "Traditional drawings of Saoras is on verge of extinction"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.importantindia.com/1633/tribal-paintings-of-orissa "Tribal Paintings of Orissa"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scstrti.in/exhibition.html "Tribal Museum"]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally made to appease the Gods and ancestors.

==Theme, Color and Style==

These icon’s line drawings are based on geometrical forms. The forms are very easiest to draw and the composition of themes are very simple. People, [[horses]], [[elephants]], the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] and the [[tree of life]] are recurring [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] in these ikons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://orissatribalart.wordpress.com/2010/04/25/idital-tribe-soura "IDITAL TRIBE–SOURA"]&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings' backdrop is prepared from red or [[yellow ochre]] earth which is then painted over using brushes fashioned from tender [[Bamboo Shoots|bamboo shoots]]. Ikons use natural dyes and chromes derived from ground white stone, hued earth, and [[vermilion]] and mixtures of [[tamarind]] seed, flower and leaf extracts.&lt;ref name="deccanherald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeless images|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/191569/timeless-images.html|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiantribalheritage.org/?p=3983 "Centre develops Saura tribal paintings of Raygada – Odisha"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tdccorissa.org/TO_Saora.asp "TRIBES ODISHA - SAORA IDTAL PAINTINGS"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idyllwild Arts Foundation''' encompasses two institutions in [[Idyllwild, California]] for training in the arts: '''[[Idyllwild Arts Academy]]''' ('''IAA''') and the '''Idyllwild Arts Summer Program'''.  The institution was formerly known as '''Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts''' ('''ISOMATA''').

Idyllwild Arts is in the San Jacinto Mountains above [[Palm Springs, California]] in the [[San Bernardino National Forest]], at an elevation of {{convert|5300|ft|m}}, 2 hours from Los Angeles, 2 hours from San Diego and 1 hour from Palm Springs.

==History==
Idyllwild Arts was founded by Dr. Max Krone and his wife, Beatrice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|title=Beatrice Perham Krone; Co-Founder of Idyllwild Arts School|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/24/local/me-9641|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Envisioning a remote place where people of all backgrounds could come together to experience the arts, they established the Idyllwild Arts Foundation in 1946 and purchased acreage in the San Jacinto Mountains on which to build.  In 1950, approximately one hundred adult students began attending summer classes in the arts.

Over the years, summer activities have continued to grow, expanding to include programs for children of all ages, a Family Camp, Metals Week, Native American Arts Festival and the Chamber Music Festival.  Classes in music, dance, theatre, visual arts, film, writing and Native American arts are offered to students from age 5 to adult.  Each year over 1800 adults and children attend Idyllwild Arts Summer Program courses. Norman Corwin, Ansel Adams, Herbert Zipper, Marguerite N. Clapp, Mark Wilke, Bella Lewitzky, Fritz Scholder, Maria Martinez, Lucy Lewis, Meredith Willson and other luminaries taught courses there in the summer.

In 1964, the school was given to the [[University of Southern California]] under the terms of an agreement with the Idyllwild Arts Foundation.  In 1983, the Foundation exercised its option to resume independent management and resumed sole ownership of the school.  In 1985, the first independent boarding high school for the arts in the western United States, the Idyllwild Arts Academy, was established.

==Idyllwild Arts Academy==
{{Main|Idyllwild Arts Academy}}
Idyllwild Arts Academy, the boarding school, offers a college preparatory program for grades 9–12 and post-graduates, with training in music, theater, dance, visual art, creative writing, film and interdisciplinary arts. An audition or portfolio is required for admission.

==Idyllwild Arts Summer Program==
The Idyllwild Arts Summer Program which began in the summer of 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PRWEB|title=Idyllwild Arts Summer Program Students to Present a Community Concert|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb10989977.htm|publisher=prweb.com|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  includes more than 95 workshops. These are taught by professional artist-teachers, in dance, music, theatre, visual arts, creative writing, poetry, filmmaking, and Native Arts.

The program for young people features a Children's Center whose participants range in age from 5 to 12 and who select classes and workshops in a variety of arts including multi-arts, dance, piano, theatre, visual arts, poetry and journal writing.

Junior Artist's Center (ages 11–13) and Youth Arts Center (ages 13–18) offer courses to accommodate a broad range of skill levels and a wide variety of art experiences. Music opportunities include musical theatre, piano classes, jazz workshop, two bands, two orchestras and chamber music. Visual artists can select courses from introductory art exploration to ceramics, advanced painting and drawing, jewelry, photography, computer animation, mixed media, and video production. Writers can take poetry, fiction and playwriting workshops. Dancers participate in ballet, jazz and modern. Actors may take up to six weeks of Theatre Festival workshops, each of which includes a major performance.

Each year, Idyllwild Arts provides financial aid for young people with limited financial resources: twenty-five percent of young people who participate in an arts workshop are awarded financial aid totaling approximately $500,000.

Part of the program involves theme-related workshops, seminars and performances featuring artists, poets and musicians. Programs include: Native American Arts, Metals Week &amp; the Chamber Music Festival.

The culmination of the Summer Program is celebrated with a concert by the Festival Choir, Festival Wind Ensemble and the Festival Orchestra.  In previous years this concert ended with a performance of [[Meredith Willson]]'s "In Idyllwild" by the combined ensembles.

== History ==
HOBT began in 1973 as '''Powderhorn Puppet Theatre''', named for a neighborhood park and lake in Minneapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url|url=https://hobt.org/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the theatre organized their first May Day procession and event.&lt;ref name=ToW&gt;{{cite book |title=Theatre of Wonder: 25 Years in the Heart of the Beast |year= 1999 |editor-first=Colleen J. |editor-last=Sheehy |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0816634200 |url=https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/theatre-of-wonder }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50-51}} About 50-60 people and a few puppets marched, raised a [[maypole]] in the park, and had some speeches. In the next years, the event grew and evolved into a way to celebrate community builders.&lt;ref name=ToW /&gt;{{rp|51}}

In 1979, the theatre changed its name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hobt.org/about/our-name/ |title=About Our Name |publisher=In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on a suggestion by poet and theatre member Steven Lisner.&lt;ref name=ToW /&gt;{{rp|45}} In 1987, they moved into the Avalon Theater, a former [[Movie theater|cinema]] originally built in 1909 as the Royal Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5331 |title=Avalon Theater in Minneapolis, MN |author=Sean Ryan |publisher=Cinema Treasures |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; HOBT purchased the Avalon Theater in 1990 for the building and staging of productions.

In 1999, the [[Weisman Art Museum]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] exhibited ''Theatre of Wonder: Twenty-five Years In the Heart of the Beast'', celebrating the works and productions by the theatre.&lt;ref name=ToW /&gt;{{rp|1}}

In 2017, the theatre received $275,000 from the will of Sarah Bowman, a performer and longtime supporter of the theatre. The funds are planned to be used in upgrading the theatre building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twincities.com/2017/08/07/late-heart-of-the-beast-theater-supporterperformers-gift-will-fund-big-things/ |title=Late Heart of the Beast theater supporter/performer's gift will fund big things |author=Chris Hewitt |publisher=Pioneer Press |date=August 7, 2017 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the organization was awarded a grant by [[The Jerome Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twincitiesarts.com/2018/06/15/news-jerome-foundation-announces-inaugural-organization-grant-recipients/ |title=NEWS: Jerome Foundation Announces Inaugural Organization Grant Recipients |author=Basil Considine |date=June 15, 2018 |publisher=Twin Cities Arts Reader |accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Elliott Bama''' (born April 28, 1926, [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[New York (state)|New York]])&lt;ref name="Mantle Fielding's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Brian M.|title=James Bama: American Realist|year=2006|publisher=Flesk|location=Santa Cruz, CA|isbn=0-9723758-8-0|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[artist]] known for his realistic paintings and etchings of [[Western United States|Western]] subjects. Life in [[Wyoming]] led to his comment, "Here an artist can trace the beginnings of Western history, see the first buildings, the oldest wagons, saddles and guns, and be up close to the remnants of Indian culture ... And you can stand surrounded by nature's wonders."

==Biography==
Born in [[Manhattan]] in 1926, he grew up copying [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[comic strip]]. He had his first professional sale when he was 15, a drawing of [[Yankee Stadium]] in the ''[[New York Journal-American]]''. He graduated from New York's [[The High School of Music and Art|High School of Music and Art]] and entered the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]], working as a mechanic, [[mural]] painter, and physical training instructor.

When discharged from the service, and back in New York City, he studied drawing and anatomy at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]]. Beginning in 1951, he was an illustrator at New York's Charles E. Cooper Studios for 15 years. His first paperback cover was Nelson Nye's ''A Bullet for Billy the Kid'' (1950). Bama had a 22-year career as a successful [[commercial artist]], producing paperback book covers, movie posters and illustrations for such publications as ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and his numerous clients included the New York Giants football team, the Baseball and Football Halls of Fame and the U.S. Air Force. Beginning with ''The Man of Bronze'' (1964), he did a powerful set of 62 covers for the ''[[Doc Savage]]'' Bantam Books paperbacks, often using as a model actor [[Steve Holland (actor)|Steve Holland]], star of TV's ''Flash Gordon'' (1954–55). He also painted the box cover art for [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]]'s monster model kits, including [[King Kong]], [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]], [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and [[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdevito.com/tim.htm The Art of Joe DeVito - Tim Lasiuta Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 he married Lynne Klepfer, a New York University graduate with an art history major. Two years later, in June, 1966, the couple headed west as guests of artist Bob Meyers at his Circle M ranch near [[Cody, Wyoming]]. Meyers had walked out on his career as a successful Manhattan illustrator with such magazines as ''[[True (magazine)|True]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' to run his ranch and paint. After return visits in 1967, the Bamas left New York and moved during September, 1968, into a cabin on Meyers’ ranch. Bama began to paint contemporary Western subjects during the daytime while doing his freelance illustrations in the evenings. He recalled, "I never came out here with the idea to be a Western artist. It just happened, and that’s the way it should be."

In 1970 Bob Meyers was murdered, and his widow Helen moved from the ranch. The Bamas moved to a house on Dunn Creek, Wapiti, 20 miles outside Cody, in 1971. In May, 1971, Bama connected with a New York dealer, prompting his decision to abandon illustration and put his total concentration into the creation of easel paintings. In Wapiti, James and Lynne Bama built a home and studio, moving into it when their son Ben was born in 1977.

His work is collected in ''The Western Art of James Bama'' (Bantam Books, 1975) and ''The Art of James Bama'' (1993). Brian M. Kane's ''James Bama: American Realist'' (Flesk, 2006) has an introduction by [[Harlan Ellison]].

==Style==
Bama's art is realism. He sometimes takes advantage of his medium to use lighting techniques—such as [[Butterfly (lighting)|butterfly lighting]]—that would not be practical in a photograph taken under ambient light.

==Awards==
Bama was inducted into the Illustrator’s Hall of Fame on June 28, 2000. At the [[Buffalo Bill Historical Center]], when he was the first Honored Artist at the Buffalo Bill Art Show in 2003, Bama commented, "Everything I’ve done — the rodeo, the trappers, the mountain men — has been done around here. The fact that I’m from Cody makes this very significant to me. They’re really honoring Cody and the Buffalo Bill Historical Center."

He was inducted into the Monster Kid Hall Of Fame at [[The Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Jules Semon Bache''' (November 9, 1861 – March 24, 1944) was an [[United States|American]] [[banker]], [[art collector]] and [[philanthropist]].

== Early life ==
Julius Bache was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-history/2008/best-friends-jewish-society-in-old-palm-beach New York Social Diary: "Best Friends: Jewish Society in Old Palm Beach"] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1xAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=jules+bache#v=onepage&amp;q=jules%20bache&amp;f=false The American Hebrew: "Jule S.

==Career==
In 1881, he started work as a cashier at Leopold Cahn &amp; Co., a [[stockbroker]]age firm founded by his uncle. In 1886, he was made a minority partner and in 1892 took full control of the business, renaming it [[Bache &amp; Co.|J. S. Bache &amp; Co.]] Jules Bache built the company into one of the top brokerage houses in the United States, outranked only by [[Merrill Lynch]]. In the process, he became an immensely wealthy individual, a patron of the arts, and a philanthropist.

During [[World War I]], Jules Bache donated money to the [[American Field Service]] in [[France]] and his wife was the honorary treasurer of the "War Babies' Cradle," a [[Charitable organization|charity]] that provided aid for mothers and children in distress in war-torn Northern France and [[Belgium]] to provide them with food, clothing, heating fuel and medical care.

Jules Bache was a shareholder of a number of prominent corporations and sat on the board of directors of many of them. Among his personal holdings, Bache had sizeable interests in Canadian mining companies. His equity in these companies were held by his [[Bahamas]] based corporation that allowed him to legally avoid some of the high personal U.S. surtaxes, a fact which he would be publicly criticized for as a result of the Federal investigations during the 1930s into the causes of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. Bache however believed that high taxation was a hindrance to economic growth and published a booklet titled "''Release business from the slavery of taxation''." A major shareholder in [[Placer Dome|Dome Mines Limited]], Bache served as company president from 1919 until 1942 and was Chairman of the Board at the time of his passing. After the brokerage firm of [[Dillon, Read &amp; Co.]] acquired the [[Dodge]] Brothers Automobile Company in 1923, Jules Bache acquired a substantial position in [[Chrysler Corporation]].

[[File:Jules Bache Mausoleum 1024.jpg|thumb|300px|The mausoleum of Jules Bache]]In addition to his high profile in the business world, Jules Bache would also become well known for his art collecting that received much press attention in 1929 when he purchased the portrait of "''[[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giuliano de Medici]]''," then attributed to [[Raphael]]. He would acquire numerous other important works including those by or attributed to [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] (including ''[[The Bache Madonna]]''), [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Gerard David]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], amongst others. In 1937 he opened his magnificent art collection to the public, and in 1943 donated some of his works to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].

=== Gift to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ===
Bache was a major donor to the Department of Decorative Arts at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Preston_Remington_records_b18157099.pdf Finding aid for the Preston Remington records, 1925–1970], Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1944, most of his picture collection – up to that time gifted to the Jules Bache Foundation, was given to the Museum; the remaining works of art from his estate from his house at 814 Fifth Avenue were sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune, Sunday, April 1, 1945, p. 20 'Jules S. Bache Art Collection is Going on Sale: Works Not Donated to the Metropolitan Museum To Be Sold April 19, 20, 21.' The auction was held at the Kende Galleries of Gimbel Brothers. The New York Times, Sunday, April 1, 1945 adds that 'oil paintings and terracotta statuary' were to be sold on April 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably his portrait by Austrian artist [[Wilhelm Viktor Krausz]] (1878–1959) was retained by one of Bache's daughters.

'''''Les Diaboliques''''' (''The She-Devils'') is a collection of [[short story|short stories]] written by [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]] and published in [[France]] in 1874. Each story features a woman who commits an act of violence, or revenge, or some other crime. It is considered d'Aurevilly's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=irwin&gt;Robert Irwin. ''Barbey D'Aurevilly and the Satanism of Appearance'' in &lt;u&gt;Les Diaboliques&lt;/u&gt;, 11-14. (Dedalus: Langford Lodge, St Judith's Lane Sawtry, Cambs, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Aurevilly, due to the boredom induced by [[bourgeois]] life in the [[Second French Republic]], was a [[dandy]]. Similarly, the acts committed by the characters in these stories are induced not only by their extreme passion but also by their boredom. Some of the characters spend hours playing [[whist]] while others take delight in wearing fine clothes. All of the female characters are best at concealing their passions and are strong, independent instigators.&lt;ref name=irwin /&gt;

D'Aurevilly uses ''récit parlé'', a bracketing narrative, as a structural tool for five of the six short stories.

==Content==

*"The Crimson Curtain": An old [[vicomte]] tells a younger friend about his first sexual experience with a woman.
*"The Greatest Love of Don Juan": An aged playboy, surrounded by past lovers, relates the tale of his greatest love affair.
*"Happiness in Crime": A [[Count|comte]] falls in love with a skilled [[fencing|fencer]] and hires her as his wife's maid.
*"Beneath the Cards of a Game of Whist": The secret affair of a lady and an expert whist player leads to an horrific act.
*"At a Dinner of Atheists": A French officer relates a tale of love and lust with the wife of one of his fellow officers.
*"A Woman's Revenge": A wealthy princess spurns her ignoble husband by becoming a cheap prostitute.

==Publication==
D'Aurevilly wrote "The Crimson Curtain" in 1866. "The Greatest Love of Don Juan" followed in 1867. In 1870, d'Aurevilly retired to the [[Contentin Peninsula]] and finished the collection.

When the collection was first published in France in 1874, it caused up an uproar with the [[France|French]] public and the work was declared a danger to [[public morality]] and the Public Prosecutor issued orders for its seizure on the grounds of [[blasphemy]] and [[obscenity]]. D'Aurevilly defended the work, albeit tongue-in-cheek, by saying that he himself was a [[Christianity|Christian]] and the stories demonstrated the battle of good against evil.&lt;ref name=irwin /&gt;

A second edition was published in 1882. [[Dedalus Books]] published an English-language version in 1996.

==Film adaptations==
* ''[[A Woman's Revenge (1921 film)|A Woman's Revenge]]'' (1921), directed by [[Robert Wiene]], based on "A Woman's Revenge"
* ''[[The Crimson Curtain (1953 film)|The Crimson Curtain]]'' (1953), directed by [[Alexandre Astruc]], based on "The Crimson Curtain"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">The '''Lough Lene Boat''', also known as '''The Monks' Boat''', is an [[Underwater archaeology|underwater archaeological]] artifact from [[prehistoric Ireland]]. It was discovered in 1968 on the east side of  [[Lough Lene]], [[County Westmeath]] nearest to the Cummerstown/Windtown townlands of [[Collinstown]].  [[Radiocarbon dating]] revealed that the boat was constructed sometime between the [[Early history of Ireland|1st and 4th century]].&lt;ref name="askaboutireland.boat"&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/physical-landscape/lakelands-of-westmeath/lough-lene/the-monks-boat/ The Monk's boat], Ask About Ireland. Retrieved 15 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:NunsTurgesius Castle isles Lough Lene.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nuns Island]], a site popularly associated with the history of the Lough Lene Boat, is visible in this photo of [[Lough Lene]] shows.  Turgesius Island and the Castle Isles are also visible.  The mainland is in the foreground.]]
The boat, which resembled a "dug out [[canoe]]", was discovered by [[Underwater diving|divers]] belonging to the local [[Mullingar]] Sub Aqua Club.  The divers moved the boat into shallower water and then, on 28 September 1958, brought it ashore for examination by [[Archaeology|experts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/image_large?asset_id=7657 Photo of the Mullingar Sub Aqua Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
P. O hEailidhe from the [[National Museum of Ireland]] reported: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"the Lough Lene boat combines techniques of [[sewn boat]] construction together with that of [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] in a way which cannot be paralleled elsewhere at present."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4070 P. O hEailidhe, National Museum of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220237/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4070 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legend==
"The Monks' Boat" appellation comes from a [[History of the Republic of Ireland|20th century]] [[folklore|local tradition]] that associates the boat with the [[monk]]s of the [[Ruins|ruined]] [[Fore Abbey]].  Although the boat pre-dates the [[abbey]] by several centuries, it is thought that the boat may have been sunk while moving religious artifacts used during [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] in the Fore Abbey and on the [[convent]] on [[Nuns Island, Lough Lene|Nuns Island]].  Another [[legend]] holds that locals, believing the boat [[curse]]d with bad fortune, did not wish the boat recovered.&lt;ref name="askaboutireland.boat"/&gt;

Because of theories about a possible [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] origin for the Lough Lene Boat, some have even speculated a connection between the vessel and [[St. Patrick]].  According to the [[Annals of Ulster]] (a [[Early Modern Ireland 1536–1691|late medieval]] document in which dates, especially of earlier events, are suspect) the [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|era of St. Patrick's life]] coincides with scientific estimation of when the boat was constructed.

==The Lough Lene Bell==
[[Image:Lough Lene Bell Riplica.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Lough Lene Bell]]
In 1882, the Royal Irish Academy was presented with the Bell of [[Lough Lene]] by the Barbavila estate proprietor, Mr. William Barlow Smythe.  The bell had been discovered the previous year in Lough Lene by a boy fishing for eels on Castle Island, which was owned by Smythe at the time.

Given the close proximity to the [[Fore Abbey]], the estate owner Smythe concluded that the bell possibly belonged to the St Feichin Abbey; During the Viking and Anglo-Norman oppressions, it may have been transferred to Nun's Island, before being eventually being hidden upon Castle Island.

The [[Bell (instrument)|Bell]] has a faint outline of the Christian [[Celtic cross]] upon opposing sides of the bell and an ornamental periphiral border. Smythe pronounced that ornamentation was generally reserved for the cases or [[shrine]]s for that era and was therefore most unusual.
The bell appears similar to two other bells from that early Christian period. These had been found in [[Bangor, County Down]] in the year 1832, and  another in [[Cashel, County Tipperary]] in 1849. Smythe, the Barbavila owner, believed that the Lough Lene Bell was contemporary to these bells which were believed to be from the 7th century, therefore supporting his theory that it was possible that it could have been a relic of [[St. Feichin]]s.
The Folklore Commission also hold an account of Kit "the Blade" Fagan's discovery of the bell, which  consequentially triggered a local treasure hunt for further artifacts around [[Collinstown]] and Fore.

While the original ''Lough Lene Bell'' remains within the National Museum, a half sized replica holds a place of pride as the [[Ceann Comhairle]]'s Bell in Dáil Éireann.
This replica was presented to the Dáil in 1931 by the widow of Major [[Bryan Cooper (politician)|Bryan Cooper]], a former member of the House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/physical-landscape/lakelands-of-westmeath/lough-lene/the-bell-of-lough-lene/index.xml The bell of Lough Lene], Ask About Ireland.

Minton's was founded by tenor saxophonist Henry Minton in 1938.&lt;ref name="Shipton, p. 88"&gt;{{harvp|Shipton|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minton's is famous for its role in the development of modern [[jazz]], also known as [[bebop]], where in its [[jam sessions]] in the early 1940s, [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Bud Powell]], [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Charlie Christian]], [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], pioneered the new music. Minton's thrived for three decades until its decline near the end of the 1960s, and its eventual closing in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Feuer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being shuttered for more than 30 years, the newly remodeled club reopened its doors on May 19, 2006, under the name '''Uptown Lounge at Minton's Playhouse'''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Reopening of Minton's Playhouse." Jazz Press Service. May 13, 2006. http://home.nestor.minsk.by/jazz/news/2006/05/1306.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minton’s Playhouse Website: http://www.uptownatmintons.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119182121/http://www.uptownatmintons.com/ |date=November 19, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reopened club was closed again in 2010. Remodeling began again in 2012.

==The club's beginnings==
Minton's original owner, Henry Minton, was well known in Harlem for being the first ever black delegate to the [[American Federation of Musicians]] Local 802.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb_550"&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he had been the manager of the 
[[Rhythm Club]], in Harlem, in the early part of the 1930s, a place where [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Fats Waller]], [[James P. Johnson]], and [[Earl Hines]] frequented.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Ralph Ellison]] later wrote that because of his union background and music business experience, Minton was aware of the economic and artistic needs of [[jazz]] musicians in New York in the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb_550"/&gt; Minton's popularity and his penchant for generosity with food and loans, made his club a favorite hang-out for musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|pp=550–551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minton started a policy of holding regular [[jam sessions]] at his club, which would later prove to be a key factor in the development of [[bebop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|p=551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his union ties, Minton was able to ensure that musicians would not be fined for their participation in jam sessions, an activity that was prohibited by the union.&lt;ref name="Gourse, p. 20"&gt;{{harvp|Gourse|1997|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dizzy Gillespie]] recalled that there were "walking" delegates from the union that would follow musicians around and fine them "a hundred to five hundred dollars" for participating in jam sessions, but that they were "somewhat immune from this at Minton's because of Henry Minton."&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, p. 560"&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|p=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ralph Ellison]], Minton's Playhouse provided "a retreat, a homogeneous community where a collectivity of common experience could find continuity and meaningful expression."&lt;ref name="Gottlieb_552"&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|p=552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minton's in the 1940s==
In late 1940, Minton hired [[Teddy Hill]], a former bandleader, to manage the club.&lt;ref name="Shipton, p. 88"/&gt; Building in the same direction that Minton had started, Hill used his connections from the [[Savoy Ballroom]] (where his band used to play), and the [[Apollo Theatre]] to increase the interest in the club.&lt;ref name="Shipton, p. 88"/&gt; Hill put together the [[house band]] which included [[Thelonious Monk]] on piano, [[Joe Guy (musician)|Joe Guy]] on trumpet, Nick Fenton on bass, and [[Kenny Clarke]] on drums.&lt;ref name="Shapiro and Hentoff, p. 339"&gt;{{harvp|Shapiro|Hentoff|1955|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Clarke and Guy were in Teddy Hill's band before it disbanded in 1939.&lt;ref name="Shapiro and Hentoff, p. 339"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szwed, p. 41"&gt;{{harvp|Szwed|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clarke, Teddy Hill wanted to "do something for the guys that had worked with him" by giving them work during difficult times.&lt;ref name="Shapiro and Hentoff, p. 339"/&gt; The house band at Minton's in 1941, with the addition of frequent guests, [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Christian]], was at the center of the emergence of bebop in the early 1940s.&lt;ref name="Szwed, p. 41"/&gt; Later, the band was led by tenor saxophonist [[Kermit Scott (musician)|Kermit Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Oliphant|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dnGfoaI5eT4C&amp;pg=PA176 175]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|DeVeaux|1997|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monday celebrity nights==
A feature of Minton's Playhouse during Teddy Hill's tenure as manager was the popular ''Monday Celebrity Nights'' sponsored by the Schiffmans who owned the nearby [[Apollo Theater]].&lt;ref name="Gourse, p. 20"/&gt; The Schiffmans treated their performers to free dinner and drinks after the conclusion of a long week of work.&lt;ref name="Gourse, p. 20"/&gt; The food at Minton's became almost as popular as the music as noted by many present at that time. In an interview with Al Fraser (1979), [[Dizzy Gillespie]] told his recollection of Monday nights at Minton's:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''On Monday nights, we used to have a ball. Everybody from the Apollo, on Monday nights, was a guest at Minton's, the whole band. We had a big jam session. Monday night was the big night, the musician's night off. There was always some food there for you. Oh, that part was beautiful. Teddy Hill treated the guys well''.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, p. 560"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cutting sessions and duels==
During the ''Monday Celebrity Nights'', many notable guest musicians such as [[Roy Eldridge]], [[Hot Lips Page]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Don Byas]], and [[Lester Young]] would sit in.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb_552"/&gt; The trumpet duels between [[Roy Eldridge]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] became legend, with Gillespie eventually surpassing his mentor. Speaking to Al Fraser, Gillespie recalled how [[Thelonious Monk]] one night teased Eldridge after being out-played by Gillespie saying, "Look, you're supposed to be the greatest trumpet player in the world...but that's the best."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|p=557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Eldridge was an established musician in the older [[Swing music|swing]] style, he was an active figure at Minton's and contributed through his encouragement of Gillespie and Clarke to further their explorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shapiro|Hentoff|1955|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eldridge and the other swing masters who participated in the early [[cutting session]]s at Minton's played an important role in the evolution of [[Swing music|swing]] toward [[bebop]] by inspiring the next generation of musicians. A young [[Sonny Stitt]] witnessed the great battles between the master saxophonists of the day in the early 1940s:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Can you imagine [[Lester Young]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Chu Berry]], [[Don Byas]], and [[Ben Webster]] on the same little jam session? They had a place called Minton's Playhouse in New York. It's kaput now. And these guys, man, nothing like it. And guess who won the fight?...[[Don Byas]] walked off with everything''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Enstice|Rubin|1994|pp=251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Byas was one of the first tenor saxophonists to assimilate [[bebop]] into his style, in contrast to Young, Hawkins, and Webster, who stayed close to their swing roots through the development of [[bebop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shipton|1999|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Pritchard, who tended bar at Minton's "in the old days", would watch as [[Ben Webster]] and [[Lester Young]] would "fight on those saxophones...like dogs in the road."&lt;ref name="Gottlieb_552"/&gt; [[Ralph Ellison]] believes that what was occurring at Minton's from 1941 to 1942 was a "continuing symposium of jazz, a summation of all the styles, personal and traditional, of jazz."&lt;ref name="Gottlieb_552"/&gt;

==Charlie Christian and the house band==
One of the pioneers of the new style, which would eventually become known as [[bebop]], was the young electric guitarist from [[Benny Goodman]]'s band, [[Charlie Christian]].&lt;ref name="Schuller_576"&gt;{{harvp|Schuller|1989|p=576}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played nightly at Minton's and was one of its stars.&lt;ref name="Schuller_576"/&gt; Although Christian was in his early twenties in 1941, his time at Minton's was significant, but brief; he would die the next March after being confined to a sanatorium stricken with [[tuberculosis]]. As evidenced by recordings made by [[Columbia University]] student Jerry Newman in 1941, Christian's playing was breaking new ground.&lt;ref name="Schuller_576"/&gt; [[Gunther Schuller]]'s assessment of Christian's playing on those recordings is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;
''His work here seems to me relentlessly creative, endlessly fertile, and is so in a way that marks a new stylistic departure. Indeed, it signals the birth of a new language in jazz, which even [[Charlie Parker|[Charlie] Parker]] did not have as clearly in focus at that time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schuller|1989|p=577}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Kenny Clarke]] and the band at Minton's would look forward with anticipation to Christian's arrival after finishing his set with Goodman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shapiro|Hentoff|1955|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian was admired by his peers at Minton's, including [[Thelonious Monk]] who "loved listening to Charlie play solos with fluid lines and interesting harmonies."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gourse|1997|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill bought Christian an amplifier to use so he would not have to bring his along. Hill had it up until his death in 1978. [http://www.cleveland.oh.us/wmv_news/jazz115.htm] Gillespie and Monk do not appear on the Christian recordings. Joe Guy and [[Kenny Kersey]] are the trumpet and piano on "Swing to Bop" and "Stompin' at the Savoy."

==Bird and Dizzy==
Soon after [[Charlie Christian]]'s death, alto saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]] emerged as a new leader of the [[bebop]] movement. Parker's collaboration with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Kenny Clarke]], at sessions at Minton's, would build on the earlier experiments of Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Enstice|Rubin|1994|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1942, Parker was known to have spent more time at [[Clark Monroe's Uptown House]], another Harlem club where [[jam sessions]] extended into the early morning than he spent playing at Minton's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woideck|1998|pp=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving [[Jay McShann]]'s band at the end of 1941, Parker joined [[Earl Hines]]'s band in 1942 and was reunited with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], who he had met sometime earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woideck|1998|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period of time starting in 1942 that Parker, nicknamed 'Bird', could be found sitting-in at Minton's on Monday nights as recalled by Miles Davis:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''On Monday nights at Minton’s, Bird and Dizzy would come in to jam, so you’d have a thousand [players] up there trying to get in so they could listen to and play with Bird and Dizzy. But most of the musicians in the know didn't even think about playing when Bird and Dizzy came to jam. We would just sit out in the audience, to listen and learn''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Parker never was officially a member of the house band at Minton's during that period, however sensing his importance to the bebop movement, Clarke and Monk approached Teddy Hill about hiring Parker into the band. Hill refused so Clarke and Monk decided to pay Parker out of their salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gourse|1997|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Parker's arrival on the scene in Harlem, a new generation of player followed. [[Miles Davis]], [[Fats Navarro]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Art Blakey]], [[Max Roach]] and many others were drawn to Minton's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gourse|1997|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miles Davis]]'s search for [[Charlie Parker]] brought him to Minton's where he "cut his teeth" at the jam sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miles remembered:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The way [it] went down up at Minton's was you brought your horn and hoped that Bird and Dizzy would invite you to play with them up on stage. And when this happened you better not blow it...People would watch for clues from Bird and Dizzy, and if they smiled when you finished playing, then that meant your playing was good''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Davis's remarks reflect on the frenzy in Harlem for the new sounds of [[bebop]] that surrounded Parker, Gillespie and Minton's.

==Sitting-in at Minton's==
Minton's Playhouse became so popular in those days that the house band began to develop ways of weeding out less skilled musicians who wanted to sit in. According to bassist [[Milt Hinton]], Gillespie prompted the band to play standards, such as [[George Gershwin|Gershwin's]] "I Got Rhythm", in difficult keys in order to discourage beginners from sitting in.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gottlieb|1996|p=564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassist [[Charles Mingus]] remembers being required to audition to get up on stage:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''To play at Minton’s you couldn’t just walk in and grab a bass. They made you go in a back room or a kitchen and call a few tunes. They did it to me too. They said, “Can you play ‘Perdido’? Can you play ‘Body and Soul’?”''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Enstice|Rubin|1994|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Practices such as these challenged up-and-coming jazz musicians to get their acts together in order to participate in the jam sessions, which kept the music at a high level.

==The end of an era==
Minton's changed its open jam policy in favor of big name acts in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Siegal|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s bands were no longer at the cutting edge. Harlem writer, [[Amiri Baraka]] (LeRoi Jones) wrote in ''Black Music'' (1967), that "The groups that come into Minton's are stand-up replicas of what was a highly experimental twenty-five years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jones|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the club was open for a little more than three decades, Minton's Playhouse will always be associated with the 1940s and the jam sessions that gave birth to [[bebop]].

==The new Minton's==
In 2013, [[Richard Parsons (businessman)|Richard Parsons]] revived Minton's as an upscale [[Jazz club]] and restaurant. The restaurant's cuisine was entrusted to noted restaurateur Alexander Smalls. The new club was designed by architect Sarah Garcia of Estudio Sarah Garcia and a new brand identity designed by New York designer [[John Simoudis]].

The World's '''Most Phallic Building contest''' was a contest held in 2003 by ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine to find the building which most resembled a [[human penis|human phallus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Gutierrez |title=Another claim to fame for Liberty Memorial |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&amp;p_theme=kc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FFE6184248A5271&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=2003-12-29 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
The contest originated when writer [[Jonathan Ames]] drew the ire of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' readers by claiming, in a diary that was later published in his book ''I Love You More Than You Know'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brendan |last=Halpin  |title=Delightful essays of life's ups, downs in 'I Love You'; I Love You More Than You Know |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/990634401.html?dids=990634401:990634401&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+21%2C+2006&amp;author=Brendan+Halpin&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=BOOK+REVIEW%3B+Delightful+essays+of+life's+ups%2C+downs+in+%60I+Love+You'%3B+I+Love+You+More+Than+You+Know+Essays+Jonathan+Ames+Black+Cat%3A+270+pp.%2C+%2413+paper&amp;pqatl=google |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-02-21 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower|Williamsburg Bank Building]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] was the world's most phallic. This led ''Cabinet'' magazine to initiate a search of its own to find which building was truly the "world's most phallic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jonathanames.com/blog/archive/events/2003_07_13_archive.html| title = Most Phallic Building?| year=2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002073201/http://www.jonathanames.com/blog/archive/events/2003_07_13_archive.html|archive-date=2011-10-02|access-date=2016-11-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gawker.com/news/realestate/the-most-phallic-building-in-the-world-contest-12901.php| title = Jonathan Ames article causes stir| year=2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625120558/http://gawker.com/news/realestate/the-most-phallic-building-in-the-world-contest-12901.php|archive-date=2009-06-25|access-date=2016-11-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/willie/willie.html| title = Williamsburg Bank?| year=2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808042704/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/willie/willie.html|archive-date=2011-08-08|access-date=2015-11-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities and readers subsequently poured in their views and staked their claims to the magazine's editors.

==Results==
After months of entries and discussion, the [[Ypsilanti Water Tower]] in [[Ypsilanti]], [[Michigan]], was announced as the winner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A the awards: the 9 most remarkable things in culture this month.(man at his best) |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19676527_ITM |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the winner of a readers' poll was the [[Florida State Capitol]] building in [[Tallahassee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Harrison |title=Site of the week |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/11/05/1067989605047.html |work=[[The Age]] |date=2003-11-06 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable nominee was the [[Torre Agbar]] (Agbar Tower) in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=High Society: Contemporary Highrise Architecture and the International Highrise Award 2006 |last= Gräwe |first=Christina |author2=Schmal, Peter Cachola |year=2007 |publisher=Jovis |isbn=3-936314-77-2 |pages=Dust jacket |url=http://www.artbook.com/3936314772.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gibraltar]] is a [[British overseas territory]] with many musical influences. [[Rock music|Rock]] based [[music]] is undergoing a [[renaissance]] with a multitude of local bands playing original material and covers. Local venues have begun accepting [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]] bands and those from nearby [[Spain]], resulting in a varied mix of live performances every weekend as well as some weekday nights.

Musicians from Gibraltar include [[Charles Ramirez]], the first [[guitar]]ist invited to play with the [[Royal College of Music]] Orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronicle.gi/Features/Charles%20Ramirez/charles%20ramirez.htm ''The Gibraltar Chronicle'' Always a pleasure to perform in Gibraltar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030909225847/http://www.chronicle.gi/Features/Charles%20Ramirez/charles%20ramirez.htm |date=2003-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and successful [[rock band]]s like [[Breed 77]], [[Melon Diesel]] and [[Taxi (Gibraltar band)|Taxi]].

The best known Gibraltarian musician is [[Albert Hammond]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foghs.org.uk/nl/70.pdf Friends of Gibraltar Heritage Society Newsletter No 70 November 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; who has had top 10 hits in the UK &amp; US, and has written many songs for international artists such as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Julio Iglesias]] among many others.

Concerts in Gibraltar by well known international acts have recently given local acts a showcase for original material in their supporting roles. These include [[Surianne]] supporting [[Suzanne Vega]], Sarah Howard supporting [[Steve Hogarth]], Jetstream supporting [[Ali Campbell]] and [[Jessie J]] and SuperWookie supporting [[Marillion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2007/10-2007.pdf Government of Gibraltar press release - Announcement of Marillion Concert] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118191214/http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/latest_news/press_releases/2007/10-2007.pdf |date=2008-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the annual [[Gibraltar Music Festival]].

[[File:Mammals 02995 Thibetian Musk (22899919524).jpg|thumb|262x262px|Musk Deer of Tibet in old illustration]]
'''Musk''' is a class of aromatic substances commonly used as [[base note]]s in [[perfume]]ry. They include [[gland]]ular secretions from animals such as the [[musk deer]], numerous plants emitting similar fragrances, and artificial substances with similar [[odor]]s.&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/musk | title = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''musk'' | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Pierre |last = Chantraine | title = Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque | publisher = Klincksieck |year= 1990 | pages = 715 | isbn = 2-252-03277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musk'' was a name originally given to a substance with a strong odor obtained from a gland of the musk deer. The substance has been used as a popular perfume [[Fixative (perfumery)|fixative]] since ancient times and is one of the most expensive [[animal product]]s in the world. The name originates from the Late Greek μόσχος 'moskhos', from Persian 'mushk', ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] मुष्क muṣka meaning "a testicle", from a diminutive of मूष् mūṣ ("mouse"). &lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|musk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/musk | title = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''musk'' | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Pierre |last = Chantraine | title = Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque | publisher =  Klincksieck |year= 1990 | page = 715 | isbn = 2-252-03277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deer gland was thought to resemble a scrotum. It is applied to various plants and animals of similar smell (e.g. musk-ox, 1744) and has come to encompass a wide variety of aromatic substances with similar odors, despite their often differing [[chemical structure]]s and molecular shapes.

Natural musk was used extensively in [[perfumery]] until the late 19th century when economic and ethical motives led to the adoption of [[synthetic musk]], which is now used almost exclusively.&lt;ref name=Rimkus&gt;{{cite book | title = Synthetic Musk Fragrances in the Environment (Handbook of Environmental Chemistry) | first = Gerhard G. (Ed.)| last = Rimkus |author2=Cornelia Sommer | chapter = The Role of Musk and Musk Compounds in the Fragrance Industry |publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 3-540-43706-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organic compound]] primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of musk is [[muscone]].

Modern use of natural musk pods occurs in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Natural sources==

===Musk deer===
{{main|Deer musk}}
[[File:Primary Form of Musk.jpg|thumb|A musk pod, obtained from the male [[musk deer]]]]
The musk deer belongs to the family [[Moschidae]] and lives in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]],&lt;ref name="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106000253184?urlappend=%3Bseq=72"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Section of the Foreign Office (Great Britain)|title="Tibet". Handbook (No. 70)|publisher=H M Staionery Office (1920)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]]. The musk pod is normally obtained by killing the male deer through traps laid in the wild. Upon drying, the reddish-brown paste inside the musk pod turns into a black [[granular material]] called "musk grain", which is then tinctured with alcohol. The aroma of the [[tincture]] gives a pleasant odor only after it is considerably [[:wikt:dilute|dilute]]d. No other natural substance has such a complex aroma associated with so many contradictory descriptions; however, it is usually described abstractly as animalistic, earthy and woody&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt; or something akin to the odor of baby's skin.&lt;ref name=Kraft/&gt;

Musk has been a key constituent in many perfumes since its discovery, being held to give a perfume long-lasting power as a fixative. Today, the trade quantity of the natural musk is controlled by [[CITES]], but illegal [[poaching]] and trading continues.&lt;ref name=Kraft&gt;{{cite book | title = Chemistry and Technology of Flavours and Fragrances | first = David J. (Ed.)| last = Rowe |author2=[[Philip Kraft]] | chapter = Chapter 7. Aroma Chemicals IV: Musks | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 0-8493-2372-X | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Other animals===
[[File:Ondatra zibethicus FWS.jpg|thumb|right|''Ondatra zibethicus'', the [[muskrat]]]]
[[Muskrat]] (''Ondatra zibethicus''), a rodent native to [[North America]], has been known since the 17th century to secrete a glandular substance with a musky odor.&lt;ref name=Groom/&gt; A chemical means of extracting it was discovered in the 1940s, but it did not prove commercially worthwhile.&lt;ref name=Groom&gt;{{cite book | title = New Perfume Handbook | first = Nigel | last = Groom | pages = 219–220 | publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-7514-0403-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glandular substances with musk-like odors are also obtained from the [[musk duck]] (''Biziura lobata'') of southern [[Australia]], the [[muskox]], the [[musk shrew]], the [[musk beetle]] (''Aromia moschata''), the [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta''), the [[Sternotherus odoratus|musk turtle]] (''Sternotherus odoratus''), the [[American alligator]] of [[North America]],  lynx musk, ''lungurion'' which, in antiquity, was highly valued, and from several other animals.

In [[crocodile]]s, there are two pairs of musk glands, one pair situated at the corner of the jaw and the other pair in the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Herpetological and Related Terminology | first = D.C. |last = Wareham | publisher = [[Elsevier Science]] | year = 2005 | isbn =0-444-51863-0 | pages = 129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk glands are also found in snakes.

===Plants===
{{NIE Poster|Musk Plant}}
Some plants such as ''[[Angelica archangelica]]'' or ''[[Abelmoschus moschatus]]'' produce musky-smelling macrocyclic lactone compounds. These compounds are widely used in perfumery as substitutes for animal musk or to alter the smell of a mixture of other musks.

The plant sources include the musk flower (''[[Mimulus moschatus]]'') of western North America, the muskwood (''[[Olearia argophylla]]'') of Australia, and the musk seeds (''[[Abelmoschus moschatus]]'') from India.

==Artificial compounds==
{{main|Synthetic musk}}
[[File:Galaxolide 200.svg|thumb|[[Galaxolide]], a polycyclic musk commonly found in [[laundry detergent]]s to mask the smell of the detergent chemicals]]
Since obtaining the deer musk requires killing the [[Endangered species|endangered animal]], nearly all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic, sometimes called "white musk". They can be divided into three major classes: aromatic nitro musks, polycyclic musk compounds, and macrocyclic musk compounds.&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt; The first two groups have broad uses in industry ranging from [[cosmetics]] to [[detergent]]s. However, the detection of the first two chemical groups in human and environmental samples as well as their carcinogenic properties initiated a public debate on the use of these compounds and a ban or reduction of their use in many regions of the world. Macrocyclic musk compounds are expected to replace them since these compounds appear to be safer.&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt;

==Other uses==

Musk has been used to attract wild animals, including in man-made perfume mixtures. For example, in 2018 Indian authorities used the perfume ''Obsession'' by [[Calvin Klein]] to attract and thus trap a wild tiger that had attacked and killed more than a dozen humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Calvin Klein's Obsession Could Be The Trick To Catching A Tiger |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/14/657238908/calvin-kleins-obsession-could-be-the-trick-to-catching-a-tiger |website=NPR |date=14 October 2018 |access-date=18 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6378">'''Narrative [[criticism]]''' focuses on the stories a speaker or a writer tells to understand how they help us make meaning out of our daily human experiences. [[Narrative]] theory is a means by which we can comprehend how we impose order on our experiences and actions by giving them a narrative form. According to Walter Fisher,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fisher | first = Walter | title = Human Communication as Narration: Toward a Philosophy of Reason, Value, and Action | place = Columbia | publisher = U of South Carolina P | year = 1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} narratives are fundamental to communication and provide structure for human experience and influence people to share common explanations and understandings (58). Fisher defines narratives as “symbolic actions-words and/or deeds that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.” Study of narrative criticism, therefore, includes form (fiction or non-fiction, prose or poetry), [[genre]] (myth, history, legend, etc.), structure (including plot, [[Theme (literature) | theme]], [[irony]], foreshadowing, etc.) characterization, and communicator’s perspective.

Characteristics of a narrative were defined as early as [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' under plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Aristotle | title = Poetics | chapter = VI–VII}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He called plot as the “first principle” or the “soul of a [[tragedy]].” According to him, plot is the arrangement of incidents that imitate the action with a beginning, middle, and end. Plot includes introduction of characters, rising action and introduction of complication, development of complication, [[climax (narrative)]], and final resolution. As described by White  (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= White |first= H |work= On Narrative |title= The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Culture |editor-first = WJT |editor-last= Mitchell |place= Chicago |publisher= U of Chicago Press |year= 1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} and Martin  (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Martin | first = W | title = Recent Theories of Narrative | place = Ithaca, NY | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} plot involves a structure of action.  However, not all narratives contain a plot. Fragmentation occurs as the traditional plot disappears, narratives become less linear, and the burden of meaning making gets shifted from the narrator to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Michael Calvin | last1 = McGee | first2 = John S | last2 = Nelson | first3 = Michael | last3 = Sizemore |  year = 1990 | title = Narrative Reason in Public Argument}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}

Narratives can be found in a range of practices such as novels, short stories, plays, films, histories, documentaries, gossip, biographies, television and scholarly books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James | last = Jasinski | title = Sourcebook on Rhetoric | place = California | publisher = Sage | year = 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}  All of these artifacts make excellent objects for narrative criticism. When performing a narrative criticism, critics should focus on the features of the narrative that allow them to say something meaningful about the artifact. Sample questions from Sonja K Foss&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sonja K | last = Foss | title = Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice | place = Illinois | publisher = Waveland | year = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|312-313}} offer a guide for analysis:
* Setting – How does the setting relate to the plot and characters? How is the particular setting created? Is the setting textually prominent – highly developed and detailed – or negligible?
* Characters ([[Persona]]) – Are some of the characters non-human or inanimate phenomena, described as thinking and speaking beings? In what actions do the characters engage? Are the characters round (possess a variety of traits, some of them conflicting or contradictory) or flat (one or a few dominant traits making the character predictable)?
* [[Narrator]] – Is the narrative presented directly to the audience, or is it mediated by a narrator? What makes the narrator intrusive or not? What kind of person is the narrator (examine his or her ethos)?
* Events – What are the major and minor events? How are the events presented? Are the events active (expressing action) or stative (expressing a state or condition)?
* Temporal relations – Do events occur in a brief period of time or over many years? What is the relationship between the natural order of the events as they occurred and the order of their presentation in the telling of a narrative? Is the story in past or present tense?
*[[Causal]] relations – What cause-and-effect relationships are established in the narrative? Are events caused largely by human action, accident, or forces of nature? In how much detail are the causes and effects described?
*[[Audience]] – Is the audience a participant in the events recounted? What can be inferred about the audience’s attitudes, knowledge, or situation from the narrative? What seems to be the narrator’s evaluation of the audience’s knowledge, personality, and abilities?
*[[Theme (literature)|Theme]] – What is the major theme (general idea illustrated by the narrative) of the narrative? How is the theme articulated? How obvious and clear is the theme?
*Limitations: Traditional narrative criticism focuses primarily on the narrative and does not take the socioeconomic and political background into consideration; however, it is not opposed to New-Historicism theory. In addition, it does not take the narrator's motivations into consideration as it focuses on the narrative to generate the analysis. Also, as the critic looks at the overall unity of the narrative, the theory is not conducive to deconstruction techniques (19-20).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale A. Yee|Yee, Gale]].

==History==
NHIA was founded in 1898 as the Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences with the goal of promoting a "cultivation of the arts and sciences, to give a more general impulse and systematic direction to scientific research and encourage and stimulate the study of history, literature, and industrial institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences.

President's report. (Manchester: Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences, 1916) [1].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the New Hampshire State Board of Education certified the institute's four-year program to prepare high school graduates to teach art.

(Manchester: Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences, 1996) 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the State of [[New Hampshire]] authorized the institute to award the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. It was at this time that the school adopted a new name: the New Hampshire Institute of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Manson, Chairman of the Board (n.d.). "Chairman's Report."

In the late 1990s, the college was the beneficiary of a $24 million bequest from the estate of Mary Fuller Russell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work=[[Hartford Courant]]| date=November 7, 2001| title=Mr Fuller's Extraordinary Gift| url=http://articles.courant.com/2001-11-07/news/0111070350_1_trinity-s-history-mr-fuller-gift| access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed NHIA to establish an endowment and embark upon a major expansion of its campus. From 2002 to 2012, under the leadership of then president Roger Williams, the college's enrollment and physical plant expanded rapidly to encompass over 500 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://info.nhpr.org/new-hampshires-art-secretnhia| title=New Hampshire's Art Secret…NHIA| publisher=NHPR| access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007 the college received a significant gift of over 2,000 rare photographic books from the collector and philanthropist John Teti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.hippopress.com/070517/arts.html|title=Photo fan donates priceless collection of rare photography books to NHIA|last=Masek|first=Heidi|date=2017-08-21|website=Hippo Press|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the highlights of the collection is a complete set of Alfred Stieglitz’s ''Camera Work'' dating from 1903 to 1917 as well as publications and photographs extending as far back as 1864. NHIA subsequently renamed its library the Teti Library in honor of the donor.

In 2012, the closure of [[Chester College of New England]], a small liberal arts college based in [[Chester, New Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/05/21/chester-college-will-shut-down|title=Chester College will close|last1=Jaschik|first1=Scott|date=May 21, 2012|work=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in over 80 percent of the student body and several full-time faculty members transferring to NHIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite new|title=Former Chester College Students Flock to Another Arts School|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/news/article_fa2fbb4a-2ed7-57e1-9736-2386dcecaff0.html|last1=Toole|first1=John|work=[[The Eagle-Tribune]]|date=May 25, 2012|access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year NHIA reached agreement with the Sharon Arts Center, a small community-based arts education center with operations in [[Sharon, New Hampshire|Sharon]] and [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], to merge operations. The Sharon Arts Center was incorporated on October 22, 1946, its stated purpose being "To stimulate, encourage and provide education in the theory and practice of the arts and crafts through instruction, exhibitions and marketing assistance."&lt;ref&gt;"NH Art Institute to Manage Sharon Arts." ledgertranscript.com. Retrieved February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The merger with the Sharon Arts Center coincided with NHIA introducing a new, low-residency M.F.A. program based in Sharon and Peterborough in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nhia.edu/graduate-studies/graduate-programs/mfa-in-visual-arts| title=MFA in Visual Arts| publisher=NHIA| access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, NHIA announced a new academic partnership with the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] that allows students at either college to enroll in classes at the partner institution at no additional cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://manchester.unh.edu/blog/campus-news/university-new-hampshire-and-new-hampshire-institute-art-announce-innovative|title=The University of New Hampshire and New Hampshire Institute of Art Announce Innovative Partnership|date=2015-06-03|work=UNH at Manchester|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2017 NHIA announced new programs in [[Comic art studies|Comic Arts]], [[Printmaking]], and [[User experience design|User Experience]] (UX) Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhia.edu/about/news-and-events/news/nhia-launches-three-new-majors|title=NHIA Launches New Majors|website=www.nhia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, NHIA announced a new Certificate in Creative [[Placemaking]] program in partnership with the National Consortium for Creative Placemaking (NCCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhia.edu/about/news-and-events/news/nhia-launches-certificate-in-creative-placemaking|title=NHIA Certificate in Creative Placemaking Launch|website=www.nhia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The New Hampshire Institute of Art is located within the Manchester Cultural District, a six-block area encompassing the [[Victory Park Historic District]] that includes several local arts and cultural institutions as well as five historic buildings designed by noted architects William Rantoul and [[Edward Lippincott Tilton|Edward Tilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unionleader.com/local-government/Manchester-aldermen-OK-establishment-of-six-block-cultural-district-03082017|title=Manchester aldermen OK establishment of six-block 'cultural district' {{!}} New Hampshire|work=UnionLeader.com|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NHIA owns or leases a total of eleven buildings in Manchester, Sharon, and Peterborough, New Hampshire. Notable among these:

*'''French Hall''' (148 Concord Street, Manchester), named in honor of NHIA's patron, Mrs. Emma Blood French, erected in 1916 and housing the Admissions, Financial Aid, Printmaking, and Fine Arts departments as well as a 325-seat auditorium. 
*'''Fuller Hall''' (156 Hanover Street, Manchester). The former New Hampshire Fire Insurance Company building was renovated to house NHIA's Photography department and Teti Library and Special Collections in 2000. It was renamed Fuller Hall in recognition of Mary Fuller Russell.&lt;ref&gt;RECON BULLETINS (2000). ''New Hampshire Business Review'', 22 (23), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Williams Hall and Gallery''' (77 Amherst Street, Manchester). Purchased in March 2005, the former Stan's Masury paint store was renovated and reopened in January 2006. The building is now home to the Ceramics and Foundations departments as well as a student lounge, faculty offices, senior studios, and Williams Gallery&lt;ref name="The Architects"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Roger Williams Studio Dedication| url=http://thearchitects.net/roger-williams-studio-dedication/| publisher=The Architects| access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated in honor of former president Roger Williams in 2014.&lt;ref name="The Architects"/&gt;  
*'''Lowell Hall''' (88 Lowell Street, Manchester). In 2009, NHIA embarked on a project to combine the existing building at 88 Lowell Street with a newly constructed, six-story residence hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=NHIA 88 Lowell St.| publisher=LEED| url=http://www.usgbc.org/projects/nhia-88-lowell-st| access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entailed moving the historic structure that had been home to Manchester's first public high school closer to the street and earned the project architect Dennis Mires, P.A. an American Institute of Architects New Hampshire Excellence in Architecture Design Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=2010 AIANH Excellence in Architecture Design Awards| url=http://www.aianh.org/design-awards/2010-awards| publisher=AIA New Hampshire| access-date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Sharon Arts Center''' (457 [[New Hampshire Route 123|Route 123]], Sharon). Ground was broken for the school and administration building in Sharon in the spring of 2000. The building was completed in November and dedicated in December. New classes were started in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.sharonarts.org/about/history| title=History of the New Hampshire Institute of Art| publisher=New Hampshire Institute of Art| access-date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art Omi''' (previously '''Omi International Arts Center''') is a nonprofit international arts organization located in [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] in [[Ghent, New York]]. It was founded in 1992 by [[Francis J. Greenburger]], a New York [[Real estate development|real estate developer]] and literary agent, who serves as chairman of Art Omi, Inc., the residency's parent foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/30/arts/art-review-the-hudson-valley-inside-and-out.html|title=The Hudson Valley, Inside and Out|date=July 30, 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization takes its name from Omi, a hamlet in the [[Hudson River Valley]] two and a half hours from New York City.

==Details==
Art Omi offers five distinct residency programs: the Art Omi: Artists Residency for visual artists for three weeks in July; the Art Omi: Writers Residency for writers of fiction and non-fiction, critics and translators for up to two months in spring and fall; Art Omi: Architecture, which invites mid-career architects to develop their work during a full two-week residency; Art Omi: Music Residency, which brings together musicians, composers and improvisers in early August; and Art Omi: Dance for dancers and choreographers in late summer. The programs encourage residents to collaborate and explore new avenues of expression and experiment with media and techniques not always available to them at home. Residents are provided with free room and board as well as a congenial place in which to work.  Each year a limited number of fellowships are available to help artists with the costs of travel and art supplies. The residency welcomes talented applicants whether they are starting out, in mid-career or are already established. To date Art Omi has hosted over two-thousand residents from 110 different countries and the United States.

Art Omi invites gallerists, critics, agents, publishers, [[curator]]s and collectors to give talks and presentations. Their visits also benefit residents by providing them with exposure and access to the New York cultural scene. Omi regularly holds exhibitions, readings, concerts and dance performances to which the public is invited. In addition to the four residency programs, Omi International Arts Center is also home to The Fields Sculpture Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE4DB1431F933A05754C0A96F958260|title=Art for Explorers Out Past the Hubbub|date=July 30, 1999|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 20, 2016|quote=And a new sculpture park, open year-round in the hamlet of Omi, N.Y., is threatening to give the Storm King Art Center a run for its money.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art Omi: Architecture and Art Omi: Education.

The main compound is made up of three separate buildings with 18 [[Bedroom|guest rooms]], three [[conference room]]s, a library and communal spaces. Ledig House (named for the late German publisher H.M. Ledig-Rowohlt), a converted 1830 [[farmhouse]], serves as Art Omi's home and central meeting place. The principal work space consists of a two-story converted [[barn]] and several satellite sheds. The latest addition to the Art Omi campus is the Charles B. Benenson Visitors Center &amp; Gallery, which opened to the public in the summer of 2008. The {{convert|4200|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Center presents exhibitions of art and sculpture and includes a gift shop and café. The structure has been built using state-of-the-art 'green' technology. Omi's facilities are available for rental for corporate retreats from December through March, when residency programs are not in session.

The Fields Sculpture Park, which is open to the public throughout the year, features over 70 permanent and temporary exhibitions. The Fields occupies approximately 150 acres of the Omi's campus that has recently{{when|date=May 2011}} expanded to cover nearly 500 acres of [[farmland]], woods and ponds. In the future architects will be invited to design structures ranging from pavilions to free-standing buildings, some of which may function as autonomous galleries or mini-museums.

Art Omi raises money primarily from philanthropic and corporate foundations and individual donors. Its major fundraising event is a theater benefit held each spring.

The '''Opera Awards''' is an singing competition, for professional Australian opera singers. It was established in 1986 with the purpose of assisting and developing professional Australian opera singers. This is achieved through programs of study with selected international educational institutions, engagements with professional opera companies, as well as through introduction, networking and educational opportunities with prominent members of the international operatic community.

The Opera Awards consists of a group of awards, including the YMF Australia Award and the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship, amongst others.  Major sponsors and supporters of the Awards have included YMF Australia, the Armstrong-Martin Estate, Haas Foundation, The [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] (UK), the [[Royal Over-Seas League]] (UK) and the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]].

== History ==
In 1986/87, [[Music &amp; Opera Singers Trust|Music &amp; Opera Singers Trust Limited]] (MOST®) created the 'Opera Awards' as a competition within the [[Australian Singing Competition|Australian SInging Competition]], and then as a separate, stand-alone competition in 2001.

The competition provides cash prizes, scholarships and career opportunities to professional Australian opera singers, enabling the study of grand opera and related music overseas.

Since 2007, the primary award within the Opera Awards is the YMF Australia Award, sponsored by YMF Australia. The recipient of the 'Opera Awards' actually receives a group of awards, scholarships and opportunities which include the YMF Australia Award, the Armstrong-Martin Scholarship, the Haas Foundation Award and the Editorial Resources Prize.

'Runners up'  receive prizes and opportunities which include (in 2011) The Royal Over-Seas League (UK) Music Bursary, the Britten-Pears Young Artists Programme, the Glyndebourne Festival Prize, and the 4MBS Classic FM Award.

The recipient of the Opera Awards (Australia) is acknowledged and invited to perform at the Finals Concert of the [[Australian Singing Competition]].

'''P. Solomon Raj''' ''(born 1921)'' is a pastor of the [[Protestant]] [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society headquartered in [[Guntur]] with major contribution to theological research and arts.&lt;ref name="Volker"&gt;Volker Kuester, ''Renunciation of Inculturation as an Aesthetic Resistance: The Indian artist Solomon Raj seen in a new light'' in ''Fiery Wheels: Art Works and Meditations'', Lalit Kala Ashram, Vijayawada, 2003, pp.100–111&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Old Testament]] scholar [[Victor Premasagar]] wrote about Raj as a pastor, professor of communications, creative artist, sculptor, poet and a theological writer.&lt;ref name="wine"/&gt;

The church historian, K. L. Richardson of the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], [[Hyderabad]], [[India]], in ''Towards Self-Reliance: A historical survey of the programmes and efforts of Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church from 1927–1969, Published by D. Christopher and T. Kanakaiah, Vijayawada, 2003&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;K. L. Richardson, ''Towards Self-Reliance: A historical survey of the programmes and efforts of Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church from 1927–1969, Published by D. Christopher and T. Kanakaiah, Vijayawada, 2003, pp.120, 133, 134''.&lt;/ref&gt;
has highlighted the contribution of Raj with special reference to Indian liturgy and music.  Richardson writes, 
{{quote|''(Adapted)'' During 1960s, Rev. P. Solomon Raju contributed very much to the AELC on indigenous methods through his writings, seminars and other special efforts.  Many Christian plays, [[Burra katha]]s and [[Hari Katha]]s were written in Telugu by the distinguished writers and musicians including Solomon Raj.}}

Much like theologians of India believing in the Indian ethos akin to [[A. B. Masilamani]], [[D. S. Amalorpavadass]], [[Victor Premasagar]], [[M. Victor Paul]] and others, Raj believes that it is only that form of Christianity, deeply etched in the diverse cultures of India, that can affect Christianity in India.  While [[A. B. Masilamani]] promoted Indian liturgy in the Christian Hymnal in Telugu, [[D. S. Amalorpavadass]] advocated for vernacular liturgy.  Similarly, Victor Premasagar had recognised the contribution of indigenous movements.&lt;ref name="wine"/&gt; [[M. Victor Paul]] rooted for indigenous churches in place of institutionalized ones.  It is in such a setting that Raj's contribution gains credence in the light of his doctoral dissertation on the Bible Mission Movement by Father Devadas which [[Roger E. Hedlund]] writes as,
{{quote|Solomon Raj shows that the traditional mission-founded Churches are really ''Western'' appendages.  This is true of the Lutherans and other traditional denominations including the Church of South India and the Church of North India.  Solomon Raj predicts that movements such as this one (Bible Mission of Fr. Devadas) will have an ever increasing influence upon Christianity in India.&lt;ref&gt;Roger E. Hedlund, ''Quest for Identity: India's Churches of Indigenous Origin: the "Little Tradition" in Indian Christianity'', published by the ISPCK for Mylapore Institute for Indigenous Studies, Madras, 2006, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As an artist, Raj received global acclaim.  Gudrun Löwner of the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]] has devoted a section in ''The Oxford Handbook of Christianity in Asia&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Löwner, ''Christian Art and Architecture in Asia'' in Felix Wilfred (Edited), The Oxford Handbook of Christianity in Asia, Oxford University Press, 2014, pp.458–476.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=CtNjAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=lutheran+solomon+raj&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBGoVChMIwLbkhPCIxwIV1gqOCh1G4A1R#v=onepage&amp;q=lutheran%20solomon%20raj&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;'',
{{quote|Still alive and creative is the Lutheran theologian and artist, Solomon Raj who uses batik and woodcuts, which use cheap materials that are readily available.  He depicts Jesus amidst the refugees and suffering people.  The artist's favourite story is John 4, where he shows the liberative message of Jesus taking water from an untouchable woman, something which is still distant reality in South Indian villages, where the Dalits are not allowed to take water from the wells of others since they are considered 'polluting'.}}

==Early education and studies==

===Graduate studies===
Raj underwent initial studies between 1940–1945&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; at the AELC-[[Andhra Christian College]], [[Guntur]] and became a teacher.  During the tenure of [[A. N. Gopal]] as president of the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] Society, Raj was sent for theological studies to the [[Gurukul Lutheran Theological College]], [[Madras]], where he studied from 1953–1956, studying under thoroughbred faculty, including&lt;ref name="folk"/&gt; Professor Hans-Werner Gensichen.

===Post-graduate studies===
In 1964&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; during the tenure of [[G. Devasahayam]] at the AELC Church Society, Raj was sent for post-graduate studies to the [[Indiana University]], [[Indiana]], where he completed a master's degree in education.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt;

===Doctoral studies===
When the [[Selly Oak Colleges]], Birmingham invited&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; Raj to lecture in communication for term between 1978–1983, Raj not only taught at the college but also enrolled as a doctoral candidate and pursued research studies under the guidance of Walter Hollenweger.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; Raj also spent time at the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]].&lt;ref name="folk"/&gt;

===Art student===
As an artist, Raj first learnt the nuances of art through the [[Sunday School]] and later became a student&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; of the notable artist, [[Damerla Rama Rao]] and cleared a state examination in drawing and painting.  While at the [[Indiana University]], he learnt woodblock printing and etching.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; As for batik, he learnt it from his friends in [[Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt;

==Career==
The career graph of Raj shows him as a teacher, pastor, administrator, professor and as an artist.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt;

===Pastor===
Although Raj began his career as a teacher, he soon became a pastor of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church Society serving as a chaplain of the AELC-[[Andhra Christian College]], Guntur serving during 1956–1959.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; He then served at the Lutheran Theological College, [[Rajahmundry]] for a year, 1959–1960.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt;

===Administrator===
In 1960, on the invitation of the [[National Council of Churches in India]] (NCCI), he took up the directorship of the Department for Audio-Visual education and served in [[Nagpur]], the headquarters of the NCCI from 1960–1968.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; In 1968, he moved to [[Vijayawada]] to take up a role as director of the radio station, ''Suvartha Vani&lt;ref&gt;Francis Peter Barboza, ''Christianity in Indian Dance Forms'', Sri Satguru Publications, 1990, p. 193.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=0DfkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=suvartha+vani+p.+solomon+raj&amp;dq=suvartha+vani+p.+solomon+raj&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBmoVChMIh8f9-p6IxwIVTG2OCh1aIgNH]&lt;/ref&gt;'', a multimedia project of the Andhra Pradesh Council of Churches, serving during the period 1968–1978.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; K. L. Richardson writes that ''Rev. P. Solomon Raj of the AELC who had rich experience in radio evangelism also served in the programme of Suvartha Vani''.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

===Professor===
Raj took up professorship and lectured at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham, from 1978–1983,&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt; where he taught communication.  Raj was visiting lecturer in the United States of America during 1984–1985.

==Contribution==
Scholars down the line have acknowledged the contribution of Raj to theology and art.

===Writings===
[[Ravela Joseph]] and [[B. Suneel Bhanu]], who had undertaken a compilation in 1993 entitled ''Bibliography of original Christian writings in India in Telugu'' on behalf of the [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], acknowledged Raj to be one of the original Christian writers&lt;ref name="Bibliography"&gt;[[Ravela Joseph]] and [[B. Suneel Bhanu]] (Compiled), ''Bibliography of original Christian writings in India in Telugu'', [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], Bangalore, 1993, pp.3, 20, 29, 36, 40 and 67.&lt;/ref&gt; in Telugu.

Richard in ''New Wine Skins: The Story of the Indigenous Missions in coastal Andhra Pradesh'', published by the ISPCK, New Delhi for the Mylapore Institute for Indigenous Studies, Madras, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; is a gifted artist particularly in [[Batik]]s where he specialised in Biblical themes while drawing on Indian cultural symbols.  This makes him a rare bird among Indian Christians, but the combination of artist and missiologist is still more rare.}}

{{quote|Solomon Raj is a true universal Christian artist blending a Christian vision with the language of International Art using for example, Indian symbols, Indonesian Batik technique, Japanese woodcut and some stereotypes of orthodox icons – all this with a powerful and very personal new style.  His art works are loved and admired by many people all over the world.&lt;ref name="fiery"/&gt;}}
* Fr. Peter Balleis, SJ, Mission Procurator, [[Nurnberg]],
{{quote|...one could hardly overlook his (Solomon Raj's) presence, which was visible in the form of a good number of his artistic works in some of our offices and corridors.&lt;ref name="fiery"/&gt;}}

==Recognition and honours==
In 1986, Raj was elected as the president of the Indian Christian Art Association.&lt;ref name="fiery"/&gt; In 1987–88, Raj was William Paton Fellow at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham.&lt;ref name="Volker"/&gt;

A '''parallel projection''' is a projection of an object in three-dimensional space onto a fixed [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]], known as the ''[[projection plane]]'' or ''image plane'', where the ''rays'', known as ''lines of sight'' or ''projection lines'', are [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other. It is a basic tool in [[descriptive geometry]]. The projection is called ''[[orthographic projection|orthographic]]'' if the rays are perpendicular (orthogonal) to the image plane, and ''[[oblique projection|oblique]]'' or ''skew'' if they are not.

==Overview==
[[File:Parallel-proj-def.svg|thumb|Parallel projection terminology and notations. The two blue parallel line segments to the right remain parallel when projected onto the image plane to the left.]]
A parallel projection is a particular case of ''[[projection (mathematics)|projection]]'' in [[mathematics]] and ''[[graphical projection]]'' in [[technical drawing]].  Parallel projections can be seen as the limit of a [[central projection|central]] or [[perspective projection]], in which the rays pass through a fixed point called the ''center'' or ''viewpoint'', as this point is moved towards infinity. Put differently, a parallel projection corresponds to a perspective projection with an infinite [[focal length]] (the distance between the lens and the focal point in [[photography]]) or "[[Zooming (filmmaking)|zoom]]". In parallel projections, lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space remain parallel in the two-dimensional projected image.

A perspective projection of an object is often considered more realistic than a parallel projection, since it more closely resembles [[human vision]] and [[photography]]. However, parallel projections are popular in technical applications, since the parallelism of an object's lines and faces is preserved, and direct measurements can be taken from the image. Among parallel projections, orthographic projections are the most realistic, and are commonly used by engineers. On the other hand, certain types of oblique projections (for example [[Axonometry#Special axonometries|cavalier projection]], [[Axonometry#Special axonometries|military projection]]) are very simple to implement, and are used to create quick and informal pictorials of objects.

The term ''parallel projection'' is used in the literature to describe both the ''procedure itself'' (a mathematical mapping function) as well as the resulting image ''produced by the procedure''.

== Properties ==
[[File:Cube-parallel-proj-s.svg|300px|thumb|Two parallel projections of a cube. In an orthographic projection (at left), the projection lines are perpendicular to the image plane (pink). In an oblique projection (at right), the projection lines are at a skew angle to the image plane.]]
Every parallel projection has the following properties.
* It is uniquely defined by its projection plane ''Π'' and the direction &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; of the (parallel) projection lines. The direction must not be parallel to the projection plane.
* Any point of the space has a unique image in the projection plane ''Π'', and the points of ''Π'' are fixed.
* Any line not parallel to direction &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is mapped onto a line; any line parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is mapped onto a point.
* Parallel lines are mapped on parallel lines, or on a pair of points (if they are parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt;). 
* The [[ratio]] of the length of two line segments on a line stays unchanged.  As a special case, [[midpoint]]s are mapped on midpoints. 
* The [[Length measurement|length]] of a line segment parallel to the projection plane remains unchanged. The length of any line segment is shortened if the projection is an orthographic one.{{clarify|This appears to contradict the first sentence!|date=April 2017}} 
* Any [[circle]] that lies in a plane parallel to the projection plane is mapped onto a circle with the same radius. Any other circle is mapped onto an [[ellipse]] or a line segment (if direction &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to the circle's plane).
* [[Angles]] in general are not preserved. But [[right angle]]s with one line parallel to the projection plane remain unchanged. 
* Any [[rectangle]] is mapped onto a [[parallelogram]] or a line segment (if &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to the rectangle's plane).
* Any figure in a plane that is parallel to the image plane is congruent to its image.

== Orthographic projection ==
{{main|Orthographic projection|Multiview projection|Axonometric projection}}
[[File:Camera focal length distance house animation.gif|thumb|right|A parallel projection corresponds to a perspective projection with a hypothetical viewpoint; i.e. one where the camera lies an infinite distance away from the object and has an infinite focal length, or "zoom".]]
[[File:Various projections of cube above plane.svg|thumb|Various projections and how they are produced]]
Orthographic projection is derived from the principles of [[descriptive geometry]], and is a type of parallel projection where the projection rays are perpendicular to the projection plane. It is the projection type of choice for [[Plan (drawing)|working drawings]].

The term ''orthographic'' is sometimes reserved specifically for depictions of objects where the principal axes or planes of the object are parallel with the projection plane (or the paper on which the orthographic or parallel projection is drawn). However, the term [[multiview projection]] is also used. In ''multiview projections'', up to six pictures of an object are produced, with each projection plane perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes. Sub-types of multiview orthographic projections include ''plans'', ''elevations'' and ''sections''.

When the principal planes or axes of an object are ''not'' parallel with the projection plane, but are rather tilted to some degree to reveal multiple sides of the object, it is called an [[axonometric projection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mitchell | first = William |author2=Malcolm McCullough | title = Digital design media | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 1994 | pages = 169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZoGgQEhKkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-471-28666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Axonometric projection'' (not to be confused with the closely related ''[[axonometry|principle of axonometry]]'', as described in [[Pohlke's theorem]]) is further subdivided into three groups: ''isometric'', ''dimetric'' and ''trimetric projection'', depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y_YqOlXoxMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wqg9m-MaKI&amp;sig=xZ9MEJ8JjFcg28YefGxBW4zcZ2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Tjj2SvO_CM-n8AaI8bTzCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwBQ#v=twopage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Drawing distinctions: the varieties of graphic expression|last=Maynard|first=Patric|last2=|first2=|date=2005|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0-8014-7280-6|location=|pages=22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcreynolds"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4eYq7-2YhYC&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Advanced graphics programming using openGL|last=McReynolds|first=Tom|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=1-55860-659-9|pages=502|author2=David Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical characteristic of axonometric pictorials is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.

==Oblique projection==
{{main|Oblique projection}}
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]]. The presence of one or more 90&amp;deg; angles is usually a good indication that the perspective is ''oblique''.]]
In an oblique projection, the parallel projection rays are not perpendicular to the viewing plane, but strike the projection plane at an angle other than ninety degrees.&lt;ref name="maynard"/&gt; In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, oblique projection is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for formal, working drawings.  In an oblique pictorial drawing, the displayed angles among the axes as well as the foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane. Special types of oblique projections include ''military'', ''cavalier'' and ''cabinet projection''.&lt;ref name="desai"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQiIj8ZS0IoC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Computer Graphics|last=Desai|first=Apurva A.|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=81-203-3524-4|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analytic representation ==
If the image plane is given by equation &lt;math&gt;\Pi:~\vec{n}\cdot\vec{x}-d=0&lt;/math&gt; and the direction of projection by &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt;, then the projection line through the point &lt;math&gt;P:~\vec p&lt;/math&gt; is parametrized by
:: &lt;math&gt;g:~\vec x = \vec p+t\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
The image &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of line &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;; it is given by the equation
::&lt;math&gt;P':~\vec{p}' = \vec p + \frac{d-\vec p\cdot\vec{n}}{\vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}}\;\vec{v} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

In several cases, these formulas can be simplified.

(S1) If one can choose the vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec v &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}=1&lt;/math&gt;, the formula for the image simplifies to
:::&lt;math&gt;\vec p' = \vec p + (d-\vec p\cdot\vec{n})\;\vec{v}  \ .&lt;/math&gt;
(S2) In an orthographic projection, the vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec v &lt;/math&gt; are parallel.  In this case, one can choose &lt;math&gt;\vec v = \vec n ,\; |\vec n|=1&lt;/math&gt; and one gets 
:::&lt;math&gt;\vec p' = \vec p + (d-\vec p\cdot\vec{n})\;\vec{n}  \ .&lt;/math&gt;
(S3) If one can choose the vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec v &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and if the image plane contains the origin, one has &lt;math&gt;d=0&lt;/math&gt; and the parallel projection is a [[linear mapping]]:
:::&lt;math&gt;\vec p' = \vec p - (\vec p\cdot\vec{n})\;\vec{v}=\vec p-(\vec v\otimes \vec n)~\vec p = (I_3-\vec v\otimes \vec n)\;\vec p \ .&lt;/math&gt;
(Here &lt;math&gt;I_3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; the [[outer product]].)

From this analytic representation of a parallel projection one can deduce most of the properties stated in the previous sections.

The '''South Street Headhouse District'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southstreet.com|title=South Street Headhouse District}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also referred to as '''South Street''', even though it also includes Pine Street and only spans the streets east of Broad Street&lt;ref name=sshd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southstreet.com/businesses/map-of-the-district/|title=Map of South Street Headhouse District}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Philadelphia]] is an area with more than 300 stores  which includes a diverse urban mix of shops, bars and eateries.  The neighborhood is generally bounded between Front Street and Seventh Street and includes Pine Street and is known for its "[[Bohemianism|bohemian]]", "[[Punk subculture|punk]]", and generally "[[Alternative lifestyles|alternative]]" atmosphere.  It is one of Philadelphia's largest tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="tourist"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120616031722/http://press.visitphilly.com/releases/what-s-in-the-south-street-neighborhood What's In The South Street Neighborhood?] (archived), [[Visitphilly.com]] Accessed August 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Demographics==
In 2014, the area's population was 27,805.  The average age for the neighborhood is 34.9, with 57.44% of the population between the ages of 18 to 44 and 62.3% of the population are renters with the average income of $71,856.&lt;ref name=sshd2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southstreet.com/businesses/key-facts-demographics/|title=Key Facts &amp; Demographics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to City Data, the area has 1,248 males and 1,196 females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/South-Street-Philadelphia-PA.html|title=South Street Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district spans the following areas:&lt;ref name=sshd2/&gt;
* [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]] from [[Front Street (Philadelphia)|Front]] to [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad]].  Some sources also say that the neighborhood has begun to expand west from here since 2014.  Traditionally, the original neighborhood only existed from Front to 7th.  The limit as of 2017 is 11th Street
* Pine Street at 2nd ([[Head House Square]])
* [[Lombard Street (Philadelphia)|Lombard Street]] between Front and 3rd
* Kater Street
* 4th Street down to Catherine Street ([[Fabric Row]])
* Passyunk Avenue south to Fitzwater

The neighborhood significantly overlaps with [[Queen Village, Philadelphia|Queen Village]], [[Washington Square West, Philadelphia|Washington Square West]], [[Bella Vista, Philadelphia|Bella Vista]], and [[Society Hill, Philadelphia|Society Hill]].

==History==
{{seealso|South Street (Philadelphia)}}Originally the southern border of William Penn's 1682 city plan and officially named Cedar Street until 1854&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/philadelphia/formerstreets.htm|title=Philadelphia History: Old Street Names.|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eastern South Street has been the center of local Swedish, Dutch, Jewish, Irish, and Italian immigrant culture as well as a vibrant [[African-American neighborhood]] beginning in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/south-street/|title=South Street {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Quaker doctrine opposed live performances within the city limits, the first permanent theater in America was built on the south side of the street at Leithgow Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hiddencityphila.org/2012/01/hippest-street-in-town-circa-1766/|title=Hippest Street In Town, Circa 1766 {{!}} Hidden City Philadelphia|website=hiddencityphila.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, giving birth to a tradition of Philadelphians seeking out entertainment on South Street that continues today.

In 1854, the same year that South Street officially became South Street, the city boundaries were redrawn to expand the area of Philadelphia to 130 square miles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/consolidation-act-of-1854/|title=Consolidation Act of 1854 {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite no longer being a literal border, South Street remained a liminal space where cultures collided. The African-American theater district of western South Street, the Jewish shops, nearby Italian businesses, and visitors from other parts of the city combined to create a place described by [[William Gardner Smith]] in his 1954 book ''South Street'' as a lively zone of contact between many different ethnicities. [[File:NW Corner South St and Front Philly.JPG|220px|right|thumb|Corner of South and Front]]
From the early 1960s to the 1970s, South Street was filled with clubs and bars that fostered a growing nightlife. During this time, the neighborhood also served as an artists' haven and a hub of [[Beat Generation|Beat subculture]] and, later, [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], [[bohemianism]], and the [[hippie movement]] in Philadelphia, establishing a lasting association of South Street with [[avant-garde]] and [[alternative culture|alternative subcultures]].&lt;ref name="icons"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6Iii1MNkXoC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDyuqXqu7LAhXIZCYKHXmWB2A4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false|title=Philadelphia Icons: 50 Classic Views of the City of Brotherly Love|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frommers"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WR5OAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbyJLarO7LAhWEMSYKHecyDf8Q6AEIOzAF|title=Frommer's Philadelphia &amp; the Amish Country|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lauren|date=2009|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keech"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beMxAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=The Best Flea, Antique, Vintage, and New-Style Markets in America|last1=Keech|first1=Pamela|date=2013|publisher=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASTKVQDpbYYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=Blinded by the Lyrics: Behind the Lines of Rock and Roll's Most Baffling Songs|last1=Mann|first1=Brett|date=2005|publisher=Citadel Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMHcDciM3kMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIUTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=Black Citymakers: How The Philadelphia Negro Changed Urban America|last1=Hunter|first1=Marcus Anthony|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was not uncommon for South Philadelphians to "[[bar hopping|bar-hop]]" across the clubs, listening to live bands along the way. This community of fans helped attract recording contracts for many artists, including [[Kenn Kweder]], the "bard of South Street"; [[George Thorogood]]; and [[Robert Hazard]]. From the mid to late 1970s into the 1980s, South Street's reputation as a musical, artistic, and [[countercultural]] hub was further solidified as it became the center of Philadelphia's [[punk scene]] and [[punk rock|punk]] and [[alternative rock]] music communities, with venues such as JC Dobbs and stores such as Zipperhead catering to the burgeoning scene.&lt;ref name="amorosi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amorosi|first1=A.D.|title=Where They Were Then|url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2002-10-17/cover3.shtml|website=Philadelphia City Paper|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laird"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laird|first1=R.F.|title=The Boomer Bible|date=1991|publisher=Workman Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-IT-INLWzkC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTp4n1qO7LAhUDQyYKHXGeArwQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ivory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|title=Philadelphia Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places|date=2007|publisher=Globe Pequot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7VhpHPjcscC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTp4n1qO7LAhUDQyYKHXGeArwQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, [[Jim's Steaks]] of [[West Philadelphia]]  expanded to 400 South Street, becoming the notable restaurant's first franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimssteaks.com/jim-s-steaks--history.html|title=Jim's Steaks History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, South Street became one of the city's main tourist attractions anchored by the [[Theatre of Living Arts]] (TLA) which began as an [[Art film|arthouse]] theater and then was reborn as a live music venue. Tourists flocked to the South Street's nightlife and the "neighborhood" community aspect was gradually lost.

South Street remains a popular hangout area for teens, college students, and [[twentysomething (term)|twentysomethings]] with its assortment of bars, [[take-out]] eateries, [[sex shop]]s, gift shops, and retailers catering to [[hip hop fashion]], [[punk fashion]], and/or [[urban culture]].  A few restaurants and independent [[boutique]]s targeting a slightly more mature clientele are interspersed with these businesses, such as Accent on Animals, a pet supply store, and South Street Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant. Starting in the late 1990s, the street saw the establishment of various [[chain store]]s, including [[Johnny Rockets]], two [[Starbucks]] locations, [[Häagen-Dazs]], [[Rita's Italian Ice]], [[Super Fresh]], [[Whole Foods]], [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]], and [[Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits]].  South Street is adjacent to [[Headhouse Square]], a notable plaza with various shops and restaurants.

Artist [[Isaiah Zagar]] has made South Street his home since the late 1960s and his mosaic work can be seen in multiple places along South Street including his large installation [[Philadelphia's Magic Gardens]] between 10th Street and 11th Street.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Zipperhead south street philly.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Zipperhead (now relocated and changed name) was mentioned in the song "Punk Rock Girl" by the [[Dead Milkmen]].]]
[[The Orlons]], a music group from Philadelphia, released a 1963 song based on (and entitled) South Street, which begins with the line "Where do all the hippies meet?"  Another Philadelphia-area band, [[The Dovells]] also mentioned South Street in their 1963 hit "[[You Can't Sit Down]]".

Philadelphia band [[Need New Body]] has a song called "So St RX" which is about South Street.

[[Fear (band)|Fear]]'s 1982 song "[[The Record (album)|I Don't Care About You]]", which name-checks the neighborhoods associated with the punk movement in the United States in the early 1980s, begins with the line, "I'm from South Street Philadelphia" (also relevant to writer/vocalist [[Lee Ving]] who was born in the city).

[[The Dead Milkmen]]'s 1988 song "Punk Rock Girl" makes references to Zipperhead (a punk rock/alternative clothing and accessories store) and The Philadelphia Pizza Company., Ltd, both of which were located on South Street. Portions of the video for this song were filmed on South Street. Zipperhead has since relocated to South 4th St. and been renamed to Crash Bang Boom. A few years after Zipperhead founder and building landlord Rick Millan sold the business to local musician Rob Windfelder of the rock band Live Not On Evil and his business partner Stefanie Jollis, the store was relocated and renamed.

[[Green Day]] made their Philadelphia debut on January 23, 1993 at J.C. Dobbs on the 300 block of South Street. The band had not yet signed with Reprise and the club oversold the 125-capacity venue. Late arrivals paid to enter the second floor and watch the live video feed. During the third song of the set, a young woman had a seizure, the show was halted, and police ended the concert and cleared the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pearn Jr.|first=Frank |date=January 23, 1993|title=Philadelphia Police Seize The Moment At Dobbs |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1993-01-23/entertainment/2906403_1_green-day-dobbs-punk-rock|newspaper=The Morning Call|location=Allentown|publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boyz II Men]]'s debut song and video "[[Motownphilly]]" was partially filmed on South Street and the location is referenced in the song.

Singer songwriter Jake Laufer's 2009 rockabilly song, "Center City," about a guy from Tennessee coming north to meet up with his Philly-based girlfriend, features several South Street landmarks, including Lorenzo's Pizza and Famous 4th Street Deli.

'''''Symphony of Dialogue''''' (2009) by the [[Turkey|Turkish]] composer [[Evrim Demirel]] reflects the composer's influences on both contemporary Western and traditional Turkish music.  The piece based on the dialogue of diverse cultures; it embraces Christianity, Judaism and Islam in one work of art and conveys their peaceful messages through the music. The novelty of the “Symphony of Dialogue” is having a traditional Qur'an singer in a western way of composed music.

“Symphony of Dialogue” is a pure message of peace and love through the music, which is entirely humanistic in its nature.

==Composition==
Musical voyage starts on a steady sustained chord which appears throughout the piece. Stationary chord is interrupted by the timpani hits amplified with the piano. Interruptions evolve new textures and drag the piece into the more anxious musical territories. Steady and unsteady musical structures interact each other through the piece and the singers endeavor to keep music in a more restful atmosphere.

'''''The Memory of Our People''''' is a [[magazine]] published in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] city of [[Rosario]], a province of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. The magazine was founded in 2004. Its original title in Spanish is "La Memoria de Nuestro Pueblo".

==History==
''The Memory of Our People'' is published by the Center for Political Studies, Economic and Social. "The Future Has History" is devoted to recovering voices, mostly from the recent past, and to provide testimony about Argentine history, the arts, the social sciences, politics and [[Latin America]] in general. It has published articles, reviews, case studies and trials by more than one hundred authors, many of whom are graduates of the [[National University of Rosario]]. A large percentage of them are or have studied in the Faculty of Humanities and Arts, with another large group formed by current or former students of the Faculty of Political Science and International Relations. There is also a significant presence of columnists from the area of social sciences at the [[University of Buenos Aires]]. However, this does not mean membership is excluded based on academic status. In contrast, the magazine strives to speak with absolute freedom, critically and even iconoclastically&lt;!--Check if the translation of this word makes sense.--&gt;, as long as it supports the unimpeded and unrestricted defense of democratic governance and human rights.

'''''Transcendence''''' is an outdoor sculpture by [[Keith Jellum]], located in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States. It depicts a fish flying through the brickwork above Southpark Seafood at the northwestern corner of Southwest Salmon Street and Southwest Park Avenue in [[Downtown Portland]].&lt;ref name=May&gt;{{cite news|last=May|first=Joseph|title="Transcendence", a fish flying through a building — a sculpture by Keith Jellum|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/travelforaircraft/2011/10/30/“transcendence”-a-fish-flying-through-a-building-—-a-sculpture-by-keith-jellum/|accessdate=April 13, 2015|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jennifer|title=Stumptown Stumper|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=92227|accessdate=April 13, 2015|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture measures {{Convert|11|ft|m}} long and is made of hand forged and welded bronze. ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' said of the sculpture and its relation to the city: "There is much in the way of art there and one cannot get a bad coffee, beer or glass of wine there. People there are friendly and not above being whimsical, perhaps this is why Keith Jellum's installation found a home in Portland?"&lt;ref name=May/&gt;

The '''Ucross Foundation''', located in [[Ucross, Wyoming|Ucross]], [[Wyoming]], is a nonprofit organization that operates an internationally known retreat for visual artists, writers, composers, and choreographers working in all creative disciplines.

==History==
Founded in 1981 by [[Raymond Plank]], Ucross is located on a 20,000-acre working cattle ranch in northeastern Wyoming.  The Big Red Complex, which includes the Foundation’s main offices and a renovated barn that houses a public art gallery, was built in 1882 and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The name Ucross comes from the original brand of the Pratt and Ferris Cattle Company in the 1880s, which operated a large ranching concern with Big Red as its headquarters.  Along with James Pratt and Cornelius Ferris, one of the early partners in the ranch was [[Marshall Field]].

==Residency and outreach==
The Foundation provides living accommodations, studio space, uninterrupted time in the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] landscape to competitively selected individuals, for two to six weeks.  Up to ten individuals are in residence at any one time.  The Foundation has four writing studios, four visual arts studios, and two composing studios and a choreography studio.  Approximately ninety-five individuals are supported annually.

Residents live in the historic Ucross School House or the Clearmont Train Depot, which have been renovated to include four bedrooms each, with a dining area, living area, and main kitchen in the School House.

Ucross has hosted over 1,400 artists-in-residence from across the United States and the world. The Foundation participates in a number of long-term collaborations with other arts organizations, including the [[Sundance Institute]] Theatre Program, the Alpert Award in the Arts (administered by [[CalArts]] and supported by the Herb Alpert Foundation), and the [[Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award|Ernest Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award]] for First Fiction. Ucross also collaborates with the [[Alley Theatre]], [[University of Wyoming]]'s MFA Program in Creative Writing, the Pew Fellowships in the Arts, The Ford Family Foundation Fellowship for Oregon Artists, and the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]’s Elaine Lebenbom Award for Female Composers.

The Ucross Foundation Art Gallery operates year-round at no cost to the public and typically features exhibitions by Ucross Fellows.  The barn loft provides space for occasional conferences and public concerts.  The Foundation was named a recipient of the Wyoming Governor’s Arts Award for Excellence in the Arts in 2005.

==Land stewardship==
Ucross has also supported numerous conservation initiatives, including the planting of thousands of trees on the ranch and the placement of a conservation easement on over 12,000 acres of the ranch with the Wyoming Chapter of [[The Nature Conservancy]]. In 2010, the Ucross Ranch, currently leased by the [[Apache Foundation]], was named a finalist for the Leopold Conservation Award, given by the [[Sand County Foundation]].  The newest land initiative at Ucross involves the creation of a community park that honors the Ucross founder’s commitment to land stewardship, along with that of his sons, Roger Plank and Michael Plank.

'''''Valley of the Wolves: Iraq''''' ({{lang-tr|Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak}}) is a 2006 [[Cinema of Turkey|Turkish]] [[action film]] directed by [[Serdar Akar]] and starring [[Necati Şaşmaz]], [[Billy Zane]] and [[Ghassan Massoud]]. The story concerns a Turkish commando team which goes to [[Iraq]] to track down the [[US military]] commander responsible for the [[Hood event]].

The film is set during the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]] and includes references to other real events such as the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prison scandal]]. The film, which went on nationwide general release across Turkey on {{start date|2006|02|03}}, was the highest-grossing Turkish films of 2006 and is one of the most expensive [[Turkey|Turkish]] films ever made.

It is part of the ''[[Valley of the Wolves]]'' media franchise, based on [[Valley of the Wolves (TV series)|the Turkish television series of the same name]], and was followed by ''[[Valley of the Wolves: Gladio]]'' (2008) and ''[[Valley of the Wolves: Palestine]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Luke | last=Harding

==Background==
The film covers through fiction real-life events like the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]], [[Daniel Pearl|the execution of Daniel Pearl]] and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture scandal]]. Nevertheless, the film's primary focus is [[Hood Event|the Hood event]] ({{lang-tr|Çuval Olayı}}), an incident on July 4, 2003 following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] where a group of [[Turkish Armed Forces|Turkish military personnel]] operating in northern [[Iraq]] were captured, led away with [[Hood (headgear)|hood]]s over their heads, and interrogated by the [[Military of the United States|United States military]].

The arrest is infamous in Turkey as the so-called "Hood event". The soldiers were led out of their headquarters at gunpoint, with hoods over their heads and subsequently detained for sixty hours before being released, after [[Turkey]] protested to the United States. This was the first time such an incident had taken place between the two NATO allies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Though neither side ever apologized, a US-Turkish commission set up to investigate the incident later issued a joint statement of regret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = | last= 
|pages= | title= Regret over Turkish troops' arrest| date= 2003-07-15| work= [[BBC News]]| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3067319.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[US Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] wrote a letter to the [[Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], expressing sorrow over what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=abundance-of-rumsfeld-letters-in-turkish-press-2003-07-20 Abundance of 'Rumsfeld letters' in Turkish press] ''[[Hürriyet Daily News]]'', 7/20/2003&lt;/ref&gt; Many Turks took offense at the incident while it lasted, and after it as well.

==Plot==
The film opens with a fictional depiction of a real-life incident, the "[[Hood event]]". On July 4, 2003, the Turkish soldiers believe they are having an ordinary visit from their [[NATO]] allies, but a sudden change occurs, and 11 allied Turkish [[special forces]] soldiers and 13 civilians are arrested by Colonel Sam William Marshall ([[Billy Zane]]), in the northern Iraq town of [[Sulaymaniyah]]. They are forced to wear hoods while in detention, and are released some time later.

A Turkish officer named Suleyman Aslan, who was a member of the special forces troops involved in the Hood event, is unable to bear the shame of what happened, and commits suicide. Before doing so, he writes a letter saying goodbye to his friend, Polat Alemdar ([[Necati Şaşmaz]]). Alemdar is a former Turkish intelligence agent who has recently severed links to the government agency for which he worked. Determined to avenge his friend's humiliation, Alemdar travels to [[Iraq]] along with several of his colleagues, seeking vengeance on the American commander whose actions led to Aslan's suicide.

At a checkpoint, Alemdar and his team kill three Iraqi Kurdish paramilitary troops called "[[Peshmerga|Peshmerge]]". They attach explosives to the foundation of a hotel, to which they demand Colonel Sam William Marshall, who was responsible for the hooding incident, come. When Marshall arrives, Polat wants him to put a sack over his head and to publicly leave the hotel with him, allowing journalists to take photos, taking the same insult he committed to Polat's dead friend. The group threatens to blow up the hotel unless Marshall and some of his men let themselves be led out of the hotel while hooded. Marshall refuses and brings in a group of Iraqi children as [[human shield]]s. Alemdar gives in and leaves.

Marshall raids an Arab wedding on the pretext of hunting [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|"terrorists"]]. When the usual celebratory gunfire starts, one soldier states: "Now they are shooting, now they are terrorists"; they attack a wedding party, where a small child named Ali sticks a branch up the barrel of one of the soldiers' guns. At first, the soldier just hushes the boy away; the second time, he opens fire and afterwards looks astonished as he sees the little child dead. The rest of the soldiers panic and open fire on the wedding guests, beat up the bride, shoot the groom, the guests and children. The survivors are captured and forced into an airtight container truck and sent to [[Abu Ghraib]] prison.

En route to Abu Ghraib, an American soldier complains that the prisoners might be suffocating in the truck. One of Marshall's men then fires on the truck, spraying the detainees with bullets. "See, now they won't suffocate to death", he says. When the soldier threatens to report the incident, he is promptly shot. In Abu Ghraib, a group of American soldiers, among them the sole female Westerner in the film (a clear reference to [[Lynndie England]] and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture scandal]]), is making naked human pyramids from those arrested in the wedding, aided by an Arab interpreter. The prisoners are washed with high pressure nozzles in what appears to be cattle stalls.

In a later scene, the [[Daniel Pearl|execution of a Western journalist]] by Iraqi rebels is about to take place, but the [[sheikh]] Abdurrahman Halis Karkuki, who is esteemed by the rebels, prevents it, and offers the journalist the opportunity to kill the rebel who was about to kill him. The rebel does not resist, but the journalist declines the offer. Thereafter, the bride who survived the earlier massacre, Leyla, wants revenge by becoming a [[suicide bombing|suicide bomber]], but is talked out of it by the Sheikh. Leyla hurries to a market to stop her brother-in-law Abu Ali, the father of the child killed at the wedding, from blowing himself up in the place where Col. Marshall is having a meeting, but she arrives too late. Alemdar and his men, who are there to assassinate Marshall, are led to safety by Leyla.

Alemdar and his team then attempt to kill Marshall again by rigging a bomb in a piano (which once belonged to [[Saddam Hussein]]) that is being delivered to Marshall as a gift. The bomb explodes prematurely, and Marshall survives. Alemdar and Leyla then go to a mosque, to meet the sheikh. Marshall tracks them down, however, and a big firefight ensues. The entire village and mosque are destroyed by heavy gunfire. Together they manage to kill Marshall, but Leyla is also killed by Marshall.

==Controversy==
The film upset some viewers for its heavy and incriminating subject matter. Some{{Who|date=August 2012}} have criticized it for alleged stereotyping and "black and white" portrayal of the opposing forces.&lt;ref name="spiegel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,401565,00.html |title=Controversy Over Turkish Movie: Beyond the Valley of the Wolves - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy arrives mainly from the following scenes:

* In one sequence, American soldiers raid an Iraqi wedding and massacre a number of civilians, which might be an allusion to a [[Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre|wedding party massacre]] perpetrated by US forces caught on tape in Mukaradeeb on May 19, 2004.
* U.S. soldiers torture detainees in [[Baghdad Central Prison|Abu Ghraib prison]], which includes a female soldier making a human pyramid, referring to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] by US soldiers. It is the first depiction of actions by American soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison ever to appear on film.
* While captives are transported on a long journey in a container on a truck, one guard says to the other: "They might suffocate in the container because there is no fresh air supply". The truck stops, the American guard gets off the truck and fires hundreds of bullet-holes into the container with an automatic weapon "in order to make holes for the air to get in", and as a result many detainees are injured or get killed. A similar event is reported to have occurred in [[Afghanistan]] after the battle for [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] on November 9, 2001, with [[Taliban]] soldiers in the container and soldiers of the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] as their guardians, as described in the documentary film ''[[Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death]]'' by [[Ireland|Irish]] filmmaker [[Jamie Doran]]. This event is also reenacted in the film ''[[The Road to Guantanamo]]''.
* The film features a [[American Jews|Jewish American]] [[U.S. Army]] doctor ([[Gary Busey]]) who, as an inhuman figure common in urban legends and [[anti-Semitic]] propaganda, removes organs from injured civilian prisoners to sell to rich people in [[New York City|New York]], [[London]] and [[Tel-Aviv]] for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]].

== Scriptwriter and director point of view ==
The film's scriptwriter Bahadir Ozdener has defined the film by saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifeinmotion.wordpress.com/2007/02/11/valley-of-the-wolves-iraq/ |title=Review at |publisher=lifeinmotion.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our film is a sort of political action. Maybe 60 or 70 percent of what happens on screen is factually true. Turkey and America are allies, but Turkey wants to say something to its friend. We want to say the bitter truth. We want to say that this is wrong.}}

The movie's director, Serdar Akar, went further and said the film was supposed to promote a dialogue between religions.&lt;ref name="Letsch 2006"&gt;{{de icon}} Letsch, Constanze, "Dialog der Kulturen", in ''Jungle World'', 2006-02-22, {{ISSN|1613-0766}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reception==
{{Prose|section|date=May 2018}}

===Turkey===
* The film has pulled in record audiences on its release in Turkey, capitalizing on widespread opposition to the [[Iraq War]].
* When asked about the factual nature of the scenario, [[Bülent Arınç]], the chairman of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish Parliament]], replied "yes, this was exactly as it happened". He called the movie "an extraordinary film that will go into history".&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Letsch, 2006: "ein extraordinärer Film, der Geschichte machen wird".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Foreign minister [[Abdullah Gul]] states that "the film is no worse than some of the productions of Hollywood studios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2006/02/hollywood_stars.html |title='&amp;#39;US Hollywood "Stars" Zane and Busey Spreading America-Hate Worldwide'&amp;#39; Feb '06 |publisher=medienkritik.typepad.com |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Istanbul]] mayor [[Kadir Topbaş]] told the ''[[Associated Press]]'' that the movie "was very successful — a soldier's honor must never be damaged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11150082/ |title=New Turkish film {{sic|villifies|nolink=y}} Americans|publisher=[Amer[MSNBC]]|date=2006-02-02|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The reception in the Turkish media was split. Some called it a milestone for the Turkish film industry — others warned the movie might lead to a strengthening of religious extremism.&lt;ref name="Letsch 2006"/&gt;
* [[Mehmet Ali Birand]], a prominent Turkish columnist and anchorman, said he admired the filmmakers. "They have played with the inner feelings, unsatisfied feelings of Turkish public opinion, and they are making money."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Germany ===
* In Germany, the home of [[European Union]]'s largest Turkish community, the film was heavily criticized for its alleged racism and [[antisemitism]] by several politicians{{Who|date=August 2012}} from both the right and left ends of the spectrum of mainstream German politics and in several leading newspapers{{Which|date=August 2012}}{{Where|date=August 2012}}. As a reviewer in the mainstream magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' put it, referring to the film's reliance on a revenge motif, "This wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't portray the opponents of Turks and Muslims so brutally — the bad guys in this black and white world are the Americans, the Kurds, the Christians and the Jews.&lt;ref name="spiegel1"/&gt;
* In an interview with ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild am Sonntag]]'' on February 19, 2006, [[Bavaria]]n premier [[Edmund Stoiber]] called upon German theatre owners to stop showing ''Valley of the Wolves''. Shortly afterward, Germany's largest cinema chain, [[CinemaxX]], pulled the film, which had been popular among Germany's large Turkish community, from its theatres in response to the criticism from politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0072910/ |title=''German Movie Chain Pulls Anti-American Flick''|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2006-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film won a [[Bogey Awards|Bogey Award]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for Kurtlar vadisi – Irak|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493264/awards|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The Central Council of Jews", a Jewish-German organization, have expressed its opinion that ''Valley of the Wolves – Iraq'' (''Kurtlar Vadisi – Irak'') holds [[antisemitic]] views, and is racist. It requested German cinemas stop showing the film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===United States===

'''''We'Moon: Gaia Rhythms for Womyn''''' is an astrological and lunar calendar datebook, featuring art and writing submitted by, for and about women. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt; "Wemoon" means "women," "we of the moon" (for other [[alternative political spelling]]s, see [[Womyn]]). The datebook was founded in 1981 and is published annually in Oregon, USA, by Mother Tongue Ink (d.b.a. We’Moon Company). ''We'Moon'' is a publication focused on “helping women make their daily lives sacred and align themselves with Earth and Moon rhythms.” &lt;ref&gt; Eisenberg, ''Sage Woman Magazine #66''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''We'Moon'' was inspired by the women’s liberation and emerging people's movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and came to fruition in the 1980s as a vehicle for the creative expression of women's empowerment and [[earth-based spirituality]]. The idea of a special calendar for women—based on lunar, solar and astrological cycles—originated at Kvindelandet, an international [[womyn's land|women’s land]] in Denmark where 50–60 lesbians from different countries lived together in the late 1970s. The first ''We'Moon'' was self-published in France in 1981 under the name of Mother Tongue Ink, as a pocket-sized astrological moon calendar diary, handwritten in five languages. The first five editions were pocket-sized, homemade, and continually evolving in format, design and technology, changing languages every year. During these years, the datebook was created by groups of volunteers in various locations in Europe. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

''We'Moon '87'' was the first edition created in the U.S., where production has remained. Mother Tongue Ink, d.b.a. We’Moon Company, was incorporated in 1995. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.49, p,58&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mother Tongue Ink published a children’s book, ''The Last Wild Witch'', by [[Starhawk]], illustrated by Lindy Kehoe. ''In the Spirit of We’Moon – Celebrating 30 years – An Anthology of We’Moon Art and Writing'', was released in 2011. ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'' is "an anthology of writing and art originally published in the annual publication ''We'Moon'', with commentary and other new material." &lt;ref&gt; University of Oregon www.libweb.uoregon.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

''We'Moon'' sends out an annual Call for Contributions to women internationally, and publishes approximately 250 pieces of original art and writing in each year’s datebook. ''We'Moon''’s thematic focus includes feminism, goddess and earth-based spirituality, world community, environmentalism, peace and justice. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt;The datebook includes articles by astrologers Gretchen Lawlor, Heather Roan Robbins, [[Susan Levitt]] and Sandra Pastorius. Lunar phase and astrological aspect data are listed for each date. &lt;ref&gt; Sydney L. Murray, ''Vision Magazine'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ''We'Moon'' has published work by thousands of contributing women, including writings by [[Joanna Macy]], [[Starhawk]], [[Susan Weed]], [[Winona LaDuke]], [[Carolyn Gage]], [[Myshkin (singer)|Myshkin]], [[Vicki Noble]], [[Donna Henes]], [[Alice Walker]], and founding editor Musawa, and art by [[Monica Sjoo]], [[Tee Corinne]], [[Meinrad Craighead]], Toni Truesdale, [[Betty LaDuke]], Sandra Stanton, Leah Dorion, Max Dashu, Sudie Rakusin and Hrana Janto. &lt;ref&gt; ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p. 242 - 249&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zurich University of the Arts''' (ZHdK, {{lang-de|'''Zürcher Hochschule der Künste'''}}) has approximately 2,500 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK)|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it the largest arts university in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Departement Design &amp; Art Education Zurich University of the Arts|url=http://www.cumulusassociation.org/component/members/view/110|work= cumulusassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 2007, following the merger between Zurich’s School of Art and Design (HGKZ) and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT). ZHdK is one of four universities affiliated to [[Zürcher Fachhochschule]].

ZHdK offers Bachelor’s and master's degree courses and further education programmes in [[art]], [[design]], [[music]], [[art education]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[dance]], transdisciplinary studies as well as PhD programmes in collaboration with different international Art Uniuversities and with [[ETH Zurich]]. ZHdK holds an active role in research, especially in artistic research and design research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zürcher Hochschule der Künste|url=http://www.eenc.info/fr/organisation/zurich-university-of-the-arts/|work= eenc.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliated to ZHdK are the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]], the Theater der Künste (Theatre of the Arts), the Mehrspur Music Club, and the Media and Information Centre (MIZ).

== History ==
Established on 1 August 2007, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) resulted from the merger between the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich]] (HGKZ), which had arisen from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] (founded in 1878), and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich University of the Arts Universities Handbook |url=http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |work= universitieshandbook.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501144050/http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding president of the new arts university was Professor Hans-Peter Schwarz. Since November 2009, Professor Thomas D. Meier has been president of ZHdK.

The Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich (HGKZ) arose from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] Zürich (founded in 1878). It was located in a building constructed by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender, which today also houses the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]].

The School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT) was the result of a merger in 1999 between Winterthur and Zurich conservatories of music, Zurich’s Jazz School, Zurich’s Theatre and Acting Academy, and the Swiss Professional Ballet School. ZHdK’s programme in Theatre Studies (affiliated to the Department of Performing Arts and Film) was originally established in 1937, in the context of the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]] (the city’s principal theatre), and known as the  Bühnenstudio Zürich. It was renamed Schauspiel-Akademie Zürich in the early 1970s.

Following the 2007 school merger, ZHdK occupies 35 sites, spread across the cities of Zurich (Ausstellungsstrasse, Florhof, Mediacampus, Gessnerallee) and Winterthur. In the autumn of 2014, ZHdK will be relocating to its new campus: the Toni Areal (under construction) in the city’s thriving western district ([[Zurich West]]). With the exception of its Gessnerallee annex, ZHdK will be leaving all other sites to unite the arts under one roof. The [[Museum of Design, Zurich]] and the Bellerive Museum will remain at their current locations.

== Teaching and research ==
ZHdK offers taught Bachelor’s and master's degree courses, which have replaced the former diploma courses in the wake of the [[Bologna Process]]. Places on all degree courses are limited. The university also offers a foundation course in art and design and various further educating courses, leading either to a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) or a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).

With research becoming more firmly established at universities of applied sciences, ZHdK has significantly intensified its research activities. Its seven research institutes and two centres of excellence focus on artistic research in particular. Research is also undertaken in the fields of [[design]], [[art history]], art education, and [[musicology]]. And, ZhdK is also running several joint PhD programmes in cooperation with national and international universities.

== Departments ==
ZHdK has five departments:

The '''Department of Music''' is the largest department at ZHdK. It provides instrumental and voice training in Classical, Jazz, and Popular Music, as well as programmes in conducting and composition.
