'''Ackermann's formula''' is a [[control system]] design method for solving the [[Full state feedback|pole allocation]] problem. One of the primary problems in control system design is the creation of controllers that will alter the dynamics of a system and alter the poles to a more suitable, and sometimes more stable, state. Such a problem can be tackled by many different methods; one such solution is the addition of a feedback loop in such a way that a gain is added to the input with which one can change the poles of the original system. If the system is [[ Controllability|controllable]], an efficient method for pole placement is Ackermann's formula, which allows one to choose arbitrary poles within the system. &lt;ref&gt; Modern Control System Theory and Design, 2nd Edition by Stanley M. Shinners &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/utari/acs/ee4314/lectures/Lecture%2022.pdf |format=PDF |title=State variable feedback  |website=Uta.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State feedback system==
Consider a linear time invariant system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/State_Feedback#Ackerman.27s_formula|title=Control Systems/State Feedback - Wikibooks, open books for an open world|website=en.wikibooks.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[state-space representation]]

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; y(t)=Cx(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the state vector, &lt;math&gt; u(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the input vector, and &lt;math&gt; A,B,C &lt;/math&gt; are matrices of compatible dimensions that represent the dynamics of our system, and, for simplicity's sake, assume  &lt;math&gt; D=0 &lt;/math&gt;. An input-output description of this system is given by the [[transfer function]]

: &lt;math&gt; C(sI-A)^{-1}B=C\ \frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)}\ B.&lt;/math&gt;

Since  &lt;math&gt;(sI-A)^{-1}=\frac{\operatorname{Adj}(sI-A)}{\det(sI-A)} &lt;/math&gt;,  the denominator of the system is given by the [[characteristic polynomial]] of  &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the poles of the system are the [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

If the system is [[Exponential stability|unstable]], or has a slow response or any other characteristic that does not specify the design criteria, it could be advantageous to make changes to it. The realization given by &lt;math&gt;\{A,B,C\}&lt;/math&gt;, however, represents the dynamics of the system, and sometimes cannot be altered. Thus, one approach to this problem might be to create a feedback loop with a gain &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that will feed the state variable into the input.

If the system is [[Controllability|controllable]], there is always an input &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that any state &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; can be transferred to any other state &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;. With that in mind, a feedback loop can be added to the system with the control input &lt;math&gt;u(t)=r(t)-Kx(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such that the new dynamics of the system will be 

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+B[r(t)+Kx(t)]= [A+BK] x(t)+Br(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y(t)=Cx(t).&lt;/math&gt;

In this new realization, the poles will be dependent on the characteristic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{new}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A-BK&lt;/math&gt;, that is 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(s)=\det(sI-(A-BK)).&lt;/math&gt;

==Ackermann's formula==

Computing the characteristic polynomial and choosing a suitable feedback matrix can be a challenging task, especially in larger systems. One way to make computations easier is through Ackermann's formula. For simplicity's sake, consider a single input vector with no reference parameter &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, such as 

: &lt;math&gt;u(t)=-k^T x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot x(t)=Ax(t)-Bk^T x(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; is a feedback vector of compatible dimensions. Given that the system is still controllable, Ackermann's method states that the design process can be simplified by the following equation: 

: &lt;math&gt;k^T =\left[0\ 0\ \cdots \ 0\ 1\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta_\text{new}(A),
&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{new}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 

=== Proof===
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c18/e6-43-13-11.pdf |title=Pole Placement Control |format=PDF |website=Eolss.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Assume that the system is [[Controllability|controllable]]. Defining &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}:=(A-Bk^{T})&lt;/math&gt; gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A_{CL})^n + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \alpha_k A_{CL}^{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Calculating the powers of &lt;math&gt;A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt; results in 

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^0=(A-Bk^T)^0=I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^1 = (A-Bk^T)^1=A-Bk^T&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^2=(A-Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A+(Bk^T)^2=A^2-ABk^T-(Bk^T)[A-Bk^T]=A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(A_{CL})^n = (A-Bk^T)^n=A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}- \cdots -Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing the previous equations into &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})&lt;/math&gt; yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=(A^n-A^{n-1} Bk^T-A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL}-\cdots-Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1})+\cdots+\alpha_2(A^2-ABk^T-Bk^T A_{CL}) + \alpha_1 (A-Bk^T)+\alpha_0I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL}) =(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1}+\cdots + \alpha_2 A^2+\alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)-(A^{n-1}Bk^{T}+A^{n-2}Bk^T A_{CL}+\cdots+Bk^TA_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots +\alpha_2 (ABk^T+Bk^T A_{CL})+\alpha_1(Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;(A^n+\alpha_{n-1}A^{n-1} + \cdots + \alpha_2 A^2 + \alpha_1 A+\alpha_0 I)=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-(A^{n-1}Bk^T+A^{n-2} Bk^T A_{CL} + \cdots + Bk^T A_{CL}^{n-1}) + \cdots + \alpha_2 (ABk^T + Bk^T A_{CL}) +\alpha_1 (A+Bk^T)&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the above equation as a matrix product and omitting the terms that  &lt;math&gt;k^T&lt;/math&gt; does not appear isolated gives

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(A_{CL})=\Delta(A)-\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1} B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]],  &lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(A_{CL}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;, thus

&lt;math&gt;\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^T
\end{array}\right]=\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[B\ \ AB\ \ \cdots \ \ A^{n-1}B\right] &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Controllability#Continuous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems|controllability matrix]] of the system. Since the system is controllable,  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. Thus, 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

To find &lt;math&gt;k^{T}&lt;/math&gt;, both sides can be multiplied by the vector &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;. This yields 

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\vdots\\
k^{T}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\mathcal{C}^{-1}\Delta(A)&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==

Consider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.31/www/Fall06/1631_topic13.pdf |format=PDF |title=Topic #13 : 16.31 Feedback Control|website=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]x+\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]u&lt;/math&gt;

We know from the characteristic polynomial of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that the system is unstable since &lt;math&gt;det(sI-A)=(s-1)(s-2)-1=(s-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;, the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; will only have positive eigenvalues. Thus, to stabilize the system we shall put a feedback gain &lt;math&gt;K=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
k_1 &amp; k_2\end{array}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

From Ackermann's formula, we can find a matrix &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;  that will change the system so that its characteristic equation will be equal to a desired polynomial. Suppose we want &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(s)=s^2+11s+30&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{desired}(A)=A^2+11A+30I&lt;/math&gt; and computing the controllability matrix yields

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
B &amp; AB\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Also, we have that &lt;math&gt;A^2=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, from Ackermann's formula

: &lt;math&gt;k^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\left[\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 3\\
3 &amp; 5
\end{array}\right]+11\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]+30I\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
43 &amp; 14\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
29 &amp; -43\\
14 &amp; 57
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^T=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
14 &amp; 57\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

== Background ==

In 2012, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) launched a new programme on the development of adverse outcome pathways. A guidance document describes in detail how AOPs are to be developed, reviewed, agreed and published at the OECD level.&lt;ref name="THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/ehs/testing/AOP%20process_10%20June%202013.pdf|website=oecd.org |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AOP development and reviewing workflow is intended to take place via a web-based IT management tool: the Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)&lt;ref name=AOP-KB&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)|url=https://aopkb.oecd.org/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which  is currently still under development. It is the wiki-based, user-friendly tool providing open-source interface for collaborative sharing of established AOPs and building new AOPs. 
The AOP-KB gives the scientific community the possibility to enter, share and discuss their AOP-related knowledge at one central point of information.
The AOP-KB allows for building AOPs by entering and then linking information about MIEs, KEs, AOs and ''' Chemical Initiators'''.
Knowing that pathway elements are not necessarily unique to a single AOP, value is added to existing knowledge by facilitating the re-use of MIE, KE and AO information in multiple AOPs, which prevents redundancy and make the collective knowledge about those entities available in all AOPs in which they appear.

The AOP-KB is a combination of individually developed applications, synchronised and orchestrated in a way that gives users the possibility to capture, review, browse and comment on AOPs shared by the AOP stakeholder community.

The AOP-KB project is an [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]  initiative, which is executed as close collaboration between the [[Joint Research Centre]] of [[European Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the  [[Engineer Research and Development Center]] of [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] for the purpose of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s programme on the development of AOPs &lt;ref name="Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics|url=http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/adverse-outcome-pathways-molecular-screening-and-toxicogenomics.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4842">The '''American National Corpus''' (ANC) is a  [[text corpus]] of [[American English]] containing 22 million words of written and spoken data produced since 1990. Currently, the ANC includes a range of genres, including emerging genres such as email, tweets, and web data that are not included in earlier corpora such as the [[British National Corpus]]. It is annotated for [[Lexical category|part of speech]] and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], [[shallow parsing|shallow parse]], and [[Named entity|named entities]].

The ANC is available from the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. A fifteen million word subset of the corpus, called the '''Open American National Corpus''' (OANC), is freely available with no restrictions on its use from the ANC Website.

The corpus and its annotations are provided according to the specifications of [[ISO/TC 37]] SC4's Linguistic Annotation Framework. By using a freely provided transduction tool (ANC2Go), the corpus and user-chosen annotations is provided in multiple formats, including CoNLL IOB format, the XML format conformant to the [[XCES|XML Corpus Encoding Standard]] (XCES) (usable with the [[British National Corpus]]'s XAIRA search engine), a [[UIMA]]-compliant format, and formats suitable for input to a wide variety of concordance software. Plugins to import the annotations into [[General Architecture for Text Engineering]] (GATE) are also available.

The ANC differs from other corpora of English because it is richly annotated, including different [[Lexical category|part of speech]] annotations (Penn tags, CLAWS5 and CLAWS7 tags), [[shallow parsing|shallow parse annotations]], and  annotations for several types of [[Named entity|named entities]]. Additional annotations are added to all or parts of the corpus as they become available, often by contributions from other projects. Unlike on-line searchable corpora, which due to copyright restrictions allow access only to individual sentences, the entire ANC is available to enable research involving, for example, development of statistical language models and full-text linguistic annotation.

ANC annotations are automatically produced and unvalidated. 
A 500,000 word subset called the [[Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC)]] is annotated for approximately 20 different kinds of linguistic annotations, all of which have been hand-validated or manually produced. These include [https://web.archive.org/web/20160404152309/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank] syntactic annotation, [[WordNet]] sense annotation, [[FrameNet]] semantic frame annotations, among others. Like the OANC, MASC is freely available for any use, and can be downloaded from the ANC site or from the  [[Linguistic Data Consortium]]. It is also distributed in part-of-speech tagged form with the [[Natural Language Toolkit]].

The ANC and its sub-corpora differ from similar corpora primarily in the range of linguistic annotations provided and the inclusion of modern genres that do not appear in resources like the [[British National Corpus]]. Also, because the initial target use of the corpora was the development of statistical language models, the full data and all annotations are available, thus differing from the  [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] (COCA) which is available only selectively through a web browser.

Continued growth of the OANC and MASC relies on contributions of data and annotations from the computational linguistics and corpus linguistics communities.

'''''SRM – Associazione Studi e Ricerche per il Mezzogiorno'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/?lang=en |title=Official Website|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Italy|Italian]] Study Centre founded in [[Naples]] in 2003 which aims to improve the knowledge of Italian economy in terms of infrastructural, productive and social assets, proceeding from a European and Mediterranean perspective. From the Study Centre of the [[Banco di Napoli]], established in 1931, SRM inherited a consolidated know-how in the analysis of the economic dynamics of the South of Italy. Over the years, it has implemented its research from an international point of view.

Its founders are four banks of the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]], the Banco di Napoli Foundation and the Turin-based Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compagniadisanpaolo.it/|title=Compagnia di San Paolo|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the [[President (corporate title)|President]] of SRM is Paolo Scudieri and the [[General Manager]] is Massimo Deandreis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/chi-siamo/?lang=en |title=About Us|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and Research==

SRM is a Study Centre related to the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]]. It specializes in the analysis of regional economic dynamics, with a particular eye towards Southern Italy. In this context, it carries out studies and research monitoring of the performance of productive sectors, investigating economic and financial scenarios, interdependence and internationalisation, and the economic value of the non-profit sector. SRM publishes studies and research in three types of publishing products: monographic research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/ricerche-monografiche-en/?lang=en|title=Researches|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; periodical reports &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/rapporti-periodici/?lang=en|title=Periodical Reports|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/reviews/?lang=en|title=Reviews|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Since 2003 SRM has provided much research on topics related to numerous Italian economic sectors: automotive, aerospace, agri-food, pharmaceutical, textile, tourism, water, renewable energy, and many others.
* Among the periodic reports, SRM has a line of reports produced in collaboration with other Institutes: the semi-yearly report "Check up Mezzogiorno"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/check-up-mezzogiorno/|title=Check Up Mezzogiorno|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[Confindustria]]; the "Territorial Finance in Italy" Report, in collaboration with IRES, IRPET, Eupolis Lombardia, IPRES and Liguria Ricerche; and the Report on the internationalisation of Italian regions, in collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo Research Department. SRM also publishes the Young Entrepreneurs Observatory and the Mezzogiorno Bulletin.
* SRM also edits three magazines. Since 1993, it has been publishing the bi-monthly magazine ''Dossier Unione Europea'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/dossier-ue/|title= Dossier UE|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to monitor European policies and their impact on the Italian economy. Since 2004, it has been editing the international magazine ''Rassegna Economica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/rassegna-economica/|title= Rassegna Economica|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1931 by the Banco di Napoli. Since 2016, SRM has also published a half-yearly magazine ''Quaderni di Economia Sociale'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/quaderni-di-economia-sociale//|title= Quaderni di Economia Sociale|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject of non-profit and social solidarity, carried out together with the Fondazione con il Sud and with the collaboration of Banca Prossima ([[Intesa Sanpaolo]] Banking Group), established as a periodic report in 2012.

SRM has also activated two permanent observatories: the first one, on the Maritime Economy, monitors the economic impact of the logistics and maritime transport sector; the second, on the Mediterranean Economy, monitors the dynamics of the commercial relations between Italy (and in particular the South of Italy) and the Mediterranean countries. Italy, including its southern regions, plays a natural role as an economic and logistic bridge between Europe and the southern shores of the Mediterranean, where the great maritime trade routes pass to and from Asia and America.

==Maritime Economy Permanent Observatory==

''Maritime Economy'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/|title=Maritime Economy|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a SRM project born in 2014 with the aim to establish a permanent observatory on the logistics and maritime transport sector. SRM has always had a consolidated research area dedicated to this field of studies because it has always believed that efficient and effective maritime transport fosters internationalization, innovation, investments in infrastructure, and employment and GDP growth.

The Maritime Economy Observatory manifests itself in a website (http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/ - in [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) that offers a wealth of analysis and studies on the topic of maritime transport seen from a variety of standpoints: from the business side (e.g. the shipping industry), from the point of view of infrastructures (ports), and in terms of individual sectors and territories (for instance by taking a closer look at the maritime transport strategies pursued by other countries).

An Annual Report titled "Italian Maritime Economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/cp/annual-report/|title= Italian Maritime Economy Annual Report|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published every year, in June. This Report is the result of SRM analyses and its study missions abroad. It includes also scientific articles by international experts in the sector. In the course of its research activity on the maritime economy, SRM has created numerous "networks" formed by entities of varying nature - business associations, companies, infrastructure components, institutions – each of which, in its own way, provides added value to the research activity and papers offered.

SRM, in Shanghai on 13 December 2016, signed the Cooperation Agreement called "Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/srm-firma-a-shanghai-laccordo-global-shipping-think-tank-alliance/?lang=en|title= Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a partnership fostered by the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.sisi-smu.org/|title= Shangai International Shipping Institute|publisher=SISI}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important Chinese research centres in the world for research on shipping, logistics and the port industry. The Agreement involves the most prestigious research institutes on the maritime economy of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[the United States]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Germany]] and the [[UK]]. SRM was the only Italian study centre and one of three European entities to become a partner in the initiative, which was endorsed to implement joint studies on maritime transport, to exchange research and analysis methods, to propose policies to public policy makers with the aim to develop port and logistics infrastructure, and to organize meetings to discuss and debate the economic trends of the sea-related sectors.
With this agreement SRM strengthens its ability to analyse and forecast trends in the economics of the maritime industry and the dynamics of shipping and port logistics, expanding its cooperation with international economic think tanks such as the [[Kühne Logistics University of Hamburg]], the [[University of Antwerp]] and the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], which are globally recognized in the field of the maritime economy.

==Mediterranean Economy Permanent Observatory==

The Permanent Observatory on the Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean Area &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-med.com/|title= Mediterranean Observatory|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a project realized by SRM and born in 2011 thanks to the sponsorship of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Compagnia di San Paolo]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with the aim to monitor and study the dynamics and the impact of mutual economic relations between [[Italy]] (and in particular Southern Italy) and the Mediterranean Area.

SRM has established this new field of research developing a strong network of relations with other national and international Research Centres on the Mediterranean Area. The Observatory analyses in particular two geographic areas - the Southern Mediterranean Area ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]]) and the Eastern Mediterranean Area ([[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]) - investigating the commercial, financial, infrastructural, entrepreneurial, energetic and technological inter-exchange relations, paying special attention to business indicators and normative-institutional dynamics affecting the Euro-Mediterranean Area. The Adriatic Mediterranean Area ([[Albania]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]]) is investigated separately. Since 2015 the analysis has been extended to the [[Gulf Countries]] ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]]).

SRM Med Observatory represents a permanent laboratory the activity of which takes place on the website. At the end of each year of research activities the Mediterranean Observatory gives life to the "Annual Report on Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-med.com/cp/med-annual-report/|title= Annual Report on Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean |publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; available online and printed also in paper format, which describes the overall picture of economic relations between Italy / Southern of Italy and Mediterranean.

==Awards and acknowledgments==

SRM received the [[Guido Dorso International Award]] in 2010. This plaque, given by the [[President of the Italian Republic]], is designated for a scientific - cultural institution of the South of Italy. It was awarded to the Association "in recognition of the intense and qualified activity carried out for a deeper knowledge of the southern territory".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

An '''astronomical survey''' is a general map or image of a region of the sky which lacks a specific observational target.  Alternatively, an astronomical survey may comprise a set of many images or spectra of objects which share a common type or feature. Surveys are often restricted to one band of the electromagnetic spectrum due to instrumental limitations, although multiwavelength surveys can be made by using multiple detectors, each sensitive to a different bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite journal |author=Lacy, M., Riley, J. M., Waldram, E. M., McMahon, R. G., &amp; Warner, P. J. |year=1995 |title=A radio-optical survey of the North Ecliptic CAP |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=276 |issue=2 |pages=614–626|bibcode=1995MNRAS.276..614L |doi=10.1093/mnras/276.2.614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys have generally been performed as part of the production of an [[astronomical catalog]]. They often use wide field [[astrograph]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

== Scientific value ==
Sky surveys, unlike targeted observation of a specific object, allow astronomers to catalogue celestial objects and perform statistical analyses on them without making prohibitively lengthy observations.  In some cases, an astronomer interested in a particular object will find that survey images are sufficient to make telescope time entirely unnecessary.

Surveys also help astronomers obtain observation time on larger, more powerful telescopes. If previous observations support a hypothesis, a telescope scheduling committee is more likely to approve new, more detailed observations to test it.

The wide scope of surveys makes them ideal for searching for moving foreground objects such as asteroids and comets.  An astronomer can compare existing survey images to current observations to locate targets which are in motion; this task can even be performed automatically using [[image analysis]] software.  Similarly, images of the same object taken by different surveys can be compared to detect transient events such as variable stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | first1=Dr. Pamela | last1=Gay | authorlink1=Pamela L.

==Etymology==
The term ''biological diversity'' was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in the year 1968 lay book ''A Different Kind of Country''&lt;ref name="Dasmann1968"&gt;{{cite book|first=Raymond Fredric |last=Dasmann|title=A Different Kind of Country|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DgM2jwEACAAJ}}|year=1968|publisher=Collier Books|isbn=978-0-02-072810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating conservation. The term was widely adopted only after more than a decade, when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy. [[Thomas Lovejoy]], in the foreword to the book ''Conservation Biology'',&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80&gt;{{cite book |author1=Soulé, Michael E. |author2=Wilcox, Bruce A. |title=Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87893-800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term to the scientific community. Until then the term "natural diversity" was common, introduced by The Science Division of [[The Nature Conservancy]] in an important 1975 study, "The Preservation of Natural Diversity." By the early 1980s TNC's Science program and its head, Robert E. Jenkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm |title=Robert E. Jenkins |publisher=Nature.org |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in America advocated the use of the term "biological diversity".

The term's contracted form ''biodiversity'' may have been coined by W.G. Rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 ''National Forum on Biological Diversity'' organized by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). It first appeared in a publication in 1988 when [[sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] used it as the title of the [[proceedings]]&lt;ref name="WilsonSciences1988"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.O. |last1=Wilson|title=Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=DSGF1xQBYi8C}}|date=1 January 1988|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-03739-6}} [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913154719/http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037395/html/R2.html |date=13 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of that forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Biodiversity Assessment: Summary for Policy-makers|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VKnimgEACAAJ}}|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56481-6}} Annex 6, Glossary. Used as source by [http://www.biodiv.be/glossary_keywords/B "Biodiversity", Glossary of terms related to the CBD], [[Belgium|Belgian]] Clearing-House Mechanism. Retrieved 2006-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists, environmentalists, political leaders and concerned citizens.

A similar term in the United States is ''"natural heritage."'' It pre-dates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes geology and landforms.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- I've never come across this term--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/natural-heritage/|title=Massachusetts Natural Heritage &amp; Endangered Species Program|last=NHESP|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

"Biodiversity" is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms, [[species diversity]] and [[species richness]]. Biologists most often define biodiversity as the "totality of genes, species and [[ecosystems]] of a region".&lt;ref name="Larsson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=zeTU8QauENcC|page=178}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Davis|title=Intro To Env Engg (Sie), 4E|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n0FvYeoHtAIC|page=40}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (India) Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-07-067117-1|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified:

* taxonomic diversity (usually measured at the species diversity level)
* ecological diversity (often viewed from the perspective of [[ecosystem diversity]])
* morphological diversity (which stems from [[genetic diversity]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Campbell |first=AK |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |year=2003 |volume=40 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00803.x |pages=193–203 |title=Save those molecules: molecular biodiversity and life}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Functional group (ecology)|functional diversity]] (which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population (e.g. different feeding mechanism, different motility, predator vs prey, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is functional diversity, and why do we care?|url = http://jonlefcheck.net/2014/10/20/what-is-functional-diversity-and-why-do-we-care-2/|website = sample(ECOLOGY)|accessdate = 2015-12-22|first = Jon|last = Lefcheck|date = 2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This multilevel construct is consistent with Datman and Lovejoy. An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. Wilcox's definition was "Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...".&lt;ref name=wilcox84&gt;

The 1992 [[United Nations]] [[Earth Summit]] defined "biological diversity" as "the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and other [[marine biology|aquatic ecosystems]] and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems".&lt;ref name="Hawksworth1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

One textbook's definition is "variation of life at all levels of biological organization".&lt;ref name="GastonSpicer2004"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kevin J. |last1=Gaston|first2=John I. |last2= Spicer|title=Biodiversity: An Introduction|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lY8rc4bcIDwC}}|date=13 February 2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-1857-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles, genes and [[organism]]s. They study processes such as [[mutation]] and [[gene transfer]] that drive evolution.&lt;ref name=wilcox84/&gt;

Measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels. However, [[tetrapod]] (terrestrial [[vertebrates]]) taxonomic and ecological diversity shows a very close correlation.&lt;!-- what does this even mean???--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024| last1=Sahney |first1=S. |last2=Benton |first2=M.J. |first3=Paul |last3=Ferry  | year = 2010 | title = Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal = Biology Letters | url = http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/01/22/rsbl.2009.1024.abstract| volume=6| issue=4| pages=544–7 | pmid=20106856| pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:Swiss National Park 131.JPG|thumb|A [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[Swiss National Park|National Park]])]]

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things ([[biota (ecology)|biota]]) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, [[soil]]s, geography and the presence of other species. The study of the spatial distribution of [[organism]]s, species and [[ecosystem]]s, is the science of [[biogeography]].

Diversity consistently measures higher in the [[tropics]] and in other localized regions such as the [[Cape Floristic Region]] and lower in polar regions generally.  [[Rain forests]] that have had wet climates for a long time, such as [[Yasuni National Park|Yasuní National Park]] in [[Ecuador]], have particularly high biodiversity.&lt;ref name=dotearth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/a-durable-yet-vulnerable-eden-in-amazonia/ | title=A Durable Yet Vulnerable Eden in Amazonia | work=Dot Earth blog, New York Times

===Latitudinal gradients===
{{Main|Latitudinal gradients in species diversity}}

Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the [[Geographical pole|poles]] to the [[tropics]]. Thus localities at lower [[latitudes]] have more species than localities at higher latitudes. This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity. Several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient, but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles.&lt;ref name=MoraRobertson2003&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20013.pdf |vauthors=Mora C, Robertson DR |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 | title=Causes of latitudinal gradients in species richness: a test with fishes of the Tropical Eastern Pacific | journal=Ecology | volume = 86 | pages =  1771–1792 |format=PDF | doi=10.1890/04-0883 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = D.

In 2016, an alternative hypothesis ("the [[fractal]] biodiversity") was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2016). The fractal nature of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. Biologia, 71(6), 669-672.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, the [[species]] pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient. This hypothesis considers [[temperature]], [[moisture]], and [[net primary production]] (NPP) as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological [[hypervolume]]. In this way, it is possible to build fractal hypervolumes, whose [[fractal dimension]] rises up to three moving towards the [[equator]].

===Hotspots===
A [[biodiversity hotspot]] is a region with a high level of [[Endemism|endemic]] species that have experienced great [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/content/biodiversity-hotspots | author = Biodiversity A-Z | title = Biodiversity Hotspots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by [[Norman Myers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02240252 | author = Myers N | year = 1988 | title = Threatened biotas: 'hot spots' in tropical forests | url = | journal = Environmentalist | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 187–208 | pmid = 12322582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02239720 | author = Myers N | year = 1990 | title = The biodiversity challenge: expanded hot-spots analysis | url = http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Gwen%27s%20Files/Biodiversity/Chapters/Info%20to%20use/Chapter%207/biodiversityhotspotMyers.pdf| journal = Environmentalist | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 243–256 | pmid = 12322583 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.468.8666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Publications/Mora%20027.pdf | author=Tittensor D. | year=2011 | title= Global patterns and predictors of marine biodiversity across taxa | journal=Nature | volume = 466 | pages =  1098–1101 |format=PDF | doi=10.1038/nature09329 | pmid=20668450 | issue=7310|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010Natur.466.1098T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKee2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey K. |last=McKee|title=Sparing Nature: The Conflict Between Human Population Growth and Earth's Biodiversity|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=omgIyInG8qEC|page=108}}|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3558-6|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hotspots are spread all over the world, the majority are forest areas and most are located in the [[tropics]].

[[Brazil]]'s [[Atlantic Forest]] is considered one such hotspot, containing roughly 20,000 plant species, 1,350 vertebrates and millions of insects, about half of which occur nowhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic Forest of South America: Biodiversity Status, Threats, and Outlook|last=Galindo-Leal|first=Carlos|publisher=Island Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55963-988-0|location=Washington|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The island of [[Madagascar]] and India are also particularly notable. [[Colombia]] is characterized by high biodiversity, with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it has the largest number of endemics (species that are not found naturally anywhere else) of any country. About 10% of the species of the Earth can be found in Colombia, including over 1,900 species of bird, more than in Europe and North America combined, Colombia has 10% of the world's mammals species, 14% of the amphibian species and 18% of the bird species of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of [[evolution]]. The [[origin of life]] has not been definitely established by science, however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the [[age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life consisted of [[microorganism]]s – [[archaea]], [[bacteria]], and [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] [[protozoan]]s and [[protist]]s.

The history of biodiversity during the [[Phanerozoic]] (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the [[Cambrian explosion]]—a period during which nearly every [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[multicellular organism]]s first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as [[mass extinction]] events.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt; The worst was the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;

The [[fossil record]] suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in [[History of Earth|history]].&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent [[geology|geologic]] sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11353852 | year = 2001 | last1 = Alroy | first1 = J | last2 = Marshall | first2 = CR | last3 = Bambach | first3 = RK | last4 = Bezusko | first4 = K | last5 = Foote | first5 = M | last6 = Fursich | first6 = FT | last7 = Hansen | first7 = TA | last8 = Holland | first8 = SM | last9 = Ivany | first9 = LC | title = Effects of sampling standardization on estimates of Phanerozoic marine diversification | volume = 98 | issue = 11 | pages = 6261–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111144698 | pmc = 33456 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.6261A | displayauthors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt; Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million, with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million,&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt; the vast majority [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref name=heywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100725181504/http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/85/heywood.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2010 |title=Mapping the web of life |publisher=Unep.org |accessdate=2009-06-21 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 318| issue = 7304| doi = 10.1038/466318a| year = 2010| journal = Nature| volume = 466| title = Does diversity always grow?| last1 = Okasha | first1 = S.|bibcode = 2010Natur.466..318O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary diversification===
The existence of a ''global carrying capacity'', limiting the amount of life that can live at once, is debated, as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species. While records of life in the sea shows a [[logistic function|logistic]] pattern of growth, life on land (insects, plants and tetrapods) shows an [[exponential growth|exponential]] rise in diversity. As one author states, "Tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled."&lt;ref name="Sahney, S. 2010"/&gt;

It also appears that the diversity continue to increase over time, especially after mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biox.stanford.edu/highlight/stanford-researchers-discover-animal-functional-diversity-started-out-poor-became-richer|title=Stanford researchers discover that animal functional diversity started out poor, became richer over time - Welcome to Bio-X|website=biox.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, changes through the [[Phanerozoic]] correlate much better with the [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]] model (widely used in [[population biology]], [[demography]] and [[macrosociology]], as well as [[fossil]] biodiversity) than with exponential and logistic models. The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order [[positive feedback]] (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a [[negative feedback]] arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the [[world population]] growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18677962 | year = 2008 | last1 = Markov | first1 = AV | last2 = Korotaev | first2 = AV | title = Hyperbolic growth of marine and continental biodiversity through the phanerozoic and community evolution | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–94 | journal = Journal of General Biology | url=http://elementy.ru/genbio/abstracts?artid=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity. The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and [[stochastic]] dynamics.&lt;ref name="pmid18677962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction, named the [[Holocene extinction event]], caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within 100 years.&lt;ref name="Wilson2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward O. |last=Wilson|title=The Future of Life|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Guosshxltn4C}}|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, in his ''Biodiversity-related Niches Differentiation Theory'',  [[Roberto Cazzolla Gatti]] proposed that species themselves are the architects of biodiversity, by proportionally increasing the number of potentially available niches in a given ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R. (2011). Evolution is a cooperative process: the biodiversity-related niches differentiation theory (BNDT) can explain why. Theoretical Biology Forum, 104(1), 35-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  This study led to the idea that biodiversity is [[autocatalytic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cazzolla Gatti, R., Hordijk, W., &amp; Kauffman, S. (2017). Biodiversity is autocatalytic. Ecological Modelling, 346, 70-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[ecosystem]] of interdependent [[species]] can be, therefore, considered as an [[Emergent properties|emergent]] [[autocatalytic set]] (a self-sustaining network of mutually "[[catalytic]]" entities), where one (group of) species enables the existence of (i.e., creates niches for) other species. This view offers a possible answer to the fundamental question of why so many species can [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in the same ecosystem.

New species are regularly discovered (on average between 5–10,000 new species each year, most of them [[insect]]s) and many, though discovered, are not yet classified (estimates are that nearly 90% of all [[arthropod]]s are not yet classified).&lt;ref name=heywood /&gt; Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in [[tropical forest]]s and in general, land has more species than the ocean; some 8.7 million species may exists on Earth, of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Moraplos/&gt;

===The balance of evidence===
"Ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature11148 | title=Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity | year=2012 | last1=Cardinale | first1=Bradley | journal=Nature | volume=486 | pages=59–67|bibcode = 2012Natur.486...59C | pmid=22678280 | issue=7401|display-authors=etal| url=https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/10240/7/wardle_d_etal_130415.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The natural species, or biota, are the caretakers of all ecosystems. It is as if the natural world is an enormous bank account of capital assets capable of paying life sustaining dividends indefinitely, but only if the capital is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Richard T., and Bernard J. Nebel.&amp;nbsp;''Environmental Science : toward a Sustainable Future''. Eighth ed., Upper Saddle River, N.J., Pearson Education, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

These services come in three flavors:
# Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control)&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;
# Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual significance)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daniel|first=T. C.|title=Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=21 May 2012|volume=109|issue=23|pages=8812–8819|doi=10.1073/pnas.1114773109|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.8812D |display-authors=etal|pmid=22615401|pmc=3384142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many claims about biodiversity's effect on these ecosystem services, especially provisioning and regulating services. After an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity's effect on ecosystem services, 14 of those claims have been validated, 6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported, 3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions.&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;

===Agriculture===
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
[[File:Amazon Manaus forest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[South America]]]]

Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories: [[genetic diversity|intraspecific diversity]], which includes the genetic variety within a single species, like the potato (''[[Solanum tuberosum]]'') that is composed of many different forms and types (e.g. in the U.S. they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes, all different, but all part of the same species, ''S. tuberosum'').

The other category of agricultural diversity is called [[species diversity|interspecific diversity]] and refers to the number and types of different species. Thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots, peppers, lettuce etc.

Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is ‘planned’ diversity or ‘associated’ diversity. This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity. Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged, planted or raised (e.g. crops, covers, symbionts and livestock, among others), which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops, uninvited (e.g. herbivores, weed species and pathogens, among others).&lt;ref name="ecology-of-agroecosystems"&gt;{{cite book|first=John H. |last=Vandermeer|title=The Ecology of Agroecosystems|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AFRQSuQGHiIC}}|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-7153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face. On [[monoculture]] farms, the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive [[pesticide]]s, mechanized tools and [[genetically modified organism|transgenic engineering techniques]], then to [[crop rotation|rotate crops]]. Although some [[polyculture]] farmers use the same techniques, they also employ [[integrated pest management]] strategies as well as strategies that are more labor-intensive, but generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology and energy.

Interspecific crop diversity is, in part, responsible for offering variety in what we eat. Intraspecific diversity, the variety of alleles within a single species, also offers us choice in our diets. If a crop fails in a monoculture, we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new. If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year, relying on intraspecific diversity. We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether, relying on interspecific diversity. Even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures, relies on biodiversity at some point.

(2009) [http://www.cbd.int/climate/ "Climate Change and Biological Diversity"] Convention on Biological Diversity Retrieved 5 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.). This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] (ACSF) at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna|title=Study: Loss of species is bad for your health|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/BiodiversityHealth.html|accessdate=20 July 2011|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health.

===Leisure, cultural and aesthetic value===
Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as [[hiking]], [[birdwatching]] or natural history study. Biodiversity inspires [[musician]]s, painters, sculptors, writers and other artists. Many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms.

Popular activities such as [[gardening]], [[fishkeeping]] and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity. The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands, though the majority do not enter commerce.

The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors, suppliers, breeders, propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood. The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms, reflecting their inherent value.

Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to [[Human|mankind]] ''in and of itself''. This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that [[tropical forest]]s and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tribot | first1 = A. | last2 = Mouquet | first2 = N. | last3 = Villeger | first3 = S. | last4 = Raymond | first4 = M. | last5 = Hoff | first5 = F. | last6 = Boissery | first6 = P. | last7 = Holon | first7 = F. | last8 = Deter | first8 = J. | year = 2016 | title = Taxonomic and functional diversity increase the aesthetic value of coralligenous reefs | url = http://nicolasmouquet.free.fr/publications/Tribot_el_al_2016_Scientific_Reports.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Scientific Reports | volume =  6| issue = | pages =  34229| doi = 10.1038/srep34229 | pmid = 27677850 | pmc = 5039688 | bibcode = 2016NatSR...634229T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity supports many [[ecosystem services]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time."&lt;ref name="diversity-loss-and-its-impact" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In absolute terms, the planet has lost 58% of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2016 study by the [https://www.wnf.nl/custom/LPR_2016_fullreport/ World Wildlife Fund]. The Living Planet Report 2014 claims that "the number of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish across the globe is, on average, about half the size it was 40 years ago". Of that number, 39% accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone, 39% for the marine wildlife gone and 76% for the freshwater wildlife gone. Biodiversity took the biggest hit in [[Latin America]], plummeting 83 percent. High-income countries showed a 10% increase in biodiversity, which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries. This is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries, which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations, which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses.&lt;ref name="LivingPlanetReport2014"&gt;{{citation|url=http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |accessdate=4 October 2014 |title=Living Planet Report 2014 |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101711/http://assets.worldwildlife.org/publications/723/files/original/LPR2014_low_res-2.pdf?1412025775 |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study published in ''[[PLOS One]]'' found that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the last 25 years. Dave Goulson of [[Sussex University]] stated that their study suggested that humans "appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/18/warning-of-ecological-armageddon-after-dramatic-plunge-in-insect-numbers|title=Warning of 'ecological Armageddon' after dramatic plunge in insect numbers|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 October 2017|last1=Editor|first1=Damian Carrington Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
[[File:Sign for biodiversity, Extinction Rebellion (cropped).jpg|thumb|Habitat loss, climate change, overconsumption and pollution are major threats to biodiversity.]]

In 2006, many species were formally classified as [[rare species|rare]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species|threatened]]; moreover, scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized. About 40 percent of the 40,177 species assessed using the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria are now listed as threatened with [[extinction]]—a total of 16,119.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/0502_060502_endangered.html|title = Endangered Species List Expands to 16,000|accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170805153429/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/0502_060502_endangered.html#|archivedate = 5 August 2017|work = National Geographic|last = Lovett|first = Richard A.|date = 2 May 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00848.x | title = The imprint of the geographical, evolutionary and ecological context on species-area relationships | year = 2006 | last1 = Drakare | first1 = Stina | last2 = Lennon | first2 = Jack J. | last3 = Hillebrand | first3 = Helmut | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–227 | pmid = 16958886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to "trivial" standardized ecosystems (e.g., [[monoculture]] following [[deforestation]]) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity - through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and "pests", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).{{Citation needed|date= August 2010}}

A 2007 study conducted by the [[National Science Foundation]] found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and ''vice versa''. "If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species."&lt;!-- the quote doesn't talk about genetic diversity --&gt;&lt;ref name=enn&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/23391 |title= Study: Loss Of Genetic Diversity Threatens Species Diversity |publisher= Enn.com |date= 2007-09-26 |accessdate= 2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of | 2005 |alt = At present}}, the most threatened ecosystems occur in [[fresh water]], according to the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] 2005, which was confirmed by the "Freshwater Animal Diversity Assessment" organised by the [[GBIF|biodiversity platform]] and the French ''[[Institut de recherche pour le développement]]'' (MNHNP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceconnection.be/ Science Connection 22] (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-extinctions are a form of habitat destruction. Co-extinction occurs when the extinction or decline in one species accompanies similar processes in another, such as in plants and beetles.&lt;ref&gt;

===Introduced and invasive species===
{{Main|Introduced species|Invasive species}}
[[File:Male Silver Pheasant.jpg|thumb|right|Male ''Lophura nycthemera'' ([[silver pheasant]]), a native of [[East Asia]] that has been introduced into parts of [[Europe]] for ornamental reasons]]
Barriers such as large [[rivers]], [[sea]]s, [[oceans]], [[mountains]] and [[deserts]] encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier, via the process of [[allopatric speciation]]. The term [[invasive species]] is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained. Without barriers, such species occupy new territory, often supplanting native species by occupying their niches, or by using resources that would normally sustain native species.

The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torchin|first=Mark E.|author2=Lafferty, Kevin D. |author3=[[Dobson, Andrew P.]] |author4=McKenzie, Valerie J. |author5=Kuris, Armand M.|title=Introduced species and their missing parasites|journal=Nature|date=6 February 2003|volume=421|issue=6923|pages=628–630|doi=10.1038/nature01346|pmid=12571595|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..628T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Jonathan M.|author2=D'Antonio, Carla M.|title=Elton Revisited: A Review of Evidence Linking Diversity and Invasibility|journal=Oikos|date=1 October 1999|volume=87|issue=1|pages=15|doi=10.2307/3546992|jstor=3546992}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=J. M.|title=Species Diversity and Biological Invasions: Relating Local Process to Community Pattern|journal=Science|date=5 May 2000|volume=288|issue=5467|pages=852–854|doi=10.1126/science.288.5467.852|bibcode = 2000Sci...288..852L|pmid=10797006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important question is, "do invasive species cause extinctions?" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=GUREVITCH|first=J|author2=PADILLA, D|title=Are invasive species a major cause of extinctions?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=1 September 2004|volume=19|issue=9|pages=470–474|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.07.005|pmid=16701309}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: [[alpha diversity]]) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: [[beta diversity]]). Overall [[gamma diversity]] may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sax|first=Dov F.|author2=Gaines, Steven D. |author3=Brown, James H.|title=Species Invasions Exceed Extinctions on Islands Worldwide: A Comparative Study of Plants and Birds|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 December 2002|volume=160|issue=6|pages=766–783|doi=10.1086/343877|pmid=18707464}}&lt;/ref&gt; but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. [[Local extinction|Extirpation]], [[population decline]] and [[Species homogeneity|homogenization]] of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jude, David auth.|first=ed. by M. Munawar|title=The lake Huron ecosystem: ecology, fisheries and management|year=1995|publisher=S.P.B. Academic Publishing|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-90-5103-117-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.

Not all introduced species are invasive, nor all invasive species deliberately introduced. In cases such as the [[zebra mussel]], [[invasive species|invasion]] of US waterways was unintentional. In other cases, such as [[mongoose]]s in [[Hawaii]], the introduction is deliberate but ineffective ([[nocturnal]] [[rat]]s were not vulnerable to the [[diurnality|diurnal]] mongoose). In other cases, such as [[oil palm]]s in Indonesia and Malaysia, the introduction produces substantial economic benefits, but the benefits are accompanied by costly [[unintended consequences]].

Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces. In [[Belgium]], [[Prunus spinosa]] from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts, disrupting the feeding habits of the ''[[Thecla betulae]]'' butterfly (which feeds on the leaves). Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive. The exotic organisms may be [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s, or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients, water and light.

At present, several countries have already imported so many exotic species, particularly agricultural and ornamental plants, that their own indigenous fauna/flora may be outnumbered. For example, the introduction of [[kudzu]] from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= ScienceDaily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110408163917.htm |title=Are invasive plants a threat to native biodiversity?

Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to [[rare species]] that come into contact with more abundant ones.

===Overexploitation===
{{Main|Overexploitation}}

Overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate. This occurs on land in the form of [[overhunting]], excessive [[logging]], poor [[soil conservation]] in agriculture and the illegal [[wildlife trade]].

About 25% of world [[fishery|fisheries]] are now overfished to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | year = 2007 | last1 = Grafton | first1 = R.

===Hybridization, genetic pollution/erosion and food security===
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Yecoro [[wheat]] (right) [[cultivar]] is sensitive to salinity, plants resulting from a hybrid cross with cultivar W4910 (left) show greater tolerance to high salinity]]
{{See also|Food security|Genetic erosion}}

In [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread [[genetic erosion]] and genetic pollution.

Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique [[genotype]]s, threatening future access to [[food security]]. A decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate.&lt;ref name="bulletin28" /&gt;&lt;!--this argument seems circular. hybridization is bad because...it limits future hybridization. so...the more genetic engineering the better so as to limit future hybridization? just sayin'...--&gt;

===Protection and restoration techniques===
Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches. Exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;with [[Digital Automated Identification SYstem]] (DAISY), using the [[Consortium for the Barcode of Life|barcode of life]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcoding.si.edu/ |title=Barcode of Life |publisher=Barcoding.si.edu |date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120801074239/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.html|deadurl=yes|title=Earth Times: show/303405,camel-cull-would-help-curb-global-warming.ht…|date=1 August 2012|archivedate=1 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost.

As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured, "missing" species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the ''[[Encyclopedia of Life#Resources and collaborations|Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].

*[[Biodiversity banking]] places a monetary value on biodiversity. One example is the Australian [[Native Vegetation Management Framework]].
*[[Gene bank]]s are collections of specimens and genetic material. Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;via tree nurseries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/vlaanderen-heeft-45-zaadtuinen-voor-autochtone-bomen-en-struiken.aspx?artikel=0935212d-8b19-45a4-9cda-167ff68d347c |title=Belgium creating 45 "seed gardens"; gene banks with intent to reintroduction |publisher=Hbvl.be |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas.
*Location-specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory species. One approach is to create [[wildlife corridor]]s that correspond to the animals' movements. National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Protected areas==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Protected areas are meant for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dolomitipark.it/doc_pdf/parchi.sola.terra/07.ProtectedAreas_Biodiversity.pdf|title=Protected Areas and Biodiversity: An Overview of Key Issues|last=Mulongoy|first=Kalemani Jo|last2=Chape|first2=Stuart|publisher=CBD Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC|year=2004|isbn=|location=Montreal, Canada and Cambridge, UK|pages=15 and 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals. Some scientists have called on the global community to designate as protected areas 30 percent of the planet by 2030, and 50 percent by 2050, in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Baillie|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ya-Ping|first2=Zhang|date=September 14, 2018 |title=Space for nature|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1051|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=361 |issue=6407 |pages=1051 |doi=10.1126/science.aau1397|pmid=30213888|access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National parks===
{{Main|National park}}
National park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation. National parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments. A limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas. Designated trails or roads are created. The visitors are allowed to enter only for study, cultural and recreation purposes. Forestry operations, grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated. Exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned.

===Wildlife sanctuary===
[[Wildlife sanctuary|Wildlife sanctuaries]] aim only at conservation of species and have the following features:

#The boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation.
#The killing, hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is responsible for the management of the sanctuary.
#Private ownership may be allowed.
#[[Forestry]] and other usages can also be permitted.

===Forest reserves===
The [[forest]]s play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species. In reserved forests, rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest, who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products. The unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics:

#They are large inaccessible forests.
#Many of these are unoccupied.
#They are ecologically and economically less important.

====Steps to conserve the forest cover====
{{see|forest cover}}
#An extensive [[reforestation]]/[[afforestation]] program should be followed.
#Alternative [[environment-friendly]] sources of fuel energy such as [[biogas]] other than wood should be used.
#Loss of biodiversity due to [[forest fire]] is a major problem, immediate steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken.
#[[Overgrazing]] by cattle can damage a forest seriously. Therefore, certain steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle.
#Hunting and [[poaching]] should be banned.

===Zoological parks===
In [[zoological park]]s or zoos, live animals are kept for public [[recreation]], education and conservation purposes. Modern zoos offer veterinary facilities, provide opportunities for threatened species to [[captive breeding|breed in captivity]] and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care. Zoos play a major role in creating [[environmental awareness|awareness]] about the need to conserve nature.

===Botanical gardens===
In [[botanical garden]]s, plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes. They consist of a collection of living plants, grown outdoors or under glass in [[greenhouse]]s and conservatories. In addition, a botanical garden may include a collection of dried plants or [[herbarium]] and such facilities as lecture rooms, laboratories, libraries, museums and experimental or research plantings.

==Resource allocation==
Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=conservationists-triage-determine-which-endangered-species-to-save Conservationists Use Triage to Determine which Species to Save and Not; Like battlefield medics, conservationists are being forced to explicitly apply triage to determine which creatures to save and which to let go] 23 July 2012 ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity, which typically require little or no restoration. These are typically non-urbanized, non-agricultural areas. Tropical areas often fit both criteria, given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jones-Walters | first1 = L. | last2 = Mulder | first2 = I. | doi = 10.1016/j.jnc.2009.06.001 | title = Valuing nature: The economics of biodiversity | journal = Journal for Nature Conservation | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–247 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | url=http://mdvnaturalist.com/images/econmics_of_biodiversity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:Hopetoun falls.jpg|thumb|right|A great deal of work is occurring to preserve the natural characteristics of [[Hopetoun Falls]], [[Australia]] while continuing to allow visitor access.]]

===International===
* United Nations [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (1992) and [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]];
* Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ([[CITES]]);
* [[Ramsar Convention]] (Wetlands);
* [[Bonn Convention]] on Migratory Species;
* [[World Heritage Convention]] (indirectly by protecting biodiversity habitats)
* Regional Conventions such as the Apia Convention
* Bilateral agreements such as the [[Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement]].

Global agreements such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], give "sovereign national rights over biological resources" (not property). The agreements commit countries to "conserve biodiversity", "develop resources for sustainability" and "share the benefits" resulting from their use. Biodiverse countries that allow [[bioprospecting]] or collection of natural products, expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers/exploits the resource to capture them privately. Bioprospecting can become a type of [[biopiracy]] when such principles are not respected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements]] (ABAs). The Convention on Biodiversity implies [[informed consent]] between the source country and the collector, to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture|fair agreement on benefit sharing]].

===National level laws===
Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions:
* The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity. It is related to private and public property rights. It can define protection for threatened ecosystems, but also some rights and duties (for example, [[fishing]] and hunting rights).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* Law regarding species is more recent. It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] is an example of an attempt to address the "law and species" issue.
* Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new, but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of [[genetically modified organisms]], gene [[patent]]s and process patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/patents.shtml |title=Gene Patenting |publisher=Ornl.gov |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example, genes, genomes, or organisms and species.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved, however. Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard, claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/envtllaw/issues/vol12/bosselman-for%20web.pdf |title=Fred Bosselman, A Dozen Biodiversity Puzzles, 12 N.Y.U.

India passed the [[Biological Diversity Act]] in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in India. The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge.

==Analytical limits==

===Taxonomic and size relationships===
Less than 1% of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x | author = Wilson Edward O | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Earth's species are microbial. Contemporary biodiversity physics is "firmly fixated on the visible [macroscopic] world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/429804a | author = Nee S | year = 2004 | title = More than meets the eye | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 429 | issue = 6994| pages = 804–805 | pmid = 15215837 |bibcode = 2004Natur.429..804N }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, microbial life is [[metabolically]] and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life (see e.g., [[extremophile]]). "On the tree of life, based on analyses of small-subunit [[ribosomal RNA]], visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs. The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder—to a first approximation, all multicellular species on Earth are insects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/448657a | bibcode=2007Natur.448..657S | title = Biodiversity: World of insects | year = 2007 | last1 = Stork | first1 = Nigel E. | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7154 | pages = 657–658 | pmid = 17687315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect extinction rates are high—supporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1095046 | author = Thomas J.

== Diversity study (botany) ==
The number of morphological attributes that can be scored for diversity study is generally limited and prone to environmental influences; thereby reducing the fine resolution required to ascertain the phylogenetic relationships. DNA based markers- microsatellites otherwise known as ''simple sequence repeats'' (SSR) were therefore used for the diversity studies of certain species and their wild relatives.

In the case of [[cowpea]], a study conducted to assess the level of genetic diversity in cowpea germplasm and related wide species, where the relatedness among various taxa were compared, primers useful for classification of taxa identified, and the origin and phylogeny of cultivated cowpea classified show that SSR markers are useful in validating with species classification and revealing the center of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogunkanmi|first=Liasu Adebayo|date=|title=Genetic diversity of cowpea and its wild relatives|url=|journal=Unilag SPGS (Thesis &amp; Dissertation 1970-2012)|volume=|pages=144–145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Marine Living Resources &amp; Ecology''' ('''CMLRE''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Kochi]], [[Kerala]] under the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], [[Government of India]] with a mandate to study the marine living resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Call for research to protect marine life  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/12/03/stories/2010120362620300.htm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, apart from implementing various research projects of the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences|ministry]], the institute also manages and operates the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|Fishery Oceanographic Research Vessel (FORV) ''Sagar Sampada'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ministry of Earth Sciences Overview |url=http://dod.nic.in/New%20RTI%20Particulars.pdf |date= |publisher=[[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] (MoES) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417153108/http://dod.nic.in/New%20RTI%20Particulars.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The institute has its origins in the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] cell, which was established under the then Department of Ocean Development, DOD (upgraded to the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]] in 2006) for managing and co-ordinating activities of [[FORV Sagar Sampada]]. During the beginning of the 9th [[Five-Year plans of India|Five Year Plan]] of the [[Government of India]] in 1998, the Marine Living Resources Programme (MLR Programme) was formulated by the DOD with a view of promoting ocean development activities in the country which inter-alia include mapping of the living resources, preparing inventory of commercially exploitable living marine resources, their optimum utilization through [[ecosystem management]] and R &amp; D in basic sciences on Marine Living Resources &amp; Ecology. With the objective of implementing this programme, the [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] cell was upgraded to the Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology. To this date, the research vessel [[FORV Sagar Sampada|''Sagar Sampada'']] serves as the backbone of the MLR research activities co-ordinated by CMLRE.

During the 9th [[Five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (1998-2002), the Centre co-ordinated the first systematic study of [[marine life]] along the [[India]]n [[continental shelf|shelf]] waters, along the  eastern and western coasts of India. The environmental characteristics of this region and the [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], marine [[benthos]], [[fishery]] resources etc. of this region were systematically characterized for the first time. During the 10th [[five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (2002-2007) the exploration was extended to the [[continental slope]] regions, particularly in the case of marine [[benthos]] and [[fisheries]]. Research thrust was also placed on studies of [[harmful algal blooms]] and [[marine mammals]] around the Indian subcontinent. The environmental and productivity patterns around the Indian [[EEZ]] continued to be monitored and research on the productivity and [[fishery]] resources of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands|Andaman and Nicobar regions]] was also carried out. In January 2005, after the devastating [[2004 tsunami]] the institute along with [[National Institute of Oceanography, India|National Institute of Oceanography]] and School of Marine Sciences, [[Cochin University of Science and Technology]] (CUSAT), Kochi carried out the one of the first scientific studies regarding the impact of the tsunami on marine life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sagar Sampada to study impact of tsunami  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/01/05/stories/2005010507390500.htm |newspaper=The Hindu |date=5 Jan 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tsunami: Research vessel assessing damage to marine ecology|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/jan/10tsunami4.htm |date=10 January 2005 |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th and 10th [[Five-Year plans of India|plan periods]], the CMLRE served chiefly as a co-ordinating and fund granting agency, managing the projects that were granted to various other research institutes and universities.

During the 11th [[Five-Year plans of India|five-year plan]] (2007-2012), the CMLRE established in-house R&amp;D activities, apart from co-ordination of projects in other institutes. In this period, focus was placed on continued monitoring of the [[pelagic]] environment and productivity, marine [[benthos]], [[harmful algal blooms]], studies on reproduction and recruitment of [[sardines]] in the south-east [[Arabian Sea]], deep-sea [[fisheries]] and [[myctophid]] resources in the Indian EEZ. Several projects during this period also focused on isolating and identifying [[Bioactive compound|bioactive]] compounds from marine organisms.

==Institute Mandate==
The Centre has the following mandate
* To develop management strategies for marine living resources through Ecosystem monitoring and modelling efforts.
* Evolving, coordinating and implementing time targeted national /regional R&amp;D programmes in the field of marine living resources and ecology through effective utilization of Fishery and Oceanographic Research Vessel Sagar Sampada.
* Strengthening of research on marine living resources and Ecology including establishment of a data centre for storage and dissemination of data/ information to end users.
* Coordinating the national programmes relating to Southern Ocean Living Resources (Antarctic marine living resources).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">'''Comparative law wikis''' are [[wiki]]s that allow users to create empirical cross-reference datasets for the analysis of the world's myriad [[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]. Wikis are adaptable to use by any cross-geographical comparative study, such as [[comparative politics]], [[comparative religion]].

==Examples==

Over the past decade, there have been several attempts to create a global legal wiki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ler.edu.au/pdf/vol19_fullpapers/ler_vol19_paper3.pdf|title=Normann Witzleb, Engaging with the World: Students of Comparative Law Write for Wikipedia|publisher=Legal Education Review (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; though as of April 2017 none have gained primacy.  Examples include the World Encyclopedia of Law, by LAWi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawin.org/comparative-law/|title=World Encyclopedia of Law|publisher=LAWi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wex]], the online legal encyclopedia created by [[Cornell Law School]]'s [[Legal Information Institute]]. Parallel efforts to create crowdsourced data structures to map global legal/regulatory authorities include projects like [[Intellipedia]], an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).

== Usefulness ==

Comparative law wikis are an efficient method of performing [[comparative law|comparative legal]] analysis.  Wikis are particularly useful for comparative global analysis because of the use with which sources from multiple jurisdictions can be gathered in one place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Dennis|last2=Mighell|first2=Tom|title=Wikis for the Legal Profession|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=12 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911023153/http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|archivedate=11 April 2014|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crowdsourcing]] permits gathering up-to-date legal authorities from contributors who have local expertise, particularly knowledge of languages and administrative structures that background implementation of particular legal/regulatory norms.  

Comparative law wikis can also be useful for comparative study in federal legal systems, such as in the U.S., where 50-state law surveys are particularly useful.

'''Drafting''' is the preliminary stage of a written work in which the author begins to develop a more cohesive product. A '''draft document''' is the product the writer creates in the initial stages of the [[writing process]].

In the drafting stage, the author:
* develops a more cohesive text
* organizes thoughts
* explains examples/ideas
* uncovers transitions
* discovers a central argument/point
* elaborates on key ideas

In a book that became popular in the 1950s, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', famed authors Strunk and White describe the first draft as being a less edited version of the final draft.  In their book, Strunk and White say, “the first principle of composition is to foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.&lt;ref&gt;The Elements of Style Fiftieth Anniversary Edition (2009), p. 15, {{ISBN|978-0-205-63264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;” This shape is the draft that eventually becomes the finished work.

More recently, [[Peter Elbow]], in his book ''Writing Without Teachers'', presents a very different view of the drafting stage in the [[writing process]]. He describes his stance on the writing process, saying “Writing is a way to end up thinking something you couldn’t have started out thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.15&lt;/ref&gt;” According to Elbow, the best way to accomplish this is a series of drafts which come together to produce an emerging “center of gravity” that then translates into the main focus on the work. This process should be a holistic process, not a linear process. Elbow’s reasoning behind this concept of multiple drafts follows the idea that, “if he learns to maximize the interaction among his own ideas or points of view, he can produce new ones that didn’t seem available to him.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. Writing Without Teachers. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford UP, 1973, 1998. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;”

Whether being used as the creation of a less-edited final product (Strunk and White) or as a tool during the prewriting stage (Elbow), drafting is a necessary stage for the writer in the writing process.  Having created a draft, the author is then able to move onto the revision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6706">'''Drainage research''' is the study of agricultural [[drainage]] systems and their effects to arrive at optimal system design.

== Aspects to be covered ==
[[File:DrDiagram.JPG|thumb|Figure 1.]]
Agricultural land [[drainage]] has [[agriculture|agricultural]],  [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[hydrology (agriculture)|hydrological]], [[engineering]], [[economy|economical]], [[social]] and [[political|socio-political]] aspects (Figure 1).&lt;br&gt;
All these aspects can be subject of drainage research.&lt;br&gt;
The aim (objective, target) of agricultural land drainage is the optimized agricultural production related to:
# reclamation of agricultural land
# [[soil conservation|conservation]] of agricultural land
# [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] of [[crop yield]]
# [[Agricultural diversification|crop diversification]]
# cropping intensification
# optimization of [[farm]] operations.

== Systems analysis ==
[[File:DrDesign.JPG|thumb|Figure 2.]]
The role of targets, criterion, environmental, and hydrological factors is illustrated in Figure 2.&lt;br&gt;
In this figure criterion factors are factors influenced by drainage on the one hand and the agricultural performance on the other.&lt;br&gt;
An example of a criterion factor is the depth of the [[water table]]:
# A drainage system influences this depth; the relation between drainage system design and depth of water table is mainly physical and can be described by [[Watertable control|drainage equations]], in which the [[Hydrology (agriculture)#Irrigation and drainage requirements|drainage requirements]] are to be found from a [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]].&lt;ref&gt;''Drainage for Agriculture: Hydrology and Water Balances''. Lecture notes, International Course on Land Drainage (ICLD), International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. Download at : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/balances.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The depth of the water table as a criterion factor needs to be translated into a criterion index to be given a numerical value that represents the behavior of the water table on the one hand and that can be related to the target (e.g. crop production) on the other hand.
# The relation between criterion index and target can often be [[optimization (mathematics)|optimized]], the maximum value providing the ultimate aim while the corresponding value of the criterion index can be used as an ''agricultural drainage criterion'' in the design procedure.

== Crop response processes ==
[[File:CrResponse.JPG|thumb|Figure 3.]]

The underlying processes in the optimization (as in the insert of Figure 2) are manifold. The processes can be grouped into mutually dependent [[soil physics|soil physical]], soil [[soil chemistry|chemical/biological]], and [[Hydrology (agriculture)|hydrological]] processes (Figure 3): 
*The soil physical processes include soil [[aeration]], [[soil structure]], soil stability,  and soil [[temperature]]
*The chemical processes include [[soil salinity]], [[Acid sulfate soil|soil acidity]] and [[Alkali soil|soil alkalinity]].
*The hydrological processes include [[evaporation]], [[Surface runoff|runoff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahiablame|first=L.M.|last2=Chaubey|first2=I.|last3=Smith|first3=D.R.|last4=Engel|first4=B.A.|date=2011|title=Effect of tile effluent on nutrient concentration and retention efficiency in agricultural drainage ditches|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2011.03.002|journal=Agricultural Water Management|volume=98|issue=8|pages=1271–1279|doi=10.1016/j.agwat.2011.03.002|issn=0378-3774|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[soil salinity]].

== Field data ==
[[File:R-3VAR1.JPG|thumb|left|Crop yield (Y) and depth of water table (X in dm) &lt;ref&gt;Data provided by various authors on banana, cotton, sugarcane and wheat response to shallow water tables [https://www.waterlog.info/cropwat.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; ]]

In drainage research the collection and analysis of field data is important.&lt;ref&gt;''Drainage Research in Farmers' Fields: Analysis of Data''. Part of project “Liquid Gold” of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.

In dealing with field data one must expect considerable [[random variation]] owing to the large number of natural processes involved and the large variability of plant and soil properties and hydrological conditions.

An example of a relation between crop yield and depth of water table subject to random natural variation is shown in the attached graph.  The graph was made with the [[SegReg]] program, see [[segmented regression]].

When analysing field data with random variation a proper application of [[statistics|statistical principles]] like in [[regression analysis|regression]] and [[frequency analysis]] is necessary.

==Soil salinity control==

In irrigated lands, subsurface drainage may be required to [[leaching (agriculture)|leach]] the salts brought into the soil with the irrigation water to prevent [[soil salination]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8294">An '''economic input-output life-cycle assessment''', or '''EIO-LCA''' involves the use of aggregate sector-level data to quantify the amount of environmental impact that can be directly attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors in producing its output. Combining such data sets can enable accounting for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of traditional [[Life-cycle assessment]]s. EIO-LCA analysis traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions (including all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements) required for producing a particular product or service.

EIO-LCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product. To the extent that the good or service of interest is representative of a sector, EIOLCA can provide very fast estimates of full supply chain implications for that good or service.

==Background==
Economic input-output analysis was developed by the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Wassily Leontief]]. It quantifies the interrelationships among sectors of an economic system, enabling identification of direct and indirect economic inputs of purchases. This concept was extended by including data about environmental and energy analysis from each sector to account for [[supply chain]] environmental implications of economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005) ''Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input-Output Approach'', Resources for the Future Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933115-24-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Input-output transactions tables, which track flows of purchases between sectors, are collected by the federal government in the United States. EIO works as follows: If &lt;math&gt;X_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the amount that sector &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; purchased from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in a given year and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the "final demand" for output from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the amount of output purchased for consumption, as opposed to purchased by other businesses as supplies for more production), then the total output &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; from sector &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; includes output to consumers plus output sold to other sectors:

&lt;math&gt;x_i = y_i + \sum_jX_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

If we define &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; as the normalized production for each sector, so that &lt;math&gt;A_{ij} = X_{ij}/x_j&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;x_i = y_i + \sum_jA_{ij}x_j&lt;/math&gt;

In vector notation

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y} + \mathbf{Ax}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} = (\mathbf{I - A})\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = (\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

This result indicates that knowing only the final demand from each sector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; and the normalized IO matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, one can calculate the total implied production &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; from each sector of the economy. If data are available on a particular emissions release (or other attribute of interest) from each sector of the economy, then a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be compiled to represent various releases (columns) per $ output from each sector (rows). Total additional emissions &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; associated with additional final demand of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; can then be calculated as:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{R}^T\Delta\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{R}^T(\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

This simple result enables very quick analysis, taking into account releases associated with the entire supply chain requirements needed to provide a specific final demand, on average. The equations are based on average data in the current economy, but they can be used to make predictions for marginal changes in output (such as one more unit of a particular product) if 
# average output and marginal output are assumed to be sufficiently close (i.e., the impact of ''one more unit'' = the impact of ''the average unit''), and
# the marginal change in final output &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; is representative of the product of interest (ex: if the product will use electricity from wind energy exclusively, then using the electricity sector, which is dominated by coal, would yield a poor estimate).

Finally, if the researcher has estimates for valuation of [[externality]] costs associated with each item in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; (or, alternatively, if weighting coefficients are available that represent the relative importance of each item in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;, using [[ecological indicator]]s, for example) then the externality costs (or weights) per unit of releases could be compiled into a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt; in order to calculate the scalar "environmental impact metric" &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta m = \mathbf{m}^T\Delta\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{m}^T\mathbf{R}^T\Delta\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{m}^T\mathbf{R}^T(\mathbf{I - A})^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Generally there is wide uncertainty associated with estimates of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}&lt;/math&gt;, so such aggregation should be done only with care, including [[sensitivity analysis]]. Typically, researchers examine specific elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; rather than attempting to aggregate.

The big picture result is that by collecting data on average economic sector transactions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and average sector emissions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to make quick predictions about the full supply chain emissions associated with a product of interest by representing the product as marginal changes in production from relevant sectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Software==
Researchers at the Green Design Institute of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] began developing a web-based tool for performing an EIO-LCA in the 1990s.  The underlying software&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiolca.net www.eiolca.net]&lt;/ref&gt; traces out the various economic transactions, resource requirements and environmental emissions associated with the production of a particular product or service. The model captures all the various manufacturing, transportation, mining and related requirements to produce a product or service. For example, one might wish to trace out the implications of purchasing $ 46,000 of reinforcing steel and $ 104,000 of concrete for a kilometer of roadway pavement. Environmental implications of these purchases can be estimated using EIO-LCA. The current (2002) model is based upon the Department of Commerce's 428 sector industry input-output model of the US economy.

In 2018, VitalMetrics Group, an environmental consultancy, developed a web-based Spend Analysis Tool&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/sustainability-tools/ www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/sustainability-tools/]&lt;/ref&gt; for quantifying the environmental impacts associated with an organization’s entire upstream supply chain. It is compliant with the approach for quantifying spend-based impacts defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard. The tool utilizes the Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA)&lt;ref&gt;Suh, S., 2005: Developing Sectoral Environmental Database for Input-Output Analysis: Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive of the U.S., Economic Systems Research, 17 (4), 449 – 469] https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09535310500284326&lt;/ref&gt;, a peer-reviewed EIO-LCA database with a base year of 2014. CEDA represents 389 industrial sectors, the commodities and the linkages between them, and over 2,700 environmental exchanges arising from them, including extraction of various natural resources, water consumption, land use, and emissions to air, water and soil.

'''''Edmond de Belamy''''' is a [[generative adversarial network]] [[portrait painting]] constructed in 2018 by Paris-based arts-collective ''Obvious.''&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/obvious-ai-art-christies-auction-smart-creativity/index.html|title=AI-produced artwork sells for $433K, smashing expectations - CNN Style|website=edition.cnn.com|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printed on canvas, the work belongs to a series of generative images called '''La Famille de Belamy'''.  It achieved widespread notoriety after [[Christie's]] announced its intention to auction the piece as the first artwork created using [[Artificial Intelligence]] to be featured in a Christie's auction. It surpassed pre-auction esimates which valued it at $7,000 to $10,000, instead selling for $432,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/Lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?sid=&amp;intObjectID=6166184&amp;T=Lot&amp;language=en|title=Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html|title=AI Art at Christie’s Sells for $432,500|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is a portrait of a somewhat-blurry man. It is a print on canvas measuring 27 ½ x 27 ½ in (700 x 700 mm.) set within a gilded wood frame. The image was created by an algorithm that referenced 15,000 portraits from various periods. 

It is signed at the bottom right with "min G max D x [log (D(x))] + z [log(1 -- D (G(z)))]", which is part of the algorithm code that produced it.

The organization that produced it is called Obvious. It is a collective comprising three people, Pierre Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupré and Gauthier Vernier, who are based in Paris, France.

The piece has been criticized because it was created using a [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN) software package based on prior research by others, including [[Ian Goodfellow]], and implemented by a developer who was not affiliated with Obvious, leading to allegations that Obvious contributed minimally to the final work product. Posts on the project's issue tracker show Obvious members requesting that the original developer provide support and custom features. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How three French students used borrowed code to put the first AI portrait in Christie’s | publisher=The Verge | date=23 October 2018 | url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans | access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11445">An '''endangered species recovery plan''' is a document describing the current status, threats and intended methods for increasing [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species]] population sizes. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973 requires that all species considered endangered must have a plan implemented for their recovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1533|title=16 U.S. Code § 1533 - Determination of endangered species and threatened species|work=LII / Legal Information Institute | accessdate= 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the format is also useful when considering the conservation of any endangered species. Recovery plans act as a foundation from which you can build a conservation effort and they can help to make conservation more effective.&lt;ref name ="Guidance"&gt;{{Cite journal | author =  National Marine Fisheries Service | title = Interim Endangered and Threatened Species Recovery Planning Guidance | url = http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/recovery/guidance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The United States congress said in 1973 that endangered species "are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/species/why-save-species.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Species - Why Save Species?|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore set laws to protect endangered species. Section 4(f) of the United States [[Endangered Species Act]] from 1973 directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to develop and implement recovery plans to promote the conservation of endangered and threatened species.&lt;ref name="noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/recovery/|title=Recovery of Species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service are responsible for administering the act. The recovery plan is a document which specifies what research and management actions are necessary to support recovery, but does not itself commit manpower or funds. Recovery plans are used in setting funding priorities and provide direction to local, regional, and state planning efforts. Recovery is when the threats to species survival are neutralized and the species will be able to survive in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esrp.csustan.edu/publications/pubhtml.php?doc=sjvrp&amp;file=cover.html#guide|title=Recovery Plan for Upland Species of the San Joaquin Valley, California|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] also create similar documents, Species Action Plans, which are used to outline the conservation strategies of species, normally between set dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/publications/species_actions_plans/ |title=IUCN - Species Action Plans |publisher= |accessdate=21 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325163018/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/publications/species_actions_plans/ |archivedate=25 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents are used to clearly define the status and threats to the species, and set aims for conservation so that parties involved can work towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/action_plans/index_en.htm|title=Species Action Plan - Conservation - Environment - European Commission|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==

[[FIle:Status_ESA.svg|thumb|220px|U.S. Endangered Species Act Categories]]

An [[endangered species]] is a species which is likely to become extinct.
The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] has 17 categories of species status. These categories are used in the documents produced for the U.S. Endangered species act. The categories include:
*Endangered (E) for species “in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range”
*Threatened (T) for species “likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range”
*Candidate (C) for species currently under consideration
*Species endangered due to “similarity of appearance” (SAE)
*Species of concern (SC) for species that are considered “important to monitor” but have not been categorized as E,T or C
*Delisted species removed from the list due to species recovery or extinction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/about/listing-status-codes.html|title=Endangered Species Program - About Us - Frequently Asked Questions - Species Status Codes|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species Program|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Status iucn3.1.svg|thumb|right|220px|IUCN red list categories]]

The IUCN also has categories that it uses to classify species, which are more widely used in conservation. These are:
*[[Extinct]] (EX) – there are no individuals remaining of that species at all
*[[Extinct in the wild]] (EW) – there are no individuals remaining of that species in the wild at all
*[[Critically Endangered]] (CR) – there is a very high risk that the species will soon go extinct in the wild, for example because there is only a very small population remaining
*[[Endangered]] (EN) – there is a high risk of the species soon becoming extinct in the wild 
*[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] (VU) – there is a high risk that the species will soon become endangered 
*[[Near threatened]] (NT) – there is a risk that the species will become threatened in the near future
*[[Least concern]] (LC) – there is a low risk that the species will become threatened. This category is used for “widespread and abundant taxa”
*[[Data Deficient]] (DD) – there is not enough data on the species to be able to make a reliable assessment on the status of the species
*[[Not evaluated]] (NE) – the species has not yet been evaluated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1|title=2001 Categories &amp; Criteria (version 3.1)|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of a recovery plan==
The recovery plan must contain at least:
#A description of what is needed to return the species to a healthy state
#Criteria for what this healthy state would be, so that the species can be removed from the endangered list when it is achieved
#Estimates of how long the recovery will take and how much it will cost &lt;ref name="noaa.gov"/&gt;

A recovery plan often contains the following sections:
*Background of the species - a description of the species, its taxonomy, population structure and life history. This includes the distribution, food sources, reproduction and abundance
*Threats - the main reasons why the species is now at risk of extinction
*Recovery strategy - details of how the species can be returned to a healthy state, including the goals, timeline, methods and criteria for delisting.&lt;ref name= "Guidance"/&gt;

==Adaptive management==

When recovery plans are carried out well, they do not simply act as stop gaps to prevent extinction, but can restore species to a state of health so they are self-sustaining. There is evidence to suggest that the best plans are adaptive and dynamic, responding to changing conditions. However, [[adaptive management]] requires the system to be constantly monitored so that changes are identified.&lt;ref name="Clark2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Clark JA et. al. | title= Improving U.S. Endangered Species Act Recovery Plans: Key Findings and Recommendations of the SCB Recovery Plan Project | journal=''Conservation Biology'' | volume=16 | year=2002 | pages=1510–1519 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01376.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly this is frequently not done, even for species that have already been [[IUCN Red List|red listed]].&lt;ref name="Grouse"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Storch, I | title= Grouse: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan 2006-2010 | url = https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2007-034.pdf }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The species must be monitored throughout the recovery period (and beyond) to ensure that the plan is working as intended. The framework for this monitoring should be planned before the start of the implementation, and the details included in the recovery plan. Information on how and when the data will be collected should be supplied.&lt;ref name="Bonobo"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Aveling, C. et. al. | title= Bonobo (''Pan paniscus'') | url = https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2012-083.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat conservation plan==

An alternative method of conserving a species is to conserve the habitat that the species is found in. In this process, there is no target species for conservation, but rather the habitat as a whole is protected and managed, often with a view to returning the habitat to a more natural state. In theory, this method of conservation can be beneficial because it allows for the entire ecosystem and the many species within to benefit from conservation, rather than just the single target species.&lt;ref name="Rohlf1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Rohlf, DJ. | title= Six Biological Reasons Why the Endangered Species Act Doesn't Work - And What to Do About It | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=5 | year=1991 | pages=273–282 | jstor=2385897 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1991.tb00139.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] suggest there is evidence that habitat based approaches do not have enough focus on individual species to protect them sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/our_work/conservation_planning/ |title=IUCN - Conservation Planning |publisher= |accessdate=21 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314215803/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/our_work/conservation_planning/ |archivedate=14 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However much research now is turning towards area-based strategies in preference to individual species approaches such as endangered species recovery plans.&lt;ref name= "Rohlf1991"/&gt;

==Test phase==

The testing phase of this program began in 12 schools in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], the capital of [[Chile]]. After 3 years the program had extended to the Ninth Region, the [[Araucanía Region]], (the part of the country with the largest indigenous population) with more than 100 schools participating in the program.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite book

==First phase==

From 1995-2007 (the unofficial First Phase of the Enlaces project), the government spent more than $121 million and international cooperation from organizations such as the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) in global education, infrastructure, [[computer]]s, access to educational recourses, technical assistance, and teacher training.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web

==Future plans==

In 2007,  the Chilean Ministry of Education presented ExpoEnlaces 2007 where they showcased the latest innovations in [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) so that people can understand the abilities of these new technologies and their uses in the classroom.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; That same year, the Ministry of Education published its new objectives and projects for the coming years. Didier de Saint Pierre, the executive director of Enlaces, divided the program into two phases, the first phase, which is coming to a close, focused on infrastructure in the schools and equipping them to install the necessary programs and administration.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The second phase involves developing the technological infrastructure so that it has the capacity to improve the quality of learning in Chile.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Once the basic technological infrastructure is in place, the Ministry will extend the technology to the remaining schools in less developed regions, and it will implement new technologies in the more advanced regions.

Examples of the new technologies that Enlaces will implement are [[electronic whiteboard]]s for [[math]], palm pilots or pocket PCs for [[physics]], and projectors for teaching sciences.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Other new strategies will include ICT in the classroom, where they will integrate portable technology and projectors in 3,000 classrooms, benefiting 87,000 students (3% of the total number of students). The goal is to implement this program in 16,000 classrooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[science]] program is a good example of the direction in which the Enlaces program is headed. A very important aspect of this program is teaching style. Enlaces encourages the use of the HEI ([[hypothesis]], [[experimentation]], [[Education|instruction]]) method. The new science classes are being developed in a multimedia format using simulations delivered via the internet.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Chile - Enlaces hace la mejor clase de Ciencias.
| publisher = OEI - Organización de Estados Iberoamericanos
| date = 2007-08-04
| url = http://www.oei.es/noticias/spip.php?article795
| accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new program offers students many benefits. The classes that follow this methodology better prepare students for lessons and projects. When presented with an experiment, students can form a hypothesis, the teacher can demonstrate every aspect of the experiment using a computer, a projection system, and the internet, and the students can follow the other steps of the scientific method. While the use of simulations is not the exactly the same as doing the physical experiment, simulation eliminates the problem of lack of equipment and materials (such as chemicals for [[chemistry]], and animals for dissection for [[biology]]) that many schools in Chile face.

===Adult Education===

Part of the objective of the Enlaces program is to help the community through [[adult education]]. The idea was that children would bring the technology home with them, but this has not worked the way the Ministry had hoped. The majority of parents (especially those in rural areas) recognize the benefits of technology for their children, but feel that they cannot benefit personally.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; For adults who do want to learn more about technology, the Enlaces program offers an 18-hour digital literacy class where they learn the basic functions of a computer, how to use a [[word processor]], how to use the [[internet]], and how to create and use an [[email]] account.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt;

'''Erotic asphyxiation''' (variously called '''asphyxiophilia''', '''hypoxyphilia''' or '''breath control play''') is the intentional restriction of [[oxygen]] to the brain for the purposes of [[sexual arousal]]. The term '''autoerotic asphyxiation''' is used when the act is done by a person to him- or herself. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a ''gasper''.&lt;ref name="Lost English"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Chris|title=Lost English: Words And Phrases That Have Vanished From Our Language|date=30 January 2012|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|isbn=978-1843172789|page=66}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The erotic interest in asphyxiation is classified as a [[paraphilia]] in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

==Physiology==
Author John Curra wrote, "The [[carotid arteries]] (on either side of the neck) carry [[oxygen]]-rich blood from the heart to the brain. When these are compressed, as in strangulation or hanging, the sudden loss of oxygen to the brain and the accumulation of [[carbon dioxide]] can increase feelings of giddiness, lightheadedness, and pleasure, all of which will heighten masturbatory sensations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Relativity of Deviance|author=John Curra|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|year=2000|page=111|isbn=0-7619-0778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author George Shuman describes the effect as such, "When the brain is deprived of oxygen, it induces a lucid, semi-hallucinogenic state called [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Combined with [[orgasm]], the rush is said to be no less powerful than cocaine, and highly addictive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Last Breath: A Sherry Moore Novel|author=George D. Shuman|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|page=80|isbn=1-4165-3491-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning hallucinogenic states brought about by chronic hypoxia, Dr. E L Lloyd notes that they may be similar to the hallucinations experienced by climbers at altitude. He further notes that no such state occurs in hypoxia brought about by sudden aircraft decompression at altitude. These findings suggest to him that they do not arrive purely from a lack of oxygen. Upon examining the studies on hypoxia he found that "abnormalities in the cerebral neurochemistry involving one or more of the interconnected [[neurotransmitters]], [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[beta-endorphin]] had been reported in all the conditions associated with hallucinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Points: Hallucinations, hypoxia, and neurotransmitters|author=Dr. E L Lloyd|publisher=British Medical Journal Volume 292| date=29 March 1986|page=903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historically, the practice of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used as a treatment for [[erectile dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sataniclust.com/04_06/pro_0406_asphyxiation.htm|title=Erotic Asphyxiation|work=Lust Magazine|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by [[hanging]]. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed an [[erection]], sometimes remaining after death (a [[death erection]]), and occasionally [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] when being hanged. However, [[post-mortem ejaculation]] occurs in hanging victims after death because of disseminated muscle relaxation; this is a different mechanism from that sought by autoerotic asphyxiation practitioners.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Practice==
Various methods are used to achieve the level of oxygen depletion needed, such as a hanging, suffocation with a plastic bag over the head, self-[[strangulation]] such as with a [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]], gas or volatile solvents, chest compression, or some combination of these.&lt;ref name = Blanchard1991/&gt; Sometimes, complicated devices are used to produce the desired effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Halloran | first1 = R.

E. | year = 1993 | title = Autoerotic fatalities with power hydraulics | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 359–364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice can be dangerous even if performed with care and has resulted in a significant number of accidental deaths. Uva (1995) writes “Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Uva | first1 = J.

== Accidental death ==
{{See also|Autoerotic fatality}}

Deaths often occur when the loss of consciousness caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss of control over the means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially more difficult to get out of dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/autoerotic-asphyxiophilia Autoerotic Asphyxiophilia] on 'Sexinfo' website, University of Santa Barbara, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some fatality cases, the body of the asphyxiophilic individual is discovered naked or with genitalia in hand, with pornographic material or sex toys present, or with evidence of having orgasmed prior to death.&lt;ref name = Janssen2005/&gt; Bodies found at the scene of an accidental death often show evidence of other [[paraphilic]] activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000433-199103000-00012 | last1 = Bogliolo | first1 = L.

== In fiction ==
{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}
The sensational nature of autoerotic asphyxiation often makes it the subject of [[urban legends]].  It has also been mentioned specifically in a number of works of fiction.
* In the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s famous novel ''Justine, or The Misfortunes of the Virtue'', Justine is subjected to this by one of her captors.  She survives the encounter.
* In the Guts short story in [[Chuck Palahniuk|Chuck Palahniuk's]] novel [[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|''Haunted'']], one the characters discusses parents who discover the accidental deaths of their sons to autoerotic asphyxiation.  They are said to cover up the deaths before police or coroners arrive to save the family from shame.
* In the novel (and later movie adaptation) ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', death as a result of this type of sexual arousal is explained when it is offered as a possible cause for a murder victim's death.
* In the film ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'', the protagonist's teenage son accidentally kills himself with asphyxiation whilst sexually aroused. The protagonist then stages his son's death as a suicide, which gives him the opportunity to rise to infamy via a [[Literary forgery|literary hoax]].
* In the film ''[[Ken Park]]'' a character named Tate practices autoerotic asphyxia.
* Autoerotic asphyxiation occurs in the [[cold open]] of ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' episode ''Back to the Garden''. 
* [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] from ''[[South Park]]'' dies from suffocating while wearing a [[Batman]] costume and practicing autoerotic asphyxia in the episode "[[Sexual Healing (South Park)|Sexual Healing]]". 
* In the season four episode of ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', titled "Monkey Business", the character Zig Semetauer is found dead in his bathroom by [[Hank Moody|Hank]], Charlie and Stu after suffocating due to autoerotic asphyxia, to which Hank quips "I'm not averse to the occasional choke-n'-stroke, but this is a prime example of why one must always use a [[buddy system]]."
* A character in the film ''[[Knocked Up]]'' offers to be a "[[:wikt:spotter|spotter]]" for a friend if he intends on performing autoerotic asphyxiation.
* Bruce Robertson, the main character in the 1998 [[Irvine Welsh]] novel, ''[[Filth (novel)|Filth]]'' engages in the practice.  This is also depicted in the 2013 film adaptation.
*In the sixth episode, season two of [[BoJack Horseman|Bojack Horseman]], autoerotic asphyxiation and celebrity deaths are recurrent discussions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3888">The '''Flood Studies Report''', published in 1975, is used in relation to [[rainfall]] events in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/5964/1/IH_094.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been replaced by the '''Flood Estimation Handbook''', but the method can still be used.

==Calculation procedure==

[[File:Rain over Woodhead Reservoir, Derbyshire.jpg|thumb|alt=Rainfall in the UK.|Rainfall on a rural catchment in [[Longdendale]], [[Derbyshire]].]]

It is possible to use the FSR to predict the depth of rainfall from a storm of a given duration and return period. The FSR includes values for two key variables mapped across the UK: the M5-60 minutes rainfall, and the ratio "r".
*M5-60 minutes rainfall is the expected depth of rainfall in millimetres (mm) from a storm lasting 60 minutes (1 hour) with a return period of 5 years (hence M5).
*M5-2 days rainfall is the expected depth of rainfall from a storm lasting 2 days (48 hours) with a return period of 5 years.
*The dimensionless ratio "r" is the M5-60 minutes value divided by the M5-2 days value.
*Factor Z1 is interpolated from figures&lt;ref&gt;Design and analysis of urban storm drainage - The Wallingford Procedure, Volume 4, The Modified Rational Method, {{ISBN|0 946466 041}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the values of M5-2 days and "r".
*Factor Z2 (the growth factor) is found from the M5 rainfall depth, and depends on the return period.
*The Areal Reduction Factor (ARF) takes the catchment area into account. For small catchments (below 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) the ARF is not required.

To find the depth of a rainfall of duration D and return period T at a given location in the UK, the following should be carried out:
# Find M5-60 minutes rainfall depth and "r" for the location using FSR maps.
# Divide this rainfall depth by "r" to get the M5-2 days depth.
# Multiply the M5-2 days depth by factor Z1 to find the M5-D depth.
# Multiply the M5-D depth by factor Z2 (the growth factor) to find the MT-D depth.
# Multiply the MT-D depth by the Areal Reduction Factor (ARF).

===Example===
Find the depth of rainfall from a storm of duration 6 hours and return period 10 years on a catchment of 5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in [[Sheffield]].
#From the FSR maps, the M5-60 minutes rainfall is 20.5mm, and "r" = 0.4.
#Divide 20.5mm by 0.4 to get 51.3mm, which is the M5-2 days rainfall depth.
#Factor Z1 = 0.64, so multiply 51.3mm by 0.64 to get 32.8mm.
#Factor Z2 = 1.16, so multiply 32.8mm by 1.16 to get 38.1mm.
#The ARF is 0.96, so multiply 38.1mm by 0.96 to get 36.6mm.

Therefore the expected depth of rainfall from the storm is 36.6mm. The mean intensity of rainfall is given by 36.6mm divided by 6 hours, which is 6.1mm/hour.

===Storm profiles===
The above method is sufficient for finding the overall depth of rainfall during a storm. However, it is often useful from an engineering perspective to predict the intensity of rainfall during the storm, to allow structures such as drains and sewers to be designed with sufficient capacity for stormwater.

In general, the intensity of a storm is highest at the mid-duration point (known as the peak), and lowest at the start and end of the storm. Therefore, peaked profiles are applied to the storm data to provide a more realistic description of the rainfall intensity during the storm.

==Flood Estimation Handbook==
The '''Flood Estimation Handbook''' was published in 1999 and replaces the FSR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceh.ac.uk/feh2/fehintro.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the percentage runoff equation:

&lt;math&gt; PR = 0.829PIMP + 25SOIL + 0.078UCWI - 20.7 &lt;/math&gt;

where PR is percentage runoff, PIMP is percentage [[impervious surface|imperviousness]] of the catchment, SOIL is the soil index and UCWI is urban catchment wetness index.

'''Genetic analysis''' is the overall process of studying and [[research]]ing in fields of science that involve [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]]. There are a number of applications that are developed from this research, and these are also considered parts of the process. The base system of analysis revolves around general genetics. Basic studies include identification of genes and [[inherited disorder]]s. This research has been conducted for centuries on both a large-scale physical observation basis and on a more microscopic scale.
Genetic analysis can be used generally to describe methods both used in and resulting from the sciences of genetics and molecular biology, or to [[applied research|applications]] resulting from this research.

Genetic analysis may be done to identify genetic/inherited disorders and also to make a [[differential diagnosis]] in certain somatic diseases such as [[cancer]]. Genetic analyses of cancer include detection of [[mutation]]s, [[fusion gene]]s, and DNA copy number changes.[[File:FDA microbiologist prepares DNA samples for gel electrophoresis analysis.jpg|thumb|right|FDA microbiologist prepares DNA samples for gel electrophoresis analysis]]

== History of genetic analysis ==
Much of the research that set the foundation of genetic analysis began in prehistoric times. Early humans found that they could practice [[selective breeding]] to improve crops and animals. They also identified inherited traits in humans that were eliminated over the years. The many genetic analyses gradually evolved over time.

=== Mendelian research ===

{{main|Mendelian inheritance}}

Modern genetic analysis began in the mid-1800s with research conducted by [[Gregor Mendel]]. Mendel, who is known as the "father of modern genetics", was inspired to study variation in plants. Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel cultivated and tested some 29,000 pea plants (i.e., Pisum sativum). This study showed that one in four pea plants had purebred recessive alleles, two out of four were hybrid and one out of four were purebred dominant. His experiments led him to make two generalizations, the [[Law of Segregation]] and the [[Law of Independent Assortment]], which later became known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance. Lacking the basic understanding of heredity, Mendel observed various organisms and first utilized genetic analysis to find that traits were inherited from parents and those traits could vary between children. Later, it was found that units within each cell are responsible for these traits. These units are called genes. Each gene is defined by a series of amino acids that create proteins responsible for genetic traits.

== Various types of genetic analysis ==
'''Genetic analyses''' include molecular technologies such as [[PCR]], [[RT-PCR]], [[DNA sequencing]], and [[DNA microarrays]], and [[cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] methods such as [[karyotyping]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridisation]].
[[File:Electrophoresis apparatus.jpg|thumb|right|Electrophoresis apparatus]]

=== DNA sequencing ===

[[DNA sequencing]] is essential to the applications of genetic analysis. This process is used to determine the order of [[nucleotide base]]s. Each molecule of DNA is made from [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], which determine what function the genes will possess. This was first discovered during the 1970s. DNA sequencing encompasses biochemical methods for determining the order of the nucleotide bases, adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, in a DNA oligonucleotide. By generating a DNA sequence for a particular organism, you are determining the patterns that make up genetic traits and in some cases behaviors.

Sequencing methods have evolved from relatively laborious gel-based procedures to modern automated protocols based on dye labelling and detection in capillary [[electrophoresis]] that permit rapid large-scale sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes. Knowledge of DNA sequences of genes and other parts of the genome of organisms has become indispensable for basic research studying biological processes, as well as in applied fields such as diagnostic or forensic research. The advent of DNA sequencing has significantly accelerated biological research and discovery.

=== Cytogenetics ===
'''[[Cytogenetics]]''' is a branch of genetics that is concerned with the study of the structure and function of the cell, especially the chromosomes. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] studies the amplification of DNA. Because of the close analysis of chromosomes in cytogenetics, abnormalities are more readily seen and diagnosed.

==== Karyotyping ====
A [[karyotype]] is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual organism.[[File:Karyotype isochromosomeX.JPG|thumb|right|Karyotype of chromosomes]]

Karyotypes describe the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the [[centromeres]], banding pattern, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics.
'''Karyotyping''' uses a system of studying chromosomes to identify genetic abnormalities and evolutionary changes in the past.

=== DNA microarrays ===
A [[DNA microarray]] is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. When a gene is expressed in a cell, it generates [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Overexpressed genes generate more mRNA than underexpressed genes. This can be detected on the microarray
Since an array can contain tens of thousands of probes, a microarray experiment can accomplish many genetic tests in parallel. Therefore, arrays have dramatically accelerated many types of investigations.

=== PCR ===

{{main|Polymerase chain reaction}}

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology in molecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.
PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications. These include [[DNA cloning]] for sequencing, DNA-based [[phylogeny]], or functional analysis of genes; the diagnosis of [[hereditary diseases]]; the identification of genetic fingerprints (used in forensic sciences and paternity testing); and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases.

== Practical application ==

===Cancer breakthrough===
Numerous practical advancements have been made in the field of genetics and molecular biology through the processes of genetic analysis. One of the most prevalent advancements during the late 20th and early 21st centuries is a greater understanding of cancer's link to genetics. By identifying which genes in the cancer cells are working abnormally, doctors can better diagnose and treat cancers.

===Possibilities===

This research has been able to identify the concepts of genetic mutations, fusion genes and changes in DNA copy numbers, and advances are made in the field every day. Much of these applications have led to new types of sciences that use the foundations of genetic analysis. Reverse genetics uses the methods to determine what is missing in a genetic code or what can be added to change that code. Genetic linkage studies analyze the spatial arrangements of genes and chromosomes. There have also been studies to determine the legal and social and moral effects of the increase of genetic analysis. Genetic analysis may be done to identify genetic/inherited disorders and also to make a differential diagnosis in certain somatic diseases such as cancer. Genetic analyses of cancer include detection of [[mutation]]s, [[fusion gene]]s, and DNA copy number changes.

The need for a clearly defined and consistent '''invasion biology terminology''' has been acknowledged by many sources. ''[[Invasive species]]'', or ''invasive [[Introduced species|exotics]]'', is a nomenclature term and categorization phrase used for flora and fauna, and for specific restoration-preservation processes in native [[habitat]]s. ''Invasion biology'' is the study of these organisms and the processes of species invasion. 

The terminology in this page contains definitions for invasion biology terms in common usage today, taken from accessible publications.  References for each definition are included.  Terminology relates primarily to invasion biology terms with some [[ecology]] terms included to clarify language and phrases on linked pages.

==Introduction==
Definitions of "invasive non-indigenous species have been inconsistent", which has led to confusion both in literature and in popular publications (Williams and Meffe 2005).  Also, many scientists and managers feel that there is no firm definition of non-indigenous species, native species, exotic species, "and so on, and ecologists do not use the terms consistently." (Shrader-Frechette 2001)  Another question asked is whether current language is likely to promote "effective and appropriate action" towards invasive species through cohesive language (Larson 2005).  Biologists today spend more time and effort on invasive species work because of the rapid spread, economic cost, and effects on ecological systems, so the importance of effective communication about invasive species is clear. (Larson 2005)

Controversy in invasion biology terms exists because of past usage and because of preferences for certain terms.  Even for biologists, defining a [[species]] as native may be far from being a straightforward matter of biological classification based on the location or the discipline a biologist is working in (Helmreich 2005).  Questions often arise as to what exactly makes a species native as opposed to non-native, because some non-native species have no known negative effects (Woods and Moriarty 2001).  Natural biological invasions, generally considered range expansions, and introductions involving human activities are important and could be considered a normal ecological process (Vermeij 2005).  Non-native and native species may be sometimes considered invasive, and these invasions often follow human-induced landscape changes, with subsequent damage to existing landscapes a value judgment (Foster and Sandberg 2004).  As a result, many important terms relevant to invasion biology, such as invasive, weed, or transient, include qualities that are "open to subjective interpretation" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Sometimes one species can have both beneficial and detrimental effects, such as the [[Mosquito fish]] (''Gambusia affinis''), which has been widely introduced because of its suppression of larval [[mosquito]]es, although it also has negative impacts on native species of insects, fish and amphibians (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).

The large number and current complexity of terms makes interpretation of some of the invasion biology literature challenging and intimidating.  Exotic, alien, transplanted, introduced, non-indigenous, and invasive are all words that have been used to describe plants and animals that have been moved beyond their native ranges by humans (Williams and Meffe 2005), along with other terms such as foreign, injurious, aquatic nuisance, pest, non-native, all with a particular implication.  Even the use of what seem to be simple, basic terms to articulate ecological concepts "can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Attempts to redefine commonly used terms in invasion biology have been difficult because many authors and biologists are particular to a favorite definition (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Also, the status and identification of any species as an invader, a weed, or an exotic are "conditioned by cultural and political circumstances." (Robbins 2004)

==Terminology==
Where words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics.

:;Alien species (See [[Introduced species]]): Less commonly used in scientific literature but often included in ''population'' publications, public information displays, and educational literature. This term refers to ''species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread; similar terms include ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

:;[[Aquatic nuisance species]]: Less commonly used in most literature. 1. A ''nonindigenous species'' that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the [[ecological stability]] of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural or recreational activities dependent on such waters (EPA 1990). 2. Aquatic ''species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans (Heutte and Bella 2003). 3. An aquatic ''species'' with adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. ''species'' that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). 

:;Biological control or biocontrol (See [[Biological pest control]]): 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others. Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of ''pests'' or ''weeds''. Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the ''pest species'', whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby 1998). 2. The release of one ''species'' to control another (Carlton 2001). 3. The management of ''weeds'' using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Biological invasion]] or [[bioinvasion]]: A broad term for both human-assisted introductions and natural range expansions (Carlton 2001).

:;Biological diversity (See [[biodiversity]]): Used to describe ''species'' richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998).

:;[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]]: An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). 

:;[[Ecosystem]]: A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Endemism|Endemic]]: A ''species'' or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic region because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this ''species'' is said to be endemic to the region (Allaby 1998).

:;Exotic species (See [[Introduced species]]): This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms ''alien species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). Other definitions include: 1. An ''introduced'', ''non native species'', or a ''species'' that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the ''species'' by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994). 2. In North America, often refers to those ''species'' not present in a ''bioregion'' before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988). 

:;[[Fauna]]: The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

:;Foreign species (See [[Introduced species]]): A species introduced to a new area or country. Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species''. 

:;[[Flora]]: Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998).

:;[[Injurious species]]: An ''introduced species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans. Similar terms include ''aquatic nuisance species'', ''noxious weed'', and ''invasive species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Intentional introduction]]: A ''species'' that is brought to a new area, country, or bioregion for a specific purpose, such as for a garden or lawn; a crop species; a landscaping ''species''; a ''species'' that provides food; a groundcover ''species''; for soil stabilization or hydrological control; for aesthetics or familiarity of the ''species''; or other purposeful reasons (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Introduced species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. This terms means those ''species'' that have been transported by human activities, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a region in which they did not occur in historical time and are now reproducing in the wild (Carlton 2001). Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''non indigenous specie''s, and ''non native species''.

:;[[Ecological_facilitation#Invasibility|Invasibility]]: The ease with which a ''habitat'' is invaded (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;Invasion (See [[Introduced species]] and [[Invasive species]]): The expansion of a ''species'' into an area not previously occupied by it (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Invasive species]]: Generally, this term refers to a subset of plants or animals that are introduced to an area, survive, and reproduce, and expand beyond the original area of introduction. This is the biological definition. Practical definitions add that they cause harm economically or environmentally within the new area of introduction. 1. An ''alien species'' whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Executive Order 1999). 2. An adjective for ''non native'' or ''nonindigenous species'' that have colonized natural areas; 3. Discrimination of ''nonindigenous species'' established in cultivated ''habitats'' (as ‘noninvasive’) from those established in natural ''habitats''; 4. ''Nonindigenous species'' that are widespread; or 5. Widespread ''nonindigenous species'' that have adverse effects on the invaded ''habitat'' (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Other definitions include the following: 5. ''Species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 6. ''Species'' that displace ''native species'' and have the ability to dominate an ecosystem, or a species that enters an ecosystem beyond its natural range and causes economic or environmental harm (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

:;[[Integrated Pest Management]]: IPM focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of ''pests''. The integrated approach to ''weed'' management incorporates the best suited cultural, biological and chemical controls that have minimum impact on the environment and on people (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Manual control]]: Removal that involves the use of tools such as shovels, axes, rakes, grubbing hoes, and hand clippers to expose, cut, and remove flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, and/or roots from target plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Mechanical control]]: Removal that involves the use of motorized equipment such as mowers, “weed-whackers”, and tractor-mounted plows, disks, and sweepers. Burning is also categorized here (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Native range]]: The ecosystem that a ''species'' inhabits (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;Native species (See [[Indigenous (ecology)]]): 1. A synonym for ''indigenous species'' 2. A ''species'' that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005). 3. In North America, a ''species'' established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)

:;[[Native weed]] ([[invasive native]]): A ''species'' that is native to an area or ''bioregion'' that has increased in number dramatically. In cases of ''disturbance'' or change to a landscape, a ''ruderal species'' can increase in cover and compete with other native plants, threatening the diversity of a community. In other cases, landscape level changes can cause the increase of the ''population'' of a ''species'', such as white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the United State, which are at the highest levels historically and cause damage to humans, crops, and structures, suffer high disease levels, and pose threats to humans through interactions on roads (Foster and Sandberg 2004).

:;Naturalized species (See [[Introduced species]]): 1. A ''species'' that was originally introduced from a different country, a different ''bioregion'', or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''non native species'' that forms self-sustaining ''populations'' but is not necessarily an ''invasive species'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Neobiota]]: An umbrella term for the entirety of all non-native species, independently of their taxonomic rank, naturalization status or time of introduction, without defining these by a negation (non-native) or by an evaluative approach (Kowarik 2002.  

:;[[Niche opportunity]]: Defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space (Shea and Chesson 2002).

:;[[Nonindigenous species]]: This is a common term used along with ''non native species'' and ''introduced species'' in current literature and publications; other similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. 1. Any ''species'' or other viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including any such organism transferred from one country into another (EPA 1990). 2. A plant or animal that is not native to the area in which it occurs which was either intentionally or unintentionally introduced (Williams and Meffe 2005). 

:;[[Non native species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal ''species'' that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. Similar terms also include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. This term has also been defined as: 1. A ''species'' whose presence is due to ''intentional'' or ''unintentional introduction'' as a result of human activity (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. A ''species'' that has been introduced to an area or ''bioregion'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

:;[[Noxious weed]]: This term is frequently a legal term in state code, denoting a special status of the plant as, for example, ''prohibited'' or ''restricted''. 1. Native or non-native plants, or plant products, that injure or cause damage to interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, public health, or the environment (Heutte and Bella 2003). 2. Implies a ''species''’ adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). 3. Any ''species'' of plants, either annual, biennial, or perennial; reproduced by seed, root, underground stem, or bulblet; which when established is or may become destructive and difficult to control by ordinary means of cultivation or other farm practices (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

:;Pathway (See Path): 1. Used to mean ''vector'', purpose (the reason why a ''species'' is moved), and route (the geographic corridor from one point to another) (Carlton 2001). 2. Mode by which a ''species'' establishes and continues to exist in a new environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Pest (organism)|Pest]]: 1. An animal that competes with humans by consuming or damaging food, fiber, or other materials intended for human consumption or use, such as an insect consuming a cropfield (Allaby 1998) 2. Synonymous to ''invasive species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

:;[[Pesticide]]: A chemical or biological agent intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate plant or animal life and any substance intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, including insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, herbicides, nematocides, and biocides (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Population]]: A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same ''species'' found in the same place at the same time (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Prohibited weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may not be brought into a state (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Restricted weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may only be brought into a state in limited quantities (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Ruderal species]]: A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground. Ruderals are often ''weeds'' which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition. See also ''native weed or invasive native'' (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Soil seed bank|Seed bank]]: Seeds that become incorporated into the soil (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Species]]: A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below genus; the basic unit of biological classification, defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Tens rule]]: 1. Describes how approximately ten percent of ''species'' pass through each transition from being imported to becoming ''casual'' to becoming established, and finally becoming a ''weed'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. Ten percent of the ''introduced species'' establish themselves in the non native continent and ten percent of these, in turn, spread or are ''pests'' although many exceptions to this rule have been noted (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

:;Time lag: 1. Time between introduction, establishment, and spread of a ''species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 2. The time between when a ''species'' is introduced and when its ''population'' growth explodes (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Unintentional introduction]]: An introduction of ''nonindigenous species'' that occurs as the result of activities other than the purposeful or intentional introduction of the ''species'' involved, such as the transport of ''nonindigenous species'' in ballast or in water used to transport fish, mollusks or crustaceans for aquaculture or other purposes (EPA 1990). 

:;Vector (See [[Vector (epidemiology)]]): The physical means or agent by which a ''species'' is transported, such as ballast water, ships’ hulls, boats, hiking boats, cars, vehicles, packing material, or soil in nursery stock (Carlton 2001). See also ''pathway''. 

:;[[Weed]]: 1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed or invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops. Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for different purposes (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''native'' or ''introduced species'' that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 3. A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1049">A '''gnome''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek:]] γνώμη ''gnome'', from γιγνώσκειν ''gignoskein'' "to know") is a type of [[saying]], especially an [[aphorism]] or a [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] designed to provide [[Education|instruction]] in a compact form (usually in the form of [[hexameter]]).

The term ''gnome'' was introduced by [[Klaus Berger (theologian)|Klaus Berger]] in the ''Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments''. He used this traditional term from the antique rhetoric and attempted to identify this rhetorical method in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, K.  1984  ''Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments'' (Heidelberg: Quelle &amp;  Meyer). 1987 Einführung in die Formgeschichte (UTB, 144; Tübingen: Franke).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gradient-index''' ('''GRIN''') '''optics''' is the branch of [[optics]] covering optical effects produced by a [[gradient]] of the [[refractive index]] of a material. Such gradual variation can be used to produce [[lens (optics)|lens]]es with flat surfaces, or lenses that do not have the [[Optical aberration|aberrations]] typical of traditional spherical lenses. Gradient-index lenses may have a refraction gradient that is spherical, axial, or radial.

== In nature ==
The [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] of the [[eye]] is the most obvious example of gradient-index optics in nature. In the [[human eye]], the [[refractive index]] of the lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Optics |last=Hecht |first=Eugene |date=1987 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |last2=Zając |first2=Alfred |isbn=978-0201116090 |edition=2nd |location=Reading, Mass. |pages=178 |oclc=13761389}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the eye to image with good resolution and low aberration at both short and long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Shirk J S, Sandrock M, Scribner D, Fleet E, Stroman R, Baer E, Hilter A. (2006) ''NRL Review'' pp 53–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of gradient index optics in nature is the common [[mirage]] of a pool of water appearing on a road on a hot day. The pool is actually an image of the sky, apparently located on the road since light rays are being [[refracted]] (bent) from their normal straight path. This is due to the variation of refractive index between the hot, less dense air at the surface of the road, and the denser cool air above it. The variation in temperature (and thus density) of the air causes a gradient in its refractive index, causing it to increase with height.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tsiboulia, A B (2003). "Gradient Index (GRIN) Lenses". In Ronald G. Driggers. ''Encyclopedia of Optical Engineering'', Volume 1. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker. 675-683. {{ISBN|9780824742508}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This index gradient causes refraction of light rays (at a shallow angle to the road) from the sky, bending them into the eye of the viewer, with their apparent location being the road's surface.

The Earth's atmosphere acts as a GRIN lens, allowing observers to see the sun for a few minutes after it is actually below the horizon, and observers can also view stars that are below the horizon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This effect also allows for observation of electromagnetic signals from satellites after they have descended below the horizon, as in [[radio occultation]] measurements.

== Applications ==
The ability of GRIN lenses to have flat surfaces simplifies the mounting of the lens, which makes them useful where many very small lenses need to be mounted together, such as in [[photocopier]]s and [[image scanner|scanner]]s. The flat surface also allows a GRIN lens to be easily fused to an [[optical fiber]], to produce [[collimated light|collimated]] output.

In imaging applications, GRIN lenses are mainly used to reduce aberrations. The design of such lenses involves detailed calculations of aberrations as well as efficient manufacture of the lenses. A number of different materials have been used for GRIN lenses including optical glasses, plastics, [[germanium]], [[zinc selenide]], and [[sodium chloride]].

Certain optical fibres ([[graded-index fiber|graded-index fibres]]) are made with a radially-varying refractive index profile; this design strongly reduces the [[dispersion (optics)|modal dispersion]] of a [[multi-mode optical fiber]]. The radial variation in refractive index allows for a sinusoidal height distribution of [[ray (optics)|rays]] within the fibre, preventing the rays from leaving the [[Core (optical fiber)|core]]. This differs from traditional optical fibres, which rely on [[total internal reflection]], in that all modes of the GRIN fibres propagate at the same speed, allowing for a higher temporal bandwidth for the fibre.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D T (1980). ''Applied Optics''. 19, 1035–1038&lt;/ref&gt;

Antireflection coatings are typically effective for narrow ranges of frequency or angle of incidence.  Graded-index materials are less constrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Jun-Chao|last2=Xiong|first2=Li-Min|last3=Fang|first3=Ming|last4=He|first4=Hong-Bo|title=Wide-angle and broadband graded-refractive-index antireflection coatings|journal=Chinese Physics B|date=2013|volume=22|issue=4|page=044201|doi=10.1088/1674-1056/22/4/044201|url=http://cpb.iphy.ac.cn/fileup/PDF/2013-4-044201.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2016|bibcode=2013ChPhB..22d4201Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
GRIN lenses are made by several techniques:
* [[Neutron]] irradiation – [[Boron]]-rich glass is bombarded with neutrons to cause a change in the boron concentration, and thus the refractive index of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;Sinai P, (1970). ''Applied Optics''. 10, 99-104&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chemical vapour deposition]] – Involving the deposition of different glass with varying refractive indexes, onto a surface to produce a cumulative refractive change.&lt;ref&gt;Keck D B and Olshansky R, "Optical Waveguide Having Optimal Index Gradient," U.S. Patent 3,904,268 (9 Sept. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Partial [[polymerisation]] – An organic [[monomer]] is partially polymerized using [[ultraviolet light]] at varying intensities to give a refractive gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Moore R S, "Plastic Optical Element Having Refractive Index Gradient," U.S. Patent 3,718,383 (Feb. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ion exchange]] – Glass is immersed into a liquid melt with [[lithium]] ions. As a result of [[diffusion]], [[sodium]] ions in the glass are partially exchanged with lithium ones, with a larger amount of exchange occurring at the edge. Thus the sample obtains a gradient material structure and a corresponding gradient of the refractive index.&lt;ref&gt;Hensler J R, "Method of Producing a Refractive Index Gradient in Glass," U.S. Patent 3,873,408 (25 Mar. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ion Stuffing – [[Phase (matter)|Phase]] separation of a specific glass causes pores to form, which can later be filled using a variety of [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s or concentration of salts to give a varying gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Mohr R K, Wilder J A, Macedo P B, and Gupta P K, in ''Digest of Topical Meeting on Gradient- index Optical Imaging Systems,'' Optical Society of America, Washington, D C (1979), paper WAL.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Direct laser writing]] – While point-by-point exposing the pre-designed structure an exposure dose is varied (scanning speed, laser power, etc.). This corresponds to spatially tunable monomer-to-polymer degree-of-conversion resulting to a different refractive index. The method is applicable to free-form micro-optical elements and multi-component optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zukauskas|first1=Albertas|last2=Matulaitiene|first2=Ieva|last3=Paipulas|first3=Domas|last4=Niaura|first4=Gedinimas|last5=Malinauskas|first5=Mangirdas|last6=Gadonas|first6=Roaldas|title=Tuning the refractive index in 3D direct laser writing lithography: towards GRIN microoptics|journal=Laser &amp; Photonics Reviews|date=2015|volume=9|issue=6|page=1863–8899|doi=10.1002/lpor.201500170|bibcode=2015LPRv....9..706Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1854, [[James Clerk Maxwell|J C Maxwell]] suggested a lens whose refractive index distribution would allow for every region of space to be sharply imaged. Known as the [[Maxwell fish-eye|''Maxwell fisheye lens'']], it involves a spherical index function and would be expected to be spherical in shape as well.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J C  (1854). ''Cambridge and Dublin Math. J.'' 8, 188&lt;/ref&gt; (Maxwell, 1854). This lens, however, is impractical to make and has little usefulness since only points on the surface and within the lens are sharply imaged and extended objects suffer from extreme aberrations.  In 1905, [[Robert W. Wood|R W Wood]] used a dipping technique creating a gelatin cylinder with a refractive index gradient that varied symmetrically with the radial distance from the axis. Disk-shaped slices of the cylinder were later shown to have plane faces with radial index distribution.  He showed that even though the faces of the lens were flat, they acted like converging and diverging lens depending on whether the index was a decreasing or increasing relative to the radial distance.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, R W (1905). ''Physical Optics'', p.&amp;nbsp;71. Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, a posthumous book of [[Rudolf Luneburg|R. K. Luneburg]] was published in which he described a [[Luneburg lens|lens]] that focuses incident parallel rays of light onto a point on the opposite surface of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R K (1964). ''Mathematical Theory of Optics''. Univ. of California Press, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; This also limits the applications of the lens because it is difficult to use it to focus visible light; however, it has some usefulness in [[microwave]] applications.

== Theory ==
An inhomogeneous gradient-index lens possesses a refractive index whose change follows the function 
&lt;math&gt;n=f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; of the coordinates of the region of interest in the medium. According to [[Fermat's principle]], the light path integral (''L''), taken along a [[Ray (optics)|ray of light]] joining any two points of a [[Optical medium|medium]], is [[Stationary process|stationary]] relative to its value for any nearby curve joining the two points. The light path integral is given by the equation
:&lt;math alt="L = \int_{S_0}^S n ds"&gt;L=\int_{S_o}^{S}n\,ds&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n'' is the refractive index and ''S'' is the arc length of the curve. If [[Cartesian coordinate]]s are used, this equation is modified to incorporate the change in arc length for a spherical gradient, to each physical dimension:
:&lt;math alt="L = \int_{S_0}^S n(x,y,z)(x'^2 + y'^2 + z'^2)^(1/2)  ds"&gt;L=\int_{S_o}^{S}n(x,y,z)\sqrt{x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}}\, ds&lt;/math&gt;
where prime corresponds to d/d''s.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gradient index optics |last=Marchland |first=Erich W. |date=1978 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0124707504 |location=New York |oclc=4497777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light path integral is able to characterize the path of light through the lens in a qualitative manner, such that the lens may be easily reproduced in the future.

The refractive index gradient of GRIN lenses can be mathematically modelled according to the method of production used. For example, GRIN lenses made from a radial gradient index material, such as [[SELFOC Microlens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flores-Arias|first=M.T.|last2=Bao|first2=C.|last3=Castelo|first3=A.|last4=Perez|first4=M.V.|last5=Gomez-Reino|first5=C.|date=2006-10-15|title=Crossover interconnects in gradient-index planar optics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0030401806005712|journal=Optics Communications|language=en|volume=266|issue=2|pages=490–494|doi=10.1016/j.optcom.2006.05.049|issn=0030-4018|via=ScienceDirect|bibcode=2006OptCo.266..490F}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a refractive index that varies according to:
:&lt;math alt="n_r = n_o (1- (Ar^2/2))"&gt;n_{r}=n_{o}\left ( 1-\frac{A r^2}{2} \right )&lt;/math&gt;, where ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the refractive index at a distance, ''r'', from the [[optical axis]]; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the design index on the optical axis, and ''A'' is a positive constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">The '''Indian National Chemistry Olympiad''' ('''INChO''' for short) is an [[Olympiad]] in [[Chemistry]] held in [[India]].

The theory part of the INChO examination is held in end-January/beginning February of every year. It is conducted by the [[Indian Association of Chemistry Teachers]]. School students (usually of standards 11, 12) first need to qualify the [[National Standard Examination in Chemistry]] (NSEC) held in November of the preceding year. Among the 30,000+ students who sit for the NSEC, only the top 1% are selected for the INChO.

About 35 students are selected from the written examination. A total of 30 students are selected from these to attend the Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), chemistry, held at [[HBCSE]], Mumbai.

Most of the students qualifying the INChO are those completing their twelfth standard. However, there have been some cases of students qualifying INChO at the end of eleventh, or tenth standard itself.

== OCSC Chemistry ==
The Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), Chemistry consists of rigorous training and testing in theory and experiment. The top four performers here are selected to represent India in the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]]. Before IChO, the selected team undergoes rigorous training in theory and experiment, in a Pre-Departure Training Camp, held in HBCSE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">The '''Institute of Archaeology''' is an [[academic department]] of the [[University of Oxford]] devoted to the teaching and research of [[archaeology]]. Together with the [[Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art]], it forms part of the [[School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|School of Archaeology]]. Its current director is [[Chris Gosden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/institute.html|title=Institute of Archaeology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origins of the Institute go back to 1946, when [[Christopher Hawkes]] was appointed Oxford's first Professor of European Prehistory and [[Ian Richmond]] the first Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire. Teaching facilities were set up for them at 36 Beaumont Street, which grew into the Institute. It was formerly founded in 1961, with Hawkes as its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/history.html|title=History of the School of Archaeology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/AW1.html|title=Prof Andrew Wilson|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond and Hawkes were succeeded by [[Sheppard Frere]] and [[Barry Cunliffe]], in respectively 1965 and 1972, who oversaw and expansion of the Institute's research and fieldwork facilities in the 1970s. Starting in 1992, Oxford introduced an bachelor's degree in anthropology and archaeology and the Institute became the focal point for undergraduate teaching in archaeology. The following year [[Margareta Steinby]] succeeded Frere as Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire. The [[Sackler Library]], situated behind the Institute, was opened in 2001. During its construction a [[Bronze Age]] [[ring ditch]]es and a medieval [[orchard]] and [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[Friary|priory]] were discovered under the foundations. [[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Andrew Wilson]] has been the Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire since 2004.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research centres==
The institute  houses three research centres: [[Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology]], Oxford Centre for Asian Archaeology, Art &amp; Culture and Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit.&lt;ref name="Research Centres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/centres.html|title=Research centres|publisher=arch.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11735">In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of pure [[mathematics]], an '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;, a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;, and the constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying certain axioms. MV-algebras are the [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]]; the letters MV refer to the [[Many-valued logic|''many-valued'' logic]] of Łukasiewicz. MV-algebras coincide with the class of bounded commutative [[BCK algebra]]s.

==Definitions==
An '''MV-algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;\langle A, \oplus, \lnot, 0\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; consisting of
* a [[empty set|non-empty]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; and
* a constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; denoting a fixed [[element (mathematics)|element]] of &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies the following [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]:
* &lt;math&gt; (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z),&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus 0 = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus y = y \oplus x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot \lnot x = x,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x \oplus \lnot 0 = \lnot 0,&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt; \lnot ( \lnot x \oplus y)\oplus y = \lnot ( \lnot y \oplus x) \oplus x.&lt;/math&gt;

By virtue of the first three axioms, &lt;math&gt;\langle A, \oplus, 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative [[monoid]]. Being defined by identities, MV-algebras form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of algebras. The variety of MV-algebras is a subvariety of the variety of [[BL (logic)|BL]]-algebras and contains all [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.

An MV-algebra can equivalently be defined (Hájek 1998) as a prelinear commutative bounded integral [[residuated lattice]] &lt;math&gt;\langle L, \wedge, \vee, \otimes, \rightarrow, 0, 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; satisfying the additional identity &lt;math&gt;x \vee y = (x \rightarrow y) \rightarrow y.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples of MV-algebras==
A simple numerical example is &lt;math&gt;A=[0,1],&lt;/math&gt; with operations &lt;math&gt;x \oplus y = \min(x+y,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot x=1-x.&lt;/math&gt; In mathematical fuzzy logic, this MV-algebra is called the ''standard MV-algebra'', as it forms the standard real-valued semantics of [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

The ''trivial'' MV-algebra has the only element 0 and the operations defined in the only possible way, &lt;math&gt;0\oplus0=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot0=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''two-element'' MV-algebra is actually the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\},&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; coinciding with Boolean disjunction and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; with Boolean negation. In fact adding the axiom &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x = x&lt;/math&gt; to the axioms defining an MV-algebra results in an axiomatization of Boolean algebras.

If instead the axiom added is &lt;math&gt;x \oplus x \oplus x = x \oplus x&lt;/math&gt;, then the axioms define the MV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; algebra corresponding to the three-valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Axiomatizations of Ln need Grigolia's axioms|date=February 2013}}. Other finite linearly ordered MV-algebras are obtained by restricting the universe and operations of the standard MV-algebra to the set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; equidistant real numbers between 0 and 1 (both included), that is, the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1/(n-1),2/(n-1),\dots,1\},&lt;/math&gt; which is closed under the operations &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; of the standard MV-algebra; these algebras are usually denoted MV&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another important example is ''Chang's MV-algebra'', consisting just of infinitesimals (with the [[order type]] &amp;omega;) and their co-infinitesimals.

Chang also constructed an MV-algebra from an arbitrary [[Linearly ordered group|totally ordered abelian group]] ''G'' by fixing a positive element ''u'' and defining the segment [0, ''u''] as { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' }, which becomes an MV-algebra with ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = min(''u'', ''x''+''y'') and ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x''. Furthermore, Chang showed that every linearly ordered MV-algebra is isomorphic to an MV-algebra constructed from a group in this way.

D. Mundici extended the above construction to abelian [[lattice-ordered group]]s. If ''G'' is such a group with strong (order) unit ''u'', then the "unit interval" { ''x'' ∈ ''G'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' } can be equipped with ¬''x'' = ''u''−''x'', ''x'' ⊕ ''y'' = ''u''∧&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; (x+y), ''x'' ⊗ ''y'' = 0∨&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''+''y''−''u''). This construction establishes a [[categorical equivalence]] between lattice-ordered abelian groups with strong unit and MV-algebras.

==Relation to Łukasiewicz logic==
[[C. C. Chang]] devised MV-algebras to study [[many-valued logic]]s, introduced by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] in 1920. In particular, MV-algebras form the [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] of [[Łukasiewicz logic]], as described below.

Given an MV-algebra ''A'', an ''A''-[[Valuation (logic)|valuation]] is a [[homomorphism]] from the algebra of [[propositional formula]]s (in the language consisting of &lt;math&gt;\oplus,\lnot,&lt;/math&gt; and 0) into ''A''. Formulas mapped to 1 (or &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;0) for all ''A''-valuations are called ''A''-[[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. If the standard MV-algebra over [0,1] is employed, the set of all [0,1]-tautologies determines so-called infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Chang's (1958, 1959) completeness theorem states that any MV-algebra equation holding in the standard MV-algebra over the interval [0,1] will hold in every MV-algebra. Algebraically, this means that the standard MV-algebra generates the variety of all MV-algebras. Equivalently, Chang's completeness theorem says that MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]], defined as the set of [0,1]-tautologies.

The way the [0,1] MV-algebra characterizes all possible MV-algebras parallels the well-known fact that identities holding in the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] hold in all possible Boolean algebras. Moreover, MV-algebras characterize infinite-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]] in a manner analogous to the way that [[Boolean algebras]] characterize classical [[two-element Boolean algebra|bivalent logic]] (see [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]).

In 1984, Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced the [[Wajsberg algebra]] as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. Wajsberg algebras and MV-algebras are isomorphic.&lt;Ref&gt;[http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf citing J. M. Font, A. J. Rodriguez, A. Torrens, "Wajsberg Algebras", ''Stochastica'', VIII, 1, 5-31, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras ===
{{expand section|the extra axioms|date=August 2014}}
In the 1940s [[Grigore Moisil]] introduced his [[Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra]]s (LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras) in the hope of giving [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] for the (finitely) ''n''-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]. However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for ''n'' ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] the Łukasiewicz ''n''-valued logic. Although C. C. Chang published his MV-algebra in 1958, it is faithful model only for the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued (infinitely-many-valued) [[Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic]]. For the axiomatically more complicated (finitely) ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by [[Revaz Grigolia]] and called MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras.&lt;ref name="Ciungu2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavinia Corina Ciungu|title=Non-commutative Multiple-Valued Logic Algebras|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-01589-7|pages=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are a subclass of LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras; the inclusion is strict for ''n'' ≥ 5.&lt;ref&gt;Iorgulescu, A.: Connections between MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras and ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras—I. Discrete Math. 181, 155–177 (1998) {{doi|10.1016/S0012-365X(97)00052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are MV-algebras which satisfy some additional axioms, just like the ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics have additional axioms added to the ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-valued logic.

In 1982 [[Roberto Cignoli]] published some additional constraints that added to LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are proper models for ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery ''proper ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz algebras''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cignoli, Proper n-Valued Łukasiewicz Algebras as S-Algebras of Łukasiewicz ''n''-Valued Propositional Calculi, Studia Logica, 41, 1982, 3-16, {{doi|10.1007/BF00373490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LM&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras that are also MV&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebras are precisely Cignoli’s proper n-valued Łukasiewicz algebras.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.univagora.ro/download/pdf/28.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to functional analysis==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
MV-algebras were related by [[Daniele Mundici]] to [[approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebra]]s by establishing a bijective correspondence between all isomorphism classes of AF C*-algebras with lattice-ordered dimension group and all isomorphism classes of countable MV algebras. Some instances of this correspondence include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Countable MV algebra !! AF C*-algebra
|-
| {0, 1} || ℂ
|-
| {0, 1/''n'', ..., 1 } || M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(ℂ), i.e. ''n''×''n'' complex matrices
|-
| finite || finite-dimensional
|-
| boolean || commutative
|}

There are multiple frameworks implementing fuzzy logic (type II), and most of them implement what has been called a '''multi-adjoint logic'''. This is no more than the implementation of a MV-algebra.

The death of a mother during [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]] or [[Postnatal|puerperium]] is a tragic event. The chances of a child surviving such an extreme birth are compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://apha.confex.com/apha/131am/techprogram/paper_62489.htm | author=Uhler SA | title=Impact of a mother’s death on child health and survival in Haiti | date=November 13, 2003 | accessdate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fictional literature the death of a pregnant or delivering mother is a powerful device: it removes one character and places the surviving child into an often hostile environment which has to be overcome. 

==Literature==

* In [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', the author ridicules the convention of heroines having mothers who die in childbirth, by beginning the novel: "No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother... were all equally against her... Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on."
* In [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'',  [[Catherine Earnshaw]] goes into early labor and dies after giving birth to her daughter, [[Catherine Linton]].

Years later, Apu eventually acknowledges Kajal as his son and takes responsibility for his upbringing. It is based on the 1932 Bengali novel ''Aparajito''.
* In the motion picture ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' (1998), the antagonist Don Rafael Montero, enemy of Don Diego de la Vega, lied that Esperanza de la Vega died in childbirth, but Esperanza de la Vega was actually gunned down instead. Then Montero raised her daughter Elena.
* In the science fiction film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997), a woman died giving birth to the film's protagonist Eleanor Ann "Ellie" Arroway, portrayed by actress [[Jodie Foster]]. Arroway's father died when she was nine years old.

=== Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium ===
[[File:Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts Belgique 1101.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The Museums’ collections trace the history of the visual arts – painting, sculpture and drawing – from the 15th to the 21st centuries. They preserve the works of the [[Flemish primitives|Flemish Primitives]], of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jacques Jordaens]], [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[James Ensor]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[René Magritte]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Jan Fabre]] and many others. This jewel among Belgium's cultural institutions comprises several entities: the [[Oldmasters Museum|Musée Old Masters Museum]], the Musée Modern Museum, the [[Wiertz Museum|Musée Wiertz Museum]] and the [[Constantin Meunier|Musée Meunier Museum]], the [[Magritte Museum|Musée Magritte Museum]] and the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum]].

Michel Draguet repositioned the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] nationally as well as internationally through a redeployment of the collection focused on the specificity of Belgian creation as well as on the particularity of Belgian reception of European creation.

In 2009, he created the [[Magritte Museum]] with, for the first time in Belgium, a private-public partnership (with [[Engie|GDF-Suez]]) on competencies. The selection of works exhibited in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is constantly expanding with a changing selection of external loans. With the support of Belgian and foreign museums as well as private collectors, works are being made available that have previously never been exhibited. The visitor can thus discover many treasures that are still in private possession. Since its creation, this museum, measuring 2500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has welcomed more than two million visitors and thus contributed to the economic and cultural development of the Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/ripostes/brandir-l-importance-economique-de-la-culture-pour-la-defendre-544aa05a3570fe7cfbf80d01|title=Brandir l'importance économique de la culture pour la défendre ?|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-05-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magritte Museum]] has already received 8 nominations and prizes. Every year more than 300,000 visitors come here from all over the world to discover the life and the works of [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/uploads/pages/files/magritte_museum_key_figures_2009_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BRX-musée-magritte.3.JPG|alt=Magritte Museum|thumb|277x277px|Magritte Museum]]
In 2013, Michel Draguet inaugurated the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Fin-de-siècle Museum]] as first chapter of a new conception of a museum of Modern Art. Famous visual artists like [[Constantin Meunier]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Léon Spilliaert]] and [[George Minne|Georges Minne]] testify to the effervescent activity of this period, reflected also in all other creative fields: literature, opera, music, architecture, photography and poetry ([[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Émile Verhaeren|Emile Verhaeren]], [[Octave Maus]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Henry van de Velde|Henry Van de Velde]], [[Maurice Kufferath]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]] and others). [[Art Nouveau]] architecture is evoked by means of a 3D reconstruction of six buildings Art Nouveau. This was the first introduction of new technologies inside de Museum. Located at the heart of Brussels, where between 1884 and 1914 the exhibitions of ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esthétique'' made the city one of the artistic capitals of the late 19th century, this museum is distinguished by its multidisciplinary nature, through a partnership formed with the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], the [[La Monnaie|Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], [[Cinematek]], the [[Bibliotheca Wittockiana]], the [[King Baudouin Foundation]] and the [[Brussels Capital Region]] for housing the Gillion Crowet collection, which is one of the museum's highlights.The [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum]], which was applauded internationally when it opened,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/belgique-bruxelles-s-offre-un-musee-fin-de-siecle-06-12-2013-1765553_3.php&lt;/ref&gt; welcomed 170,000 visitors during its first operating year.

Michel Draguet also initiate a highly popular yet challenging exhibition program from ancient masters to contemporary art mounting up to eight major shows per year. The quality and quantity of this program has been supported by a renewing strategy to the public in its diversity. In this way, Draguet initiate “Museum on measure”: a program dedicated to fragilized public supported by charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.article27.be/IMG/pdf/accompagner_les_publics_socialement_fragilises_au_musees_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the educational services have developed a range of new activities and the social programs have been extended. This is a result of the increase in partnerships between the public and private sectors .

Among the highlights of the programme have been large exhibitions such as “Art Nouveau Bing”, “Rubens in Brussels”, “CoBrA”, “Alechinsky”, “Leon Spilliaert” “Jordaens and Antiquity”, “The Flemish Primitives in  Brussels”, “Andres Serrano”, “Marc Chagall”, “Kandinsky and Europe”, “Symbolism in Belgium” and “Stanley Kubrick Photographer”. Michel Draguet introduced also a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats with from small “cabinet exhibitions” on such artists Pierre Lahaut, [[Jules Schmalzigaug]], [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], and others. He placed permanent installation of contemporary artist inside the [[Oldmasters Museum|OldMasters]] department like [[David Altmejd]] or [[Jan Fabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/the-collection|title=The collection – Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|website=www.fine-arts-museum.be|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years now, the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]  has been the most popular art institution in Belgium. In 2015, the Museum had its best attended year so far with a total of 767.355 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor-Figures-2015-LO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. From 2005 until 2017, the number of visitors has doubled and the turnover tripled, thereby reducing the State contribution from 54.4% of the global budget to 32%. And this has been achieved during a period of very severe budgetary cuts: 11% in 2013 and 2014, 30% for the period 2015-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/michel-draguet-reconduit-la-direction-des-musees-royaux-des-beaux-arts-de-belgique-132655|title=Michel Draguet reconduit à la direction des Musées royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique - 28 avril 2017 - lejournaldesarts.fr|website=Le Journal Des Arts|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online and digital outreach of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is considered as pioneer. In this perspective, Draguet initiated the ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' project which allows members of the public to delve into the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] († Brussels, 1569). While the artist and his paintings are instantly recognizable worldwide, every composition also depicts a whole host of characters - some surprising, others familiar - and vignettes that provide the subtext of history, which are masterpieces worthy of exploration in their own right.

Drawing on a wide spectrum of virtual and on-site experiences, this unique initiative offers everyone the chance to immerse themselves in Bruegel’s works by honing in on the details of each painting and accessing expert knowledge. By delving deeper into the artist’s world, the viewer will discover the unexpected elements in Bruegel’s works which constitute the pinnacle of the Flemish master’s craft. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] launched this project jointly with the [[Google Cultural Institute]] in anticipation of the 450thanniversary of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]’s death, in 2019. The project brings together major international museums, many of which are European, around the focal figure of Bruegel the Elder. This innovative concept is the fruit of in-depth thinking on current transformations in the field of museology as it adapts to the digital era.

The ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' virtual exhibitions' can be accessed on the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]’s interactive screens, on their mobile app and on the [[Google Cultural Institute]] platform.

=== Royal Museums of Art and History ===
[[File:Park of the Cinquantenaire - Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels, 2010 (HDR 1).jpg|thumb|339x339px|Royal Museums of Art and History of Belgium]]
From 1st August 2010 till 28 February 2014, Michel Draguet was designated temporary Director-General of the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This entity includes the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Museum of Antiquities]], the Museum of Non-European Civilizations, the Museum of the Decorative Arts, the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower, [[Halle Gate]], and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]].

He was charged to manage this institution, which was then in crisis, to overhaul its accounts and structure. Under his leading, the museum put together a restructuring plan that, starting with the merging of the support staff, created enough flexibility to allow modernization of the administrative organizations of both entities – the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]] and [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]].

Michel Draguet initiated a large project of redeployment of both institutions. The home of the former would house collections of a more universalist nature, on the model of the [[Louvre]] and [[British Museum]], and that of the latter would offer a more “national” foundation that broadens to embrace a European dynamic comprising the very future of Brussels as the capital of what is today a common space. From there came the idea of redeploying the collections in accordance with two guidelines: first, to bring the federal collections together in one place; second, to develop theme-based museums that complement rather than compete with one another.

Together the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]] and [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Art and History]] welcome more than 1.1 million visitors a year: this is the equivalent of the population of Brussels. Merged, the two institutions would increase their attractiveness to the public: by reorganizing the presentation of the collections between the different institutions; by creating poles of scientific excellence based on the strong points of the collections; by creating new museum entities that offer a new dimension for marketing the city of Brussels; and by rationalizing the teams and practices employed. For the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], the entities proposed are as follows : a Museum of Non-European Civilizations, which would initially be a world museum through the eyes of Europeans, on the basis of which a new intercultural dialogue could be initiated; a Museum of Antiquities as a platform for the European identity; and a Museum of Music that will broaden the perspectives of the current [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]]. Plus a few heritage assets – the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower and [[Halle Gate]] – which contribute to the attractiveness of the city.

His plan for redeployment of both the collections and personnel that would culminate in the fusion of the two entities was discussed at the Belgian Parliament in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Without initiative from the politics and considering that his Secretary of State was not supporting the reforme led by him and by the Chairman of [[BELSPO|Belspo]] [http://plus.wikimonde.com/wiki/Philippe_Mettens Philippe Mettens], Michel Draguet decided to step down in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml|title=La Chambre des représentants de Belgique|website=www.dekamer.be|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3934">'''Nutrition analysis''' refers to the process of determining the [[nutrition]]al content of [[food]]s and food products.  The process can be performed through a variety of certified methods.

==Methods==
===Laboratory analysis===
Traditionally, food companies would send food samples to laboratories for physical testing. 
Typical analysis includes:
Moisture (water) by loss of mass at 102 °C,
Protein by analysis of total nitrogen, either by Dumas or Kjeldahl methods,
Total fat, traditionally by a solvent extraction, but often now by secondary methods such as NMR,
[[Crude ash]] (total inorganic matter) by combustion at 550C,
Estimated dietary fibre by various AOAC methods such as 985.29,
Sodium (and thereby Salt) either by flame photometry, AA or ICP-OES,
Total sugars, normally by a liquid chromatography technique, such as IC-HPAED or HPLC-RI,
Fatty acids by GC-FID,
Carbohydrates and energy values are normally calculated from these analytical values.

===Software===
Software is available as an alternative to laboratory nutrition analysis.  This software typically utilizes a database of ingredients that have previously been laboratory tested.  The user can input ingredient data by matching their ingredients to ingredients found in the database; the analysis can then be calculated.

===Online nutrition analysis===
In recent years, web-based nutrition analysis software services have become more popular. Online nutrition analysis allows users to access online databases and draw from certified ingredients to produce instant nutrition information.

===Turnkey nutrition analysis services===
Another emerging trend is the use of nutritional analysis services that do a complete analysis of any recipe by using their proprietary database.  Users provide recipes, cooking methods and serving sizes.  In turn, the service provides a complete nutritional analysis.

==Applications==
In the United States, nutrition information is required on packaged retail foods in the form of nutrition facts panels as a result of [[food labeling regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/default.htm Food Labeling and Nutrition Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many restaurants have begun posting nutrition information as a result of both customer demand and menu-labeling laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/business/mcdonalds-to-start-posting-calorie-counts.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition facts label===
{{main|Nutrition facts label}}

===Menu-labeling===
The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], signed into law March 23, 2010, includes a provision that creates a national, uniform nutrition-disclosure standard for food service establishments.

The nutrition-disclosure provision requires chain restaurants, similar retail food establishments and vending machines with 20 or more locations to provide specific nutrition labeling information. Those establishments must post calories on menus, menu boards and drive-thru boards. Buffets, salad bars and other self-service items are also included and will be required to provide caloric information adjacent to the item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/NutritionPolicy/Pages/MenuLabeling.aspx Issue Update:Menu Labeling ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently many state and local menu-labeling laws have been passed requiring restaurants to post nutrition information on menus and menu boards, or have it readily available upon customer request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/menulabeling/ Center for Science in the Public Interest]&lt;/ref&gt; Restaurants have had to perform nutrition analysis in order to generate nutrition information and conform to these laws. More recently national legislation has been introduced that would set a national standard for menu labeling, the most popular of which is the [[LEAN act]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''PAL-S''' is the system of television receiver sets in the early days of PAL system. Here '''PAL''' stands for '''''Phase alternating at line rate''''' and '''S''' stands for '''''simple'''''.

== PAL system ==

 {{main|PAL}}

The color hue modulates the phase of a subcarrier named [[chrominance subcarrier|color carrier]]. In PAL system the polarity of the phase in each frame is reversed to neutralize the undesirable phase shifts introduced during transmission. Thus the effect of undesirable phase shift is positive in one frame and negative in the second frame. Averaging the two, the effect of the undesirable phase shifts in two consecutive frames cancel each other.

In the early days of the PAL system, it was proposed that, the human eye can average the slightly different color hues in two consecutive frames and perceive the original color. The television receiver sets which rely on optical averaging were called PAL-S receivers. 

== The problems in PAL-S ==

{{main|Hanover bars}}

However, it soon turned out that the optical averaging had problems. When the distance between the viewer and the receiver set is not large,  the viewer can distinguish the lines. The phase reversion takes place in  every frame. But each frame is composed of two fields. So the viewer watches two consecutive lines without reversion. The next two lines are reverted phase lines. That means that when there is undesired phase shift the viewer watches a thin horizontal bar with one color and another thin bar with another color. This pattern is known as Hanover bar.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J.King:''Beginner’s Guide to Color Television'', Newness Technical Book, London, 1978; {{ISBN|0-408-00101-1}}, p 69-71 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic averaging ==

In the standard analogue PAL receiver, the color differences between the consecutive bars are  averaged electronically (by the use of delay line). This system is known as '''PAL-D'''.

The '''Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System''' (PacIOOS) is a nonprofit association and one of eleven such associations in the U.S. [[Integrated Ocean Observing System]], funded in part by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).&lt;ref name = pacioos.org/&gt;&lt;ref name="KhorramWiele2016"/&gt;

The PacIOOS area covers eight time zones,&lt;ref name="KhorramWiele2016"/&gt; and 2300 individual islands associated with the U.S.&lt;ref name = ioos.noaa.gov/&gt;  Observation priorities are public safety, direct economic value, and environmental preservation.&lt;ref name="KhorramWiele2016"/&gt;  Among ocean characteristics reported are:&lt;ref name = pacioos.org/&gt;
* Currents forecast
* Shoreline impacts such as high sea level
* Buoy water characteristics including salinity, turbidity, and temperature

The PacIOOS website is hosted by the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], and provides interactive graphs and map viewers.&lt;ref name = phys.org/&gt;

[[File:Cyperus scapes IMG 5322p.JPG|thumb|''Cyperus'' scapes. Contrast with peduncle of ''Agave'']]
In [[botany]], a '''peduncle''' is a stem supporting an [[inflorescence]], or after [[fecundation]], an [[infructescence]].&lt;ref name= "ShastriV"&gt;Shashtri, Varun. Dictionary of Botany. Publisher: Isha Books 2005. {{ISBN|978-8182052253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peduncle is a [[Plant stem|stem]], usually green, though some peduncles are more or less florally colored or neutral in color, having no particular pigmentation. In some species, peduncles are leafless, though others bear small leaves, or even [[cataphyll]]s, at nodes; such leaves generally may be regarded as [[bract]]s.  The peduncle is the inflorescence base without flowers. When an unbranched peduncle has no obvious nodes, rises directly from a bulb or stem, and especially if it rises apparently directly from the ground, it commonly is referred to as a [[Scape (botany)|scape]].&lt;ref name= "ShastriV"/&gt;

The [[acorn]]s of the [[pedunculate oak]] are borne on a long peduncle, hence the name of the tree.

[[Image:Satellite image of Noordoostpolder, Netherlands (5.78E 52.71N).png|thumb|right|[[Satellite imagery|Satellite image]] of [[Noordoostpolder]], [[Netherlands]] (595.41&amp;nbsp;km²)]] 

A '''polder''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpɔldər|-|Nl-polder.ogg}}) is a low-lying tract of land enclosed by [[dike (construction)|dikes]] that form an artificial [[hydrology|hydrological]] entity, meaning it has no connection with outside water other than through manually operated devices. There are three types of polder:
# [[Land reclamation|Land reclaimed]] from a body of water, such as a lake or the [[sea|sea bed]]
# [[Flood plain]]s separated from the sea or river by a dike
# [[Marshes]] separated from the surrounding water by a dike and subsequently drained; these are also known as ''[[koog]]s'' especially in Germany

The ground level in drained marshes [[Subsidence|subsides]] over time. All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and water pressure of [[ground water]], or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or drained by opening [[sluice]]s at [[low tide]]. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of [[peat]] (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. 
 
Polders are at risk from flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the [[muskrat]] is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former [[fen]]lands and coastal areas.

Flooding of polders has also been used as a military tactic in the past. One example is the flooding of the polders along the [[Yser]] river during [[World War I]]. Opening the sluices at high tide and closing them at low tide turned the polders into an inaccessible swamp which allowed the Allied armies to stop the German army.

==Etymology==
From [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''polder'' ("polder"), from [[Middle Dutch]] ''polre'', from [[Old Dutch]] ''polra'', ultimately from ''pol-'' "part of land, elevated above its surroundings"; with [[augmentative]] suffix ''-er'' and [[Epenthesis|epenthetical]] '' -d-''.

==Polders and the Netherlands==
[[Image:Gemaal de Leyens.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Pumping station in [[Zoetermeer]], [[Netherlands]]. The polder lies lower than the surrounding water on the other side of the dike. The [[Archimedes' screw]]s are clearly visible.]] 
The [[Netherlands]] is frequently associated with polders, as its engineers became noted for developing techniques to drain wetlands and make them usable for agriculture and other development. This is illustrated by the saying: "God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=3HjRCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=origin+of+phrase+%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.&amp;q=%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.#v=snippet&amp;q=%22God%20created%20the%20world%2C%20but%20the%20Dutch%20created%20the%20Netherlands%22.&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;". 

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 ''polders''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/rws/waterinnovatiebron/cgi-bin/toonlijst.pl?config=config&amp;var=volgnr&amp;val=1&amp;layout=index-forceframe&amp;confignr=1&amp;menu=1067260347&amp;menuitem=1120115781| publisher=Rijkswaterstaat| title=''Kijk naar de geschiedenis''| accessdate=2008-01-21}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; nationwide. By 1961 {{convert|6800|sqmi}}, about half of the country's land, was reclaimed from the sea.&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half the total surface area of ''polders'' in north-west Europe is in the Netherlands. The first [[embankment dam|embankments]] in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century. 

As a result of flooding disasters, [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]s called ''waterschap'' (when situated more inland) or ''hoogheemraadschap'' (near the sea, mainly used in the [[Holland]] region)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=waterschap|url = http://www.waterschappen.nl/mijn-waterschap.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142234/http://www.waterschappen.nl/|archivedate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were set up to maintain the integrity of the water defences around polders, maintain the waterways inside a polder, and control the various water levels inside and outside the polder. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such they are the oldest democratic institution in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain polder integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way politics]]—the ''[[Polder Model]]''.

The [[North Sea flood of 1953|1953 flood disaster]] prompted a new approach to the design of dikes and other water-retaining structures, based on an acceptable probability of overflowing. Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequences. The potential damage in lives, property and rebuilding costs is compared to the potential cost of water defences. From these calculations follows an acceptable flood risk from the sea at one in 4,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years, while it is one in 100–2,500&amp;nbsp;years for a river flood. The particular established policy guides the Dutch government to improve flood defences as new data on threat levels becomes available. 

Some famous Dutch polders and the year they were laid dry are:
* [[Beemster]] (1609-1612)
* [[Schermer]] (1633-1635)
* [[Haarlemmermeerpolder]] (1852)
* As part of the [[Zuiderzee Works]]:
** [[Wieringermeerpolder]] (1930)
** [[Noordoostpolder]] (1942)
** [[Flevopolder]] (1956-1966)

== Examples of polders ==
===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh has 123 polders, of which 49 are sea-facing. These were constructed in the 1960s to protect the coast from tidal flooding and reduce salinity incursion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/98292/bangladesh-polders-under-threat "Bangladesh polders under threat"], Irin News&lt;/ref&gt; They reduce long-term flooding and waterlogging following [[storm surge]]s from [[tropical cyclone]]s. They are also cultivated for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ "Bangladeshi project to enhance polders amidst climate woes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408091108/http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ |date=2014-04-08 }}, Unearth News&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24394">'''Predicate transformer semantics''' were introduced by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] in his seminal paper "[[Guarded commands|Guarded commands, nondeterminacy and formal derivation of programs]]". They define the semantics of an [[imperative programming]] paradigm by assigning to each ''statement'' in this language a corresponding ''predicate transformer'': a [[total function]] between two ''[[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]]'' on the state space of the statement. In this sense, predicate transformer semantics are a kind of [[denotational semantics]]. Actually, in [[guarded commands]], Dijkstra uses only one kind of predicate transformer: the well-known '''weakest preconditions''' (see below).

Moreover, predicate transformer semantics are a reformulation of [[Floyd–Hoare logic]]. Whereas Hoare logic is presented as a [[deductive system]], predicate transformer semantics (either by '''weakest-preconditions''' or by '''strongest-postconditions''' see below) are '''complete strategies''' to build [[Deductive reasoning|valid deductions]] of Hoare logic. In other words, they provide an effective [[algorithm]] to reduce the problem of verifying a Hoare triple to the problem of proving a [[First-order logic|first-order formula]]. Technically, predicate transformer semantics perform a kind of [[symbolic execution]] of statements into predicates: execution runs ''backward'' in the case of weakest-preconditions, or runs ''forward'' in the case of strongest-postconditions.

== Weakest preconditions ==
=== Definition ===
Given a  ''statement'' ''S'', the '''weakest-precondition''' of ''S'' is a
function mapping any [[postcondition]] ''R'' to a [[precondition]] ''P''. Actually,  the result of this function, denoted &lt;math&gt;wp(S, R)&lt;/math&gt;, is the "weakest" precondition on the initial state ensuring that execution of ''S'' terminates in a final state satisfying ''R''.

More formally, let us use variable ''x'' to denote ''abusively'' the [[tuple]] of variables involved in statement ''S''. Then, a given ''Hoare triple'' &lt;math&gt;\{ P \} S \{ R \}&lt;/math&gt; is provable in [[Hoare logic]] for '''total correctness''' if and only if the first-order predicate below holds:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x, P \Rightarrow wp(S,R)&lt;/math&gt;

Formally, weakest-preconditions are defined recursively over the [[abstract syntax]] of statements. Actually, weakest-precondition semantics is a [[continuation-passing style]] semantics of state transformers where the predicate in parameter is a continuation.

=== Skip ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{skip},R) \ =\ R&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Abort ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{abort},R) \ =\ \textbf{false}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Assignment ===
We give below two equivalent weakest-preconditions for the assignment statement. In these formulas, &lt;math&gt;R[x \leftarrow E]&lt;/math&gt; is a copy of ''R'' where [[Free variables and bound variables|free occurrences]] of ''x'' are replaced by ''E''. Hence, here, expression ''E'' is implicitly coerced into a ''valid term'' of the underlying logic: it is thus a ''pure'' expression, totally defined, terminating and without side effect. 
* version 1:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt; wp(x := E, R)\ =\ \forall y, y = E \Rightarrow R[x \leftarrow y]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''y'' is a fresh variable (representing the final value of variable ''x'')
|} 
* version 2:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt; wp(x := E, R)\ =\ R[x \leftarrow E] &lt;/math&gt; 
|}

The first version avoids a potential duplication of ''E'' in ''R'', whereas the second version is simpler when there is at most a single occurrence of ''x'' in ''R''. The first version also reveals a deep duality between weakest-precondition and strongest-postcondition (see below).

An example of a valid calculation of ''wp'' (using version 2) for assignments with integer valued variable ''x'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
wp(x := x - 5, x &gt; 10) &amp; = &amp; x - 5 &gt; 10 \\
                       &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; x &gt; 15 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that in order for the postcondition ''x &gt; 10'' to be true after the assignment, the precondition ''x &gt; 15'' must be true before the assignment.  This is also the "weakest precondition", in that it is the "weakest" restriction on the value of ''x'' which makes ''x &gt; 10'' true after the assignment.

=== Sequence ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(S_1;S_2,R)\ =\ wp(S_1,wp(S_2,R))&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[t]{rcl} wp(x:=x-5;x:=x*2\ ,\ x&gt;20) &amp; = &amp; wp(x:=x-5,wp(x:=x*2, x &gt; 20))\\ 
  &amp; = &amp; wp(x:=x-5,x*2 &gt; 20)\\
  &amp; = &amp; (x-5)*2 &gt; 20\\
  &amp; = &amp; x &gt; 15
  \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conditional ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{if}\ E\ \textbf{then}\ S_1\ \textbf{else}\ S_2\ \textbf{end},R)\ =\ (E \Rightarrow wp(S_1,R)) \wedge (\neg E \Rightarrow wp(S_2,R))&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[t]{rcl} 
wp(\textbf{if}\ x &lt; y\ \textbf{then}\ x:=y\ \textbf{else}\;\;\textbf{skip}\;\;\textbf{end},\ x \geq y)
&amp; = &amp; (x &lt; y \Rightarrow wp(x:=y,x\geq y))\ \wedge\ (\neg (x&lt;y) \Rightarrow wp(\textbf{skip}, x \geq y))\\
&amp; = &amp; (x &lt; y \Rightarrow y\geq y) \ \wedge\ (\neg (x&lt;y) \Rightarrow x \geq y)\\
&amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; \textbf{true}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== While loop ===
==== Partial Correctness ====
Ignoring termination for a moment, we can define the rule for the ''weakest liberal precondition'', denoted ''wlp'', using a predicate ''I'', called the [[loop invariant]], typically supplied by the programmer:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wlp(\textbf{while}\ E\ \textbf{do}\ S\ \textbf{done}, R)\ =\ 
            \begin{array}[t]{l} 
            I\\ 
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((E \wedge I) \Rightarrow wlp(S,I))[x \leftarrow y]\\
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((\neg E \wedge I) \Rightarrow R)[x \leftarrow y]
          \end{array}
 &lt;/math&gt; 
|}

This simply states that (1) the invariant must hold at the start of the loop; (2) additionally,  for any initial state ''y'', the invariant and guard taken together be strong enough to establish the weakest precondition necessary for the loop body to be able to re-establish the invariant; (3) finally, if and when the loop terminates in a given state ''y'', the fact that the loop guard is false along with the invariant should be able to establish the required postcondition.

==== Total Correctness ====
To show total correctness, we also have to show that the loop terminates. For this we define a [[well-founded relation]] on the state space denoted "&lt;" and called [[loop variant]]. Hence, we have:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{while}\ E\ \textbf{do}\ S\ \textbf{done}, R)\ =\ 
           \begin{array}[t]{l} 
            I\\ 
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((E \wedge I) \Rightarrow wp(S,I \wedge x &lt; y))[x \leftarrow y]\\
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((\neg E \wedge I) \Rightarrow R)[x \leftarrow y]
          \end{array}&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''y'' is a fresh tuple of variables
|}
Informally, in the above conjunction of three formulas: 
* the first one means that invariant ''I'' must initially hold;
* the second one means that the body of the loop (e.g. statement ''S'') must preserve the invariant and decrease the variant: here, variable ''y'' represents the initial state of the body execution;
* the last one means that ''R'' must be established at the end of the loop: here, variable ''y'' represents the final state of the loop.

In predicate transformers semantics, ''invariant'' and ''variant'' are built by mimicking the [[Kleene fixed-point theorem]]. Below, this construction is sketched in [[set theory]]. We assume that ''U'' is a set denoting the state space. First, we define a family of subsets of ''U'' denoted &lt;math&gt;(A_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; by induction over [[natural number]] ''k''. Informally &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of initial states that makes ''R'' satisfied after less than ''k'' iterations of the loop: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
A_0 &amp; = &amp; \emptyset \\
A_{k+1} &amp; = &amp; \left\{\ y \in U\ | \ ((E \Rightarrow wp(S, x \in A_k)) \wedge (\neg E \Rightarrow R))[x \leftarrow y]\ \right\} \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we define: 
* invariant ''I'' as the predicate &lt;math&gt;\exists k, x \in A_k&lt;/math&gt;.
* variant &lt;math&gt;y &lt; z&lt;/math&gt; as the proposition &lt;math&gt;\exists i, y \in A_i \wedge (\forall j, z \in A_j \Rightarrow i &lt; j)&lt;/math&gt;

With these definitions, &lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{while}\ E\ \textbf{do}\ S\ \textbf{done}, R)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to formula &lt;math&gt;\exists k, x \in A_k&lt;/math&gt;.

However, in practice, such an abstract construction cannot be handled efficiently by theorem provers. Hence, loop invariants and variants are provided by human users, or are inferred by some [[abstract interpretation]] procedure.

=== Non-deterministic guarded commands ===
Actually, Dijkstra's [[Guarded Command Language]] (GCL) is an extension of the simple imperative language given until here with non-deterministic statements. Indeed, GCL aims to be a formal notation to define algorithms. Non-deterministic statements represent choices left to the actual implementation (in an effective programming language): properties proved on non-deterministic statements are ensured for all possible choices of implementation. In other words, weakest-preconditions of non-deterministic statements ensure
* that there exists a terminating execution (e.g. there exists an implementation),
* and, that the final state of all terminating execution satisfies the postcondition.

Notice that the definitions of weakest-precondition given above (in particular for '''while-loop''') preserve this property.

==== Selection ====
Selection is a generalization of '''if''' statement:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\mathbf{if}\ E_1 \rightarrow S_1 \ [\!] \ \ldots\ [\!]\ E_n \rightarrow S_n\ \mathbf{fi}, R)\ = \begin{array}[t]{l}
    (E_1 \vee \ldots \vee E_n) \\
    \wedge\ (E_1 \Rightarrow wp(S_1,R)) \\
    \ldots\\
    \wedge\ (E_n \Rightarrow wp(S_n,R)) \\
    \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Here, when two guards &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt; are simultaneously true, then execution of this statement can run any of the associated statement &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Repetition ====
Repetition is a generalization of '''while''' statement in a similar way.

=== Specification statement (or weakest-precondition of procedure call) ===
[[Refinement calculus]] extends non-deterministic statements with the notion of ''specification statement''. Informally, this statement represents a procedure call in black box, where the body of the procedure is not known. Typically, using a syntax close to [[B-Method]], a '''specification statement''' is written 
:&lt;math&gt;P\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ Q \rightarrow x:=y&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''x'' is the global variable modified by the statement,
* ''P'' is a predicate representing the precondition,
* ''y'' is a fresh logical variable, bound in ''Q'', that represents the new value of ''x'' non-deterministically chosen by the statement,
* ''Q'' is a predicate representing a postcondition, or more exactly a guard: in ''Q'', variable ''x'' represents the initial state and ''y'' denotes the final state.

The weakest-precondition of '''specification statement''' is given by:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(P\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ Q \rightarrow x:=y\ ,\ R)\ =\ P \wedge \forall z, Q[y \leftarrow z] \Rightarrow R[x \leftarrow z]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''z'' is a fresh name
|}

Moreover, a statement ''S'' '''implements''' such a specification statement if and only if the following predicate is a tautology:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;\forall x_0, (P \Rightarrow wp(S,Q[x \leftarrow x_0][y \leftarrow x]))[x \leftarrow x_0]&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a fresh name (denoting the initial state)
|}

Indeed, in such a case, the following property is ensured for all postcondition ''R'' (this is a direct consequence of ''wp'' monotonicity, see below):
:&lt;math&gt;wp(P\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ Q \rightarrow x:=y\ ,\ R) \Rightarrow wp(S,R)&lt;/math&gt;

Informally, this last property ensures that any proof about some statement involving a specification remains valid 
when replacing this specification by any of its implementations.

== Other predicate transformers ==
=== Weakest liberal precondition  {{anchor|Weakest liberal precondition}} ===
An important variant of the weakest precondition is the '''weakest liberal precondition''' 
&lt;math&gt;wlp(S, R)&lt;/math&gt;, which yields the weakest condition under which ''S'' either does not terminate or establishes ''R''. It therefore differs from ''wp'' in not guaranteeing termination. Hence it corresponds to [[Hoare logic]] in partial correctness: for the statement language given above, ''wlp'' differs with ''wp'' only on '''while-loop''', in not requiring a variant (see above).

=== Strongest postcondition ===
Given ''S'' a statement and ''R'' a [[precondition]] (a predicate on the initial state), then
&lt;math&gt;sp(S, R)&lt;/math&gt; is their '''strongest-postcondition''': it implies any postcondition satisfied by the final state of any execution of S, 
for any initial state statisfying R. In other words, a Hoare triple &lt;math&gt;\{ P \} S \{ Q \}&lt;/math&gt; is provable in Hoare logic if and only if the predicate below hold:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x, sp(S,P) \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;
Usually, '''strongest-postconditions''' are used in partial correctness.
Hence, we have the following relation between weakest-liberal-preconditions and strongest-postconditions: 
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x, P \Rightarrow wlp(S,Q)) \ \Leftrightarrow\ (\forall x, sp(S,P) \Rightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt;

For example, on assignment we have:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt; sp(x := E, R)\ =\ \exists y, x=E[x \leftarrow y] \wedge R[x \leftarrow y]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''y'' is fresh
|}

Above, the logical variable ''y'' represents the initial value of variable ''x''.
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt; sp(x := x - 5, x &gt; 15)\ =\ \exists y, x = y - 5 \wedge y &gt; 15 \ \Leftrightarrow \ x &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;

On sequence, it appears that ''sp'' runs forward (whereas ''wp'' runs backward):
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;sp(S_1;S_2\ ,\ R)\ =\ sp(S_2,sp(S_1,R))&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Win and sin predicate transformers ===
[[Leslie Lamport]] has suggested ''win'' and ''sin'' as ''predicate transformers''  for [[concurrent programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |first=Leslie  |last=Lamport |title=''win'' and ''sin'': Predicate Transformers for Concurrency |journal=[[TOPLAS|ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst.]] |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=396–428 |date=July 1990 |doi=10.1145/78969.78970 |url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-win}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicate transformers properties ==
This section presents some characteristic properties of predicate transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ralph-Johan |last=Back |first2=Joakim |last2=Wright |title=Refinement Calculus: A Systematic Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAEMCAAAQBAJ |origyear=1978 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4612-1674-2 |series=Texts in Computer Science |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below, ''T'' denotes a predicate transformer (a function between two predicates on the state space) and ''P'' a predicate. For instance, ''T(P)'' may denote ''wp(S,P)'' or ''sp(S,P)''. We keep ''x'' as the variable of the state space.

=== Monotonic ===
Predicate transformers of interest (''wp'', ''wlp'', and ''sp'') are [[monotonic]]. A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''monotonic''' if and only if:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x, P \Rightarrow Q) \Rightarrow (\forall x, T(P) \Rightarrow T(Q))&lt;/math&gt;

This property is related to the [[Hoare logic#Consequence rule|consequence rule of Hoare logic]].

=== Strict ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''strict''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{false})\ \Leftrightarrow\ \mathbf{false}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, ''wp'' is strict, whereas ''wlp'' is generally not. In particular, if statement ''S'' may not terminate then
&lt;math&gt;wlp(S,\mathbf{false})&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. We have
:&lt;math&gt;wlp(\mathbf{while}\ \mathbf{true}\ \mathbf{do}\ \mathbf{skip}\ \mathbf{done}, \mathbf{false}) \ \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{true}&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, '''true''' is a valid invariant of that loop.

=== Terminating ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''terminating''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{true})\ \Leftrightarrow\ \mathbf{true}&lt;/math&gt;

Actually, this terminology makes sense only for strict predicate transformers: indeed, &lt;math&gt;wp(S,\mathbf{true})&lt;/math&gt; is the weakest-precondition ensuring termination of ''S''.

It seems that naming this property '''non-aborting''' would be more appropriate: in total correctness, non-termination is abortion, whereas in partial correctness, it is not.

=== Conjunctive ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''conjunctive''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(P \wedge Q)\ \Leftrightarrow\ (T(P) \wedge T(Q))&lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for &lt;math&gt;wp(S,.)&lt;/math&gt;, even if statement ''S'' is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement.

=== Disjunctive ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''disjunctive''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(P \vee Q)\ \Leftrightarrow\ (T(P) \vee T(Q))&lt;/math&gt;

This is generally not the case of &lt;math&gt;wp(S,.)&lt;/math&gt; when ''S'' is non-deterministic. Indeed, let us consider a non-deterministic statement ''S'' choosing an arbitrary boolean. This statement is given here as the following ''selection statement'':
:&lt;math&gt;S\ =\ \mathbf{if}\ \mathbf{true} \rightarrow x:=0\  [\!]\  \mathbf{true} \rightarrow x:=1\ \mathbf{fi}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;wp(S,R)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the formula &lt;math&gt;R[x \leftarrow 0] \wedge R[x \leftarrow 1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;wp(S,\ x=0 \vee x=1)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the ''tautology'' &lt;math&gt;(0=0 \vee 0=1) \wedge (1=0 \vee 1=1)&lt;/math&gt;

Whereas, the formula &lt;math&gt;wp(S, x=0) \vee wp(S,x=1)&lt;/math&gt;
reduces to the ''wrong proposition'' &lt;math&gt;(0=0 \wedge 1=0) \vee (1=0 \wedge 1=1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The same counter-example can be reproduced using a ''specification statement'' (see above) instead:
:&lt;math&gt;S\ =\ \mathbf{true}\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ y \in \{ 0, 1 \} \rightarrow x:=y&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
* Computations of weakest-preconditions are largely used to statically check [[Assertion (computing)|assertions in programs]] using a theorem-prover (like [[satisfiability modulo theories|SMT-solvers]] or [[Interactive theorem proving|proof assistants]]): see [[Frama-C]] or [[ESC/Java|ESC/Java2]].
* Unlike many other semantic formalisms, predicate transformer semantics was not designed as an investigation into foundations of computation.  Rather, it was intended to provide programmers with a methodology to develop their programs as "correct by construction" in a "calculation style".  This "top-down" style was advocated by Dijkstra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edsger W. |last=Dijkstra |title=A Constructive Approach to the Problem of Program Correctness |journal=BIT Numerical Mathematics |volume=8 |pages=174–186 |year=1968 |doi= 10.1007/bf01933419}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Niklaus Wirth|N. Wirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Niklaus Wirth |first=N. |last=Wirth |title=Program development by stepwise refinement |journal=Comm. ACM |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=221–7 |date=April 1971 |doi=10.1145/362575.362577 |url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:3026/eth-3026-01.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been formalized further by [[Ralph-Johan Back|R.-J. Back]] and others in the [[refinement calculus]]. Some tools like [[B-Method]] now provide  [[automated reasoning]] in order to promote this methodology.
* In the meta-theory of [[Hoare logic]], weakest-preconditions appear as a key notion in the proof of [[Gödel's completeness theorem|relative completeness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://coq.inria.fr/V8.2pl1/contribs/HoareTut.hoarelogicsemantics.html Tutorial on Hoare Logic]: a [[Coq]] library, giving a simple but formal proof that [[Hoare logic]] is sound and complete with respect to an [[operational semantics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond predicate transformers ==
=== Weakest-preconditions and strongest-postconditions of imperative expressions ===
In predicate transformers semantics, expressions are restricted to terms of the logic (see above). However, this restriction seems too strong for most existing programming languages, where expressions may have side effects (call to a function having a side effect), may not terminate or abort (like ''division by zero''). There are many proposals to extend weakest-preconditions or strongest-postconditions for imperative expression languages and in particular for [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]].

Among them, ''Hoare Type Theory'' combines [[Hoare logic]] for a [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-like language, [[separation logic]] and [[type theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Aleksandar |last=Nanevski |first2=Greg |last2=Morrisett |first3=Lars |last3=Birkedal |title=Hoare Type Theory, Polymorphism and Separation |journal=Journal of Functional Programming |volume=18 |issue=5-6 |pages=865–911 |date=September 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0956796808006953 |url=http://ynot.cs.harvard.edu/papers/jfpsep07.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This system is currently implemented as a [[Coq]] library called '''Ynot'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ynot.cs.harvard.edu/ Ynot] a [[Coq]] library implementing Hoare Type Theory.&lt;/ref&gt; In this language, [[Evaluation strategy|evaluation of expressions]] corresponds to computations of ''strongest-postconditions''.

=== Probabilistic Predicate Transformers ===
''Probabilistic Predicate Transformers'' are an extension of predicate transformers for [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic programs]].
Indeed, such programs have many applications in [[cryptography]] (hiding of information using some randomized noise), 
[[distributed systems]] (symmetry breaking).

'''Psychogeography''' is an exploration of urban environments that emphasizes playfulness and "drifting".  It has links to the [[Situationist International]].  Psychogeography was defined in 1955 by [[Guy Debord]] as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SI/en/display/2 Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography, 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life". Another definition is "a whole toy box full of playful, inventive strategies for exploring cities... just about anything that takes [[pedestrians]] off their predictable paths and jolts them into a new [[awareness]] of the urban landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Joseph (July/August 2004).

Psychogeography was originally developed by the avant-garde movement [[Lettrist International]] in the journal ''Potlatch''.  The originator of what became known as [[unitary urbanism]], psychogeography, and the [[dérive]] was [[Ivan Chtcheglov]], in his highly influential 1953 essay "Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau" ("Formulary for a New Urbanism").&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan. [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"]. Full text at bopsecrets.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lettrists' reimagining of the city has its precursors in aspects of [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]].  The idea of urban wandering relates to the older concept of the [[flâneur]], theorized by [[Charles Baudelaire]].  Following Chtcheglov's exclusion from the Lettrists in 1954, [[Guy Debord]] and others worked to clarify the concept of unitary urbanism, in a bid to demand a revolutionary approach to architecture.  At a conference in Cosio di Arroscia, [[Italy]] in 1956, the Lettrists joined the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] to set a proper definition for the idea announced by [[Gil J. Wolman]]: "Unitary Urbanism - the synthesis of art and technology that we call for — must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;Wolman, Gil (1956). ''Address by the Lettrist International Delegate to the Alba Conference of September 1956'' ALba: Lettrist International.&lt;/ref&gt;  It demanded the rejection of functional, [[Euclid]]ean values in [[architecture]], as well as the separation between art and its surroundings.  The implication of combining these two negations is that by creating abstraction, one creates art, which, in turn, creates a point of distinction that unitary urbanism insists must be nullified.  This confusion is also fundamental to the execution of unitary urbanism as it corrupts one's ability to identify where "function" ends and "play" (the "ludic") begins, resulting in what the Lettrist International and [[Situationist International]] believed to be a utopia where one was constantly exploring, free of determining factors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;!-- These last few sentences need referencing. Who is making these arguments? --&gt;

In "Formulary for a New Urbanism", Chtcheglov had written "Architecture is the simplest means of articulating time and space, of modulating reality, of engendering dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Chtcheglov, Ivan (1953). [http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm "Formulary for a New Urbanism"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Situationists found contemporary architecture both physically and ideologically restrictive, combining with outside cultural influence, effectively creating an undertow, and forcing oneself into a certain system of interaction with their environment: "[C]ities have a psychogeographical relief, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes which strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones".{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}

The Situationists' response was to create designs of new urbanized space, promising better opportunities for experimenting through mundane expression.  Their intentions remained completely as abstractions.  Guy Debord's truest intention was to unify two different factors of "ambiance" that, he felt, determined the values of the urban landscape: the soft ambiance — light, sound, time, the association of ideas — with the hard, the actual physical constructions.  Debord's vision was a combination of the two realms of opposing ambiance, where the play of the soft ambiance was actively considered in the rendering of the hard.  The new space creates a possibility for activity not formerly determined by one besides the individual.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

However, the Situationist International may have been [[tongue-in-cheek]] about some parts of psychogeography.  "This apparently serious term 'psychogeography'", writes Debord biographer Vincent Kaufman, "comprises an art of conversation and drunkenness, and everything leads us to believe that Debord excelled at both."{{Sfn|Kaufman|2006|p=114}}

Eventually, Debord and [[Asger Jorn]] resigned themselves to the fate of "urban relativity".  Debord readily admits in his 1961 film ''A Critique of Separation'', "The sectors of a city…are decipherable, but the personal meaning they have for us is incommunicable, as is the secrecy of private life in general, regarding which we possess nothing but pitiful documents".  Despite the ambiguity of the theory, Debord committed himself firmly to its practical basis in reality, even as he later confesses, "none of this is very clear. It is a completely typical drunken monologue…with its vain phrases that do not await response and its overbearing explanations. And its silences."&lt;ref&gt;''A Critique of Separation'' (1961). Complete Cinematic Works ([[AK Press]], 2003, Trans. Knabb. K)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before settling on the impossibility of true psychogeography, Debord made another film, ''On the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time'' (1959), the title of which suggests its own subject matter.  The film's narrated content concerns itself with the evolution of a generally passive group of unnamed people into a fully aware, anarchistic assemblage, and might be perceived as a biography of the situationists themselves.  Among the rants which construct the film (regarding art, ignorance, consumerism, militarism) is a desperate call for psychogeographic action:
{{cquote
|When freedom is practised in a closed circle, it fades into a dream, becomes a mere image of itself. The ambiance of play is by nature unstable. At any moment, "ordinary life" may prevail once again. The geographical limitation of play is even more striking than its temporal limitation. Every game takes place within the boundaries of its own spatial domain.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Moments later, Debord elaborates on the important goals of unitary urbanism in contemporary society:
{{cquote
|The atmosphere of a few places gave us a few intimations of the future powers of an architecture that it would be necessary to create in order to provide the setting for less mediocre games.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Quoting [[Karl Marx]], Debord says:
{{cquote
|People can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is animated. Obstacles were everywhere. And they were all interrelated, maintaining a unified reign of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Debord G. Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

While a reading of the texts included in the journal ''Internationale Situationniste'' may lead to an understanding of psychogeography as dictated by Guy Debord, a more comprehensive elucidation of the term would come from research into those who have put its techniques into a more developed practise.  While Debord's influence in bringing Chtchglov's text to an international audience is undoubted, his skill with the 'praxis' of unitary urbanism has been placed into question by almost all of the subsequent protagonists of the Formulary's directives.  Debord was indeed a notorious drunk (see his Panegyrique, Gallimard 1995) and this altered state of consciousness must be considered along with assertions he made regarding his attempts at psychogeographical activities such as dérive and constructed situation.  The researches undertaken by WNLA, AAA and the London Psychogeographical Association during the 1990s support the contention of Asger Jorn and the Scandinavian Situationniste (Drakagygett 1962 - 1998) that the psychogeographical is a concept only known through practise of its techniques.  Without undertaking the programme expounded by Chtchglov, and the resultant submission to the urban unknown, comprehension of the Formulary is not possible.  As Debord himself suggested, an understanding of the 'beautiful language' of situationist urbanism necessitates its practice.

==Dérive==
{{Main|Dérive}}
Psychogeography combines subjective and objective knowledge and studies.  Debord struggled to stipulate the finer points of this theoretical paradox, ultimately producing "Theory of the Dérive" in 1958, a document which essentially serves as an instruction manual for the psychogeographic procedure, executed through the act of dérive ("drift").

{{cquote
|In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there… But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.{{Sfn|Knabb|1995|p=50}}
}}

In the SI's 6th issue, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] writes in a manifesto of unitary urbanism, "All space is occupied by the enemy.  We are living under a permanent curfew.  Not just the cops — the geometry".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher, ed. (1998). ''Leaving the 20th Century: the Incomplete Work of the Situationist International'', London: Rebel Pub.. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dérive, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was "a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus", and "a maneuver within the enemy's field of vision".{{Sfn|McDonough|2004|p=259}}  To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the dérive brought appeal in this sense of taking the "fight" to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation.  The dérive was a course of preparation, reconnaissance, a means of shaping situationist psychology among urban explorers for the eventuality of the {{clarify|text=situationist city|date=August 2016}}.

==Contemporary psychogeography==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] serves as the focal point of local psychogeography oriented groups]]Since the 1990s, as situationist theory became popular in artistic and academic circles, [[avant-garde]], [[neoist]], and [[revolutionary]] groups emerged, developing psychogeographical [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in various ways.  Influenced primarily through the re-emergence of the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] and the foundation of [[The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture]], these groups have assisted in the development of a contemporary psychogeography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychogeography.org |title=psychogeography.org weblog and archive |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1996 The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture undertook an extensive programme of practical research into classic (situationist) psychogeography in both [[Glasgow]] and London.  The discoveries made during this period, documented in the group's journal ''Viscosity'', expanded the terrain of the psychogeographic into that of [[urban design]] and architectural performance.

The journal ''[[Transgressions: A Journal of Urban Exploration]]'' (which appears to have ceased publication sometime in 2000) collated and developed a number of post-avant-garde revolutionary psychogeographical themes.  The journal also contributed to the use and development of psychogeographical maps&lt;ref&gt;"The production of psychogeographical maps, or even the introduction of alterations such as more or less arbitrarily transposing maps of two different regions, can contribute to clarifying certain wanderings that express not subordination to randomness but total insubordination to habitual influences (influences generally categorized as tourism, that popular drug as repugnant as sports or buying on credit)." from ''Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography'', Debord 55&lt;/ref&gt; which have, since 2000, been used in political actions, drifts and projections, distributed as flyers. Since 2003 in the [[United States]], separate events known as [[Provflux]] and [[Psy-Geo-conflux]] have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments, under the academic umbrella of psychogeography.

Psychogeography also become a device used in [[performance art]] and [[literature]].  In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in particular, psychogeography has become a recognised descriptive term used in discussion of successful writers such as [[Iain Sinclair]] and [[Peter Ackroyd]] and the documentaries of filmmaker [[Patrick Keiller]].  The popularity of Sinclair drew the term into greater public use in the United Kingdom.  Though Sinclair makes infrequent use of the jargon associated with the Situationists, he has certainly popularized the term by producing a large body of work based on pedestrian exploration of the urban and suburban landscape.  Sinclair and similar thinkers draw on a longstanding British literary tradition of the exploration of urban landscapes, predating the Situationists, found in the work of writers like [[William Blake]], [[Arthur Machen]], and [[Thomas de Quincey]].  The nature and history of [[London]] were a central focus of these writers, utilising [[Romanticism|romantic]], [[gothic novel|gothic]], and [[occult]] ideas to describe and transform the city.  Sinclair drew on this tradition combined with his own explorations as a way of criticising modern developments of urban space in such key texts as ''Lights Out for the Territory''.  Peter Ackroyd's bestselling ''London: A Biography'' was partially based on similar sources.  [[Merlin Coverley]] gives equal prominence to this literary tradition alongside Situationism in his 2006 book ''Psychogeography'', not only recognising that the situationist origins of psychogeography are sometimes forgotten, but that via certain writers like [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Daniel Defoe]], and Charles Baudelaire, they had a shared tradition. Novelist [[Will Self]] had a column "Psychogeography" which started out in the [[British Airways]] [[Inflight magazine]] and then appeared weekly in the Saturday magazine of ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper until October 2008.

The concepts and themes seen in popular comics writers such as [[Alan Moore]] in works like ''[[From Hell]]'' are also now seen as significant works of psychogeography.  Other key figures in this version of the idea are [[Walter Benjamin]], [[J. G. Ballard]], and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]].  Part of this development saw increasing use of ideas and terminology by some psychogeographers from [[Charles Fort|Fort]]ean and occult areas like [[earth mysteries]], [[ley lines]], and [[chaos magic]], a course pioneered by Sinclair.  A core element in virtually all these developments remains a dissatisfaction with the nature and design of the modern environment and a desire to make the everyday world more interesting.

After a few years of practicing, the psychogeography group that gravitates around the Urban Squares Initiative and Aleksandar Janicijevic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/07author.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033354/http://urbansquares.com/07author.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330183148/http://urbansquares.com/12psychomaps.html |date=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the initiator of, and main figure in organizing and leading this group, came up with the working definition of this procedure as: "The subjective analysis–mental reaction, to neighbourhood behaviours related to geographic location. A chronological process based on the order of appearance of observed topics, with the time delayed inclusion of other relevant instances". In 2013 Aleksandar Janicijevic published "Urbis - Language of the urban fabric" as a visual attempt to rediscover lost or neglected urban symbols. In 2015 another book was published "MyPsychogeography", an attempt to synthesize sketches and ideas which have informed his art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |title=psychogeography now – window to the urban future &amp;#124; …… |publisher=Photoblog.urbansquares.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606150623/http://photoblog.urbansquares.com/?page_id=170 |archivedate=2013-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate making dérives, a number of applications for mobile devices have been created over the last few years.  Most notably, Dérive app,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deriveapp.com/ Dérive app]&lt;/ref&gt; Serendipitor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serendipitor.net/ Serendipitor]&lt;/ref&gt; Drift,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brokencitylab.org/drift/ Drift]&lt;/ref&gt; and Random GPS&lt;ref&gt;[http://nogovoyages.com/random_gps.html Random GPS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ptolemy Project''' is an ongoing project aimed at modeling, simulating, and designing [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]], [[real-time computing|real-time]], [[embedded system]]s. The focus of the Ptolemy Project is on assembling concurrent components. The principal product of the project is the Ptolemy II [[model based design]] and simulation tool. The Ptolemy Project is conducted in the Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Center (iCyPhy) in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], and is directed by Prof. Edward A. Lee.

The key underlying principle in the project is the use of well-defined [[model of computation|models of computation]] that govern the interaction between components. A major problem area being addressed is the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The project is named after [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]], the 2nd century Greek astronomer, mathematician, and geographer.

The Kepler Project, a community-driven collaboration among researchers at three other [[University of California]] campuses has created the [[Kepler scientific workflow system]] which is based on Ptolemy II.

In ''A Guide to Research in Music Education,'' Phelps, Ferrara and Goolsby define research as the identification and isolation of a problem into a workable plan; the implementation of that plan to collect the data needed; and the synthesis, interpretation and presentation of the collected information into some format which readily can be made available to others. Research typically falls into one of four categories: experimental, descriptive, historical, or philosophical.

==Types of Research==

===Experimental===
Experimental research is used to determine what will be or to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. An example of experimental research is a 2000 study by Prickett and Bridges. The purpose of the study was to determine if the basic song repertoire of vocal/choral music education majors is significantly better than instrumental music education majors. The study revealed no significant difference between the two groups, and that neither group had developed a strong repertoire of standard songs outside of the college music classroom. The impact of the study was the recommendation that professors preparing music education students for their future careers consider adding activities to music education courses that build a strong song repertoire.

===Descriptive===
Descriptive research is used to determine what is and is usually conducted for one of three purposes:
#to obtain data on the current status of existing phenomena, such as conditions, practices, and situations
#to establish relationships among several variables, using the data about the current status to investigate relationships that may provide greater insight into the current status
#to determine developments, trends, or changes by describing variables as they develop over a period of time
There are three broad categories of descriptive research: survey studies, relationship studies, and development studies.

====Survey Studies====
A survey is a systematic method of collecting information on one or more variables. An example of a survey study is a 1998 study by Gillespie and Hamann. The purpose of the study was to gather descriptive information about orchestra programs that can be used as baseline data when considering the needs of school string programs. The findings indicated a continued enrollment increase in school orchestras in the 1990s although the number of orchestra teachers remained stable, and that larger schools are more likely to offer orchestra instruction. The impact of the study was the recommendation that school systems should provide larger, more adequate teaching facilities and that universities and string teachers should emphasize strategies for teaching larger string classes in their teacher preparation programs.

====Development Studies====
Development studies collect information on existing situations, determine relationships, and examine changes in these variables over a period of time. Development studies include:
#longitudinal studies, which are conducted over a period of time with data collected from the same sample at specific intervals during the study
#trend studies, in which a population is sampled and subjects at the same level of development are tested
#cohort studies, which measure an entire population at periodic intervals over a period of time

===Historical===
Historical research refers to the collection of data to record and interpret past events. Source materials used by the historical researcher are normally of two kinds, primary and secondary. A primary source is first-hand information, observed directly by the researcher. A secondary source is second-hand information, not original to the researcher. Through the process of external criticism, the researcher learns whether or not the object of scrutiny is authentic. Through the process of internal criticism, the researcher determines if the information contained in the object is credible. An example of historical research is a 1993 study by Gruhn. The purpose of the study was to determine if [[Lowell Mason]]'s ''Manual of the Boston Academy of Music for the Instruction in the Elements of Vocal Music on the System of Pestalozzi'' is truly based on Pestalozzian principles. A detailed comparison of the ''Manual,'' a work by Pfeiffer and Nageli, and a work by Kubler revealed that the Pfeiffer and Nageli work is much closer to the ideas advocated by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] than the Kubler work, and that Mason's ''Manual'' is little more than a translation of Kubler.

===Philosophical===
[[International Society for Philosophy of Music Education|Philosophical research]] is used to examine the underlying principles in any field. An example of philosophical research is a 1999 article by [[Bennett Reimer]] published in ''The Music Educators Journal'': "Facing the Risks of the Mozart Effect." This article is a response to the practice of music educators who advocated music education because of its relationship to spatial task performance. A 1993 research report from the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irving by Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky is an example of the research literature that supported what became to be known as "the [[Mozart Effect]]." Reimer rejects spatial task performance as justification for music education because, according to Reimer's aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified by its merit as an art, not for extra-musical reasons.

==History of Research in American Music Education==
In 1837 the Connecticut General Assembly voted to collect educational data. Questionnaires were sent to all Connecticut schools in 1838. Eight questions were about music instruction. This was probably the first attempt in the U.S. to collect data on music instruction on a wide-scale basis and perhaps the earliest example of research in music education.

In 1918 the Educational Council was established by the Music Supervisors National Conference (later the Music Educators National Conference or [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|MENC]]). The Educational Council published bulletins, mostly based on survey data and including recommendations for the profession. One such bulletin was ''The Present Status of Music Instruction in Colleges and High Schools 1919-1920.'' In 1923 the name of the organization was changed form Educational Council to the National Research Council of Music Education. The name changed again in 1932 to the Music Education Research Council. The ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' began publication in 1953 under the editorship of [[Allen Britton]]. At first many of the articles were based on historical and descriptive research, but in the early 1960s the journal began to shift to experimental research. The Society for Research in Music Education was established in 1960, and in 1963 the ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' became its official publication. The MENC Historical Center was established in 1965. In 1978, MENC founded several Special Research Interest Groups.

==Research Publications==
Price and Chang (2000) provide an overview of the many diverse music education research journals including annotation and publication details for each source. While the ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' continues to be the dominant journal in the field, other journals include the ''[[Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education]],'' ''The Missouri Journal of Research in Music Education,'' ''The Bulletin of Research, Contributions to Music Education, The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education,'' and ''Update: The Applications of Research in Music Education. '' Research on the impact of music education research journals includes investigations of initial citation speeds (Hancock, 2015) and accumulated citations (Hamann &amp; Lucas, 1998).

==Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning==
One of the dominant events in the field of music education research was the 1992 publication of the ''Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.'' Edited by Richard Colwell, the ''Handbook'' contains fifty-five chapters written by more than seventy scholars. Colwell edited a second volume in 2002, ''The New Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning.''

To see the shift of emphasis that has taken place in music education research in recent years, one need only compare the contents of the 1992 volume and the 2002 volume. The inclusion of sections on "Conceptual Framework" and "Evaluation" in the 1992 volume is evidence of emphasis on standards and a set body of knowledge. The absence of similar sections in the 2002 volume is evidence of a shift toward a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosophical and a [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] teaching theory. The inclusion of a section on "related arts" in the 2002 volume recalls the research of the late 1960s and 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">'''Scientific consensus''' is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the [[scientific community|community]] of [[scientist]]s in a [[Scientific discipline|particular field]] of study. Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily unanimity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/consensus.htm|title=Scientific Consensus|publisher=Green Facts|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consensus]] is normally achieved through communication  at conferences, the  publication process, replication (reproducible results by others), and [[peer review]]. These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the 'normal' debates through which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shwed Uri|author2=Peter Bearman|url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/75/6/817.full.pdf+html|title=The Temporal Structure of Scientific Consensus Formation|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=75|issue=6|date=December 2010|pages=817–40|accessdate=18 December 2010|ref=harv|doi=10.1177/0003122410388488|pmc=3163460 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the "inside" to the "outside" of the scientific community. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the consensus is can be quite straightforward.

Scientific consensus may be invoked in popular or political debate on subjects that are controversial within the public sphere but which may not be controversial within the scientific community, such as [[evolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution|url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/evolution.aspx|publisher=National Science Teacher Association |accessdate=2008-05-02|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific opinion on climate change#Scientific consensus|climate change]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf "Joint Science Academies' Statement"]&lt;/ref&gt; or the lack of a link between [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccinations and autism]].&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

== Change of consensus over time ==
{{See also|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}
There are many philosophical and historical theories as to how scientific consensus changes over time. Because the history of scientific change is extremely complicated, and because there is a tendency to project "winners" and "losers" onto the past in relation to our ''current'' scientific consensus, it is very difficult to come up with accurate and rigorous models for scientific change.&lt;ref name="Pickering 1993"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pickering| first= Andrew| authorlink=Andrew Pickering |title = The Mangle of Practice | year = 1995 |publisher = Chicago University Press | location = IL | isbn = 0-226-66802-9 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is made exceedingly difficult also in part because each of the various branches of science functions in somewhat different ways with different forms of evidence and experimental approaches.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Most models of scientific change rely on new data produced by scientific [[experiment]]. [[Karl Popper]] proposed that since no amount of experiments could ever ''prove'' a scientific theory, but a single experiment could ''disprove'' one, science should be based on [[falsifiability|falsification]].&lt;ref name="PopperLSR"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Popper| first= Karl Raimund| authorlink=Karl Popper |title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | year = 1934 | edition = 2002| publisher = Routledge Classics | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-415-27844-7 | ref=harv }} Originally published in German as {{cite book |title=Logik der Forschung: zur Erkenntnistheorie der modenen Naturwissenschaft |series=Schriften zur Wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung |year=1935 |publisher=Springer | location=Vienna |oclc=220936200|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this forms a logical theory for science, it is in a sense "timeless" and does not necessarily reflect a view on how science should progress over time.

Among the most influential challengers of this approach was [[Thomas Kuhn]], who argued instead that experimental [[data]] always provide some data which cannot fit completely into a theory, and that falsification alone did not result in scientific change or an undermining of scientific consensus. He proposed that scientific consensus worked in the form of "[[paradigm]]s", which were interconnected theories and underlying assumptions about the nature of the theory itself which connected various researchers in a given field. Kuhn argued that only after the accumulation of many "significant" anomalies would scientific consensus enter a period of "crisis". At this point, new theories would be sought out, and eventually one paradigm would triumph over the old one – a series of [[paradigm shift]]s rather than a linear progression towards truth. Kuhn's model also emphasized more clearly the social and personal aspects of theory change, demonstrating through historical examples that scientific consensus was never truly a matter of pure logic or pure facts.&lt;ref name="KuhnSSR"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kuhn| first= Thomas S. |title=[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] |year = 1962 | edition = 1996| pages=| publisher = University of Chicago Press, Chicago| isbn = 978-0-226-45808-3 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these periods of 'normal' and 'crisis' science are not mutually exclusive. Research shows that these are different modes of practice, more than different historical periods.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

==Perception and public opinion==
Perception of whether a scientific consensus exists on a given issue, and how strong that conception is, has been described as a "gateway belief" upon which other beliefs and then action are based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientists are from Mars, Laypeople are from Venus: An Evidence-Based Rationale for Communicating the Consensus on Climate|journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education|date=November-December 2014|volume=34|issue=6|url=http://reports.ncse.com/index.php/rncse/article/viewFile/347/599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politicization of science ==
{{Main article|Politicization of science}}

In public policy debates, the assertion that there exists a consensus of scientists in a particular field is often used as an argument for the validity of a theory and as support for a course of action by those who stand to gain from a policy based on that consensus. Similarly arguments for a ''lack'' of scientific consensus are often encouraged by sides who stand to gain from a more ambiguous policy.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

For example, the [[scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on the causes of global warming]] is that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Oreskes| first = Naomi| authorlink = Naomi Oreskes| title = Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change| journal = Science| volume = 306| page = 1686| date = December 2004| url =http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686| doi = 10.1126/science.1103618| pmid = 15576594| issue = 5702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher=The National Academies Press| isbn = 0-309-14588-0| last = America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council| title = Advancing the Science of Climate Change| location = Washington, D.C.| year = 2010| url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices"&gt;{{cite web | title = Understanding and Responding to Climate Change| url = http://dels-old.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/climate_change_2008_final.pdf|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=30 May 2010|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[history of science and technology|historian of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reporting that a survey of the abstracts of 928 science articles published between 1993 and 2003 showed none which disagreed explicitly with the notion of [[anthropogenic global warming]].&lt;ref name="Oreskes_science"&gt;Naomi Oreskes, "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change.]" ''Science'' 306:5702 (3 December 2004): p. 1686. Accessed 7 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Oreskes stated that those who opposed these scientific findings are amplifying the normal range of scientific uncertainty about any facts into an appearance that there is a great scientific disagreement, or a lack of scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="Oreskes_washpost"&gt;Naomi Oreskes, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26065-2004Dec25.html Undeniable Global Warming.]" ''The Washington Post'' (26 December 2004): B07.&lt;/ref&gt; Oreskes's findings were replicated by other methods that require no interpretation.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

The theory of [[evolution|evolution through natural selection]] is also supported by an overwhelming scientific consensus; it is one of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Science Institute of Medicine | title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism | publisher=National Academy Press | year=2008|isbn=0-309-10586-2 | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"That this controversy is one largely manufactured by the proponents of creationism and intelligent design may not matter, and as long as the controversy is taught in classes on current affairs, politics, or religion, and not in science classes, neither scientists nor citizens should be concerned." [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2277 Intelligent Judging – Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom] George J. Annas, [[New England Journal of Medicine]], Volume 354:2277–81  May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of evolution claim that there is significant dissent on evolution within the scientific community.&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;Stephen Jay Gould, "[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html Evolution as Fact and Theory,]" May 1981; in ''Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes.'' New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1994: 253–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wedge strategy]], a plan to promote [[intelligent design]], depended greatly on seeding and building on public perceptions of absence of consensus on evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.pdf "The Wedge Document"] Discovery Institute, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherent [[uncertainty in science]], where theories are never ''proven'' but can only be ''disproven'' (see [[falsifiability]]), poses a problem for politicians, policymakers, lawyers, and business professionals. Where scientific or philosophical questions can often languish in uncertainty for decades within their disciplinary settings, policymakers are faced with the problems of making sound decisions based on the currently available data, even if it is likely not a final form of the "truth". The tricky part is discerning what is close enough to "final truth". For example, social action against smoking probably came too long after science was 'pretty consensual'.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

Certain domains, such as the approval of certain technologies for public consumption, can have vast and far-reaching political, economic, and human effects should things run awry with the predictions of scientists. However, insofar as there is an expectation that policy in a given field reflect knowable and pertinent data and well-accepted models of the relationships between observable phenomena, there is little good alternative for policy makers than to rely on so much of what may fairly be called 'the scientific consensus' in guiding policy design and implementation, at least in circumstances where the need for policy intervention is compelling. While science cannot supply 'absolute truth' (or even its complement 'absolute error') its utility is bound up with the capacity to guide policy in the direction of increased public good and away from public harm. Seen in this way, the demand that policy rely only on what is proven to be "scientific truth" would be a prescription for policy paralysis and amount in practice to advocacy of acceptance of all of the quantified and unquantified costs and risks associated with policy inaction.&lt;ref name="Shwed and Bearman 2010" /&gt;

No part of policy formation on the basis of the ostensible scientific consensus precludes persistent review either of the relevant scientific consensus or the tangible results of policy. Indeed, the same reasons that drove reliance upon the consensus drives the continued evaluation of this reliance over time – and adjusting policy as needed.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

'''Secular arm''', in [[ecclesiastical law]], refers to the legal authority of the civil power, the State, or any [[Laity|lay]] authority, invoked by the Church to punish offenders in cases properly belonging to the jurisdiction of the Church. In the [[Middle Ages]] especially in Inquisition trials for [[heresy]], or grave immorality, ecclesiastical courts delivered convicted clerical and lay offenders over to the secular arm to administer severe capital punishments. The phrase "[[Spanish Inquisition#Sentencing|relaxed]] to the secular arm" was used by the [[Spanish Inquistion]] to describe the handover of the condemned heretic.

The medieval Latin phrase 'brachium seculare' was translated first into late Middle English.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Religion&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Introduced circa 1180–1250 at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the church inquisitors delivered a [[Cathar]] heretic, or any heretic, to the secular arm, to be burnt at the stake. 
Under [[canon law]] church tribunals had no jurisdiction to impose penalties involving mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages p.260&lt;/ref&gt;
Notably the contrary circumstance of appeal by individuals to the secular authorities to interfere with, or hinder, the process of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was until recently punished in the [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]] [[Catholic Church|Church]] by [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (3 ed.)p.532&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was first recognized by the university and its school director-then Rey Dalde in 2002 on the month of August with the efforts of its first student officers for the school year 2002-2003 (June 2002-March 2003) being headed by their president-then, Maria Fe dela Cruz.
The society's [[by-laws]] has been written mainly by Cherryl C. Marudo. According to the by-laws, the name of the organization is Society of Industrial Engineering Students (or SIES). But, for some reasons, it became locally known as SIE (without the second S which means Students) probably because its name structure has been compared to the university's College of Engineering.
Aside from SIE, the society is also known in the acronym UPHSDSIE, with UPHSD, the university's acronym just to know that the society is in that said university. But still, SIE would do.
By the year 2016, the SIE renamed as the Junior Philippine Institute of Industrial Engineers or JPIIE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3068">[[Image:Splitscreen 16-9.svg|frame|250px|Various methods to display multiple signals on a 4:3 screen: 1+3, 3+1 (1:1), 2×2, 3×3, 4×4 (4:3), 1+1 (2:3 vertical, 8:3 horizontal), 4×3 (1:1), 1 in 12 (4:3).]]

A '''split screen''' is a display technique in [[computer graphics]] that consists of dividing graphics and/or text into non-movable adjacent parts, typically two or four [[rectangle|rectangular]] areas.  This is done in order to allow the simultaneous presentation of (usually) related graphical and textual information on a [[computer display]]. Split screen differs from [[windowing system]]s in that the latter allows overlapping and freely movable parts of the screen (the "[[Window (computing)|windows]]") to present related as well as unrelated application data to the user, while the former conforms more strictly to the description given in the paragraph above.

The split screen technique can also be used to run two instances of an application, possibly with another user interacting with the other instance.

==In video games==
The split screen feature is commonly used in non-[[Computer network|networked]] [[video game]]s with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] options.  

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Hii.jpg|thumb|right|A split screen for four players, all playing [[Call of Duty 2]] simultaneously on the same screen]] --&gt;
In its most easily  understood form, a split screen for a two-player video game is an audiovisual output device (usually a standard [[television]] for [[video game console]]s) where the display has been divided into two equally sized areas so that the players can explore different areas simultaneously without being close to each other.  This has historically been remarkably popular on consoles, which until the 2000s did not have access to the [[Internet]] or any other network.

Split screen is useful for people who want to play with other players, but with only one console.
In recent years, split screen hasn't been used very often because the new frontier of videogames is playing with other players [[Multiplayer online game|online]], without screen sharing.

== Advantages and disadvantages of split screen in video games ==

===Advantages===
*Users can see where the other players are
*Users can communicate with the players who are near them
*Only one Console needed
*Only one Game Copy needed

===Disadvantages===
*Small screens
*User can cheat by looking at the other players' screens, also called 'screen-cheating' or 'screen-peeking'.
*Rendering more screens taxes the hardware, often reducing [[frame rate]] or graphical detail.
*More distraction.
&lt;!-- commented out as it is non-notable: [[Microsoft]] is researching the split-screen concept for PCs.[http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/06/microsoft-researching-split-screen-desktop-software/] --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3519">'''Technological somnambulism''' is a concept used when talking about the [[philosophy of technology]]. The term was used by [[Langdon Winner]] in his essay ''Technology as forms of life''. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of ''sleepwalking'' in our mediations with [[technology]]. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors.  One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again.  Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new ''worlds'' in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of &lt;!--using that--&gt;the technology (Winner 105-107).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, Langdon. "[http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Society_Fall_2010/Winner_Ttechnologies_as_Forms_of_Life.pdf Technologies as Forms of Life]". ''Readings in the Philosophy of Technology''. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0742564015}}. 103-113&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept can be found in the earlier work of [[Marshall McLuhan]], cf. ''[[Understanding Media]]'', where he refers to a comment made by [[David Sarnoff]] expressing a [[social determinism|socially deterministic]] view of "value free" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, "...the voice of the current somnambulism".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in [[Media Theory]] it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.gatech.edu/je77/222|title=Media Theory Reading List|website=home.cc.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/reading/montgomery.htm|title=Media Theory Reading List -- Harper Montgomery|website=csmt.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | title=Media Digital Humanities | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603180344/http://english.ucalgary.ca/Digital%20Humanities | archivedate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shiva Musée Guimet 22971.jpg|thumb|A Cambodian [[Shiva]] head showing a third eye.]]
The '''third eye''' (also called the '''mind's eye''', or '''inner eye''') is a mystical and [[esoteric]] concept of a speculative invisible eye which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.&lt;ref name=MMM&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Myth and Magic&amp;nbsp;– Volume 19|year=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York, NY|isbn=0839360355|page=2606|editor=Richard Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious overview==
In certain dharmic spiritual traditions the third eye refers to the [[ajna]] (or brow) [[chakra]].&lt;ref name=Saraswati&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Swami Satyananda Saraswati|title=Kundalini iuuuggTantra|year=2001|publisher=Yoga I Publications Trust|location=Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third eye refers to the gate that leads to inner realms and spaces of [[higher consciousness]]. In [[New Age]] spirituality, the third eye often [[symbol]]izes a state of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or the evocation of [[mental image]]s having deeply personal [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[psychological]] significance. The third eye is often associated with [[vision (religion)|religious visions]], [[clairvoyance]], the ability to observe [[chakra]]s and [[aura (paranormal)|auras]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Chakras'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[precognition]], and [[out-of-body experience]]s. People who are claimed to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as ''seers''.  In [[Hinduism]], the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows. 

In [[Taoism]] and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called [[Zen]] in Japanese), "third eye training" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various [[qigong]] postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct "vibration" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach more advanced meditation levels. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the [[mind's eye]], is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism claims that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth [[Chakra]], forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The doctrine of the elixir by R.B. Jefferson Coombe Springs Press 1982 chapter 4. The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs.&lt;/ref&gt; In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the "Upper Dan Tien" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name "muddy pellet".

According to the Christian teaching of Father [[Richard Rohr]], the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), "but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." Rohr refers to this level of awareness as "having the mind of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, Richard "The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See", The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8245-2543-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8245-2543-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[H.P. Blavatsky]]&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm The Secret Doctrine]'', Vol. 2, 1888, {{ISBN|1-55700-124-3}}, pp. 289-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant [[pineal gland]], which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain. [[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s sense light via a third [[parietal eye]]—a structure associated with the pineal gland—which serves to regulate their [[circadian rhythm]]s, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claimed that by extending an "etheric tube" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"/&gt;  It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as [[quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Stephen ''Extrasensory Perception of Quarks'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0227-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 1993"&gt;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Rick Strassman]] has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (dimethyltryptamine), an [[entheogen]] which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.&lt;ref name="strassman"&gt;{{cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule. A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences |last=Strassman |first=Rick J. |authorlink=Rick Strassman |year=2001 |publisher=Park Street |location=Rochester, Vt |isbn=978-0-89281-927-0}} ({{cite web | url=http://rickstrassman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=60 | title=Chapter summaries | accessdate=27 February 2012}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The use of the phrase ''mind's eye'' does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs.  Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have critiqued this view.&lt;ref&gt;''Consciousness Explained'', Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-316-18065-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others, such as [[Johnjoe McFadden]] of the [[University of Surrey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the New Zealand-based neurobiologist [[Susan Pockett]],  propose that the brain's [[electromagnetic field]] is consciousness itself, thus causing the perception of a unitary location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unisci.com/stories/20022/0516026.htm Our Conscious Mind Could Be An Electromagnetic Field], UniSci.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrey.ac.uk/qe/pdfs/cemi_theory_paper.pdf Synchronous Firing and Its Influence on the Brain's Electromagnetic Field: Evidence for an Electromagnetic Field Theory of Consciousness], J.

[[File:Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|350px|A trailer for the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'']]

A '''trailer''' (also known as a '''preview''' or '''coming attraction''') is a commercial [[advertisement]] for a [[feature film]] that will be exhibited in the future at a [[movie theater|cinema]], the result of creative and technical work. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a feature film screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://straightdope.com/mailbag/mtrailers.html | title = Why are they called "trailers" if they're shown before the movie? | author = Gfactor | publisher = The Straight Dope | date = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film begins.

Movie trailers have now become popular on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]] discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.

== History ==
[[File:The African Queen - trailer.ogv|thumb|Film trailer for ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' ([[1951 in film|1951]]).]]

The first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when [[Nils Granlund]], the advertising manager for the [[Marcus Loew]] theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical ''The Pleasure Seekers'', opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ''Daily Star'', the practice which Loew adopted was described as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew’s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising".&lt;ref&gt;"Movies Score on Legit in New York;" Lincoln, Nebraska ''Daily Star''; November 9, 1913; Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring [[Charlie Chaplin]] at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Blondes, Brunettes, and Bullets, Granlund, N.T.; Van Rees Press, NY, 1957, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Trailers were initially shown after, or "trailing", the feature film, and this led to their being called "trailers". The practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the feature. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Up until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by [[National Screen Service]] and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries.  Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured [[wiktionary:stentorian|stentorian]] voices.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the "new Hollywood" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television.  Among the trend setters were [[Stanley Kubrick]] with his montage trailers for ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]).  Kubrick's main inspiration for the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer was the short film ''[[Very Nice, Very Nice]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]) by Canadian film visionary [[Arthur Lipsett]]. [[Pablo Ferro]], who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Many home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most [[VHS]] tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to "Stay tuned after the feature for more previews." With [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]s, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Definition ==
Trailers consist of a series selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]]. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trailer music |publisher=SoundtrackNet, LLC |date=30 April 2009 |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the movie theater trade group ''[[National Association of Theatre Owners]]'' issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than 2 minutes, which is 30 second shorter than the prior norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marketingmovies.net/news/theaters-advocate-shorter-trailers-marketing/ | title = Theaters Advocate Shorter Movie Trailers | publisher = MarketingMovies.net | date = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many.

Some trailers use "special shoot" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. [[Dimension Films]] also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s two towers. However, after the [[September 11 attacks]] the studio pulled it from theaters.

[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] in a 1937 color film trailer for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.]]

One of the most famous "special shoot" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', which featured director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal [[Vera Miles]] with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when [[Janet Leigh]] was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.

There are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of film trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio.  Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer [[film editor|editor]]s work from [[Dailies|rushes]] or [[dailies]]. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different [[take]]s of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film.

Some trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' the character Rick Blaine says, "OK, you asked for it!" before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.

== Truth vs. misleading ==
{{essay|section|date=December 2016}}

Over the years, there have been many instances where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by [[bait and switch]]ing, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernman.com/10-incredibly-misleading-movie-trailers/ |title=10 Movie Trailers That Are Nothing Like The Actual Movie |publisher=Modernman.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American woman sued the makers of ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' because their film "failed to live up to its promo's promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardie|first=Giles|title=Misleading trailer leads to law suit|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/misleading-trailer-leads-to-law-suit-20111011-1lj2z.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Woman sues to stop Drive getting away with a 'misleading' trailer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/10/woman-sues-drive-trailer|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=10/08/11 3:02pm 10/08/11 3:02pm |url=http://gawker.com/5847970/woman-files-lawsuit-over-misleading-trailer-for-drive |title=Woman Files Lawsuit Over 'Misleading' Trailer for Drive |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although her lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michbar.org/file/opinions/appeals/2013/101513/55553.pdf ''Deming v.

== Composition ==
Trailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain [[deleted scene]]s from the film.

The key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=6–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trailers have a [[three-act structure]] similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of "signature music" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.

[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (33).jpg|thumb|250px|Screenshot from film trailer for 1959 ''[[North by Northwest]]'']]

[[Voice-over]] narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist [[Don LaFontaine]]. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, [[Hal Douglas]], [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliott]], John Leader, [[Corey Burton]], [[George DelHoyo]], [[Peter Cullen]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Ashton Smith]], [[Jim Cummings]], John Garry, [[Tom Kane]], [[Nick Schatzki]], [[Ben Patrick Johnson]], Tony Rodgers, [[Beau Weaver]], and [[Brian Cummings]]. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as "Colossal!", "Stupendous!", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.

[[Music]] helps set the [[setting tone|tone]] and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the [[film score]] may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:

* Music from the score of other movies.
* Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack thereof, or recognizability. The most often used of these is ''[[O Fortuna]]'' from ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' by Carl Orff,&lt;ref name="soundtrack.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundtrack.net/trailers/frequent/ |title=SoundtrackNet : Trailers: Frequently Used Trailer Music |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the works of [[E.S. Posthumus]] and [[Beethoven]].  Popular music may be selected for its tone (i.e. hard rock for an action film, lighter pop for a romantic comedy), or to establish context (e.g. the trailer for a film set in the 1940s might use big band swing).
* "Library" music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer. There are many trailer music library companies which produce [[trailer music]], some of the best known are [[audiomachine]], [[Two Steps From Hell]], [[Immediate Music]] and [[X-Ray Dog]] or SFX and Music libraries like the ones from Moss Landing, [[Gerrit Kinkel Productions]] or [[RedCola Music|redCola]].
* Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is [[John Beal (composer)|John Beal]], who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 film trailer projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020113.html?categoryid=4051&amp;cs=1 |title=Daily Variety: Razor-thin copyright line |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Braveheart]]'', ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''.

A ''cast run'' is a list of the [[movie star|stars]] that appear in the movie. If the [[film director|director]] or [[film producer|producer]] is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a [[billing (film)|billing]] block, which is a list of the principal [[actor|cast]] and [[film crew|crew]]. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio [[production logo]]s are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, [[Paramount Pictures]] was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the [[production company]] and [[film distributor|distributor]] of the film.

Many trailers are [[audio mixing (film and television)|mixed]] in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.

Trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35&amp;nbsp;mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution.  Since the advent of [[Digital 3D|Digital 3&amp;#8209;D]], it has become common for a 3‑D feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3‑D.

== Collections ==
National Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema's expense) or destroyed, however it required no proof of destruction and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series reported as 'destroyed' were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming Soon to a Theatre Near You - Maybe" in Ares 8, Schow, DJ; Simulations Publications, NY 1981, Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cinemas also began to show "trailer trash" programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.

== Other types of trailers ==
Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as [[YouTube]] as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers.

=== Video game trailers ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}

Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, video game trailers began to be produced as they became more mainstream. Used to entice viewers to go out and play the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process is similar to that for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/04/03/sega-admits-aliens-colonial-marines-trailer-was-misleading/ |title=Sega Admits 'Aliens: Colonial Marines' Trailer Was Misleading |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hideo Kojima]], a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-12-war-has-changed-but-has-hideo-kojima |title=War has changed.

=== TV spots ===
TV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30–60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content "appropriate" for the channel.

=== TV show trailers ===
[[TV show]] trailers are trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show.

=== Book trailer ===
A '''book trailer''' is a [[video]] advertisement for a [[book]] which employs techniques similar to those of [[trailer (film)|movie trailers]] to promote books and encourage readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=YouTube video sets stage for novel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/04/business/fi-vidbooks4|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trailers can also be referred to as "video-podcasts", with higher quality trailers being called "cinematic book trailers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deval|first=Jacqueline|title=Publicize Your Book (Updated): An Insider's Guide to Getting Your Book the Attention It Deserves|year=2008|publisher=Perigee Trade|isbn=0399534318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FVhmwgodMUC&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=%22book+trailer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22book%20trailer%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Justin|title=Seeking readers via 'book trailer' / Publisher tries out movie-style preview to market new title |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Seeking-readers-via-book-trailer-Publisher-2488096.php|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Killian|title=On a screen near you ...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/16/fiction.features7|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kneschke|first=Tristan|title=Don't Judge a Book by its Trailer|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/301723/20120220/book-trailer-video-movie-edit-film-novel.htm|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=International Business Times|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Nina|title=Super Sad Book Trailers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-06/features/ct-prj-0708-book-trailers-20120706_1_book-trailers-publishers-videos|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[John Farris|John Farris's]] book trailer for his 1986 novel ''Wildwood'' incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as [[John Zacherle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitton|first=Akira|title=TOR Books' WILDWOOD promo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OMCNVb7wMM|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the ''School Library Journal'' Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLJ's Trailie Awards Asks Readers to Vote for Their Favorite Book Trailer|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/home/886663-312/sljs_trailie_awards_asks_readers.html.csp|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BookReels, an MTV for Books?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/62365-bookreels-an-mtv-for-books.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan-made trailers ===
For popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.

== MPAA rating cards for theatrical trailers ==
{{Anchor|Rating cards}}
[[File:Redband.JPG|thumb|An example of a red band trailer card, in this case for 2008 ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.]]

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) mandates that theatrical trailers be no longer than two minutes and thirty seconds.  Each major studio{{clarify|date=February 2013}} is given one exception to this rule per year.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Internet or home-video trailers have no time restrictions. ''Rating cards'' appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPAA's standards.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A ''green band'' is an all-green graphic at the beginning of the trailer.  Until April 2009, these cards indicated that they had been approved for "all audiences" and often included the movie's [[MPAA rating]]. This signified that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which include limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for "appropriate" audiences, meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the film they had come to see. In May 2013, the MPAA changed the trailer approval band from "for appropriate audiences" to "to accompany this feature", but only when accompanying a feature film; for bands not accompanying a feature film, the text of the band remained the same. The font and style of the text on the graphic bands (green and red) was also changed at the time the green band was revised in 2013.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Trailers which do not adhere to these guidelines may be issued a ''red band'', which indicates approval for only "restricted" or "mature" audiences. These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movies{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (only films that are released in theaters rated R and not in theaters{{clarify|date=December 2014}} rated PG-13). These trailers may include nudity, profanity, or other material deemed inappropriate for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Cat-and-Mouse for a Trashy Trailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/movies/24kick.html | publisher =New York Times |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-24 | first=Brooks | last=Barnes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, "yellow band" trailers were introduced around 2007 to indicate restricted content, only for distribution on the Internet. Although official, this practice appears to have never been widespread (although occasional yellow band trailers are created). A notable example is the yellow band trailer for Rob Zombie's ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David M. |last=Halbfinger |date=13 June 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/movies/13yell.html |title=Attention, Web Surfers: The Following Film Trailer May Be Racy or Graphic |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=E1 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The [[Key Art Awards]], presented by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and the [[Golden Trailer Awards]]. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the [[Dolby Theater]] in Hollywood. ''The Film Informant'' also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 TFI Awards|url=http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|work=2011 Film Informant Awards|publisher=The Film Informant|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717025506/http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.

[[Image:Flock of sheep.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[sheep]] research flock at U.S. Sheep Experiment Station]]
The '''U.S. Sheep Experiment Station''' ('''USSES''') is an [[agricultural experiment station]] focusing on [[domestic sheep]] (''Ovis aries'') which is run by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Agricultural Research Service]]. Its stated mission is "...to develop integrated methods for increasing production efficiency of sheep and to simultaneously improve the [[sustainability]] of [[rangeland]] ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/AboutUs/AboutUs.htm?modecode=53-64-00-00 |title=About Us |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and facilities==
The station is located roughly six miles north of [[Dubois, Idaho]], and its lands span both Idaho and [[Montana]]. Its headquarters are on {{convert|27930|acre|km2|1}} of land owned by the Agricultural Research Service, including research facilities, animal facilities (such as [[lambing]] pens and dry lots), as well as residential facilities. The station is surrounded by the [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest]], as well being within two hours of the [[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]]  and [[Yellowstone National Park]]s.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=53-64-00-00 |title=Dubois, Idaho |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also holds roughly {{convert|16600|acre|km2|1}} within Montana's [[Centennial Mountains]] and {{convert|1200|acre|km2|1}} near [[Kilgore, Idaho]], both of which are used largely for seasonal grazing and rangeland research. The USSES spans several diverse [[ecosystems]], including [[subalpine]] [[meadow]], foothill, [[sagebrush steppe]], and [[desert shrubland]]. The station is the second largest employer in [[Clark County, Idaho]].&lt;ref name="ars"/&gt;

==Research==
The U.S. Sheep Experiment Station conducts research in the areas of [[ovine]] reproductive efficiency, genetic improvement (especially of [[List of sheep breeds|breeds]]), nutrient intake and use, ovine growth and development, range/grazing management, and product quality (i.e. [[Lamb and mutton|meat]] and [[wool]]). In addition to lambs and other attendant sheep, the station has a base flock of 3,000 mature sheep.&lt;ref name="ars"/&gt; 

Breeds developed at the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station include: 
* The [[Columbia (sheep)|Columbia]], a [[Dual use|dual-purpose breed]] and one of the first originating in the U.S. Early crosses were made in [[Wyoming]], but the originating flock was moved to the USSES in 1918.
* The [[Polypay (sheep)|Polypay]], developed in the 1960s. Known for its white wool and a high lambing rate.
* The [[Targhee (sheep)|Targhee]], a dual-purpose [[rangeland]] breed, named after the adjacent national forest.

One of the few areas of conflict when it comes to the station's research is its overlap with [[grizzly bear]] habitat. In 2010, the station made efforts to limit grazing in bear habitats,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_6361a398-41cd-11df-be5f-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Idaho sheep station halts grazing in bear habitat |work=[[Billings Gazette]] |date=April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 2013 environmental groups sued, claiming that its research activities continue to threaten grizzlies in the greater [[Yellowstone]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/groups-sue-federal-agency-over-sheep-research-station-after-grizzly/article_7b390052-c004-11e2-9ccf-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Groups sue federal agency over sheep research station after grizzly deaths |work=[[The Missoulian]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1860">The '''unifacial cambium''' (pl. '''cambia''' or '''cambiums''') produces cells to the interior of its cylinder.  These cells differentiate into [[xylem]] tissue.  Unlike the more common bifacial [[vascular cambium|cambium]] found in later [[woody plants]], the unifacial cambium does not produce [[phloem]] to its exterior.  Also in contrast to the bifacial cambium, the unifacial cambium is unable to expand its circumference with anticlinal cell division.  Cell elongation provides a limited amount of expansion.

== Unifacial cambium plant morphology and life cycles ==

The unifacial cambium allowed plants to grow as tall as 50 metres.  Lacking secondary phloem, unifacial cambium plants developed alternative strategies to long range nutrient transport.  For example, the stems of lycophyte trees were covered in photosynthesizing leaf bases.

Due to the limited capacity for circumference growth, unifacial cambium plants had very little wood compared to modern woody plants.  Xylem tissue in unifacial cambium plants was particularly structurally efficient.  Additional structural support was provided in lycophytes by a special periderm tissue in the outer cortex.

Lycophyte trees exhibit determinate growth.  These trees appear to have lived for most of their life cycle as a 'stump', establishing root networks underground, before shooting up rapidly, releasing spores, and dying shortly thereafter.

Bolivia's President [[Evo Morales]] told the conference that, one of the world's main polluters, the [[government of the United States|United States]] denied science, turned its backs on multilateralism, and attempted to deny a future to upcoming generations by its national government deciding to [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|leave the Paris agreement]], making "it the main threat to Mother Earth and life itself".&lt;ref name=aljazeera1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Papenfuss|first1=Mary|title=U.S. Lashed As 'Main Threat' To Environment at UN Ocean Conference|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-main-environmental-threat-united-nations_us_593618e4e4b0099e7faeaac2|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=6 June 2017|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wash1/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune1/&gt;&lt;ref name=townhall1/&gt; [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] called Trump's withdrawal "catastrophic" and the reaction from US mayors, governors and many in the corporate world as "wonderful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monaco's ruler: Trump should listen to scientists on climate|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/monacos-ruler-trump-should-listen-to-scientists-on-climate/2017/06/07/3eeca946-4bce-11e7-987c-42ab5745db2e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May Sweden's deputy prime minister [[Isabella Lövin]] stated that the United States is resisting plans to highlight how climate change is disrupting life in the oceans at the conference, that the US has negatively affected preparations and that "the decline of the oceans is really a threat to the entire planet" with a "need to start working together".&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW-US resists plan to link climate change, ocean health-UN co-chair|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20170530150853-6bg97|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. resists plan to link climate change, ocean health: U.N. co-chair|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-resists-plan-to-link-climate-change-ocean-health-un-co-chair-2017-5?IR=T|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=9 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovin also makes note of difficulties to engage with Washington in the conference, partly because key posts at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] remain unfilled since the end of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt;

&lt;!--Subsidies--&gt;
UNCTAD Secretary-General [[Mukhisa Kituyi]] states that [[subsidies]] from wealthy governments encourage overfishing, overcapacity and may contribute to [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal and unregulated fishing]], creating [[food insecurity]], unemployment and poverty for people relying mainly on fish as their primary source of nourishment or livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD and other global influencers gather to discuss eliminating harmful fisheries subsidies at UN Ocean Conference|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1494|accessdate=7 June 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and progress==&lt;!--/continuation/...--&gt;
&lt;!--Requires not just UN--&gt;
[[Marine biologist]] Ayana Elizabeth Johnson notes that the UN's work alone is not nearly enough and that for a solution to this existential crisis of the health of our global environment, strong and inspired leadership at all levels – from mayors, to governors, CEOs, scientists, artists and presidents is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ayana Elizabeth|title=Climate, Oceans, the United Nations, and What's Next|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2017/06/02/climate-oceans-the-united-nations-and-whats-next/|website=National Geographic Society (blogs)|accessdate=6 June 2017|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Goals and how much of it has been achieved etc--&gt;
In 2010 the international community agreed to protect 10% of the ocean by 2020 in the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]'s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and Sustainable

&lt;!--Organizers' résumé--&gt;
Peter Thomson called the conference was a success, stating that he was "satisfied with [its] results", that the conference "held at a very critical time" has "turned the tide on [[marine pollution]]". He says that "we are now working around the world to restore a relationship of balance and respect towards the ocean".&lt;ref name=unn1/&gt;&lt;ref name=xin1/&gt;

A '''vacuum chamber''' is a rigid enclosure from which air and other gases are removed by a [[vacuum pump]]. This results in a low-pressure environment within the chamber, commonly referred to as a [[vacuum]]. A vacuum environment allows researchers to conduct physical experiments or to test mechanical devices which must operate in [[outer space]] (for example) or for processes such as vacuum drying or vacuum coating. Chambers are typically made of metals which may or may not shield applied external magnetic fields depending on wall thickness, [[frequency]], [[resistivity]], and [[Permeation|permeability]] of the material used. Only [[Materials for use in vacuum|some materials]] are suitable for vacuum use.

Chambers often have multiple ports, covered with [[vacuum flange]]s, to allow instruments or windows to be installed in the walls of the chamber. In low to medium-vacuum applications, these are sealed with [[elastomer]] [[o-ring]]s. In higher vacuum applications, the flanges have knife edges machined onto them, which cut into a copper [[gasket]] when the flange is bolted on.

A type of vacuum chamber frequently used in the field of [[spacecraft]] engineering is a [[thermal vacuum chamber]], which provides a thermal environment representing what a spacecraft would experience in space.

==Vacuum chamber materials==
Vacuum chambers can be constructed of many materials. "Metals are arguably the most prevalent vacuum chamber materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danielson|first=PHil|title=Choosing the Right Vacuum Materials|url=http://www.vacuumlab.com/Articles/VacLab36.pdf|publisher=The Vacuum Lab|accessdate=February 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724150040/http://www.vacuumlab.com/Articles/VacLab36.pdf|archive-date=July 24, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strength, pressure, and permeability are considerations for selecting chamber material.
Common materials are:
* Stainless Steel
* Aluminum
* Mild Steel
* Brass
* High density ceramic
* Glass
* Acrylic
*hard steel

==Vacuum degassing==
"Vacuum degassing is the process of using vacuum to remove gases from compounds which become entrapped in the
mixture when mixing the components."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Degassing Epoxy &amp; Silicone|url=http://www.lacotech.com/ProductFiles/SMT-04-1013%20revA1%20(App%2006-14%20Vacuum%20Degassing%20Epoxy%20and%20Silicone).pdf|publisher=LACO Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To assure a bubble-free mold when mixing resin and silicone rubbers and slower-setting harder resins, a vacuum chamber is required. A small vacuum chamber is needed for de-airing (eliminating air bubbles) for materials prior to their setting. The process is fairly straightforward. The casting or molding material is mixed according to the manufacturers directions.

===Process===
Since the material may expand 4–5 times under a vacuum, the mixing container must be large enough to hold a volume of four to five times the amount of the original material that is being vacuumed to allow for the expansion; if not, it will spill over the top of the container requiring clean-up that can be avoided. The material container is then placed into the vacuum chamber; a vacuum pump is connected and turned on. Once the vacuum reaches {{nowrap|29 inches}} (at sea level) of mercury, the material will begin to rise (resembling [[foam]]). When the material falls, it will plateau and stop rising. The vacuuming is continued for another 2 to 3 minutes to make certain all of the air has been removed from the material. Once this interval is reached, the vacuum pump is shut off and the vacuum chamber release valve is opened to equalize air pressure. The vacuum chamber is opened, the material is removed and is ready to pour into the mold.

Though a maximum vacuum one can theoretically achieve at sea level is 29.921 inches of mercury (Hg,) this will vary significantly as altitude increases. For example, for a mold making in ''[[Denver, Colorado]]'', which sits at 5280 feet above sea level, one can only achieve a vacuum on the mercury scale of 24.896 Hg in their vacuum chamber. 

To keep the material air-free, it must be slowly poured in a high and narrow stream starting from the corner of the mold box, or mold, letting the material flow freely into the box or mold cavity. Usually, this method will not introduce any new bubbles into the vacuumed material. To ensure that the material is totally devoid of air bubbles, the entire mold/mold box may be placed in the chamber for an additional few minutes; this will assist the material in flowing into difficult areas of the mold/mold box.

==Vacuum drying==
Water and other liquids may accumulate on a product during the production process. "Vacuum is often employed as a process for removing bulk and absorbed water (or other solvents) from a product. Combined
with heat, vacuum can be an effective method for drying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum Drying|url=http://www.lacotech.com/ProductFiles/SMT-04-1011%20revA1%20(App%2005-07%20Vacuum%20Drying).pdf|publisher=LACO Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World's largest vacuum chamber==

[[NASA]]'s [[Space_Power_Facility#Thermal-Vacuum_Test_Chamber|Space Power Facility]] houses the world's largest vacuum chamber. It was built in 1969 and stands {{convert|122|ft|m}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, enclosing a [[bullet]]-shaped space. It was originally commissioned for nuclear-electric power studies under vacuum conditions, but was later decommissioned. Recently, it was recommissioned for use in testing [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems. Recent uses include testing the airbag landing systems for the [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, Spirit and Opportunity, under simulated Mars atmospheric conditions.
