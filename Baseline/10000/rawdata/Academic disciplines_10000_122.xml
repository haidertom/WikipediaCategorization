      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">'''Austal2000''' is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke&lt;ref name="Janicke"&gt;[http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm Web site of Ingenieurbüro Janicke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812134159/http://www.janicke.de/htm/e_home.htm |date=August 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.  

Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines.

==Description==

It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a [[random walk]] process ([[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian simulation model]]) and it has capabilities for [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|building effects]], complex terrain, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollutant plume]] depletion by [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet or dry deposition]], and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.&lt;ref name="AustalDownload"&gt;[http://www.austal2000.de/ Austal2000 download web site (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden-Württemberg.

'''Actor–network theory''' ('''ANT''') is a theoretical and methodological approach to [[social theory]] where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationship.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena.  Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to "describe" rather than "explain" social activity.  Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford university press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental aim of ANT is to explore how networks are built or assembled and maintained to achieve a specific objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/2579 Carroll, N., Richardson, I., and Whelan, E. (2012). Service science: an actor-network theory approach. International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation (IJANTTI);4(3), pp. 51-69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpx_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=carroll+A+Bureaucratic+View+of+Public+Service+Innovation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OrMOvhK-8k&amp;sig=YljSfKMKSn1HchgCBBiJYmRnMMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit-ITauIrQAhXDA8AKHbdPBS0Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carroll, N. (2014). Actor-Network Theory: A Bureaucratic View of Public Service Innovation, Chapter 7, Technological Advancements and the Impact of Actor-Network Theory, pp. 115-144, Publisher IGI Global, Hershey, PA]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is best known for its controversial insistence on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to act or participate in systems or [[Social network|networks]] or both, ANT is also associated with forceful critiques of conventional and critical sociology. Developed by [[science and technology studies]] (STS) scholars [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], the sociologist [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], and others, it can more technically be described as a "material-semiotic" method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and [[semiotic]] (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic.

Broadly speaking, ANT is a [[social constructivism|constructivist]] approach in that it avoids [[essentialist]] explanations of events or innovations (i.e. ANT explains a successful theory by understanding the combinations and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than saying it is true and the others are false). Likewise, it is not a cohesive theory in itself.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Rather, ANT functions as a strategy that assists people in being sensitive to terms and the often unexplored assumptions underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=A.|date=2010|title=Actor-Network Theory: sensitive terms and enduring tensions|url=http://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=75bbc661-0a89-475a-9eef-8c8c5a2e9904|journal=Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie. Sonderheft|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from many other [[science and technology studies|STS]] and sociological [[Social network|network theories]] for its distinct material-semiotic approach.

==Background and context==
ANT was first developed at the [[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]] (CSI) of the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] in the early 1980s by staff ([[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]]) and visitors (including [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]]). The 1984 book co-authored by John Law and fellow-sociologist Peter Lodge (''Science for Social Scientists''; London: Macmillan Press Ltd.) is a good example of early explorations of how the growth and structure of knowledge could be analyzed and interpreted through the interactions of actors and networks.  Initially created in an attempt to understand processes of innovation and knowledge-creation in science and technology, the approach drew on existing work in [[Science and technology studies|STS]], on studies of [[large technical system|large technological systems]], and on a range of French intellectual resources including the semiotics of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], the writing of philosopher [[Michel Serres]], and the [[Annales School]] of history.

ANT appears to reflect many of the preoccupations of French [[post-structuralism]], and in particular a concern with non-foundational and multiple material-semiotic relations. At the same time, it was much more firmly embedded in English-language academic traditions than most post-structuralist-influenced approaches. Its grounding in (predominantly English) [[science and technology studies]] was reflected in an intense commitment to the development of theory through qualitative empirical case-studies. Its links with largely US-originated work on large technical systems were reflected in its willingness to analyse large scale technological developments in an even-handed manner to include political, organizational, legal, technical and scientific factors.

Many of the characteristic ANT tools (including the notions of translation, generalized symmetry and the “heterogeneous network”), together with a [[scientometric]] tool for mapping innovations in science and technology (“co-word analysis”) were initially developed during the 1980s, predominantly in and around the CSI. The “state of the art” of ANT in the late 1980s is well-described in Latour’s 1987 text, ''Science in Action''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;Latour, B. (1987). ''[[Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society]].'' Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1990 onwards, ANT started to become popular as a tool for analysis in a range of fields beyond STS. It was picked up and developed by authors in parts of organizational analysis, informatics, health studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, feminist studies, technical communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895040|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Sarah|last2=Swarts|first2=Jason|date=2015|title=Visualizing and Tracing: Research Methodologies for the Study of Networked, Sociotechnical Activity, Otherwise Known as Knowledge Work|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|pages=14-44|doi=10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economics.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"&gt;Müller, M. and Schurr, C., 2016. Assemblage thinking and actor‐network theory: conjunctions, disjunctions, cross‐fertilisations. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 41(3), pp.217-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2008}}, ANT is a widespread, if controversial, range of material-semiotic approaches for the analysis of heterogeneous relations. In part because of its popularity, it is interpreted and used in a wide range of alternative and sometimes incompatible ways. There is no orthodoxy in current ANT, and different authors use the approach in substantially different ways. Some authors talk of “after-ANT” to refer to “successor projects” blending together different problem-focuses with those of ANT.&lt;ref&gt;John Law and John Hassard (eds) (1999). ''Actor Network Theory and After'' (Oxford and Keele: Blackwell and the Sociological Review).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A material-semiotic method==
Although it is called a “[[Philosophical theory|theory]]”, ANT does not usually explain “why” or "how" a network takes the form that it does.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; Rather, ANT is a way of thoroughly exploring the relational ties within a network (which can be a multitude of different things). As Latour notes,&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Latour, B. (1999). [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/46-TECHNOLOGY-DURABLE-GBpdf.pdf "Technology Is Society Made Durable"]. In Law, J., ed., ''Sociology of Monsters''.&lt;/ref&gt; "explanation does not follow from description; it is description taken that much further." It is not, in other words, a theory "of" anything, but rather a method, or a "how-to book" as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; puts it.

The approach is related to other versions of material-semiotics (notably the work of philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], and feminist scholar [[Donna Haraway]]). It can also be seen as a way of being faithful to the insights of [[ethnomethodology]] and its detailed descriptions of how common activities, habits and procedures sustain themselves.  Similarities between ANT and [[symbolic interactionist]] approaches such as the newer forms of [[grounded theory]] like [[situational analysis]], exist,&lt;ref&gt;Fernback, J., 2007. “Beyond the Diluted Community Concept: A Symbolic Interactionist Perspective on Online Social Relations.” ''New Media &amp; Society'', 9(1), pp.49-69. [[doi:10.1177/1461444807072417]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Latour&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A, &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. (2011). ''[http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 Bruno Latour: Hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023006/http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 |date=May 24, 2015 }}''. Suffolk: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; objects to such a comparison.

Although ANT is mostly associated with studies of science and technology and with the sociology of science, it has been making steady progress in other fields of sociology as well.  ANT is adamantly empirical, and as such yields useful insights and tools for sociological inquiry in general. ANT has been deployed in studies of identity and subjectivity, urban transportation systems, and passion and addiction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gomart, Emilie, and Hennion, Antoin (1999) “[https://www.academia.edu/866668/A_Sociology_of_Attachment_Music_Amateurs_Drug_Addicts A Sociology of Attachment: Music Amateurs, Drug Users]”.

==The actor-network==
As the term implies, the actor-network is the central concept in ANT. The term "network" is somewhat problematic in that as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;&lt;ref name=technology /&gt;&lt;ref name=on&gt;Latour, B. "[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-67%20ACTOR-NETWORK.pdf On Actor Network Theory: A Few Clarifications]"&lt;/ref&gt; notes, it has a number of unwanted connotations. Firstly, it implies that what is described takes the shape of a network, which is not necessarily the case. Secondly, it implies "transportation without deformation," which, in ANT, is not possible since any actor-network involves a vast number of [[#Translation|translations]]. Latour,&lt;ref name=on /&gt; however, still contends that network is a fitting term to use, because "it has no a priori order relation; it is not tied to the axiological myth of a top and of a bottom of society; it makes absolutely no assumption whether a specific locus is macro- or micro- and does not modify the tools to study the element 'a' or the element 'b'." This use of the term "network" is very similar to Deleuze and Guattari's [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomes]]; Latour &lt;ref name=technology /&gt; even remarks tongue in cheek that he would have no objection to renaming ANT "actant-rhizome ontology" if it only had sounded better, which hints at Latour's uneasiness with the word "theory".

Actor–network theory tries to explain how material–semiotic networks come together to act as a whole; the clusters of actors involved in creating meaning are both material and semiotic. As a part of this it may look at explicit strategies for relating different elements together into a network so that they form an apparently coherent whole. These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making.&lt;ref name=RtS&gt;Latour, B., 2005. ''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory]]''. Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that relations need to be repeatedly “performed” or the network will dissolve. They also assume that networks of relations are not intrinsically coherent, and may indeed contain conflicts. Social relations, in other words, are only ever in process, and must be [[Performativity|performed]] continuously.

Actants denote human and non-human actors, and in a network take the shape that they do by virtue of their relations with one another. It assumes that nothing lies outside the network of relations, and as noted above, suggests that there is no difference in the ability of technology, humans, animals, or other non-humans to act (and that there are only enacted alliances). As soon as an actor engages with an actor-network it too is caught up in the web of relations, and becomes part of the [[entelechy]].

If taken to its logical conclusion, then, nearly any actor can be considered merely a sum of other, smaller actors. A car is an example of a complex system. It contains many electronic and [[machine|mechanical]] components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as ''punctualisation'', and is similar to the idea of [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

When an actor network breaks down, the punctualisation effect tends to cease as well. In the automobile example above, a non-working engine would cause the driver to become aware of the car as a collection of parts rather than just a vehicle capable of transporting them from place to place. This can also occur when elements of a network act contrarily to the network as a whole. In his book ''Pandora’s Hope'', Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it becomes visible.

==Human and non-human actors==
ANT is often associated with the equal treatment of human and non-human actors. ANT assumes that all entities in a network can and should be described in the same terms. This is called the principle of ''[[generalized symmetry]]''. The rationale for this is that differences between them are generated in the network of relations, and should not be presupposed.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"/&gt;

===Intermediaries and mediators===
The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators, on the other hand, are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs. From an ANT point of view, sociology has tended to treat too much of the world as intermediaries.

For instance, a sociologist might take silk and nylon as intermediaries, holding that the former “means”, “reflects”, or “symbolises” the upper classes and the latter the lower classes. In such a view, the real-world silk–nylon difference is irrelevant — presumably, many other material differences could also, and do also, transport this class distinction. But taken as mediators, these fabrics would have to be engaged with by the analyst in their specificity: the internal real-world complexities of silk and nylon suddenly appear relevant, and are seen as actively constructing the ideological class distinction which they once merely reflected.

For the committed ANT analyst, social things like class distinctions in taste, as in the silk and nylon example, are examples of social construction, but also groups and power must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators. There is no stand-alone social repertoire lying in the background to be reflected off, expressed through, or substantiated in, interactions (as in an intermediary conception). That being said, it doesn't make sense to say there are social aspects of things. Things themselves are a constitutive part of the social reality they are able to enact.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;

==Other central concepts==

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (sociology)}}
Central to ANT is the concept of translation which is sometimes referred to as '''sociology of translation''', in which innovators attempt to create a ''forum,'' a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists try to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Callon (1986). “[http://www.vub.ac.be/SOCO/tesa/RENCOM/Callon%20%281986%29%20Some%20elements%20of%20a%20sociology%20of%20translation.pdf Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay]”. In John Law (ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Callon]] has defined 4 moments of translation: [[problematization]], [[interessement]], enrollment and mobilisation of allies.  Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions to mesh together.  Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005).

=== Tokens, or quasi-objects ===
In the above examples, “social order” and “functioning car” come into being through the successful interactions of their respective actor-networks, and actor-network theory refers to these creations as ''tokens'' or ''quasi-objects'' which are passed between actors within the network.

As the token is increasingly transmitted or passed through the network, it becomes increasingly punctualized and also increasingly [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]]. When the token is decreasingly transmitted, or when an actor fails to transmit the token (e.g., the oil pump breaks), punctualization and reification are decreased as well.

== Actor network theory and specific disciplines ==
Recently, there has been a movement to introduce Actor Network Theory as an analytical tool to a range of applied disciplines outside of sociology, including nursing, public health, business (Klein and Czarniawska, 2005), library and information science (Beagle, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal|url = |title = The Sociotechnical Networks of Scholarly Communication.|last = Beagle|first = Donald|date = 2001|journal = Portal: Libraries and the Academy |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=421–443|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;); urban studies (Farias and Bender, 2010), and community, urban, and regional planning (Beauregard, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning with Things|last = Beauregard|first = Robert|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=32 |pages=182–190|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauregard and Lieto, 2015; Rydin, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Using Actor-Network Theory to understand planning practice: Exploring relationships between actants in regulating low-carbon commercial development|last = Rydin|first = Yvonne|date = 2012|journal = Planning Theory |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–45|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rydin and Tate, 2016, Tate, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Growth management implementation in Metro Vancouver: Lessons  from actor network theory.|last = Tate|first = Laura|date = 2013|journal = Environment and Planning B |volume=40 |issue= |pages=783–800|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== ANT and international relations ===
Actor-Network Theory has become increasingly prominent within the discipline of [[International Relations]] and [[Political Science]].

Theoretically, scholars within IR have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.),&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015. [http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract "We have never been civilized: Torture and the Materiality of World Political Binaries."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204051611/http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract |date=2015-12-04 }} ''European Journal of International Relations'', [[doi:10.1177/1354066115616466]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR,&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, E. and Hobden, S, 2013. “Of parts and wholes: International Relations beyond the human.” ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies', 41(3), pp.430-450.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the infrastructures of world politics,&lt;ref&gt;Barry, A., 2013. “Material Politics.”&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the effects of technological agency.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, A., 2013. “Technological agency in the co-constitution of legal expertise and the US drone program.” ''Leiden Journal of International Law', 26(4), pp.811-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically, IR scholars have drawn on insights from ANT in order to study phenomena including political violences like the use of torture and drones,&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"/&gt; piracy and maritime governance,&lt;ref&gt;Bueger C., 2013. “Practice, pirates, and coast guards.” ''Third World Quarterly', 34(10), pp.1811-1827.&lt;/ref&gt; and garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Acuto, M., 2014. “Everyday International Relations.” ''International Political Sociology', 8(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ANT and design ===
The Actor-Network Theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object's structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects' design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaneva|first=Albena|title=Making the Social Hold: Towards an Actor-Network Theory of Design|journal=Design and Culture|publication-date=2009|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Actor–network theory insists on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to be actors or participants in networks and systems. Critics including figures such as [[Langdon Winner]] maintain that such properties as ''[[intentionality]]'' fundamentally distinguish humans from animals or from “things” (see [[Activity Theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, L. (1993). [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding It Empty : Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values"] (Vol. 18, pp. 362-378).&lt;/ref&gt; ANT scholars {{Who|date=December 2012}} respond with the following arguments:
* They do not attribute intentionality and similar properties to [[non human|nonhumans]].
* Their conception of [[human agency|agency]] does not presuppose intentionality.
* They locate agency neither in human “subjects” nor in non-human “objects”, but in heterogeneous associations of humans and nonhumans.

ANT has been criticized as amoral. [[Wiebe Bijker]] has responded to this criticism by stating that the amorality of ANT is not a necessity. Moral and political positions are possible, but one must first describe the network before taking up such positions. This position has been further explored by Stuart Shapiro who contrasts ANT with the history of ecology, and argues that research decisions are moral rather than methodological, but this moral dimension has been sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, S. (1997). Caught in a web: The implications of ecology for radical symmetry in STS. Social Epistemology, 11(1), 97-110. [[doi:10.1080/02691729708578832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle and Spicer note that "ANT has also sought to move beyond deterministic models that trace organizational phenomena back to powerful individuals, social structures, hegemonic discourses or technological effects. Rather, ANT prefers to seek out complex patterns of causality rooted in connections between actors." They argue that ANT's ontological realism makes it "less well equipped for pursuing a critical account of organizations—that is, one which recognises the unfolding nature of reality, considers the limits of knowledge and seeks to challenge structures of domination." &lt;ref&gt;Andrea Whittle and [[André Spicer]], 2008. Is actor network theory critique? ''Organization Studies'' 2008 29: 611&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that ANT does not account for pre-existing structures, such as power, but rather sees these structures as emerging from the actions of actors within the network and their ability to align in pursuit of their interests. Accordingly, ANT can be seen as an attempt to re-introduce [[Whig history]] into [[science and technology studies]]; like the myth of the [[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|heroic inventor]], ANT can be seen as an attempt to explain successful innovators by saying only that they were successful. Likewise, for organization studies, Whittle and Spicer assert that ANT is, "ill suited to the task of developing political alternatives to the imaginaries of market managerialism."

Key early criticism came from other members of the STS community, in particular the "Epistemological Chicken" debate between Collins and Yearley with responses from Latour and Callon as well as Woolgar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Collins and Yearley accused ANTs approach of collapsing into an endless relativist regress.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M., &amp; Yearley, S. (1992). Epistemological Chicken. In A. Pickering (Ed.), Science as Practice and Culture (pp. 301-326). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some critics&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, O. (1990). 'Surely You're Joking, Mr Latour!'. Science, Technology, Human Values. Vol.15(4) pp.495-504.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that research based on ANT perspectives remains entirely descriptive and fails to provide explanations for social processes. ANT—like comparable social scientific methods—requires judgement calls from the researcher as to which actors are important within a network and which are not. Critics{{Who|date=July 2013}} argue that the importance of particular actors cannot be determined in the absence of “out-of-network” criteria. Similarly, others{{Who|date=October 2014}} argue that actor-networks risk degenerating into endless chains of association ([[six degrees of separation]]—we are all networked to one another). Other research perspectives such as [[social constructionism]], [[social shaping of technology]], [[social network theory]], [[normalization process theory]], [[Diffusion of Innovations]] theory are held to be important alternatives to ANT approaches.

In a workshop called “On Recalling ANT”, [[Bruno Latour]] stated that there are four things wrong with actor-network theory: “actor”, “network”, “theory” and the hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf Keynote Speech: On Recalling ANT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210351/http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf |date=July 14, 2014 }}, Lancester University, Department of Sociology&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book however (''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network–Theory]]''), Latour reversed himself, accepting the wide use of the term, “''including'' the hyphen” (Latour 2005:9).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also remarked how he had been helpfully reminded that the ANT acronym “was perfectly fit for a blind, myopic, workaholic, trail-sniffing, and collective traveler” (the ant, Latour 2005:9) — qualitative hallmarks of actor-network [[epistemology]].

[[File:August Endell.jpg|thumb|August Endell]]
'''August Endell''' (1871–1925) was a designer, writer, teacher, and German [[Jugendstil]] architect. He is also known as one of the founders of the Jugendstil movement, the German expressionist movement of [[Art Nouveau]]. His first marriage was with [[Baroness Elsa|Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]].

==Life==
August Endell was born on April 12, 1871, in Berlin. In 1892 Endell moved to [[Munich]], where he gave up his dream of being a teacher and instead became a scholar. He studied aesthetics, psychology and philosophy, German literature, and art at the [[University of Munich]]. He had the intention to pursue a doctorate degree in academics, but changed direction when he met [[Hermann Obrist]], who became a close friend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MOMA| url = http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=1727 | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate = 2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose work was characterized by expressive ornamentation of observed submarine flora and fauna. Although influenced and encouraged by Obrist, Endell was primarily concerned with translating his idea of mobile space into architecture and decorations. Endell expressed important ideas on the stylistic intention underlying the work of Jugendstil artists at the time.&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"&gt;Buddensieg 1983 1–389"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 Endell joined the Initiative of Artistic Münchner Vereinigten Werkstätten für Kunst, and established himself as one of the innovators and leaders of the [[Kunstgewerbeschule|Kunstgewerbler]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, Irene. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1900, Endell met Else Plötz (later the [[Baroness Elsa|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]), then an actress and aspiring artist who took private art lessons from him.&lt;ref name="Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 109"&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was married in a civil service on 22 August 1901 in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 109"/&gt; They had an [[open relationship]], and in 1902 Else Endell became romantically involved with a friend of Endell’s, the [[poet]] and [[translator]] Felix Paul Greve (later the [[Canadians|Canadian]] author [[Frederick Philip Grove]]). After the trio travelled together to [[Palermo]], [[Italy]], the Endells’ marriage disintegrated&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the pair divorced in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Although their separation was acrimonious, and Freytag-Loringhoven dedicated several satirical poems to August Endell,&lt;ref&gt;Freytag-Loringhoven, Elsa von. ''Mein Mund ist lüstern / I Got Lusting Palate: Dada Verse''. Trans. and Ed. Irene Gammel. Berlin: Ebersback, 2005, 112–118.&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship was influential for both artists. Endell later married sculptor [[Anna Meyn]] (1882–1967), with whom he had a child. In 1918 Endell was appointed director of the Breslau Academy of Art, in which function he served until he fell ill and died on 13 April 1925 at the age of 54.

==Career==
Endell is noted for many designs. In 1897 he received his first commission, an important one that made him practically famous overnight: to design the façade of the [[Hofatelier Elvira|Atelier Elvira]] Photographic Studio in ([[Munich]]), which belonged to [[Hermann Obrist]].&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"/&gt; HIs design included an abstract depiction of a dragon coming out of a wave like element. His use of curve lines implied a sense of calmness to the intricate and massive piece. Organic elements  further enforced with the decoration of coral. The building incorporated elements of styles by [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Hector Guimard]]. Unfortunately the Atelier Elvira was burned to the ground during World War II.

[[File:Joseph Sattler-PAN.jpg|left|thumb|Cover by [[Joseph Sattler]] for 1895/96 issue of ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'']]

In 1899, August Endell became co editor of the magazine ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', a literary magazine that was published from 1895 to 1900 in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"/&gt; The magazine played a key role in the development of the [[Art Nouveau]] movement as a whole, printing illustrations by both well-known and young upcoming artists. . Endell published one of his own essays titled, " Um die Schönheit,” in which Endell comments on how exhibitions of art, stressed from nature is not a set of design ideal for art. Then writing that, “ … we are on the threshold of not only the new style, but also the development of a completely new art. The art of applying forms of nothing insignificant, not representing anything, and not resembling anything… running deep into our souls, so deeply and so strongly as only music can do.&lt;ref name="Mahler"&gt;{{citation|last=Mahler|first=Astrid|title=A World of Forms from Nature: New Impulses for the Aesthetic of the Jugendstil|work=Visual Resources: An International Journal of Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Endell believed that art and style should be the power of direct impact in form on viewer’s personal feelings.  His opinions of art and style were highly valued by other artists of the time such as, [[Franz Stuck]], [[Lovis Corinth]], and [[Ernst Kirchner]]; being favored highly by futurist artist and expressionists.&lt;ref name="Mahler"/&gt;  In his essays, Endell paved the way for abstract art in Germany. Endell’s personal art theory was based on a psychological aesthetic of perception. He believed formal art should be separate from nature. He felt very strongly about art evoking strong feelings through freely invented forms, just as music does through sounds. Endell also contributed illustrations and decorative designs for wall reliefs, carpets, textiles, coverings, window glass and lamps  to the publication ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]''&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"/&gt;

Not long after, in 1901, he contributed to the design of the Theater Bunte, in Berlin Germany, which has since been destroyed. Designing all the decorative elements, carpets, fabrics, and even the nails used in the building of the theater. Each area of the theater was painted a different diverse color, thus the name Theatre Bunte, Bunte meaning “colored.&lt;ref name="Mahler"/&gt;”

Endell was also responsible for the design of the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a notable courtyard complex in the centre of Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hackesche Höfe | url = http://www.berlin.de/orte/sehenswuerdigkeiten/hackesche-hoefe/index.en.php | publisher=Land Berlin | accessdate = 2011-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429164408/http://www.berlin.de/orte/sehenswuerdigkeiten/hackesche-hoefe/index.en.php| archivedate= April 29, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the design for a sanatorium in Wyk auf Föhr built in 1902. August Endell then went on to design several private homes and villas in the towns of Berlin and [[Potsdam]] in Germany.

All while working as a self-taught architect, Endell was continuously publishing articles, essays, and books on his thought of design. In 1908 he published the book The Beauty in the Big City. Within the book the vision of a modern city is developed through Endell’s artistic [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. He describes the city as taking place at the beginning of the 20th century. He describes the city as a place were work, culture, and art can all be exchanged. A few additional [[architectural]] designs August Endell worked on were; 1912 design of the Racecourse Gallop of Mariendorf, 1912 the Trabrennbahn in Berlin Germany, and in 1914 the temporary location of the exhibition of Deutscher Werkbund.

August Endell was a designer and an architect. From there he moved on to the idea of a new visual art and began creating fine art works that were architecturally structured while still expressing the qualities of other forms of art.
He began creating and building things such as gates, arches, stairway rails, and other decorative wall elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1633">The "'''Azes era'''" (also known as the Aja/Ajasa era), was named after the [[Indo-Scythian]] king, "King Azes the Great" or [[Azes I]]. As a number of inscriptions are dated in this era it is of great importance in dating the reigns of several kings and events in early [[Indian history]].

Earlier, some scholars believed that the Azes era was same as the [[Vikrama Samvat]] (57 BCE) used in India. However, this was disputed by Robert Bracey following discovery of an inscription of [[Vijayamitra]], which is dated in two eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alf Hiltebeitel |title=Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mahābhārata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLfHSOWKB-sC |date=2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-18566-6 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Falk and Bennett (2009) shows that these two were indeed separate eras, and that the Azes era can be dated with a high degree of likelihood to c. 48/47 or 47/46 BCE, depending on whether it began in the spring or the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Falk and Bennett (2009), pp. 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bondage''' is the practice of [[consent|consensually]] tying, binding, or restraining a partner for [[erotic]], [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], or [[somatosensory system|somatosensory stimulation]]. A partner may be [[physical restraint|physically restrained]] in a variety of ways, including the use of [[rope]], [[Handcuffs|cuffs]], [[bondage tape]], or [[self-adhering bandage]].

Bondage itself does not necessarily imply [[sadomasochism]]. Bondage may be used as an end in itself, as in the case of [[rope bondage]] and [[breast bondage]]. It may also be used as a part of [[human sexual behavior|sex]] or in conjunction with other [[BDSM]] activities. The letter "B" in the acronym "BDSM" comes from the word "bondage". [[Sexuality]] and [[erotica]] are an important aspect in bondage, but are often not the end in itself. Aesthetics also plays an important role in bondage.

A common reason for the active partner to tie up their partner is so both may gain pleasure from the restrained partner's submission and the feeling of the temporary transfer of control and power. For [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] people, bondage is often used as a means to an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The restrained partner can derive sensual pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility, and the active partner can derive visual pleasure and satisfaction from seeing their partner tied up.

Many couples incorporate bondage into their sex lives, often sporadically but sometimes more regularly, and find sexual bondage to be relationship-affirming.&lt;ref name="Keesling"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal &amp; Intimacy |last=Keesling |first=Barbara |authorlink= |author2= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Hunter House Publishers]] |location= |isbn=978-0-89793-148-9 |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes takes the form of a [[Sexual roleplay|sex game]] or [[sexual fantasy]] enactment. Bedroom bondage games are commonly used as a form of [[foreplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Come Hither: A Commonsense Guide to Kinky Sex |last=Brame |first=Gloria G. |authorlink= |author2= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location= |isbn=978-0-684-85462-5 |page=22 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They require and imply a level of trust and a surrender of control by the restrained to the active partner.&lt;ref name="Keesling" /&gt; The restrained partner (called a ''submissive'') surrenders control to the other partner (called a ''dominant''). This surrender of control happens voluntarily and under mutual understanding and consent.

The main feature of sexual bondage is that it renders the restrained person vulnerable to a variety of sex acts. The restrained partner is dependent for their sexual satisfaction on the actions of their partner, who may treat the restrained partner as their [[sex object]].

There are many reasons why people allow themselves to be bound. Some people feel a kind of freedom during corporal passivity, they can concentrate on their inner spirituality and feel at peace, as a participant in a study about motivation for bondage explained: "Some people have to be tied up to be free".&lt;ref&gt;Apostolides, Marianne: ''The Pleasure of Pain: Find out why one in 10 of us is into S&amp;M''. In: ''Psychology Today'', September/October 1999, ISSN 0033-3107.&lt;/ref&gt; Others experience helplessness, struggle against their bonds, and feel a degree of masochistic pleasure from the restraint and pain, as well as being unobstructed for erotic stimulation by their partner.

Bondage can be relatively simple to apply, enabling improvisation using household items and little experience. Bedroom bondage is usually mild bondage, with one partner voluntarily being put into restraints by being tied up or handcuffed. [[Blindfold]]s are a common part of bedroom play. The restrained partner is then typically [[sexual stimulation|sexually stimulated]] by [[masturbation]], [[Fingering (sex act)|fingering]], [[oral sex]], a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], or [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]]. Bondage can also be used for purposes other than sexual foreplay. For example, it may be used in [[Tickling fetishism|erotic tickling]] or for [[sexual teasing]].

The free partner may derive [[erotic]] pleasure or achieve [[sexual arousal]] from being in a dominant situation, while the tied partner may achieve arousal from being in a largely "helpless" position in the hands of a trusted partner. Either way, the partners are usually playing out bondage games to act out their [[sexual fantasies]].&lt;ref name="Keesling" /&gt;

In 1995, [[psychologist]]s [[Kurt Ernulf]] and [[Sune Innala]] from [[Sweden]] published an analysis based on answers from members of the bondage-oriented [[Usenet]] group ''[[alt.sex.bondage]]''. Most of the answers (76%) were from men. In 71% of the answers the active (restraining) role in bondage was played by heterosexual men, in 11% by heterosexual women and in 12% by homosexual men. 29% of the heterosexual men, 89% of the heterosexual women and 88% of the homosexual men played the passive (restrained) role. A third of the people who answered said they practised bondage in connection with [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] activities or at least thought bondage and sadomasochism belonged together.&lt;ref&gt;Ernulf, Kurt E.; Innala, Sune M.: ''Sexual Bondage: A Review and Unobtrusive Investigation''. In: ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 24, issue 6, 1995, pp. 631–654.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of American students conducted by a magazine in 1996, 24% of the people who replied claimed to have sexual fantasies involving bondage. This was claimed by 40% of the homosexual and bisexual men, 32% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 24% of the heterosexual women and 21% of the heterosexual men. 48% of the lesbian and bisexual women, 34% of the homosexual and bisexual men, and 25% of the heterosexual men and women had had practical experiences of bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Leland; Brantley, Cynthia: ''Sex on Campus''. [[Random House]], New York 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey conducted in the USA in 1985, about half of the men considered bondage erotic,&lt;ref&gt;Breslow, Norman; Evans, Linda; Langley, Jill: ''On the Prevalence and Roles of Females in the Sadomasochistic Subculture: Report of an Empirical Study''. In: ''Archives of Sexual Behavior''. 14/1985, pp. 303–317.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the 1993 publication ''Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', only 11% of the representatives had had practical experiences of bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia, L.; Samuel, S.: ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior''. Wiley, New York 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Because of the diversity in its forms, bondage can be divided into various different types based on its motivation.
[[File:Alsana Sin by ropemarks.jpg|thumb|[[Rope bondage]]: A [[Gag (BDSM)|gagged]] model bound in an uncomfortable position using [[breast bondage]] and [[crotch rope]]s]]

===Bondage for a purpose===
This form of bondage is the best known in BDSM, and denotes restraining the passive partner for an ulterior purpose, such as making them more accessible for a [[erotic spanking|spanking]] session. Bondage for its own sake is not considered in this category.&lt;ref name="Papiertiger"&gt;[http://www.datenschlag.org/papiertiger/lexikon/fesselspiele.html ''Fesselspiele''] in ''Der Papiertiger'', a BDSM encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decorative bondage===
In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is bound for a decorative purpose, to be used as an aesthetic object, for example for erotic photography, or a form of [[human furniture]] in a BDSM party.&lt;ref name="Papiertiger"/&gt;

===Torture bondage===

In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is purposefully bound in an uncomfortable or painful position, for example as a punishment in connection of a dominant/submissive sexual play. Almost any form of bondage, when the restrained partner is left tied up long enough, can be used as torture bondage. How long this punitive form of bondage is used for varies greatly, however in bondage erotica such as [[John Willie]]'s ''[[Sweet Gwendoline]]'' or [[Japanese bondage]] photography, it is often extensive and long-lasting.

===Film bondage===
Film bondage is a form of completely non-violent bondage for aesthetic purposes only. In this form of bondage, the restrained partner is bound lightly and is capable of escaping without great effort.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Kroll|Kroll, Eric]]: ''Fetish Girls''. [[Taschen]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditative bondage===
This form of bondage is seldom used in western bondage. However, in Japanese bondage ({{lang-ja|shibari}}), it is an important aspect, possibly originally having evolved from a religious tradition, where the interest is in the restrained partner's spiritual situation rather than their corporal situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Califia: ''Sensuous Magic: A Guide for Adventurous Lovers''. Mass Market Paperback, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public==
[[File:Woman topless on leash at Folsom Street Fair 2012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Petplay]]: Woman bound using a dog's chain at [[Folsom Street Fair]]]]
[[File:Folsom 2003 bondage demo cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Bondage demonstration at the 2003 [[Folsom Street Fair]].]]
A [[subculture]] of [[gay men]], sometimes called [[Leather subculture|leathermen]], were among the first groups to make obvious hints of their tastes in bondage in public. Other groups, including pansexual and heterosexual BDSM enthusiasts, later followed suit. Early public displays were mainly limited to the wearing of certain fashion items, such as collars and cuffs.

Over time, more explicit public displays arose. The most prominent examples are LGBT street fairs, such as the famous [[Folsom Street Fair]]. These events are few in number and highly controversial in most regions.

[[Exhibitionism|Exhibitionist]] displays are another manifestation of public bondage. They are typically undertaken by individuals who fetishize public displays of sex and sexuality. However, some exhibitionist bondage is done as a social or political statement. This could be an effort to raise awareness of alternative sexuality or a political metaphor for oppression.

BDSM clubs feature semi-public bondage. While the clubs and events are considered private, play parties feature open spaces where play occurs that allows other attendees to watch scenes in progress. Public play of this variety is more rooted in social activity and the safe space afforded by such clubs than exhibitionist fetishism.

==BDSM==
Bondage features prominently in [[BDSM scene]]s and [[sexual roleplay]]. It is the best known aspect of BDSM even outside the BDSM scene, and does not require a BDSM-oriented sexual identity to practice. Even so-called "vanilla" people can become masters of the technical aspects of tying their partners up.

Bondage has a sexual appeal to people of all sexes and all [[sexual orientation]]s, in a [[switch (BDSM)|switch]], [[dominance and submission|dominant (top) or submissive (bottom)]] role.

There are also some common fantasy settings in which bondage may be a component. These include:
* [[Rape fantasy|Rape, ravishment or abduction]]: The top fictitiously seizes or abducts the consenting bottom and has complete control.
* Dominance/submission: A training session occurs in which rewards for obedience and punishment for defiance are given. [[Erotic humiliation|Humiliation]] is usually involved.
* [[Predicament bondage]]: The bottom is given a choice between two tortures. For example, caning on the rear or flogging on the chest. If the bottom cannot stand one any longer, the top will start the other. This can also be done mechanically, like having a bottom squat and rigging a crotch rope to tighten if they attempt to stand.

Bondage is often combined with other sexual and BDSM techniques.

[[Self-bondage]] is more complex, and may involve special techniques to apply bondage to oneself, and also to effect a release after a lapsed period of time. Self-bondage is also notably risky: see the safety notes below. [[File:3 Layer Gag.ogv|thumb|Self-gagging]]

[[File:A Blue Coloured Monoglove style Armbinder.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|A woman wearing an [[armbinder]].]]
A large variety of [[bondage equipment]] is available for use in BDSM scenes for a number of results. These include rope, straps, or harnesses which can be used to hold limbs together; [[spreader bar]]s, [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|x-frames]] which can be used to keep limbs apart; the body or limbs can be tied to an object, such as to chairs or stocks; the body may be suspended from another object, as in [[suspension bondage]]; or it may used to restrict normal movement, such as use of [[hobble skirt]]s, [[handcuff]]s, or [[human pony|pony]] harness. Bondage may also be used to wrap the whole body or a part of it in bindings, such as cloth or plastic (saran wrap or cling film "mummification") as well as [[sleepsack (BDSM)|sleepsack]] bondage.

One of the purposes of bondage in BDSM is to restrain a person (typically called the [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]) in a [[BDSM position]]. This may involve simply tying the hands together in front or behind. Other positions involve the use of a waist belt to anchor the hands to the front, back or sides. Other popular positions are the [[spreadeagle (position)|spread eagle]], with the limbs splayed out and fastened by wrists and ankles to bedposts, door frame or some other anchoring point; the [[hogtie bondage|hogtie]], which secures each wrist to its corresponding ankle behind the back (wider, padded restraints such as [[bondage cuffs]] are recommended for this); the [[balltie]], which secures wrists to ankles, in front, with the knees drawn up to the chest; the [[crotch rope]], which involves pulling a rope between the labia to apply pressure to the female genitals. Sometimes a knot is placed in the rope at the position of the clitoris to intensify the sensation. A crotch rope can also be used on males, either placing pressure directly on the scrotum or including a tie to capture the scrotum. Other positions include the [[reverse prayer position]] (not recommended unless the subject has flexible shoulders), and an [[over-arm tie]], in which the arms are brought over the head, and the wrists fastened together behind the head and then by a length of rope, chain or strapping to a belt at the waist.

The types of restraints used in bondage include [[rope]], which is often preferred because of its flexibility. [[bondage rigger|Rigging]], however, requires considerable skill and practice to do safely. Other types of restraints include chains, [[handcuff]]s, [[thumbcuffs]] and [[belly chains]]. Institutional restraints, such as [[straitjacket]]s may be used in some roleplays, and purpose-made bondage gear, such as [[monoglove]]s, [[sleepsack (BDSM)|sleepsacks]], [[bondage hook]]s and [[bondage table]]s, are also available.

Some BDSM [[play party (BDSM)|play parties]] offer "bondage workshops", where couples, or people otherwise consenting with each other, can practice tying under the instruction and supervision of an experienced [[bondage rigger]].

== Safety ==
[[File:Gefährdete Regionen in der Grundhaltung einer klassischen Oberkörperbondage.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Areas vulnerable to damage in classic upper body bondage are marked out in red.]]
Bondage is safer when conducted between sober, trusted partners who are fully aware of the risks involved and the precautions necessary to ensure safety, such as informed consent. Partners who are in committed relationships may have a greater basis for trusting each other. Performing acts in a supervised location, such as a [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], or with a group of trusted friends may also increase safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fetish.com/community/magazine/bdsm-toys/dungeon-bondage-beginners-caning-bench|title=Beginners Guide - Dungeon Bondage: Caning Benches &amp; Spanking|author=|date=|website=Fetish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a subculture of people who seek out others interested in bondage and pursue such activities with people who they do not know well. This subculture has given rise to Safe, Sane &amp; Consensual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=|title=Safe Sane Consensual|url=http://kinkweekly.com/ssc/|magazine=Kink Weekly|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precautions===

Safety precautions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Erotic Bondage Handbook |last=Wiseman |first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Wiseman |author2= |year=2000 |publisher=[[Greenery Press]] |location=Oakland, CA |isbn=1-890159-13-1 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The use of a "[[safeword]]", or some clear way for the subject to indicate genuine distress and a wish to discontinue, temporarily stop or vary the activities of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Philip; Devon, Molly: ''Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism''. 1st edition, [[Mystic Rose Books]], 1988. {{ISBN|0-9645960-0-8}}, pp. 95–106.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Never leaving a bound person alone.
* Avoiding positions or restraints which may induce [[postural asphyxia]].
* Making sure that the subject changes positions at least once an hour (to avoid [[circulation (physiology)|circulation]] problems).
* Making sure that the subject can be released quickly in an emergency.
* Avoiding restraints which impair breathing. (Gags or hoods which block the mouth can become [[asphyxial]] hazards if the subject vomits or the nose becomes otherwise blocked.)
* Remaining sober; alcohol and drugs should be avoided.

[[File:BoundCon 2013 custom photoshoot 8 picture 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3| [[Suspension bondage]]: A woman being hung upside down using adequate precautions at [[Bound Con]] event, Germany, 2013.]]

Accidents and lasting damage can generally be avoided by very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject every so often if he or she is all right. Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does not get enough oxygen turns bluish. If blood can get in, but cannot get out because one of the veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.

If the subject has been gagged or can otherwise not verbally communicate, a different form of the [[safeword]] is needed. For instance, they may hum a simple tune, or opening and closing one or both hands repeatedly, or releasing an object held in one hand (such as a rubber ball, or a scarf).

[[Suspension bondage]] by hanging upside-down can be especially risky. The danger most often associated with it is falling on your head.  Other dangers include [[nerve]] compression, circulation problems and fainting due to increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Federation Francaise de Speleologie | title = Harness Induced Pathology | work = Petzl Work/Rescue Catalog | year = 1997 | url = http://www.caves.org/grotto/nag/html/harness.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051216185233/http://www.caves.org/grotto/nag/html/harness.html | archivedate = 16 December 2005 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Seldon | title = Harness suspension: review and evaluation of existing information | publisher=UK Health and Safety Executive | work=Contract Research Report 451 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/RESEARCH/crr_pdf/2002/crr02451.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparations===

Some simple preparations may also be helpful:
* Food. It is common &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openmindedhealth.com/2011/06/rope-bondage|title=Rope Bondage|author=|date=25 June 2011|website=Open Minded Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; for people (especially those on diets) to [[fainting|faint]] during a long session. Having a regular meal beforehand is recommended; being fed small snacks during play may also help prevent fainting.
* Cutting tools. A pair of [[EMT scissors]] is recommended (useful for safely cutting rope and tape off skin).
* Keyed-alike padlocks, if chains are being used.

Scenes depicted in bondage photographs and videos are chosen for their visual appeal and fantasy value. Sometimes these positions are dangerous or cannot be maintained for more than a few minutes (i.e., "don't try this at home") such as inverted bondage or suspension from the wrists and ankles. In many cases they cannot be "acted out" with good results and are only for extremely physically fit and very experienced BDSM participants. Especially in highly artistic Japanese bondage, years of experience of bondage is required to avoid the risks.

[[Self-bondage]] carries a higher risk, particularly because it violates an important principle of bondage safety; to never leave a bound person alone. For the feeling of being tied up to be as authentic as possible, practitioners of self-bondage can use time-limit clocks, freeze their keys in blocks of ice, or use self-invented devices, in order to temporarily abandon power over their own restraint and freedom (called "tunnel play").

Without someone to release them in the event of an emergency or medical crisis, self-bondage can lead to severe and permanent physical damage. Especially in combination with [[asphyxiation]], self-bondage can be lethal to its practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpus-delicti.com/auto.html|title=Corpus-delicti.com|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
[[File:Slave at St. Andrews cross (3092).jpg|thumb|upright|A woman chained to a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|Saint Andrew's Cross]].]]
[[File:Exxxotica NJ 2013-066.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Two women mummified using duct tape, restraining their entire body, at [[Exxxotica]] 2013.]]

Bondage techniques can be divided into six main categories:
* Binding body parts, such as arms or legs, together.
* Spreading out body parts, such as arms or legs.
* Binding the restrained partner to an outside object, such as a [[Saint Andrew's Cross (BDSM)|Saint Andrew's Cross]], a chair, or a table.
* Suspending the restrained partner from the ceiling.
* Hindering or slowing down the movement of the restrained partner, such as with a [[hobble skirt]] or a [[corset]].
* Wrapping the restrained partner up in soft, elastic material, thus restraining their entire body. This is known as mummification.

Many people feel that bondage must be "rough and tough", as seen in many images of bondage erotica, but this is not always true. In so-called "soft bondage", the active partner can simply hold the restrained partner's hands together with their own hands, handcuff the restrained partner, or simply order the restrained partner not to move their hands, without using any physical restraint. This latter case, called "verbal bondage", appeals to many people and is far more common than most people {{who|date=July 2015}} think.

A popular variant of bondage considers the artistic and aesthetic part of tying a person up more than the transfer of power and control, or the sexual pleasure. This type of bondage is called "shibari" or "kinbaku", and comes originally from [[Japanese bondage]]. Shibari / kinbaku can be practised either in the traditional Japanese way or in conjunction with western bondage.

=== Techniques of rope bondage ===
[[Rope bondage]] is perhaps the best known and most used form of bondage. There are several forms of rope bondage.
; Rope wrapping: The rope is simply wrapped around the restrained partner's upper body, or in some cases, his/her entire body.
; Rope weaving: A more complicated technique, where a rope is first wrapped around the restrained partner's body in a zig-zag pattern, and then a second rope is woven around it.
; Double rope technique: The restrained partner is bound by two ropes at once, allowing decorative rope patterns to be applied quickly.
; Single rope technique: A sure technique, most often used in conjunction with sadomasochism, where the restrained partner is bound by only one rope.&lt;ref name="Papiertiger"/&gt;

=== Terms used in bondage ===
[[File:BoundCon 2013 bondage challenge 6.jpg|thumb|right|Two women in [[frogtie]] bondage.]]
In the American-European bondage scene, specific terms have developed for different kinds of bondage. The terms most often used in the European bondage subculture are in English, although some bondage term come from the Japanese language, such as ''kata'' (bondage position) or ''musubime'' (bondage knot). Examples of simple bondage techniques are the "spread eagle", where the restrained partner's each limb is tied to a different corner of a bed,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jay Wiseman|Wiseman, Jay]]: ''Jay Wiseman's Erotic Bondage Handbook''. Greenery Press, {{ISBN|1-890159-13-1}}, pp. 193–203.&lt;/ref&gt; or the "[[hogtie bondage|hogtie]]", where the restrained partner's hands and feet are both tied, and the ropes tying these are connected with each other, holding the restrained partner in a bent position. A "crotch rope" is sometimes used, where a rope is passed between the partner's legs, applying pressure to the genitals.

== Materials ==
Just about any material that can be used to hinder or restrain a person's movement can be used in bondage. Bondage can be performed with everyday objects or specially designed BDSM equipment.

In less BDSM-oriented vanilla bondage everyday objects, such as silk scarves, stockings, neckties and belts are often used. Soft objects such as these can also be used for binding in front of the restrained partner's eyes, temporarily blinding them.

"Verbal bondage" is bondage without physical restraint, the subject is simply given orders not to move, or only move in a restrained fashion.

===Rope===
{{Main article|Rope bondage|Bondage rope harness}}

Rope is very often used in bondage as a material for physical restraint. In the western world, almost any kind of rope can be used for bondage, such as cotton, artificial fibers, or other materials. However, in Japanese bondage (shibari), only ropes made of [[hemp]] or [[jute]] are usually used. In Japanese bondage, the rope is usually well prepared before it can be used, so that it becomes soft and easily bendable. Between bondage sessions, the rope is cleaned by washing it.

Regardless of the type of rope used for bondage, temporary superficial damage to the skin can appear where the rope has applied pressure, this is called "rope burns".&lt;ref&gt;Mass Sadist: ''B.D.S.M. 4 Dummies''. Lulu.com, 2006. {{ISBN|1-4303-0975-X}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In emergency situations, [[EMT scissors]] provide a quick way to free the restrained partner, however this destroys the rope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jay Wiseman|Wiseman, Jay]]: ''The Toybag Guide to Dungeon Emergencies and Supplies''. Greenery Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-890159-54-9}}, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metal===
{{Main article|Metal bondage}}

Metal (especially steel) is often used in bondage, most often in [[handcuffs]], [[legcuffs]], [[thumbcuffs]], hooks and chains, and is often combined with other materials. Apart from the durability of metal and the flexibility of metal items, metal appeals to many people because of its tough image and the sheer toughness of being bound by metal items. Metal is practically immune to struggling and escape. In BDSM erotica, metal chains are often associated with historical torture and prison scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Stargraves: ''The Shuttered House''. Last Gasp, 2003. {{ISBN|1-900058-37-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldiss, Allan: ''Slaveship''. Bondage Books, 2006. {{ISBN|0-9549966-4-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from pure metal chains, [[cable tie]]s are also often used as a quick way to tie someone up securely. These ties can leave burn marks on the skin when applied too tightly, and because of their durability and resistance to struggling, must be handled carefully when applied to joints or being left in place for a longer time.

===Leather, latex and polish===
{{See also|Bondage suit}}
[[File:2 Pup Pride Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|A neoprene dog hood used in the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]]&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;]]
Products made of leather are often used in bondage because of their flexibility and resistance to tearing. Because leather is easy to acquire, care for and work upon, it is one of the most popular materials for home-made bondage items. Many people have a fetish for leather, [[latex]] and [[polishing|polish]] and use these materials in connection with bondage, for example for cuffs, belts or neck bands. There are special bondage skirts, trousers or sacks made of these materials, as well as clothing and equipment for BDSM role play that can be used in connection with bondage. For example, harnesses are used in [[pony play]], but would not be used without the corresponding role play.&lt;ref name=SBS&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/726963267928/pup-play-men-who-live-as-dogs  |title=Pup play men who live as dogs |date=18 July 2016|work=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bondage erotica ==
[[File:Three women posing in grease and ropes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Erotic pose of three women in bondage gear.]]
Some people regard bondage to be [[eroticism|erotically]] [[sexual stimulation|stimulating]] or [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]]. Bondage features in some [[sexual fantasy]] scenarios. Bondage themes are present in some erotica and pornography.

[[Bondage pornography]] for heterosexual men almost overwhelmingly depicts bound women, rather than bound men, despite the fact that one of the most common fantasies in both sexes is being bound.

Bondage fantasies often involve dressing in a role outfit. Typical outfits for the submissive person invoke common icons of passivity or sexual innocence (e.g. a [[shepherd]]ess, [[nun]] or schoolgirl outfit for women, or a leather slave harness and cuffs, thong, or ancient slave outfit for men). In a similar respect, the dominant person's attire often reflect images of power, control, and extreme discipline (a [[Nazi]] officer, military officer, police or [[prison warden]] uniform).

==Spiritual aspects==
Some people who have been put into long-term deep bondage (mummification) have reported having [[Out-of-body experience|out-of-the-body experiences]] and there are some who desire to be put in deep bondage for this reason.  A [[New Age]] form of bondage is being immersed a [[sensory deprivation tank]] for the express purpose of having an out-of-the-body experience as was practiced while on [[ketamine]] by [[John C. Lilly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. Lilly|Lilly, John C.]] ''The Center of the Cyclone'' 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art and popular culture==
[[File:Blacklight Shibari.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Bondage with fluorescent ropes.]]

Bondage is also presented in erotic and mainstream literary forms, including cartoons and magazines, and depicted in erotic art, such as some of the works of [[Gustave Doré]] and [[John Everett Millais]]. The mythical [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] was a popular subject for bondage in art by painters including [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'' (1630), [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1840), [[Edward Poynter]] (1869) and [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).

Other popular scenarios for bondage in art was that of [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] from the fifteenth century epic poem ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', which is itself a continuation of the romantic epic saga ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', which is similar to that of Andromeda in that the heroine is offered as a sacrifice to the sea gods; and the [[damsel in distress]] theme. The damsel in distress theme was also used in ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914) motion picture serial, which found [[Pearl White]] in mortal danger on a weekly basis.

Depictions of bondage in art may be erotic, in which case they follow a heteronormative model and tend to depict a young woman in danger and fear. ''Bizarre'' was a fetish and [[bondage magazine]] published between 1946–1959 by [[bondage artist]] [[John Willie]]. It included drawings and photographs using professional [[bondage model]]s in bondage or [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] scenes. [[Sweet Gwendoline]] was the main female character in his works, published largely in the 1950s and 60's, and possibly the most famous bondage icon after [[Bettie Page]]. She was repeatedly depicted as the stereotypical naïve blonde damsel in distress.

Bondage received a positive (if brief) treatment in ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'', a mainstream [[sex manual]] popular in the 1970s. The publication of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s book, ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'', which included photographs of bound nudes, did a great deal to improve public awareness of the acceptance of bondage.

By the 1990s, references to bondage could be found in [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] prime-time television series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', where equipment such as [[handcuffs]] or [[collar (BDSM)|collar]]s and concepts such as the [[safeword]] were included as a matter of course.

''[[The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]]'' was an erotic trilogy published in the 1980s by [[Anne Rice]] which contained bondage scenarios, as part of a wide range of BDSM acts.

Other examples of bondage erotica include [[Pauline Réage]]'s ''[[Story of O]]'', [[Frank E. Campbell (writer)|Frank E. Campbell]]'s books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backdrop.net/sm-201/index.php?title=F._E._Campbell|title=Backdrop.net|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the artwork of Robert Bishop.

The [[Fifty Shades trilogy|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] by E.L. James was first published in ebook in 2011 and subsequently went on to become a bestseller. The print edition of the first book, ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' was published in 2012 and became the fastest selling bestseller, breaking multiple sales records. The trilogy revolves entirely around a fictional BDSM relationship; though it is widely considered a poor representation of BDSM relationships by those in the BDSM scene, partially for its negative representation of women. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[File:The logo of the Centre for Integrative Bee Research as used since 2010.jpg|thumb|The Ciber Logo]]
The '''Centre for Integrative Bee Research''' ('''CIBER''') is located on the Crawley campus at the [[University of Western Australia]] in [[Perth]]. CIBER conducts basic scientific research into [[honeybee]] reproduction, immunity and ecology and aligns its work with the needs of industrial and governmental partners. CIBER is specifically dedicated to facilitate interdisciplinary research and offers opportunities for scientists to perform collaborative research on honeybees using methods and approaches from [[systems biology]] and [[evolutionary ecology]]. The ultimate goal is to better understand how individual molecules and their interplay are responsible for complex biological process such as sexual reproduction or immunity. Research conducted at CIBER is done in close collaboration with the local [[beekeeping]] industry, notably the Better Bees of Western Australia bee breeding program. The research group consists of 20–30 researchers from all different academic levels as well as representatives from the governmental and honeybee industry sector.  The research group also runs an outreach program and was involved in the making of the theatrical movie ''[[More than Honey]]''.

== History ==

Reports about dramatic declines in a number of global honeybee populations, especially in commercially managed stock, resulted in an inquiry of the Australian Parliament into the future of the Australian honey bee industry. A house standing committee on Primary Industries and Resources finally published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=House of Representatives, Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources|title=More Than Honey: The future of the Australian honey bee and pollination industries |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=/pir/honeybee/report.htm|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 June 2008 that summarised the situation of the honeybee industry in Australia.  Among a large number of recommendations, the report identified an urgent need for more research to address existing and future problems of Australian honeybees, the bee industry and recommended a substantial increase in funding for honeybee research. The need for additional and coordinated research into honeybees stimulated in a number of initiatives from Australian researchers and research institutions. However, it became clear that the geographical isolation of Western Australia and the ban to import bees or some bee products into the state requires the buildup of a specific research hub. CIBER was formally set up as the Collaborative Initiative for Bee Research at the [[University of Western Australia]] in 2008 and was renamed in 2011 to Centre for Integrative Bee Research. The name change coincided with the introduction of a new logo, that is currently still in use. In 2017 CIBER shifted its operations from the University of Western Australia to the University of California, Riverside campus.  See http://ciber.ucr.acsitefactory.com/

== Research ==
The interdisciplinary approach is one of the core characteristics of CIBER’s activities, which run along two different gradients: First, CIBER connects several disciplines of research including the molecular and nano sciences, evolutionary biology, and sociobiology, as well as economics. Second, CIBER bridges fundamental and applied sciences by generating new knowledge in areas of practical interest for honeybee industry partners. CIBER uses a number of modern molecular technologies such as [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] to identify molecules involved in physiological processes such as reproduction or immunity. Research conducted at CIBER pioneered a novel scientific field in research known as evolutionary proteomics. The central idea is to understand how evolutionary processes operate on the molecular level. Researchers at CIBER conducted the first large scale analyses of the proteins present in glandular secretions supporting honeybee sperm, such as seminal fluid and spermathecal fluid.

For experimental work, CIBER maintains and breeds its own bee stock of around 60 colonies, kept at an apiary on the campus of the University of Western Australia. During the winter month, most of the bee stock is moved north to overwintering grounds.

CIBER personnel is represented in a number of National boards and councils to provide expertise and advice on issues about honeybees, for example the [http://www.rirdc.gov.au/research-programs/animal-industries/honeybee RIRDC Honeybee Advisory Board], the Primary Producers Committee or the  [http://asianhoneybee.net.au/ Asian Honeybee Transition to Management Scientific Advisory group].

== Collaboration with the honeybee industry ==
A number of research projects are done in collaboration with local beekeepers. To do this, CIBER received funding in 2009 from the [[Australian Research Council]] to conduct research on male honeybee fertility together with '''Better Bees of Western Australia''' as an industry partner. 
Better Bees of Western Australia is a group of 8 commercial beekeepers. Each individual beekeeper owns and maintains some of the 24 bee lineages that are recognized as part of "The Western Australian Bee Breeding Program". The aim of the honey bee breeding program is to maintain a genetic pool of honey bee breeding stock for the WA apiary industry to use in maintaining a healthy population of managed honeybees.
In 2013 CIBER and Better Bees received a second grant from the [[Australian Research Council]] to study the fungal disease Nosema and its interactions with the honeybee immune system.

== CIBER outreach ==
The research and activities of CIBER are communicated to the broader public through an outreach program, which includes the organisation of public lectures and seminars, the showing of bees to the public and in schools and exhibitions, as well as activities during the yearly honeybee week. In 2011, CIBER and the [[Perth]] based museum SciTech organised an exhibition "The Science of Honeybees", which initially ran for 6 months at SciTech, then toured through schools and libraries in Western Australia. The success of the exhibition insipired plans for a permanent CIBER - Honeybee exhibition at [[Scitech|SciTech]], which was scheduled to open in 2013.
CIBER also maintains its own [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Centre-for-Integrative-Bee-Research-CIBER/107607792730734 facebook page], which allows interested users to follow ongoing activities at CIBER as well as get updated information on honeybees in general.
CIBER is also involved in organisation of the yearly Honey Week, which is held annually in May. Honey week is an Australia-wide initiative to showcase bees and beekeeping to the public.
The outreach activities of CIBER were awarded with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140923093546/http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/science/ScienceAwards/Pages/2014Winners.aspx Premier's Science Award] of Western Australia in 2014, acknowledging its success in raising community awareness about the importance of honeybees in the environment.

== ''More than Honey'' movie==
CIBER was involved in the making of the theatrical documentary ''[[More than Honey]]'' by Swiss film maker [[Markus Imhoof]], which was released into several European movie theatres in 2012. The group provided scientific advisory for the film, and some of the research conducted at CIBER is featured in the film. The movie had its world premiere on 11 August 2012, concluding the [[Locarno film festival]] in Switzerland and was later on shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) in September 2012. The documentary was the most successful Swiss film of 2012 and is the most successful Swiss documentary movie of all time. The movie was awarded more than 25 international prizes such as the German and Swiss Film Awards for best documentary, and became the Swiss candidate for a nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards (Oscar) . CIBER actively promoted screenings of the movie in Australia as part of the [http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/fia/ffg/fil/fuef/enindex.htm German Film Festival] and maintains the official [http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/blog/ English] and [http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/blog/?lang=de German] blog of the movie.

== Future Bees Fund ==

For fund raising purposes and in order to finance activities such as bee research, beekeeping and outreach activities, CIBER set up the [http://www.futurebeesfund.org Future Bees Fund] in 2013, which is a non-profit fund located at the University of Western Australia. A board consisting of representatives from research and the bee keeping industry decides on the usage of funds available and to help publicise the fund activities.

'''Ceramic engineering''' is the science and technology of creating objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials. This is done either by the action of heat, or at lower temperatures using precipitation reactions from high-purity chemical solutions. The term includes the purification of raw materials, the study and production of the chemical compounds concerned, their formation into components and the study of their structure, composition and properties.

[[Ceramic materials]] may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure, with long-range order on atomic scale. Glass ceramics may have an amorphous or glassy structure, with limited or short-range atomic order. They are either formed from a molten mass that solidifies on cooling, formed and matured by the action of heat, or chemically synthesized at low temperatures using, for example, [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal]] or [[sol-gel]] synthesis.

The special character of ceramic materials gives rise to many applications in [[materials engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[chemical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]]. As ceramics are heat resistant, they can be used for many tasks for which materials like metal and [[polymers]] are unsuitable. Ceramic materials are used in a wide range of industries, including mining, aerospace, medicine, refinery, food and chemical industries, packaging science, electronics, industrial and transmission electricity, and guided lightwave transmission.&lt;ref name="KBU"&gt;Kingery, W.D., Bowen, H.K., and Uhlmann, D.R., ''Introduction to Ceramics'', p. 690 (Wiley-Interscience, 2nd Edition, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The word "[[ceramic]]" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word κεραμικός (''keramikos'') meaning [[pottery]]. It is related to the older [[Indo-European language]] root "to burn",
&lt;ref name=hippel&gt;
{{cite book|author1=von Hippel |author2=A. R. | chapter= Ceramics| title = Dielectric Materials and Applications| publisher = Technology Press (M.I.T.) and John Wiley &amp; Sons| year = 1954| isbn = 1-58053-123-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
"Ceramic" may be used as a noun in the singular to refer to a ceramic material or the product of ceramic manufacture, or as an adjective. The plural "ceramics" may be used to refer the making of things out of ceramic materials. Ceramic engineering, like many sciences, evolved from a different discipline by today's standards. Materials science engineering is grouped with ceramics engineering to this day.

[[File:Sabbiatrice.jpg|thumb|Leo Morandi's tile glazing line (circa 1945)]]

Abraham Darby first used [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] in 1709 in Shropshire, England, to improve the yield of a smelting process. Coke is now widely used to produce carbide ceramics. Potter [[Josiah Wedgwood]] opened the first modern ceramics factory in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], England, in 1759. Austrian chemist [[Carl Josef Bayer]], working for the textile industry in Russia, developed a [[Bayer process|process]] to separate [[alumina]] from [[bauxite]] ore in 1888. The Bayer process is still used to purify alumina for the ceramic and aluminium industries. Brothers Pierre and Jacques [[Pierre Curie|Curie]] discovered [[piezoelectricity]] in Rochelle salt circa 1880. Piezoelectricity is one of the key properties of [[electroceramics]].

[[Edward Goodrich Acheson|E.G. Acheson]] heated a mixture of coke and [[clay]] in 1893, and invented carborundum, or synthetic [[silicon carbide]]. [[Henri Moissan]] also synthesized SiC and [[tungsten carbide]] in his [[electric arc furnace]] in Paris about the same time as Acheson. Karl Schröter used liquid-phase [[sintering]] to bond or "cement" Moissan's tungsten carbide particles with cobalt in 1923 in Germany. Cemented (metal-bonded) [[carbide]] edges greatly increase the durability of [[hardened steel]] cutting tools. [[Walther Nernst|W.H. Nernst]] developed [[Cubic zirconia|cubic-stabilized zirconia]] in the 1920s in Berlin. This material is used as an oxygen sensor in exhaust systems. The main limitation on the use of ceramics in engineering is brittleness.

=== Military ===

[[File:Nightvision.jpg|thumb|Soldiers pictured during the [[2003 Iraq War]] seen through IR transparent Night Vision Goggles]]

The [[military]] requirements of [[World War II]] encouraged developments, which created a need for high-performance materials and helped speed the development of ceramic science and engineering. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, new types of ceramics were developed in response to advances in atomic energy, electronics, communications, and space travel. The discovery of ceramic superconductors in 1986 has spurred intense research to develop superconducting ceramic parts for electronic devices, electric motors, and transportation equipment.

There is an increasing need in the military sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to transmit light around the visible (0.4–0.7 micrometers) and mid-infrared (1–5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring [[transparent armour]]. Transparent armor is a material or system of materials designed to be optically transparent, yet protect from fragmentation or ballistic impacts. The primary requirement for a transparent armour system is to not only defeat the designated threat but also provide a multi-hit capability with minimized distortion of surrounding areas. Transparent armour windows must also be compatible with night vision equipment. New materials that are thinner, lightweight, and offer better ballistic performance are being sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.405270|title=Proceedings of SPIE|chapter=Transparent ceramics for armour and EM window applications|year=2000|last1=Patel|first1=Parimal J.|volume=4102|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such solid-state components have found widespread use for various applications in the electro-optical field including: [[fibre optics|optical fibres]] for guided lightwave transmission, [[optical]] [[switches]], laser [[amplifiers]] and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], hosts for solid-state [[lasers]] and optical window materials for gas lasers, and [[Infrared homing|infrared (IR) heat seeking devices]] for [[missile guidance]] systems and [[night vision devices|IR night vision]].

== Modern industry ==

Now a multibillion-dollar a year industry, ceramic engineering and research has established itself as an important field of science. Applications continue to expand as researchers develop new kinds of ceramics to serve different purposes.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD"&gt;Richerson, D.W., ''Modern Ceramic Engineering'', 2nd Ed., (Marcel Dekker Inc., 1992) {{ISBN|0-8247-8634-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Zirconium dioxide]] ceramics are used in the manufacture of knives. The blade of the [[ceramic knife]] will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and can be snapped by dropping it on a hard surface.
*Ceramics such as alumina, [[boron carbide]] and silicon carbide have been used in [[bulletproof vest]]s to repel small arms [[rifle]] fire. Such plates are known commonly as [[trauma plate]]s. Similar material is used to protect [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpits]] of some military aircraft, because of the low weight of the material.
*[[Silicon nitride]] parts are used in ceramic ball bearings. Their higher hardness means that they are much less susceptible to wear and can offer more than triple lifetimes. They also deform less under load meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from friction during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings; problems which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. The major drawback to using ceramics is a significantly higher cost. In many cases their electrically insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
*In the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] ceramic engine which can run at a temperature of over 6000&amp;nbsp;°F (3300&amp;nbsp;°C). Ceramic engines do not require a cooling system and hence allow a major weight reduction and therefore greater fuel efficiency. [[Fuel efficiency]] of the engine is also higher at high temperature, as shown by [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot's]] theorem. In a conventional metallic engine, much of the energy released from the fuel must be dissipated as [[waste heat]] in order to prevent a meltdown of the metallic parts. Despite all of these desirable properties, such engines are not in production because the manufacturing of ceramic parts in the requisite precision and durability is difficult. Imperfection in the ceramic leads to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure. Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass-production is not feasible with current technology.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Currently, even blades made of [[superalloy|advanced metal alloys]] used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

*Recently, there have been advances in ceramics which include bio-ceramics, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. [[Hydroxyapatite]], the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopaedic implants made from these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions. Because of this, they are of great interest for gene delivery and [[tissue engineering]] scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength and are used to coat metal orthopaedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopaedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nano crystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopaedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopaedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
*Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.&lt;ref&gt;B.E.

*High-tech ceramic is used in watch-making for producing watch cases. The material is valued by watchmakers for its light weight, scratch-resistance, durability and smooth touch. [[International Watch Company|IWC]] is one of the brands that initiated the use of ceramic in watch-making. The case of the IWC 2007 Top Gun edition of the Pilot's Watch [[Double chronograph]] is crafted in high-tech black ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watches.infoniac.com/index.php?page=post&amp;id=62 Ceramic in Watch-making].

== Glass-ceramics ==
[[File:Glass ceramic cooktop.jpg|thumb|A high strength glass-ceramic cook-top with negligible thermal expansion.]]

Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both glasses and ceramics. Glass-ceramics have an amorphous phase and one or more crystalline phases and are produced by a so-called "controlled crystallization", which is typically avoided in glass manufacturing. Glass-ceramics often contain a crystalline phase which constitutes anywhere from 30% [m/m] to 90% [m/m] of its composition by volume, yielding an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties.&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

In the processing of glass-ceramics, molten glass is cooled down gradually before reheating and annealing. In this heat treatment the glass partly [[crystallizes]]. In many cases, so-called 'nucleation agents' are added in order to regulate and control the crystallization process. Because there is usually no pressing and sintering, glass-ceramics do not contain the volume fraction of porosity typically present in sintered ceramics.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;

The term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and [[aluminosilicate]]s which yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties. The most commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking. The negative [[thermal expansion]] coefficient (TEC) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive TEC of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net TEC near zero. This type of [[glass-ceramic]] exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

==Processing steps==

The traditional ceramic process generally follows this sequence: Milling → Batching → Mixing → Forming → Drying → Firing → Assembly.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ball mill.gif|thumb|[[Ball mill]]]]

*'''Milling''' is the process by which materials are reduced from a large size to a smaller size. Milling may involve breaking up cemented material (in which case individual particles retain their shape) or pulverization (which involves grinding the particles themselves to a smaller size). Milling is generally done by mechanical means, including ''attrition'' (which is particle-to-particle collision that results in agglomerate break up or particle shearing), ''compression'' (which applies a forces that results in fracturing), and ''impact'' (which employs a milling medium or the particles themselves to cause fracturing). Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the planetary mill or wet attrition mill), which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up. Compression mills include the jaw [[crusher]], roller crusher and cone crusher. Impact mills include the [[ball mill]], which has media that tumble and fracture the material. Shaft impactors cause particle-to particle attrition and compression.
*'''Batching''' is the process of weighing the oxides according to recipes, and preparing them for mixing and drying.
*'''Mixing''' occurs after batching and is performed with various machines, such as dry mixing [[Industrial mixer|ribbon mixers]] (a type of cement mixer), Mueller mixers,{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} and [[pug mill]]s. Wet mixing generally involves the same equipment.
*'''Forming''' is making the mixed material into shapes, ranging from toilet bowls to spark plug insulators. Forming can involve: (1) Extrusion, such as extruding "slugs" to make bricks, (2) Pressing to make shaped parts, (3) [[slipcasting|Slip casting]], as in making toilet bowls, wash basins and ornamentals like ceramic statues. Forming produces a "green" part, ready for drying. Green parts are soft, pliable, and over time will lose shape. Handling the green product will change its shape. For example, a green brick can be "squeezed", and after squeezing it will stay that way.
*'''Drying''' is removing the water or binder from the formed material. [[Spray drying]] is widely used to prepare powder for pressing operations. Other dryers are tunnel dryers and periodic dryers. Controlled heat is applied in this two-stage process. First, heat removes water. This step needs careful control, as rapid heating causes cracks and surface defects. The dried part is smaller than the green part, and is brittle, necessitating careful handling, since a small impact will cause crumbling and breaking.
*'''Sintering''' is where the dried parts pass through a controlled heating process, and the oxides are chemically changed to cause bonding and densification. The fired part will be smaller than the dried part.

==Forming methods==

[[Ceramic forming techniques]] include throwing, [[slipcasting]], tape casting, [[freeze-casting]], injection moulding, dry pressing, isostatic pressing, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and others. Methods for forming ceramic powders into complex shapes are desirable in many areas of technology. Such methods are required for producing advanced, high-temperature structural parts such as heat engine components and [[turbines]]. Materials other than ceramics which are used in these processes may include: wood, metal, water, plaster and epoxy—most of which will be eliminated upon firing.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

These forming techniques are well known for providing tools and other components with dimensional stability, surface quality, high (near theoretical) density and microstructural uniformity. The increasing use and diversity of speciality forms of ceramics adds to the diversity of process technologies to be used.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

Thus, reinforcing fibres and filaments are mainly made by polymer, sol-gel, or CVD processes, but melt processing also has applicability. The most widely used speciality form is layered structures, with tape casting for electronic substrates and packages being pre-eminent. Photo-lithography is of increasing interest for precise patterning of conductors and other components for such packaging. Tape casting or forming processes are also of increasing interest for other applications, ranging from open structures such as fuel cells to ceramic composites.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

The other major layer structure is coating, where melt spraying is very important, but chemical and physical vapour deposition and chemical (e.g., sol-gel and polymer pyrolysis) methods are all seeing increased use. Besides open structures from formed tape, extruded structures, such as honeycomb catalyst supports, and highly porous structures, including various foams, for example, [[reticulated foam]], are of increasing use.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

Densification of consolidated powder bodies continues to be achieved predominantly by (pressureless) sintering. However, the use of pressure sintering by hot pressing is increasing, especially for non-oxides and parts of simple shapes where higher quality (mainly microstructural homogeneity) is needed, and larger size or multiple parts per pressing can be an advantage.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

== The sintering process ==

{{See also|Sintering#Sintering mechanisms|l1=Sintering mechanisms}}

The principles of sintering-based methods are simple ("sinter" has roots in the English "[[cinder]]"). The firing is done at a temperature below the melting point of the ceramic. Once a roughly-held-together object called a "green body" is made, it is baked in a [[kiln]], where atomic and molecular [[diffusion]] processes give rise to significant changes in the primary microstructural features. This includes the gradual elimination of [[porosity]], which is typically accompanied by a net shrinkage and overall [[densification]] of the component. Thus, the pores in the object may close up, resulting in a denser product of significantly greater [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[fracture toughness]].

Another major change in the body during the firing or sintering process will be the establishment of the [[polycrystalline]] nature of the solid. This change will introduce some form of [[grain]] size distribution, which will have a significant impact on the ultimate [[physical properties]] of the material. The grain sizes will either be associated with the initial [[particle size]], or possibly the sizes of aggregates or particle [[cluster (physics)|cluster]]s which arise during the initial stages of processing.

The ultimate [[microstructure]] (and thus the physical properties) of the final product will be limited by and subject to the form of the structural template or precursor which is created in the initial stages of [[chemical synthesis]] and physical forming. Hence the importance of chemical [[Powder (substance)|powder]] and [[polymer]] [[Chemical process|processing]] as it pertains to the synthesis of industrial ceramics, glasses and glass-ceramics.

There are numerous possible refinements of the sintering process. Some of the most common involve pressing the green body to give the densification a head start and reduce the sintering time needed. Sometimes organic [[binder (material)|binders]] such as [[polyvinyl alcohol]] are added to hold the green body together; these burn out during the firing (at 200–350&amp;nbsp;°C). Sometimes organic lubricants are added during pressing to increase densification. It is common to combine these, and add binders and lubricants to a powder, then press. (The formulation of these organic chemical additives is an art in itself. This is particularly important in the manufacture of high performance ceramics such as those used by the billions for [[electronics]], in capacitors, [[inductor]]s, [[sensor]]s, etc.)

A slurry can be used in place of a powder, and then cast into a desired shape, dried and then sintered. Indeed, traditional pottery is done with this type of method, using a plastic mixture worked with the hands. If a mixture of different materials is used together in a ceramic, the sintering temperature is sometimes above the melting point of one minor component – a ''liquid phase'' sintering. This results in shorter sintering times compared to solid state sintering.&lt;ref&gt;Rahaman, M.N., ''Ceramic Processing and Sintering'', 2nd Ed. (Marcel Dekker Inc., 2003) {{ISBN|0-8247-0988-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength of ceramics==
A material's strength is dependent on its microstructure. The engineering processes to which a material is subjected can alter its microstructure. The variety of strengthening mechanisms that alter the strength of a material include the mechanism of [[grain boundary strengthening]]. Thus, although yield strength is maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately, very small grain sizes make the material brittle. Considered in tandem with the fact that the yield strength is the parameter that predicts plastic deformation in the material, one can make informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending on its microstructural properties and the desired end effect.

The relation between yield stress and grain size is described mathematically by the Hall-Petch equation which is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_y = \sigma_0 + {k_y \over \sqrt {d}}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the strengthening coefficient (a constant unique to each material), ''σ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a materials constant for the starting stress for dislocation movement (or the resistance of the lattice to dislocation motion), ''d'' is the grain diameter, and ''σ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the yield stress.

Theoretically, a material could be made infinitely strong if the grains are made infinitely small. This is, unfortunately, impossible because the lower limit of grain size is a single [[unit cell]] of the material. Even then, if the grains of a material are the size of a single unit cell, then the material is in fact amorphous, not crystalline, since there is no long range order, and dislocations can not be defined in an amorphous material. It has been observed experimentally that the microstructure with the highest yield strength is a grain size of about 10 nanometres, because grains smaller than this undergo another yielding mechanism, grain boundary sliding.&lt;ref name="Grain boundary sliding"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schuh|first=Christopher |author2=Nieh, T.G. |year=2002|doi=10.1557/PROC-740-I1.8|title=Hardness and Abrasion Resistance of Nanocrystalline Nickel Alloys Near the Hall-Petch Breakdown Regime|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/p014240.pdf |journal=Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. |volume=740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing engineering materials with this ideal grain size is difficult because of the limitations of initial particle sizes inherent to [[nanomaterials]] and nanotechnology.

==Theory of chemical processing==

===Microstructural uniformity===
In the processing of fine ceramics, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing [[density]] variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled [[Flocculation|agglomeration]] of powders due to attractive [[van der Waals forces]] can also give rise to in microstructural inhomogeneities.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite book

Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the [[solvent]] can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity.

In addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding inhomogeneous densification.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite journal

It would therefore appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over particle-particle interactions.

Monodisperse powders of colloidal [[silica]], for example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree of order in the [[colloidal crystal]] or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation.

Such defective polycrystalline colloidal structures would appear to be the basic elements of submicrometer colloidal [[materials science]], and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as polycrystalline ceramics.

=== Self-assembly ===

[[Self-assembly]] is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, micelles, etc.) without the influence of any external forces. Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into [[thermodynamic]]ally stable, structurally well-defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the 7 [[crystal]] systems found in [[metallurgy]] and [[mineralogy]] (e.g. [[face-centred cubic]], [[body-centred cubic]], etc.).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  The fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell (or [[lattice parameter]]) in each particular case.

Thus, self-assembly is emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and [[nanotechnology]]. [[Molecular]] self-assembly has been observed in various [[biological]] systems and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, [[emulsions]], phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization in the absence of any external forces.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In addition, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer [[Composite material|composites]], [[elastomers]], and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] materials are being re-evaluated, with an emphasis on bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methods of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. This includes an emerging class of [[Mechanics|mechanically]] superior [[biomaterials]] based on microstructural features and designs found in nature. The new horizons have been identified in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems in nature. This includes the nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of [[hierarchical]] structures.&lt;ref name="K"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ariga&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/014109| pmid = 27877935| title = Challenges and breakthroughs in recent research on self-assembly| journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials| volume = 9| issue = 1| pages = 014109| year = 2008| last1 = Ariga | first1 = K. | last2 = Hill | first2 = J.

==Ceramic composites==

[[File:PCCB Brake Carrera GT.jpg|thumb|The Porsche Carrera GT's carbon-ceramic (silicon carbide) composite [[disc brake]]]]
Substantial interest has arisen in recent years in fabricating ceramic composites. While there is considerable interest in composites with one or more non-ceramic constituents, the greatest attention is on composites in which all constituents are ceramic. These typically comprise two ceramic constituents: a continuous matrix, and a dispersed phase of ceramic particles, whiskers, or short (chopped) or [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|continuous ceramic fibres]]. The challenge, as in wet chemical processing, is to obtain a uniform or homogeneous distribution of the dispersed particle or fibre phase.&lt;ref name="COMP"&gt;Hull, D. and Clyne, T.W. (1996) ''An Introduction to Composite Materials''. Cambridge Solid State Science Series, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="DES"&gt;Barbero, E.J. (2010) ''Introduction to Composite Materials Design'', 2nd Edn., CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider first the processing of particulate composites. The particulate phase of greatest interest is tetragonal zirconia because of the toughening that can be achieved from the [[Phase transformations in solids|phase transformation]] from the metastable tetragonal to the monoclinic crystalline phase, aka [[transformation toughening]]. There is also substantial interest in dispersion of hard, non-oxide phases such as SiC, TiB, TiC, [[boron]], [[carbon]] and especially oxide matrices like alumina and [[mullite]]. There is also interest too incorporating other ceramic particulates, especially those of highly anisotropic thermal expansion. Examples include Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, graphite, and boron nitride.&lt;ref name="COMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DES" /&gt;

[[File:SiC p1390066.jpg|thumb|right|[[Silicon carbide]] single crystal]]

In processing particulate composites, the issue is not only homogeneity of the size and spatial distribution of the dispersed and matrix phases, but also control of the matrix grain size. However, there is some built-in self-control due to inhibition of matrix grain growth by the dispersed phase. Particulate composites, though generally offer increased resistance to damage, failure, or both, are still quite sensitive to inhomogeneities of composition as well as other processing defects such as pores. Thus they need good processing to be effective.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

Particulate composites have been made on a commercial basis by simply mixing powders of the two constituents. Although this approach is inherently limited in the homogeneity that can be achieved, it is the most readily adaptable for existing ceramic production technology. However, other approaches are of interest.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

[[File:Tungsten carbide.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tungsten carbide]] milling bits]]

From the technological standpoint, a particularly desirable approach to fabricating particulate composites is to coat the matrix or its precursor onto fine particles of the dispersed phase with good control of the starting dispersed particle size and the resultant matrix coating thickness. One should in principle be able to achieve the ultimate in homogeneity of distribution and thereby optimize composite performance. This can also have other ramifications, such as allowing more useful composite performance to be achieved in a body having porosity, which might be desired for other factors, such as limiting thermal conductivity.

There are also some opportunities to utilize melt processing for fabrication of ceramic, particulate, whisker and short-fibre, and continuous-fibre composites. Clearly, both particulate and whisker composites are conceivable by solid-state precipitation after solidification of the melt. This can also be obtained in some cases by sintering, as for precipitation-toughened, partially stabilized zirconia. Similarly, it is known that one can directionally solidify ceramic eutectic mixtures and hence obtain uniaxially aligned fibre composites. Such composite processing has typically been limited to very simple shapes and thus suffers from serious economic problems due to high machining costs.&lt;ref name="COMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DES" /&gt;

Clearly, there are possibilities of using melt casting for many of these approaches. Potentially even more desirable is using melt-derived particles. In this method, quenching is done in a solid solution or in a fine eutectic structure, in which the particles are then processed by more typical ceramic powder processing methods into a useful body. There have also been preliminary attempts to use melt spraying as a means of forming composites by introducing the dispersed particulate, whisker, or fibre phase in conjunction with the melt spraying process.

Other methods besides melt infiltration to manufacture ceramic composites with long fibre reinforcement are [[chemical vapour infiltration]] and the infiltration of fibre [[Optical fibre#Preform|preform]]s with organic [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]], which after [[pyrolysis]] yield an [[amorphous]] ceramic matrix, initially with a low density. With repeated cycles of infiltration and pyrolysis one of those types of [[ceramic matrix composite]]s is produced. Chemical vapour infiltration is used to manufacture [[carbon/carbon]] and silicon carbide reinforced with [[carbon fibre|carbon]] or [[silicon carbide fibre]]s.

Besides many process improvements, the first of two major needs for fibre composites is lower fibre costs. The second major need is fibre compositions or coatings, or composite processing, to reduce degradation that results from high-temperature composite exposure under oxidizing conditions.&lt;ref name="COMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DES" /&gt;

==Applications==

[[File:Si3N4thruster.jpg|thumb|Silicon nitride thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; propellants]]

The products of technical ceramics include tiles used in the [[Space Shuttle program]], gas burner [[nozzle]]s, [[Ballistic vest|ballistic protection]], nuclear fuel uranium oxide pellets, [[Implant (medicine)|bio-medical implants]], [[jet engine]] [[turbine]] blades, and [[missile]] nose cones.

Its products are often made from materials other than clay, chosen for their particular physical properties. These may be classified as follows:

*[[Oxide]]s: silica, alumina, [[zirconia]]
*Non-oxides: carbides, [[boride]]s, [[nitride]]s, [[silicide]]s
*[[Mixture|Composite]]s: particulate or whisker reinforced matrices, combinations of oxides and non-oxides (e.g. polymers).

Ceramics can be used in many technological industries. One application is the ceramic tiles on [[NASA]]'s Space Shuttle, used to protect it and the future supersonic space planes from the searing heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. They are also used widely in electronics and optics. In addition to the applications listed here, ceramics are also used as a coating in various engineering cases. An example would be a ceramic bearing coating over a titanium frame used for an aircraft. Recently the field has come to include the studies of single crystals or glass fibres, in addition to traditional polycrystalline materials, and the applications of these have been overlapping and changing rapidly.

Silicification is quite common in the biological world and occurs in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates). Crystalline minerals formed in such environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g. strength, hardness, fracture toughness) and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of length or spatial scales. The minerals are crystallized from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0–40&amp;nbsp;°C). Formation of the mineral may occur either within or outside of the cell wall of an organism, and specific biochemical reactions for mineral deposition exist that include lipids, proteins and carbohydrates.

Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring the design of novel materials with exceptional physical properties for high performance in adverse conditions. Their defining characteristics such as hierarchy, multifunctionality, and the capacity for self-healing, are currently being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Perry, C.C.|title=Silicification: The Processes by Which Organisms Capture and Mineralize Silica|journal=Rev. Miner. Geochem.|volume=54|page=291|year=2003|doi=10.2113/0540291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic building blocks begin with the 20 amino acids and proceed to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptides–saccharides. These, in turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of the ‘soft tissues’ common to most biominerals. With well over 1000 proteins possible, current research emphasizes the use of collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The ‘hard’ phases are often strengthened by crystalline minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases have been identified as hydroxyapatite, silica, and [[aragonite]]. Using the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials have been presented. Selected systems in each class are being investigated with emphasis on the relationship between their microstructure over a range of length scales and their mechanical response.

Thus, the crystallization of inorganic materials in nature generally occurs at ambient temperature and pressure. Yet the vital organisms through which these minerals form are capable of consistently producing extremely precise and complex structures. Understanding the processes in which living organisms control the growth of crystalline minerals such as silica could lead to significant advances in the field of materials science, and open the door to novel synthesis techniques for nanoscale composite materials, or nanocomposites.

[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|The iridescent nacre inside a [[Nautilus]] shell.]]
High-resolution SEM observations were performed of the microstructure of the mother-of-pearl (or [[nacre]]) portion of the [[abalone]] shell. Those shells exhibit the highest mechanical strength and fracture toughness of any non-metallic substance known. The nacre from the shell of the abalone has become one of the more intensively studied biological structures in materials science. Clearly visible in these images are the neatly stacked (or ordered) mineral tiles separated by thin organic sheets along with a macrostructure of larger periodic growth bands which collectively form what scientists are currently referring to as a hierarchical composite structure. (The term hierarchy simply implies that there are a range of structural features which exist over a wide range of length scales).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.pmatsci.2007.05.002| title = Biological materials: Structure and mechanical properties| journal = Progress in Materials Science| volume = 53| pages = 1| year = 2008| last1 = Meyers | first1 = M.

The '''Clore Social Leadership Programme (Clore Social)''' was established in 2008 to develop and strengthen leadership skills and capacity across the social sector. Clore Social was initiated by the [[Clore Duffield Foundation]] and inspired by its sister programme, the Clore Leadership Programme for the creative and cultural sectors. Its founding director was [[Mary Marsh|Dame Mary Marsh]].

Clore Social identifies, connects and develops leaders through its fully funded fellowship programme and works with people, partners and funders across all sectors to offer a holistic approach to developing leaders for social impact. So far 101 fellows have joined its network. It is run by a small staff team from its office in Kings Cross, London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''Mental state''' is generally a literary or legal term, and is only used in [[psychiatry]] or [[psychology]] as the mental state examination, where  it refers to the condition of someone's mind. Here there is an assessment of thought processes, memory, mood, [[cognitive]] state, and energy level. Where a mental state is shared by a large proportion of the members of a group or society, it can be called a collective mental state. [[Gustave Le Bon]] proposed that mental states are passed by [[Infectious disease|contagion]], while [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote of [[war fever]] in his work ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1922), a perfect example of the collective mental state. [[Franz Borkenau]] wrote of collective madness, while many writers have discussed [[collective depression]]. [[Psychosis]] can be passed from one individual to another as induced psychosis or ''folie à deux'', but rarely involves more than two people. Where the mental state involves a large population, it is more appropriate to use plain English rather than psychiatric or psychological terminology.

'''Communicative planning''' is an approach to [[urban planning]] that gathers stakeholders and engages them in a process to make decisions together in a manner that respects the positions of all involved.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Planning: Shaping Places in Fragmented Societies|last=Healey|first=Patsy|publisher=UBC Press|year=1997|isbn=0774805986|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes called collaborative planning among planning practitioners or collaborative planning model.

== History and theory ==
Since the 1970s, communicative planning theory has formed based on several key understandings. These key points include the notions that communication and reasoning come in diverse forms, knowledge is socially constructed, and people’s diverse interests and preferences are formed out of their social contexts.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Healey|first=Patsy|year=1996|title=The Communicative Turn in Planning Theory and its Implications for Spatial Strategy Formation|url=|journal=Readings in Planning Theory|volume=23|pages=217–234|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/b230217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative theory also draws on [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] analyses of power in that it recognizes that power relations exist in practice and have the ability to oppress individuals.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Specific to a community and urban planning context, communicative theory acknowledges that planners' own actions, words, lived experiences, and communication styles have an effect on the planning process the planner is facilitating.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Finally, communicative planning theory advances the idea that planning happens in everyday practice and social relations, and consensus-building can be used to organize people's thoughts and move past traditional ways of knowing and decision-making.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

In the 1990s, a number of planning scholars began writing about a new orientation to urban planning theory that moved away from the prevalent rational approach to planning. [[Judith Innes]] is credited with coining the term "communicative planning" in her article ''Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice.''&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith|year=1995|title=Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/14/3/183.extract|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=14|pages=183–189|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0739456x9501400307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innes' tries to bridge the gap between planning theories and planning in practice, and offers consensus-building as a tool for urban planners to create collaborative and engaging planning environments that allow different stakeholders to participate.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-12-31|title=Consensus Building and Complex Adaptive Systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369908976071|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=4|pages=412–423|doi=10.1080/01944369908976071|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booher|first=David E.|last2=Innes|first2=Judith E.|date=2002-03-01|title=Network Power in Collaborative Planning|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/21/3/221|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=221–236|doi=10.1177/0739456X0202100301|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-03-31|title=Consensus Building as Role Playing and Bricolage|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944369908976031|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/01944369908976031|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Around the same time as this article was published, Patsy Healey also published a number of planning theory texts exploring communicative and collaborative planning. Drawing on the theory of [[Jürgen Habermas]] in particular, Healey's work focuses on the impact that communicative acts (which can be in spoken or written form) have on a community planning process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Healey also expands on the work of urban planner [[John F.

The emerging field of therapeutic planning is closely related to communicative planning. Therapeutic planning operates on the basis that communities can experience collective trauma, including from past planning processes, and that carefully facilitated community engagement can act as catalysts for community-wide healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erfan|first=Aftab|date=2016-11-21|title=Confronting collective traumas: an exploration of therapeutic planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|journal=Planning Theory &amp; Practice|volume=0|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|issn=1464-9357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aftab|first=Erfan,|date=2013-09-09|title=An experiment in therapeutic planning : learning with the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw First Nations|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0074273|doi=10.14288/1.0074273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ENsYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=therapeutic+planning+community&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6BKoIae-W0&amp;sig=cRmujL8p6qsJhL9fG0b_YN6ZFXc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS6djzttfQAhUG9GMKHXhZBaAQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=therapeutic%20planning%20community&amp;f=false|title=The Global City and the Holy City: Narratives on Knowledge, Planning and Diversity|last=Fenster|first=Tovi|date=2016-09-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317880097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some planning practitioners use untraditional planning approaches, such as filmmaking and other artistic media, to engage community members in therapeutic planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Leonie|last2=Attili|first2=Giovanni|date=2014-01-16|title=Changing the Lens Film as Action Research and Therapeutic Planning Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/16/0739456X13516499|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|pages=0739456X13516499|doi=10.1177/0739456X13516499|issn=0739-456X|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicative process and tools ==
In a communicative planning process, planning practitioners play more of a facilitative role. They often act as a ‘knowledge mediator and broker’&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; to help reframe problems in order to promote more creative thinking about possible solutions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning in divided cities: collaborative shaping of contested space|last=Gaffikin|first=Frank|last2=Morrissey|first2=Mike|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-405-19218-7|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this process, information should be produced collectively by the full range of stakeholders who may be affected by the outcome of the process.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=1998-03-31|title=Information in Communicative Planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369808975956|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=64|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1080/01944369808975956|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, all of the stakeholders should be involved in negotiating both the problem definition and the solution together.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In doing so, solutions to conflicts amongst stakeholders may be re-framed as ‘win-win’, as opposed to the ‘zero sum’ mindset which occurs when stakeholders are bargaining on the basis of their own fixed interests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Consensus-building is an important part of this collective meaning-making process, as information is discussed and validated within the group of sakeholders, resulting in information which holds more significance to the group.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

To aid in consensus-building efforts, power should be distributed amongst the stakeholders such that they are equals in the process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Openness and trust are also crucial for building consensus.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The objectives, underlying assumptions, and positions of these stakeholders should be considered along with the uncertainties about future conditions, such as population growth, and decisions which are linked to other decisions.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Arnab|date=2012-03-01|title=Recognizing Uncertainty and Linked Decisions in Public Participation: A New Framework for Collaborative Urban Planning|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2102/abstract|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=131–148|doi=10.1002/sres.2102|issn=1099-1743}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to have the stakeholders identify this information for themselves, as it will help reduce the biases present in both analyses driven by only one future and position-based discussions, as well as bring to the forefront any conflicts between the underlying values of the stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By considering this broad range of information, commonalities between different stakeholders may be identified, which can help build consensus. However, this cannot guarantee consensus, as positions might in fact be too different.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In order to deal with the challenges that arise from positions being very different and the increasing complexity of analysis required, new models of collaboration are needed which build on various principles of conflict management, including engaging early and engaging often.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==  Case studies  ==

'''The Neighbourhood Revitalization Program (NRP) - 1990'''

In 1990, the city of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] launched a 20-year program designed to empower residents in local decision making and share community planning responsibilities among residential, government and private stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elwood|date=2002|title=Neighbourhood Revitalization through Collaboration: Assessing the implications of neoliberal urban policy at the grassroots.|journal=GeoJournal|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the dwindling standard of living within Minneapolis neighbourhoods, the NRP was conceptualized as a means of involving citizens in the prioritization of revitalization efforts. The Minneapolis government divided 400 million dollars between 81 neighbourhood organizations who utilized the funding over two decades to assess priorities, reach consensus and implement neighbourhood improvement projects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the first decade of the NRP, 48% of funding was used for upgrading housing and 16% went towards job creation and economic developments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=J.|last2=Pentel|first2=P.|date=2002|title=What the Neighbours Want: The Neighborhood Revitalization Program's First Decade.|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=68|issue=4|pages=435–449|doi=10.1080/01944360208976284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other priorities included public safety, the preservation of green space and improving transportation infrastructure.

Through the completion and adoption of 66 unique neighbourhood plans, stakeholders from various organizations including the general public, [[Minneapolis Public Library]], Minneapolis Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Housing Inspection and [[Hennepin County]] all came together to articulate and agree upon feasible and mutually beneficial neighbourhood directives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fung|date=2006|title=Empowered Participation in Urban Governance: The Minneapolis Revitalization Program.|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=30|issue=3|pages=638–655|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2006.00685.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; With emphasis placed on citizen participation, municipal planners took on an advisory role and assisted neighbourhood planning organizations in encouraging participation, engaging a diverse audience and reviewing completed plans through a technical lens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite the creation of Participation Agreements which stood as formal commitments to holding an inclusive engagement process, the NRP has been criticized for a lack of representation from all neighbourhood members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While the NRP has been applauded for its communicative and collaborative values, critics point to cases of exclusion and the enormous amount of continuous time and energy required for its success as main drawbacks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Seattle's Neighbourhood Planning Program - 1994'''

In 1994, [[Seattle]] developed the Neighbourhood Planning Program (NPP) in response to outcry from the general public surrounding a lack of involvement in a recently completed comprehensive plan.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siranni|first=Carmen|date=2007|title=Neighbourhood Planning as Collaborative Design|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=73|issue=4|pages=373–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPP intended to build a partnership between residents and the local government and provided neighbourhoods with the choice to create their own unique local plan or continue by the comprehensive plan. While these neighbourhood plans had to be consistent with the broad goals of the comprehensive plan, participating neighbourhoods were afforded the opportunity to identify their own priorities and provide a list of recommendations to the city.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Initially, each participating neighbourhood was given 10,000 dollars to begin a communicative engagement process and identify a vision for their local community.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neighbor Power: Building Community the Seattle Way|last=Diers|first=Jim|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding for the planning stage would not be rewarded until the City felt as though enough stakeholders and community representatives had been included in the process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Community Capacity: How collaborative planning is changing the culture of governance in Seattle.|last=Kobler|first=A|publisher=Iowa State University ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the visioning process was deemed to be inclusive and rigorous, the city provided each neighbourhood with between 60,000-100,000 dollars to develop a plan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In total, 38 neighbourhoods participated and developed their own neighbourhood plan for the municipality to follow.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Before approving each neighbourhood plan, the municipality would hold public hearings in the neighbourhood to share the plan and ensure there was consensus among all the residents in the area.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  By 1999, the City had adopted these plans and began implementing the shared visions of each neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Each plan varied significantly as each neighbourhood was afforded the opportunity to hire their own planner or consultants to assist them in the process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Planning professionals participated in the process mainly as mediators who helped guide participatory sessions and facilitated the consensus-building process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 20, 000 and 30, 000 residents participated directly in the NPP.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The program has been recognized as a successful example of communicative planning and [[collaborative governance]] due to the high level of participation and the frequency with which consensus was genuinely reached.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==  Challenges and critiques ==
Critiques of Innes, Healey, and communicative planning focus on the planning processes and outcomes.

Older critiques of communicative planning theory question whether the theory they find idealist can translate a consensus-based process into authentic outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewdwr-Jones|first=M.|last2=Allmendinger|first2=P.|date=1998-11-01|title=Deconstructing Communicative Rationality: A Critique of Habermasian Collaborative Planning|url=http://epn.sagepub.com/content/30/11/1975|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=30|issue=11|pages=1975–1989|doi=10.1068/a301975|issn=0308-518X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also question whether consensus is a valuable goal when they see critical planning decisions as being made gradually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aetrlrhK37sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=rationality+and+power&amp;ots=a7lj21LT2d&amp;sig=0_-GsZZkld1rJoEsk3Ui8Y_pT4s#v=onepage&amp;q=rationality%20and%20power&amp;f=false|title=Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|date=1998-02-28|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226254494|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional critiques relate to power: who has the power to exclude and include stakeholders and whether stakeholders will use their power to manipulate the consensus building process (given that consensus must be reached).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older critiques of communicative planning practice also see a lack of real world outcomes from the communicative planning processes because deeper political and institutional change is needed first.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Judith Innes directly responded to these critiques in her article ''Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=2004-03-01|title=Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/3/1/5|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–20|doi=10.1177/1473095204042315|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she expanded her description of the consensus building process and communicative planning's roots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Newer [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] critiques argue collaborative planning is a way to maintain larger political and institutional systems while creating a process that only seems to better represent the public.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=Mark|date=2009-05-01|title=Resisting Neoliberalization: Communicative Planning or Counter-Hegemonic Movements?|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/8/2/140|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=140–165|doi=10.1177/1473095209102232|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see collaborative planning as a way to keep neoliberals in power and political systems stable, rather than creating real changes to the governing system.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In [[ethics]], '''dual loyalty''' is loyalty to two separate interests that potentially [[logical consequence|entails]] a [[conflict of interest]].

A frequently cited example of the term "dual loyalty" is used in connection with [[physician]]s who must balance, on the one hand, the physician's loyalty to a [[patient]] (and/or the regulations that govern the physician-patient relationship), and on the other hand, the institution or country for which the physician serves. 

For example, a doctor who is asked by a government to assess a prisoner's fitness to withstand [[torture]] faces an enormous ethical dilemma because of the competing loyalties of the doctor to the state versus the [[medical ethics|physician's code of ethics]] and his/her commitment to a patient's [[human rights]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3289">'''Egain forecasting''' is a method of controlling building [[heating]] by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit. By combining [[physics]] of structures with [[meteorology]], properties of the building, [[weather]] conditions including outdoor temperature, [[wind power]] and direction, as well as [[solar radiation]] can be taken into account. In the case of conventional heating control, only current outdoor temperature is considered.

The starting point for developing the method of eGain forecasting was the ENLOSS mathematical [[energy accounting|energy balance]] model developed by Prof. Roger Taesler
&lt;ref&gt;Taesler, R. (1990/91) "Climate and Building Energy Management". ''Energy and Buildings'', Vol. 15-16, pp 599 - 608.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] in cooperation with Thorbjörn Geiser (member of the board) and Stefan Berglund,&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent 6098893 Comfort control system incorporating weather forecast data and a method for operating such a system (Inventor Stefan Berglund)&lt;/ref&gt; who are currently both employed at eGain Sweden AB. Forecasting method began to be introduced to use in the late 1980s.

Until 2017 inclusive, forecasting method has been introduced in nearly 16 million square metres of floorage of [[residential building]]s and commercial premises. Estimated data indicate 10 - 15 kWh/''m''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;  reduction of average annual [[heat energy]] consumption. Since forecasting method contains information about future demand and is not in conflict with other methods of increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], it is always a good foreground solution.

==eGain Forecasting in practice==
As far as practical use of forecasting method is concerned, usually [[remote control]] forecasting receivers are used to send and receive data by means of [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]] or [[GSM]] network. Then, the forecasting receivers manage the operation of control panels installed in buildings which adjust distribution of heat energy in the [[heating system]] of a given property.

Recently, special remote control weather loggers have started to be used in combination with forecasting receivers. The weather loggers measure [[air temperature]] and [[humidity]] with high accuracy and the measurements are sent in real time to forecasting receivers to which they are connected. Such a turning point in [[technology]] means even more detailed preview of situation and better possibilities of control for users of forecasting method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5710">'''Environmental archaeology''' is a sub-field of [[archaeology]] and is the science of reconstructing the relationships between past societies and the environments they lived in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/envarch/what/|title=What is Environmental Archaeology?|last=|first=|date=|website=Florida Museum of Natural History|publisher=University of Florida|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Archaeology: Approaches, Techniques &amp; Applications|last=Wilkinson|first=Keith|publisher=Tempus|year=2003|isbn=0752419315|location=Stroud|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field represents an archaeological-palaeoecological approach to studying the palaeoenvironment through the methods of human palaeoecology. Reconstructing past environments and past peoples' relationships and interactions with the landscapes they inhabited provides archaeologists with insights into the origin and evolution of anthropogenic environments, and prehistoric adaptations and economic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Archaeology: Theoretical and Practical Approaches|last=Branch|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=0340808713|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental archaeology is commonly divided into three sub-fields: 
* [[archaeobotany]] (the study of plant remains)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archaeobotany.dept.shef.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page|title = Online Archaeobotany Tutorial|last =|first =|date =|website = Integrated Archaeobotanical Research Project|publisher = University of Sheffield|access-date = 6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[zooarchaeology]] (the study of faunal remains)
* [[geoarchaeology]] (the study of geological processes and their relationship to the archaeological record)

Other related fields include:
*[[landscape archaeology]]
*[[bioarchaeology]] and [[human ecology]]
*[[climatology]]
*[[palaeoecology]]
*[[archival research]]

Environmental archaeology often involves studying plant and animal remains in order to investigate which plant and animal species were present at the time of prehistoric habitations, and how past societies managed them. It may also involve studying the physical environment and how similar or different it was in the past compared to the present day. An important component of such analyses represents the study of site formation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/sterms/g/siteformation.htm|title=Site Formation Processes|last=Kris|first=Hirst|date=|website=about education|publisher=|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field is particularly useful when [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s may be absent from an excavated or surveyed site, or in cases of earth movement, such as [[erosion]], which may have buried artifacts and archaeological features. While specialist sub-fields, for example [[bioarchaeology]] or [[geomorphology]], are defined by the materials they study, the term "environmental" is used as a general template in order to denote a general field of scientific inquiry that is applicable across time periods and geographical regions studied by archaeology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butzer|first=Karl W.|date=2012|title=Collapse, environment, and society|url=|journal=PNAS |volume=109 |pages=3632–3639|doi=10.1073/pnas.1114845109|pmid=|access-date=|pmc=3309741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental archaeology has emerged as a distinct discipline in the course of the last 50 years. In recent years it has grown rapidly in significance and is now an established component of most excavation projects. The field is multidisciplinary, and environmental archaeologists as well as palaeoecologists work side by side with archaeologists and anthropologists specialising in material culture studies in order to achieve a more holistic understanding of past human lifeways and people-environment interactions.

A notable pioneer of environmental archaeology has been [[Karl Butzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk9Q0XUHdLU|title=An interview with Professor Karl W. Butzer|last=|first=|date=1987|website=YouTube|publisher=Anne Buttimer|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Each focus within environmental archaeology collects information about a different aspect of human relation with their surrounding environment. Together these components (along with methods from other fields) are combined to fully understand a past society’s lifestyle and interactions with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;
Environmental archaeology: theoretical and practical approaches. Place of publication not identified: Routledge, 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Past aspects of land use, food production, tool use, and occupation patterns can all be established and the knowledge applied to current and future human-environment interactions.

'''Exhibit design''' (or '''exhibition design'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Exhibition Design | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | author=Dernie, David | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-393-73211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the process of developing an exhibit—from a concept through to a physical, three-dimensional exhibition. It is a continually evolving field, drawing on innovative, creative, and practical solutions to the challenge of developing communicative environments that ‘tell a story’ in a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/course/xmdxmdma/ MA Design for Exhibition and Museum], [[University of Lincoln]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exhibit designer]]s (or [[exhibition designer]]s) use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences–enabling these targeted audiences to access the messages, stories and objects of an exhibit.
There are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions, to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos, and visitor centers. All types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions.
   
Exhibit design is a collaborative process, integrating the disciplines of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[audiovisual]] engineering, [[digital media]], [[lighting designer|lighting]], [[interior design]], and content development to develop an audience experience that interprets information, involves and engages a user and influences their understanding of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Skolnick, [[Jan Lorenc]], and Craig Berger, ''What is Exhibition Design?'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the planning and design process, exhibit designers work closely with [[graphic designers]], content specialists, [[architects]], fabricators, technical specialists, audiovisual experts, and, in the case of museums and other [[mission statement|mission]]-based institutions, stakeholders like community members, government agencies, and other partner organizations.
  
The exhibit design process builds on a conceptual or [[interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. The first phases establish a thematic direction and develop creative and appropriate design solutions to achieve the interpretive and communication goals of the exhibit. The latter phases employ technical expertise in translating the visual language of the designs into detailed documents that provide all the specifications required to fabricate and install an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442230170/Museums-101|title=Museums 101|last=Walhimer|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2015|isbn=9781442230187|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition design in different parts of the world are influenced by the local culture as well as the availability of materials. Exhibition design in Europe is considered as a meeting place for relationship building while in North America energy is spent on creating a sense of place and building community.

One of the major shifts in museum and exhibit design in the last decade has been a focus on visitor experience.  By identifying the five types of museum visitors and their needs and expectations, museums can design their exhibits to give a positive visitor experience.&lt;ref&gt;John Falk, ''Identity and the museum visitor experience''2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participatory activities are also becoming more popular, Nina Simon has done research describing and identifying themes and trends in museums that will attract visitors and educate them in fun and engaging ways. &lt;ref&gt;Nina Simon, ''The Participatory Museum'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flower brick''' is a type of [[vase]], cuboid-shaped like a building [[brick]], and designed to be seen with the long face towards the viewer.&lt;ref name="p01pm6m5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01pm6m5|title=BBC One - Antiques Roadshow, Series 36, Sainsbury Centre Norwich 1, English Delftware flower bricks|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O21382/flower-brick-unknown/|title=Flower brick|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional flower bricks are made of a [[ceramic]] material. The top surface has a large hole into which water is poured, and a number of smaller holes into which flower stems are inserted, so that the flowers are kept in position.  They are a sub-type of the [[boughpot]] or [[tulipiere]], which have more rounded shapes.

'''Formal sciences''' are [[formal language]] disciplines concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[robotics]], [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}   Strictly speaking, formal science is not science{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} but a variety of fundamentally abstract logical systems that are applied to both the natural world and human constructs.  Whereas the [[natural science]]s and [[social science]]s seek to characterize [[physical systems]] and [[social system]]s, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences are language [[tools]] concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by [[sign systems]]. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures the latter use to describe the world, and what inferences may be made about them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==History==
Formal sciences began before the formulation of the [[scientific method]], with the most ancient [[Mathematics|mathematical]] texts dating back to 1800&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Babylonian mathematics]]), 1600&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Egyptian mathematics]]) and 1000&amp;nbsp;BC ([[Indian mathematics]]). From then on different cultures such as the Indian, [[Greek mathematics|Greek]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab and Persian]] made major contributions to mathematics, while the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]] and [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese]], independently of more distant cultures, developed their own mathematical tradition.

Besides mathematics, [[logic]] is another example of one of oldest subjects in the field of the formal sciences. As an explicit analysis of the methods of reasoning, logic received sustained development originally in three places: [[Indian logic|India]] from the {{nowrap|6th century BC}}, [[Logic in China|China]] in the {{nowrap|5th century BC}}, and Greece between the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} and the {{nowrap|1st century BC}}. The formally sophisticated treatment of modern logic descends from the Greek tradition, being informed from the transmission of [[Aristotelian logic]], which was then further developed by [[logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logicians]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The Indian tradition also continued into the [[early modern period]]. The native Chinese tradition did not survive beyond [[Ancient history|antiquity]], though Indian logic was later adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] China.

As a number of other disciplines of formal science rely heavily on mathematics, they did not exist until mathematics had developed into a relatively advanced level. [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] (1654), and [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1657) started the earliest study of [[probability theory]]. In the early 1800s, [[Gauss]] and [[Laplace]] developed the mathematical theory of [[statistics]], which also explained the use of statistics in insurance and governmental accounting. Mathematical statistics was recognized as a mathematical discipline in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century.

In the mid-20th century, mathematics was broadened and enriched by the rise of new [[mathematical science]]s and engineering disciplines such as [[operations research]] and [[systems engineering]]. These sciences benefited from basic research in [[electrical engineering]] and then by the development of [[Computer|electrical computing]], which also stimulated [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]] ([[scientific computing]]), and [[theoretical computer science]]. Theoretical computer science also benefits from the discipline of [[mathematical logic]], which included the [[theory of computation]].

==Differences from other forms of science==
{{quote|One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.|[[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |authorlink=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]], for their content and validity are independent of any empirical procedures.  

Therefore, straightly speaking, formal science is not a science.  It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at the real things, information and thoughts that we experienced.  As [[Francis Bacon]] pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature.  Formal science is a method that is helpful to science but cannot replace science.

Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds – whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, [[general relativity]] or [[evolutionary biology]], do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in all domains and useful in all empirical sciences.

Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of [[axioms]] and [[definitions]] from which other statements ([[theorems]]) are deduced. In other words, theories in formal sciences contain no [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic statements]]; all their statements are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">'''Fuzzy Control Language''', or '''FCL''', is a language for implementing [[fuzzy logic]], especially [[fuzzy control]]. It was standardized by IEC 61131-7. It is a [[domain-specific programming language]]: it has no features unrelated to fuzzy logic, so it is impossible to even print "[[Hello world program|Hello, world!]]". Therefore, one does not write a program in FCL, but one may write ''part'' of it in FCL.

== Example ==

 RULE 0: IF (Temperature IS Cold) THEN (Output IS High)

== Limitations ==

FCL is not an entirely complete fuzzy language, for instance, it does not support "hedges", which are adverbs that modify the set. For instance, the programmer cannot write:

 RULE 0: IF (Temperature IS VERY Cold) THEN (Output IS VERY High)

However, the programmer can simply define new sets for "very cold" and "very high". FCL also lacks support for higher-order fuzzy sets, subsets, and so on. None of these features are essential to fuzzy control, although they may be nice to have.

'''Gender-biased diagnosing''' is a controversial&lt;ref&gt;Authors V. Mark Durand, M.V. &amp; Barlow, D.H. (2009) ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7BZTtO5rh8C&amp;lpg=PA436&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.436.] Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-495-59982-4}}. Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sociology|sociological]] observation which asserts that [[medical diagnosis|medical]] and psychological diagnosis may be influenced by the [[gender]] of the patient. Several studies have found evidence of [[differential diagnosis]] for patients with similar ailments but of different sexes.

== Medical diagnosis ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
The phenomenon may affect physical diagnosis. Women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] nature for a [[physical ailment]] than men, despite presenting with similar symptoms. Women sometimes have trouble being taken seriously by physicians when suffering from medically unexplained [[illness]], and report difficulty receiving appropriate medical care for their illnesses because doctors repeatedly diagnose their physical complaints as related to [[Mental illness|psychiatric problems]].
Clinical offices that rely on healthcare routines become less distinct due to biased medical knowledge of gender.  There is a distinct differentiation between gender and sex in the medical sense. Gender is the societal construction of what femininity and masculinity is, whereas, sex is the biological aspect that defines the dichotomy of female and male. The way of lifestyle and the place in society are often considered when diagnosing patients.&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, K. (2008). Gender bias in medicine. Women's Health (London, England), 4(3), 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional medical studies, most of these medical studies were done on men thus overlooking many issues that were related to women's health. This topic alone sparked controversy and brought about question to the medical standard of our time. Research that was done on diseases that affected women more were less funded than those diseases that affected men and women equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trechak A | year = 1999 | title = On cultural and gender bias in medical diagnosis | url = | journal = Multicultural Education | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an example of gender bias in the psychiatric field as well, Hamburg notes that, "psychiatrists would diagnose women with depression and then, eventually psychiatrists would begin to assume that women were more depressed than men due to the fact that the patients that were examined by the psychiatrists were women and they had similar symptoms. As for the men, they were diagnosed with drug or alcohol problems and they were thrown out of the study."&lt;ref&gt;Hamberg, Katarina. "Gender Bias in Medicine." Women's Health (London, England), 4.3 (2008): 237-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the Women's Health Equity Act that was passed in 1993, this Act gave women the chance to participate in medical studies and examine the gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1993. Congressional Record Daily Edition. n.p.: 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Women's Health Equity Act was introduced there was no research done on infertility, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer which were essential to women's health.&lt;ref&gt;THE WOMEN'S HEALTH EQUITY ACT of 1991.

There is a suggestion that assumptions regarding gender specific behavioural characteristics can lead to a diagnostic system which is biased.&lt;ref&gt;Maddux, J.E. &amp; Winstead, B.A. (2005) ''Psychopathology: foundations for a contemporary understanding'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2SJpF8ucrKgC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20biased%20diagnosing&amp;f=false p.77.] Routledge. {{ISBN|0-8058-4077-X}} Retrieved November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of gender bias with regard to ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) [[personality disorder]] criteria has been controversial and widely debated. The fourth DSM (4th ed., text revision; DSM–IV–TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) makes no explicit statement regarding gender bias among the ten personality disorders (PDs), but it does state that six PDs (antisocial, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid) are more frequently found in men. Three others (borderline, histrionic, dependent) are more frequent in women. Avoidant is equally common in men and women.

There are many ways to interpret differential prevalence rates as a function of gender. Some critics have argued that they are an artifact of gender bias. In other words, the PD criteria assume unfairly that stereotypical female characteristics are pathological. The results of this study conclude with no indication of gender-biased criteria in the [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], and [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]] PDs. This is in contrast with what is predicted by critics of these disorders, who suggest they are biased against women. It is possible, however, that other sources of bias, including assessment and clinical bias,  are still at work in relation to these disorders. The results do show that the group means are higher in women than in men, an expected result considering the higher prevalence rate of these disorders for women.&lt;ref&gt;Jane, J. S., Oltmanns, T. F., South, S. C., &amp; Turkheimer, E. (2007) "Gender bias in diagnostic criteria for personality disorders: An item response theory analysis" Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 116(1), 166-175&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of the DSM–IV was to provide an accurate classification of [[psychopathology]], not to develop a diagnostic system that will, democratically, diagnose as many men with a personality disorder as women". However, if the criteria are to serve equally as indicators of disorder for both men and women, it will be important to establish that the implications of these criteria for functional impairment are comparable for both sexes. Whereas it is plausible that there are gender-specific expressions of these disorders, DSM–IV criteria that function differentially for men and women can systematically over-pathologize or under-represent mental illness in a particular gender. The present study is limited by the investigation of only four personality disorders and the lack of inclusion of additional diagnoses that have also been controversial in the gender bias debate (such as dependent and histrionic personality disorders), although it offers a clearly articulated methodology for studying this possibility. In addition, it provides an examination of a clinical sample of substantial size and uses functional assessments that cut across multiple functional domains and multiple assessment methods. Our results indicate that BPD criteria showed some evidence of differential functioning between genders on global functioning, although there is little evidence of sex bias within the diagnostic criteria for [[avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]], [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]], or [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]]s. Further investigation and validation across sexes for those disorders would be an important direction of future research.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, C. D., Morey, L. C., Skodol, A. E., Shea, M. T., Sanislow, C. A., Grilo, C. M., et al. (2009) "Differential impairment as an indicator of sex bias in DSM-IV criteria for four personality disorders" Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment, S(1), 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable evidence indicates a prominent role for [[psychological trauma|trauma]]-related cognitions in the development and maintenance of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) symptoms. The present study utilized [[regression analysis]] to examine the unique relationships between various trauma-related cognitions and PTSD symptoms after controlling for gender and measures of general affective distress in a large sample of trauma-exposed college students. In terms of trauma-related cognitions, only negative cognitions about the self were related to PTSD symptom severity. Gender and anxiety symptoms were also related to PTSD symptom severity. Theoretical implications of the results are consistent with previous studies on the relationship between PTSD and negative cognitions, the self, world, and blame subscales of the PTCI were significantly related to PTSD symptoms. The study correlations indicated that increased negative trauma-related cognitions were related to more severe PTSD symptoms. Also consistent with previous reports, correlations also indicated that gender was related to PTSD symptom severity, such that women had more severe PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptom severity was also positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moser J. S. |author2=Hajcak G. |author3=Simons R. F. |author4=Foa E.

Distinguishing between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often challenging, especially when the client has experienced a trauma such as [[childhood sexual abuse]] (CSA), which is strongly linked to both disorders. Although the individual diagnostic criteria for these two disorders do not overlap substantially, patients with either of these disorders can display similar clinical pictures. Both patients with BPD and PTSD may present as aggressive toward self or others, irritable, unable to tolerate emotional extremes, dysphoric, feeling empty or dead, and highly reactive to mild stressors. Despite having similar clinical pictures, PTSD and BPD are regarded differently by many clinicians. Results from a 2009 study concluded that patient gender does not affect diagnosis. This finding is consistent with research suggesting that women are not more likely to be given the BPD diagnosis, all else being equal, though it contradicts other findings from studies that have used similar case vignettes. Nor did the data support an effect of clinician gender or age on diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, H. E., Taft, C. T., Gordon, R. A., &amp; Meis, L. A. (2009) "Clinician bias in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder"  Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 1(4), 282-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study examined gender-specific associations between trauma cognitions, alcohol cravings and alcohol-related consequences in individuals with dually diagnosed PTSD and [[alcohol dependence]] (AD). Participants had entered a treatment study for concurrent PTSD and AD; baseline information was collected from participants about PTSD-related cognitions in three areas: (a) Negative Cognitions About Self, (b) Negative Cognitions About the World, and (c) Self-Blame. Information was also collected on two aspects of AD: alcohol cravings and consequences of AD. Gender differences were examined while controlling for PTSD severity. The results indicate that Negative Cognitions About Self are significantly related to alcohol cravings in men but not women, and that interpersonal consequences of AD are significantly related to Self-Blame in women but not in men. These findings suggest that for individuals with comorbid PTSD and AD, psychotherapeutic interventions that focus on reducing trauma-related cognitions are likely to reduce alcohol cravings in men and relational problems in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jayawickreme N. |author2=Yasinski C. |author3=Williams M. |author4=Foa E.

[[File:Wind turbine 1888 Charles Brush.jpg|thumb| [[Charles F. Brush|Charles Brush's]] windmill of 1888, used for generating electricity.]]

'''[[Wind power]]''' has been used as long as humans have put [[sailing ships|sails]] into the wind. For more than two millennia [[Windmill|wind-powered machines]] have ground grain and pumped water. Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams, or later, requiring sources of fuel. Wind-powered pumps drained the [[Polder#Polders and the Netherlands|polders of the Netherlands]], and in arid regions such as the [[American mid-west]] or the [[Australian outback]], [[wind pump]]s provided water for livestock and steam engines.

With the development of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind plants suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electricity grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny plants for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind farms]] that provide electricity to national electrical networks.

By 2014, over 240,000 commercial-sized wind turbines were operating in the world, producing 4% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/wind-in-numbers/ Wind in numbers], Global Wind Energy Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wwea2014&gt;{{cite book |author=The World Wind Energy Association |title=2014 Half-year Report |year=2014|pages=1–8 |publisher=WWEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sailboats]] and [[sailing ship]]s have been using wind power for at least 5,500 years,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and architects have used wind-driven [[natural ventilation]] in buildings since similarly ancient times. The use of wind to provide mechanical power came somewhat later in antiquity.

The [[Babylonia]]n emperor [[Hammurabi]] planned to use wind power for his ambitious irrigation project in the 17th century BC.&lt;ref name="Sathyajith2006"&gt;

The first practical [[windmill]]s were in use in [[Sistan]], a region in [[Iran]] and bordering [[Afghanistan]], at least by the 9th century and possibly as early as the 7th century. These "[[Panemone windmill]]s" were horizontal windmills,{{ref|a|[note 1]}} which had long vertical [[driveshaft]]s with six to twelve rectangular [[Windmill sail|sail]]s covered in reed matting or cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1986). ''Islamic Technology: An illustrated history'', p. 54. [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-42239-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These windmills were used to [[Windpump|pump water]], and in the [[gristmill]]ing and sugarcane industries.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The use of windmills became widespread across the Middle East and Central Asia, and later spread to China and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69.

Wind-powered [[Automaton|automata]] are known from the mid-8th century: wind-powered [[statue]]s that "turned with the wind over the domes of the four gates and the palace complex of the Round City of [[Baghdad]]". The "Green Dome of the palace was surmounted by the statue of a horseman carrying a lance that was believed to point toward the enemy. This public spectacle of wind-powered statues had its private counterpart in the '[[Abbasid]] palaces where automata of various types were predominantly displayed."&lt;ref&gt;

The first windmills in [[Europe]] appear in sources dating to the twelfth century. These early European windmills were  [[post mill|sunk post mills]]. The earliest certain reference to a windmill dates from 1185, in Weedley, Yorkshire, although a number of earlier but less certainly dated twelfth-century European sources referring to windmills have also been adduced.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr., ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is sometimes argued that [[the Crusades|crusaders]] may have been inspired by windmills in the Middle East, this is unlikely since the European vertical windmills were of significantly different design than the horizontal windmills of Afghanistan. Lynn White Jr., a specialist in medieval European technology, asserts that the European windmill was an "independent invention;" he argues that it is unlikely that the Afghanistan-style horizontal windmill had spread as far west as the Levant during the Crusader period.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr. ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 86-87, 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt;  In medieval England rights to waterpower sites were often confined to nobility and clergy, so wind power was an important resource to a new middle class.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Energy Encyclopedia Vol. 6'', page 420&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, windmills, unlike water mills, were not rendered inoperable by the freezing of water in the winter.

By the 14th century Dutch [[windmill]]s were in use to drain areas of the [[Rhine River]] delta.

The first wind turbine used for the production of electricity was built in Scotland in July 1887 by [[Prof James Blyth]] of [[Anderson's College]], Glasgow (the precursor of [[Strathclyde University]]).&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price |first=Trevor J |title=James Blyth - Britain's First Modern Wind Power Engineer |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mscp/wind/2005/00000029/00000003/art00002 |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=191–200 |date=3 May 2005 |doi=10.1260/030952405774354921 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth's 10 m high, cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at [[Marykirk]] in [[Kincardineshire]] and was used to charge [[accumulator (energy)|accumulator]]s developed by the Frenchman [[Camille Alphonse Faure]], to power the lighting in the cottage,&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; thus making it the first house in the world to have its electricity supplied by wind power.&lt;ref name="Shackleton"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth offered the surplus electricity to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electricity was "the work of the devil."&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

Across the Atlantic, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 1887-1888 by [[Charles F. Brush]],&lt;ref&gt;[Anon, 1890, 'Mr. Brush's Windmill Dynamo', Scientific American, vol 63 no. 25, 20 December, p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt; this was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windpower.org/en/pictures/brush.htm A Wind Energy Pioneer: Charles F.

Accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brush wind turbine had a rotor 17 m (56 foot) in diameter and was mounted on an 18 m (60 foot) tower. Although large by today's standards, the machine was only rated at 12&amp;nbsp;kW; it turned relatively slowly since it had 144 blades. The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 [[incandescent light bulb]]s, three arc lamps, and various motors in Brush's laboratory. The machine fell into disuse after 1900 when electricity became available from Cleveland's central stations, and was abandoned in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in Cutler J. Cleveland,(ed) ''Encyclopedia of Energy Vol.6'', Elsevier, {{ISBN|978-1-60119-433-6}}, 2007, pp. 421-422&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 [[Denmark|Danish]] scientist, [[Poul la Cour]], constructed a wind turbine to generate electricity, which was used to produce [[hydrogen]]&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; by [[electrolysis]] to be stored for use in experiments and to light the Askov High school. He later solved the problem of producing a steady supply of power by inventing a regulator, the Kratostate, and in 1895 converted his windmill into a prototype electrical power plant that was used to light the village of Askov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historybecauseitshere.weebly.com/poul-la-cour-pioneered-wind-mill-power-in-denmark.html|title=Poul la Cour Pioneered Wind Mill Power in Denmark|last=Warnes|first=Kathy|work=History, because it's there|accessdate=20 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129092021/http://historybecauseitshere.weebly.com/poul-la-cour-pioneered-wind-mill-power-in-denmark.html|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark there were about 2,500 windmills by 1900, used for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills, producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 MW.

In the American midwest between 1850 and 1900, a large number of small windmills, perhaps six million, were installed on farms to operate irrigation pumps.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Encyclopedia of Energy'',pg. 421&lt;/ref&gt;  Firms such as Star, Eclipse, [[Fairbanks-Morse]], and [[Aeromotor]] became famed suppliers in North and South America.

== 20th century ==

Development in the 20th century might be usefully divided into the periods:
* 1900–1973, when widespread use of individual wind generators competed against fossil fuel plants and centrally-generated electricity
* 1973–onward, when the [[1973 oil crisis|oil price crisis]] spurred investigation of non-petroleum energy sources.

=== 1900–1973 ===

==== Danish development ====
In Denmark wind power was an important part of a decentralized electrification in the first quarter of the 20th century, partly because of Poul la Cour from his first practical development in 1891 at Askov. By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators from 5&amp;nbsp;kW to 25&amp;nbsp;kW. The largest machines were on 24&amp;nbsp;m (79&amp;nbsp;ft) towers with four-bladed 23&amp;nbsp;m (75&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter rotors.&lt;ref name=EncycEnergy /&gt; In 1957 [[Johannes Juul]] installed a 24 m diameter [[Gedser wind turbine|wind turbine at Gedser]], which ran from 1957 until 1967.  This was a three-bladed, horizontal-axis, upwind, stall-regulated turbine similar to those now used for commercial wind power development.&lt;ref name=EncycEnergy&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Encyclopedia of Energy Vol. 6'', page 426&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Farm power and isolated plants ====
In 1927 the brothers Joe Jacobs and Marcellus Jacobs opened a factory, [[Jacobs Wind]] in [[Minneapolis]] to produce wind turbine generators for farm use.  These would typically be used for lighting or battery charging, on farms out of reach of central-station electricity and distribution lines. In 30 years the firm produced about 30,000 small wind turbines, some of which ran for many years in remote locations in Africa and on the [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] expedition to [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Energy Encyclopedia vol. 6'', page 422&lt;/ref&gt; Many other manufacturers produced small wind turbine sets for the same market, including companies called Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline and Winpower.

In 1931 the [[Darrieus wind turbine]] was invented, with its [[Wind turbine#Vertical axis design|vertical axis]] providing a different mix of design tradeoffs from the conventional horizontal-axis wind turbine. The vertical orientation accepts wind from any direction with no need for adjustments, and the heavy generator and gearbox equipment can rest on the ground instead of atop a tower.

By the 1930s windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed. Used to replenish battery storage banks, these machines typically had generating capacities of a few hundred watts to several kilowatts. Beside providing farm power, they were also used for isolated applications such as [[cathodic protection|electrifying]] bridge structures to prevent corrosion. In this period, high tensile steel was cheap, and windmills were placed atop prefabricated open steel [[lattice tower]]s.

The most widely used small wind generator produced for American farms in the 1930s was a two-bladed horizontal-axis machine manufactured by the Wincharger Corporation. It had a peak output of 200 watts. Blade speed was regulated by curved air brakes near the hub that deployed at excessive rotational velocities. These machines were still being manufactured in the United States during the 1980s. In 1936, the U.S. started a [[Rural Utilities Service|rural electrification]] project that killed the natural market for wind-generated power, since network power distribution provided a farm with more dependable usable energy for a given amount of capital investment.

In Australia, the Dunlite Corporation built hundreds of small wind generators to provide power at isolated postal service stations and farms. These machines were manufactured from 1936 until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearen.ca/dunlite/Dunlite.htm Dunlite history page Retrieved 28 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Utility-scale turbines ====
[[File:Wind turbine 1941.jpg|thumb|The world's first megawatt-sized wind turbine near Grandpa's Knob Summit,&lt;!-- yes, this is the real name for the [http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains/detail.asp?fid=3618456 mountain] the turbine was built on -see the citation- --&gt;, [[Castleton, Vermont]].&lt;ref name=NP /&gt;]]
[[File:Eolienne 006 02.jpg|thumb|right|Experimental wind turbine at [[Nogent-le-Roi]], France, 1955.]]

A forerunner of modern horizontal-axis utility-scale wind generators was the WIME D-30 in service in [[Balaklava]], near [[Yalta]], [[USSR]] from 1931 until 1942. This was a 100&amp;nbsp;kW generator on a 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) tower, connected to the local 6.3 kV distribution system. It had a three-bladed 30 metre rotor on a steel lattice tower.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Hau, ''Wind turbines: fundamentals, technologies, application, economics'', Birkhäuser, 2006 {{ISBN|3-540-24240-6}}, page 32, with a photo&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reported to have an annual [[load factor (electrical)|load factor]] of 32 per cent,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wyatt, Electric Power: Challenges and Choices,(1986),Book Press Ltd., Toronto, {{ISBN|0-920650-00-7}} , page NN&lt;/ref&gt; not much different from current wind machines.&lt;ref&gt;See also Robert W. Righter ''Wind energy in America: a history'' page 127 which gives a slightly different description.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 the [[Smith-Putnam wind turbine|world's first megawatt-size wind turbine]] was connected to the local electrical distribution system on the mountain known as Grandpa's Knob in [[Castleton, Vermont]], United States. It was designed by [[Palmer Cosslett Putnam]] and manufactured by the S. Morgan Smith Company.  This 1.25 MW Smith-Putnam turbine operated for 1100 hours before a blade failed at a known weak point, which had not been reinforced due to war-time material shortages. No similar-sized unit was to repeat this "bold experiment" for about forty years.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;[http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf The Return of Windpower to Grandpa's Knob and Rutland County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828170455/http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf |date=28 August 2008 }}, Noble Environmental Power, LLC, 12 November 2007.

==== Fuel-saving turbines ====
During the [[Second World War]], small wind generators were used on German U-boats to recharge submarine batteries as a fuel-conserving measure. In 1946 the [[Great Tower Neuwerk|lighthouse]] and residences on the island of [[Neuwerk]] were partly powered by an 18&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine 15 metres in diameter, to economize on diesel fuel. This installation ran for around 20 years before being replaced by a submarine cable to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri R. Stein, '' Pioneer in the North Sea: 1946 Insel Neuwerk Turbine'', in ''IEEE Power and Energy Magazine'', September/October 2009, pp. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The Station d'Etude de l'Energie du Vent at [[Nogent-le-Roi]] in France operated an experimental 800 KVA wind turbine from 1956 to 1966.&lt;ref name="cavey2004"&gt;

=== 1973–2000 ===

==== US development ====
From 1974 through the mid-1980s the United States government worked with industry to advance the technology and enable large commercial wind turbines. The [[NASA wind turbines]] were developed under a program to create a utility-scale wind turbine industry in the U.S. With funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] and later the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE), a total of 13 experimental wind turbines were put into operation, in four major wind turbine designs. This research and development program pioneered many of the multi-megawatt turbine technologies in use today, including: steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities. The large wind turbines developed under this effort set several world records for diameter and power output. The MOD-2 wind turbine cluster of three turbines produced 7.5 megawatts of power in 1981. In 1987, the MOD-5B was the largest single wind turbine operating in the world with a rotor diameter of nearly 100 meters and a rated power of 3.2 megawatts.  It demonstrated an availability of 95 percent, an unparalleled level for a new first-unit wind turbine. The MOD-5B had the first large-scale variable speed drive train and a sectioned, two-blade rotor that enabled easy transport of the blades. The 4 megawatt WTS-4 held the world record for power output for over 20 years. Although the later units were sold commercially, none of these two-bladed machines were ever put into mass production. When oil prices declined by a factor of three from 1980 through the early 1990s,&lt;ref name=OilHistory&gt;[[Price of petroleum]],&lt;/ref&gt; many turbine manufacturers, both large and small, left the business. The commercial sales of the NASA/Boeing Mod-5B, for example, came to an end in 1987 when Boeing Engineering and Construction announced they were "planning to leave the market because low oil prices are keeping windmills for electricity generation uneconomical."&lt;ref name=BoeingLeaves&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1987/8701230009.asp{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Hawaiians get Boeing's Last Wind Machine Makani Ho'Olapa will Bring Power to 1,140 Residences'' 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the 1980s, [[California]] provided [[tax rebate]]s for wind power. These rebates funded the first major use of wind power for utility electricity. These machines, gathered in large wind parks such as at [[Altamont Pass]] would be considered small and un-economic by modern wind power development standards.

====Danish development====

A giant change took place in 1978 when the world's [[:da:Vindkraftværket Tvindkraft|first multi-megawatt wind turbine]] was constructed. It pioneered many technologies used in modern wind turbines and allowed Vestas, Siemens and others to get the parts they needed. Especially important was the novel wing construction using help from German aeronautics specialists. The power plant was capable of delivering 2MW, had a tubular tower, pitch controlled wings and three blades. It was built by the teachers and students of the Tvind school. Before completion these "amateurs" were much ridiculed. The turbine still runs today and looks almost identical to the newest most modern mills.

Danish commercial wind power development stressed incremental improvements in capacity and efficiency based on extensive serial production of turbines, in contrast with development models requiring extensive steps in unit size based primarily on theoretical extrapolation.  A practical consequence is that all commercial wind turbines resemble the ''Danish model'', a light-weight three-blade upwind design.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe '' Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995 {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

All major [[Wind turbine#Horizontal axis|horizontal axis]] turbines today rotate the same way (clockwise) to present a coherent view. However, early turbines rotated counter-clockwise like the old windmills, but a shift occurred from 1978 and on. The individualist-minded [[Wind turbine design#Blades|blade]] supplier Økær made the decision to change direction in order to be distinguished from the [[collective]] [[Tvind]] and their small wind turbines. Some of the blade customers were companies that later evolved into [[Vestas]], [[Siemens]], [[Enercon]] and [[Nordex]]. Public demand required that all turbines rotate the same way, and the success of these companies made clockwise the new standard.&lt;ref name="woc77-81"&gt;Grove-Nielsen, Erik. [http://www.windsofchange.dk/WOC-77-81.php Økær Vind Energi 1977 - 1981] ''Winds of Change''. Retrieved: 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-sufficiency and back-to-the-land ====
In the 1970s many people began to desire a self-sufficient life-style. [[Solar cell]]s were too expensive for small-scale electrical generation, so some turned to windmills. At first they built ad-hoc designs using wood and automobile parts. Most people discovered that a reliable wind generator is a moderately complex engineering project, well beyond the ability of most amateurs. Some began to search for and rebuild farm wind generators from the 1930s, of which Jacobs Wind Electric Company machines were especially sought after. Hundreds of Jacobs machines were reconditioned and sold during the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Following experience with reconditioned 1930s wind turbines, a new generation of American manufacturers started building and selling small wind turbines not only for battery-charging but also for interconnection to electricity networks. An early example would be Enertech Corporation of Norwich, Vermont, which began building 1.8&amp;nbsp;kW models in the early 1980s.

In the 1990s, as aesthetics and durability became more important, turbines were placed atop tubular steel or reinforced concrete towers. Small generators are connected to the tower on the ground, then the tower is raised into position. Larger generators are hoisted into position atop the tower and there is a ladder or staircase inside the tower to allow technicians to reach and maintain the generator, while protected from the weather.

== 21st century ==
[[File:Wind turbine size increase 1980-2011.png|thumb|Size comparison of modern wind turbines]]

As the 21st century began, fossil fuel was still relatively cheap, but rising concerns over [[energy security]], [[global warming]], and eventual [[peak oil|fossil fuel depletion]] led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of [[renewable energy]]. The fledgling commercial wind power industry began expanding at a robust growth rate of about 25% per year, driven by the ready availability of large wind resources, and falling costs due to improved technology and wind farm management.&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/03/btm-forecasts-340-gw-of-wind-by-2013?src=rss |title=BTM Forecasts 340-GW of Wind Energy by 2013 |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steady run-up in [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil prices after 2003]] led to increasing fears that [[peak oil]] was imminent, further increasing interest in commercial wind power. Even though wind power generates electricity rather than liquid fuels, and thus is not an immediate substitute for petroleum in most applications (especially transport), fears over petroleum shortages only added to the urgency to expand wind power. Earlier oil crises had already caused many utility and industrial users of petroleum to shift to [[coal]] or [[natural gas]]. Wind power showed potential for replacing natural gas in electricity generation on a cost basis.

These floating turbines are a very different construction technology—closer to floating oil rigs rather—than traditional fixed-bottom, shallow-water [[monopile foundation]]s that are used in the other large [[offshore wind farm]]s to date.

By late 2011, Japan announced plans to build a multiple-unit floating wind farm, with six 2-megawatt turbines, off the [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima coast]] of northeast Japan where the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster]] has created a scarcity of electric power.&lt;ref name=bb20110916&gt;

===Airborne turbines===
{{see also|High altitude wind power}}
Airborne wind energy systems use airfoils or [[Airborne wind turbine|turbines supported in the air]] by buoyancy or by aerodynamic lift. The purpose is to eliminate the expense of tower construction, and allow extraction of wind energy from steadier, faster, winds higher in the atmosphere. As yet no grid-scale plants have been constructed.  Many design concepts have been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith|first=Saul|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/saul_griffith_on_kites_as_the_future_of_renewable_energy|title=High-altitude wind energy from kites!

==Notes==
#{{Note|a}}The terms "horizontal" and "vertical" refer to the plane of rotation of the sails. Modern wind turbines are generally referred to by the plane of rotation of the main axle (windshaft). Thus a horizontal mill may also be described as a "vertical-axis windmill" and a vertical mill may also be described as a "horizontal-axis windmill".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Induction''' is used to refer to a period during which a [[Newly Qualified Teacher]] in [[England]] or [[Wales]] is both supported and assessed to ensure that regulatory standards are met.

==Background==
Although probation periods for new teachers had only been dropped in 1992, the [[Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998]] introduced arrangements by which the [[Secretary of State for Education]] could bring about regulations requiring new teachers to serve a period of induction.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/80030--d.htm|title=Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998|accessdate=2007-01-22|publisher=HMSO|year=1998|author=HM Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the then secretary of state, [[David Blunkett]] introduced an induction period under The Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/19991065.htm|title=The Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/1065) |accessdate=2007-01-21|publisher=HMSO|year=1999|author=HM Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations made it a requirement that all teachers complete an induction period equivalent to one year upon qualification as a teacher.

==Requirements==
Under current regulations, teachers wishing to work in maintained [[state school]]s must satisfactorily complete a period of induction. During this period, a newly qualified teacher is entitled to additional support and subject to regular observation and assessment to ensure that he or she is meeting the required induction standards.

===Standards===
Having achieved [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS), teachers are expected to continue to meet the standards required for that qualification. In addition, they must meet the 6 criteria set out in the induction standards:
# Seek and use opportunities to work collaboratively with colleagues to raise standards by sharing effective practice in the school.
#Show a commitment to their professional development by
##identifying areas in which they need to improve their professional knowledge, understanding and practice in order to teach more effectively in their current post, and
##with support, taking steps to address these needs. 
#Plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils in their classes with special educational needs, with or without statements, and in consultation with the SENCO contribute to the preparation, implementation, monitoring and review of Individual Education Plans or the equivalent.
#Liaise effectively with parents or carers on pupils’ progress and achievements.
#Work effectively as part of a team and, as appropriate to the post in which they are completing induction, liaise with, deploy, and guide the work of other adults who support pupils’ learning.
#Secure a standard of behaviour that enables pupils to learn, and act to pre empt and deal with inappropriate behaviour in the context of the behaviour policy of the school.

===Support===
In order to support newly qualified teachers in meeting the standards, a number of entitlements are guaranteed by regulations:
*a reduced timetable (of no more than 90% of other equivalent teachers)
*support from an induction tutor
*a named induction contact at a [[local education authority]] or other body

===Assessment===
In addition, all teachers undergoing a programme of induction are subject to assessment processes, including:
*regular observations every 6–8 weeks
*a termly review meeting
*a decision at the end of the induction period to ascertain whether the required standards have been met.

==Restrictions==
Induction can only be completed in a restricted range of school types. Similarly, teachers who have not completed, and are not completing, induction can only be employed in such school types under special circumstances

===Completing induction===
Induction can only be completed in eligible schools in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Guernsey]], [[Jersey]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Gibraltar]] or at [[Service Children's Education]] (SCE) schools in [[Cyprus]] and [[Germany]].
Eligible schools are [[maintained school]]s, non-maintained [[special school]]s, [[independent school]]s (with support from either a [[local education authority]] or [[The Independent Schools' Council Teacher Induction Panel]], or a [[sixth form college]] under certain circumstances.

===Teachers not completing induction===
Teachers who have not completed a period of induction are limited in the work they can carry out in eligible schools.

Where a teacher is employed in an eligible school for at least one term, he or she must be offered, and must undertake, a programme of induction lasting throughout that period.

Teachers who have not completed a period of induction can only work in eligible schools for periods of less than one term during a restricted time-frame. This time-frame begins on the first day that such employment begins, and expires no later than four terms from that date (approximately 16 months). Teachers who have reached this point may seek an extension to this period from the relevant [[local education authority]].

Teachers who have not completed a period of induction are eligible to work in [[independent school]]s

===Time limits===
As stated in the statutory guidance on induction for newly qualified teachers in England, there is no set time limit for starting or completing an induction period. The previous ruling that an NQT needed to complete the induction period within 5 years was abolished in September 2008.

{{Internet}}
'''Internet slang''' ('''Internet shorthand''', '''cyber-slang''', '''netspeak''', or '''chatspeak''') refers to various kinds of [[slang]] used by different people on the [[Internet]]. An example of Internet slang is "&lt;code&gt;[[:wikt:LOL#English|LOL]]&lt;/code&gt;" meaning "laugh out loud". It is difficult to provide a standardized definition of Internet slang due to the constant changes made to its nature.&lt;ref name=Yin&gt;Yin Yan (2006) World Wide Web and the Formation of the Chinese and English "Internet Slang Union". Computer-Assisted Foreign Language Education. Vol. 1. {{ISSN|1001-5795}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be understood to be any type of [[slang]] that [[Internet]] users have popularized, and in many cases, have coined. Such terms often originate with the purpose of saving [[keystroke]]s or to compensate for small character limits. Many people use the same [[abbreviation]]s in [[text messaging|texting]] and [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking websites]]. [[Acronym]]s, [[Computer keyboard|keyboard symbols]] and [[abbreviation]]s are common types of Internet slang. New dialects of slang, such as [[leet]] or [[Lolcat|Lolspeak]], develop as [[ingroup]] [[internet meme]]s rather than time savers. Some people only use LOL for fun. Many people use this [[internet slang]] not only on the Internet but also face-to-face.

==Creation and evolution==

===Origins===
Internet slang originated in the early days of the Internet with some terms predating the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daw |first=David |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/248526/web_jargon_origins_revealed.html |title=Web Jargon Origins Revealed |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet slang is used in [[chat room]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[online game]]s, [[video game]]s and in the [[online community]]. Since 1979, users of communications networks like [[Usenet]] created their own [[shorthand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meggyn |url=http://theunderenlightened.com/trolling-for-slang-the-origins-of-internet-werdz/ |title=Trolling For Slang: The Origins of Internet Werdz |publisher=Theunderenlightened.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pop culture==
In Japanese, the term [[moe (slang)|moe]] has come into common use among slang users to mean something extremely cute and appealing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Aside from the more frequent abbreviations, acronyms, and [[emoticon]]s, Internet slang also uses archaic words or the lesser-known meanings of mainstream terms.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt; Regular words can also be altered into something with a similar pronunciation but altogether different meaning, or attributed new meanings altogether.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt; Phonetic transcriptions of foreign words, such as the transformation of "impossible" into "&lt;code&gt;impossibru&lt;/code&gt;" in Japanese and then [the [[transliteration]] of that] back to [the character set used for] English, also occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In places where [[logograph]]ic languages are used, such as China, a visual Internet slang exists, giving characters dual meanings, one direct and one implied.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt;

===Motivations===
The primary motivation for using a slang unique to the Internet is to ease [[communication]]. However, while Internet slang shortcuts save time for the writer, they take two times as long for the reader to understand, according to a study by the [[University of Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't be 404, know the tech slang|date=December 10, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7775013.stm|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, similar to the use of slang in traditional face-to-face speech or written language, slang on the Internet is often a way of indicating [[social group|group membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=1997|title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language|edition= Second |location=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet slang provides a channel which facilitates and constrains our ability to communicate in ways that are fundamentally different from those found in other semiotic situations. Many of the expectations and practices which we associate with spoken and written language are no longer applicable. The Internet itself is ideal for new slang to emerge because of the richness of the medium and the availability of information.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; Slang is also thus motivated for the “creation and sustenance of online communities”.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; These communities, in turn, play a role in solidarity or identification&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt;&lt;ref name= miao /&gt; or an exclusive or common cause.&lt;ref name=mud /&gt;

David Crystal distinguishes among five areas of the Internet where slang is used- [[World Wide Web|The Web itself]], [[email]], [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous chat]] (for example, [[mailing list]]s), [[synchronous communication|synchronous chat]] (for example, [[Internet Relay Chat]]), and [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name=Davidcrystal&gt;{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=2001|title= Language and the Internet|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-80212-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[computer|electronic]] character of the channel has a fundamental influence on the language of the medium. Options for communication are constrained by the nature of the hardware needed in order to gain Internet access. Thus, productive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be sent) is determined by the preassigned characters on a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], and receptive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be seen) is determined by the size and configuration of the screen. Additionally, both sender and receiver are constrained linguistically by the properties of the internet [[software]], [[computer hardware]], and [[networking hardware]] linking them. Electronic discourse refers to writing that is "very often reads as if it were being spoken – that is, as if the sender were writing talking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Davis, B.H. &amp; Brewer, J. P. |date=1997 |title=Electronic discourse: linguistic individuals in virtual space|location= Albany, NY|publisher= State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of slang==

Internet slang does not constitute a homogeneous language variety. Rather, it differs according to the user and type of Internet situation.&lt;ref name=hohenhaus&gt;Hohenhaus, Peter (2005). Elements of traditional and "reverse" purism in relation to computer-mediated communication. In Langer, Nils and Winifred V. Davies (eds.), Linguistic Purism in the Germanic Languages. Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 203-220.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the language of Internet slang, there is still an element of [[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]], as seen in [[style guides]], for example ''Wired Style'',&lt;ref name=hale&gt;[Hale, C. and Scanlon, J (1999). Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age. New York: Broadway Books]&lt;/ref&gt; which are specifically aimed at usage on the Internet. Even so, few users consciously heed these prescriptive recommendations on CMC, but rather adapt their styles based on what they encounter online.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Naomi. (2000). ''Alphabet to Email.'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is difficult to produce a clear definition of Internet slang, the following types of slang may be observed. This list is not exhaustive.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Description
|-
| Letter homophones || Included within this group are [[abbreviation]]s and [[acronym]]s. An abbreviation is a shortening of a word, for example "&lt;code&gt;CU&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;CYA&lt;/code&gt;" for "see you (see ya)". An acronym, on the other hand, is a subset of abbreviations and are formed from the initial components of a word. Examples of common acronyms include "&lt;code&gt;LOL&lt;/code&gt;" for "laugh out loud", "&lt;code&gt;BTW&lt;/code&gt;" for "by the way" and "&lt;code&gt;TFW&lt;/code&gt;" for "that feeling when". There are also combinations of both, like "&lt;code&gt;CUL8R&lt;/code&gt;" for "see you later".
|-
| Punctuation, capitalizations, and other symbols || Such features are commonly used for emphasis. Periods or exclamation marks may be used repeatedly for emphasis, such as "&lt;code&gt;........&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/code&gt;". Question marks and exclamation marks are often used together in strings such as "&lt;code&gt;?!?!?!?!&lt;/code&gt;" when one is angry while asking a question. Grammatical punctuation rules are also relaxed on the Internet. "E-mail" may simply be expressed as "&lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;", and apostrophes can be dropped so that "John's book" becomes "&lt;code&gt;johns book&lt;/code&gt;". Examples of capitalizations include "&lt;code&gt;STOP IT&lt;/code&gt;", which can convey a stronger emotion of annoyance as opposed to "stop it". Bold, underline and italics are also used to indicate stress.
|-
| Onomatopoeic and/or stylized spellings || [[Onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeic]] spellings have also become popularized on the Internet. One well-known example is "&lt;code&gt;hahaha&lt;/code&gt;" to indicate laughter. Onomatopoeic spellings are very language specific. For instance, in Spanish, laughter is spelled as "&lt;code&gt;jajaja&lt;/code&gt;" instead because J is pronounced like H in Spanish. In Thai it's 55555 because 5 in Thai is said Ha. In Korean, it is "&lt;code&gt;kekeke&lt;/code&gt;".
|-
| Keyboard-generated emoticons and smileys || [[Emoticon]]s are generally found in web forums, instant messengers, and online games. They are culture-specific and certain emoticons are only found in some languages but not in others. For example, the Japanese equivalent of emoticons, kaomoji (literally "face marks"), focus on the eyes instead of the mouth as in Western emoticons. They are also meant to be read right-side up, as in &lt;code&gt;^_^&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to sideways, &lt;code&gt;:3&lt;/code&gt;. More recently than face emoticons, other emoticon symbols such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;3&lt;/code&gt; (which is a sideways heart) have emerged. Compared to emoticons used in Western cultures such as the [[United States]], kaomoji play a very distinct social role in online discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Katsuno, Hirofumi and Christine R. Yano (2002), ''[[Asian Studies Review]]'' 26(2): 205-231&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Direct requests || These are found in chat engines such as [[Internet Relay Chat]] or online games, where personal identities may be concealed. As such, questions such as "&lt;code&gt;A/S/L?&lt;/code&gt;" which stands for "age, sex, location?" are commonly posed.&lt;ref name=Thurlow&gt;Thurlow, C. (2001), Language and the Internet, In R, Mesthrie &amp; R, Asher (Eds), The concise encyclopedia of sociolinguistics, London: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Leet || [[Leet]]speak, or &lt;code&gt;1337&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1337 - what is it and how to be 1337|url=http://www.1337.net/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative alphabet for the English language which uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters. For example, Wikipedia may be expressed as "&lt;code&gt;\/\/1|&lt;1p3[)14&lt;/code&gt;". It originated from computer hacking, but its use has been extended to online gaming as well. Leet is far less common now than in the first decades of the internet.
|-
| Novel [[syntax|syntactic]] features || Unusual syntactic structures such as "[[I Can Has Cheezburger?]]" and "You are doing me a frighten" have been encouraged and spread by highly successful memes. Pluralization of "the internets" is another example, which has become common since it was used by [[George W. Bush]] during a televised event.
|-
| [[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] || Flaming refers to the use of rude or profane language in interactions between Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, N.S. (2003). Language of the Internet. In A. Farghali (Ed.), The Stanford handbook for language engineers (pp. 59—127). Stanford, California: CSLI&lt;/ref&gt; It can be caused by any subject of polarizing nature. For example, there is an ongoing debate among users of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[classic Mac OS]]/[[macOS]] as to which is "superior". Historically, the act of flaming has been described as an intrinsic quality of [[email]]s due to an absence of visual and auditory cues in [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC).&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Martin, Tim O’Shea, Pat Fung, and Russel Spears (1992), ‘Flaming’ in Computer-Mediated Communication. Contexts of Computer-Mediated Communication, ed. Martin Lea, 89-112. New York: Harvester Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Padonkaffsky jargon]] || Olbanian language is a [[Russian language|Russian]] [[Cant (language)|cant]] language developed by [[padonki]] of [[Runet]]. The language entered mainstream culture and it has been suggested that Olbanian should be taught in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usrbc.org/resources/russiannews/event/1192 |title=Reuters |publisher=Usrbc.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems exist for other languages with non-Roman scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic.

==Views on Internet slang==

There have been ongoing debates about how the use of slang on the Internet influences language usage outside of technology. Even though the direct causal relationship between the Internet and language has yet to be proven by any scientific research,&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |title=Internet’s Effect on Language Debated |publisher=Newjerseynewsroom.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422130830/http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet slang has invited split views on its influence on the standard of language use in non-computer-mediated communications.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptivists]] tend to have the widespread belief that the Internet has a negative influence on the future of language, and that it would lead to a degradation of standard.&lt;ref name=Davidcrystal /&gt; Some would even attribute any decline of standard formal English to the increase in usage of electronic communication.&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /&gt; It has also been suggested that the linguistic differences between Standard English and CMC can have implications for literacy education.&lt;ref&gt;Hawisher, Gale E. and Cynthia L. Selfe (eds). (2002). Global Literacies and the World-Wide Web. London/New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; This is illustrated by the widely reported example of a school essay submitted by a Scottish teenager, which contained many abbreviations and acronyms likened to [[SMS language]]. There was great condemnation of this style by the mass media as well as educationists, who expressed that this showed diminishing literacy or linguistic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2814235.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; UK &amp;#124; Is txt mightier than the word? |publisher=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] have counter-argued that the Internet allows better expressions of a language.&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /&gt; Rather than established linguistic conventions, linguistic choices sometimes reflect personal taste.&lt;ref name=baron&gt;Baron, Naomi S. (2002). Who sets email style: Prescriptivism, coping strategies, and democratizing communication access. The Information Society 18, 403-413&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that as opposed to intentionally flouting language conventions, Internet slang is a result of a lack of motivation to monitor speech online.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Naomi (2003) “Why Email Looks Like Speech: Proofreading Pedagogy and Public Face.” In New Media Language, ed. Jean Aitchison and Diana M. Lewis, 85–94. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Hale and Scanlon describe language in Emails as being derived from "writing the way people talk", and that there is no need to insist on 'Standard' English.&lt;ref name=hale /&gt; English users, in particular, have an extensive tradition of etiquette guides, instead of traditional prescriptive treatises, that offer pointers on linguistic appropriateness.&lt;ref name=baron /&gt; Using and spreading Internet slang also adds onto the cultural currency of a language.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt; It is important to the speakers of the language due to the foundation it provides for identifying within a group, and also for defining a person’s individual linguistic and communicative competence.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt; The result is a specialized subculture based on its use of slang.&lt;ref name="annemarie"&gt;Simon-Vandenbergen, Anne Marie (2008) Deciphering L33t5p34k: Internet Slang on Message Boards. Thesis paper. Ghent University Faculty of Arts and Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarly research, attention has, for example, been drawn to the effect of the use of Internet slang in [[ethnography]], and more importantly to how conversational relationships online change structurally because slang is used.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia, Angela Cora, Standlee, Alecea I., Beckhoff, Jennifer and Yan Cui. Ethnographic Approaches to the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication. Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. Vol. 38 No. 1 pp 52–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, there is already considerable controversy regarding the use of [[anglicisms]] outside of CMC.&lt;ref&gt;Hohenhaus, Peter. (2002).

==Use beyond computer-mediated communication==
Internet [[slang]] has crossed from being mediated by the computer into other non-physical domains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Crystal, David (September 20, 2001). Language and the Internet. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80212-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, these domains are taken to refer to any domain of interaction where interlocutors need not be geographically proximate to one another, and where the Internet is not primarily used. Internet slang is now prevalent in telephony, mainly through short messages ([[SMS]]) communication. [[Abbreviation]]s and [[interjection]]s, especially, have been popularized in this medium, perhaps due to the limited character space for writing messages on mobile phones. Another possible reason for this spread is the convenience of transferring the existing mappings between expression and meaning into a similar space of interaction.&lt;ref name=new.bbc.co.uk&gt;"Don't be 404, know the tech slang". BBC. December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Internet slang has also taken a place as part of everyday [[offline]] language, among those with digital access.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The nature and content of [[online]] conversation is brought forward to direct [[offline]] [[communication]] through the [[telephone]] and direct talking, as well as through [[Orthography|written language]], such as in writing notes or letters. In the case of interjections, such as numerically based and abbreviated Internet slang, are not pronounced as they are written physically or replaced by any actual action. Rather, they become [[Lexicalisation|lexicalized]] and spoken like non-slang words in a “stage direction” like fashion, where the actual action is not carried out but substituted with a verbal signal. The notions of flaming and [[troll (Internet)|trolling]] have also extended outside the computer, and are used in the same circumstances of deliberate or unintentional implicatures.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt;

The expansion of Internet slang has been furthered through codification and the promotion of digital literacy. The subsequently existing and growing popularity of such references among those online as well as offline has thus advanced Internet slang [[Digital literacy|literacy]] and globalized it.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (2004) The glocal village: Internet and community. Arts and Science Review. University of Toronto. Issue 1, Series 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness and proficiency in manipulating Internet slang in both online and offline communication indicates digital literacy and teaching materials have even been developed to further this knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Singhal |first= M. |title=The Internet and foreign language education: Benefits and challenges |publisher=The Internet TESL Journal |year=1997 |url=http://iteslj.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A South Korean publisher, for example, has published a textbook that details the meaning and context of use for common Internet slang instances and is targeted at young children who will soon be using the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ashcroft, Brian (2010) Hey Korean Kids, Let’s Learn Leetspeak And Internet Slang. Published February 11th, 2010. Retrieved from [http://kotaku.com/5469239/hey-korean-kids-lets-learn-leetspeak-and-internet-slang]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Internet slang has been recommended as language teaching material in second language classrooms in order to raise communicative competence by imparting some of the cultural value attached to a language that is available only in slang.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana, M. (2004) Integration of Effective Internet Resources for Future Teachers of Bilingual Ed. National Association of African American Studies, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, well-known dictionaries such as the [[Oxford Dictionary of English|OED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/category/word-trends-and-new-words/ |title=Oxford Dictionary official blog |publisher=Blog.oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Merriam-Webster]] have been updated with a significant and growing body of slang jargon. Besides common examples, lesser known slang and slang with a non-English etymology have also found a place in standardized linguistic references. Along with these instances, literature in user-contributed dictionaries such as [[Urban Dictionary]] has also been added to. Codification seems to be qualified through frequency of use, and novel creations are often not accepted by other users of slang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Brian |url=http://www.noslang.com/rejects/ |title=Rejects |publisher=Noslang.com |accessdate= 28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet slang today===
Although Internet slang began as a means of "opposition" to mainstream language, its popularity with today's globalized digitally literate population has shifted it into a part of everyday language, where it also leaves a profound impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Unbulleted list | {{cite web |last= Eller |first= Lara L. |year= 2005 |work= Thesis |title= Instant Message Communication and its Impact upon Written Language |publisher= [[West Virginia University]] |url=  http://www.wvu.edu/ }}
{{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= WVU Scholar |url= http://wvuscholar.wvu.edu/ |subscription= yes }}
 | {{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= University of Hong Kong |url= http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3632984 |subscription= yes }} | {{cite web |format= pdf |title= Alternate source |website= Research Gate |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267419817_Instant_Message_Communication_and_its_Impact_upon_Written_Language }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently used slang also have become conventionalised into memetic "unit[s] of cultural information".&lt;ref name=bas&gt;{{cite web |last=Flamand |first=E |year=2008 |title=The impossible task of dialog analysis in chatboxes |url=http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:D28k7Tswv5wJ:scholar.google.com/+internet+slang+meme&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These memes in turn are further spread through their use on the Internet, prominently through websites. The Internet as an "information superhighway" is also catalysed through slang.&lt;ref name="annemarie"/&gt; The evolution of slang has also created a 'slang union'&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt; as part of a unique, specialised subculture.&lt;ref name=annemarie /&gt; Such impacts are, however, limited and requires further discussion especially from the non-English world. This is because Internet slang is prevalent in languages more actively used on the [[Internet]], like [[English language|English]], which is the [[Internet]]’s [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20332763|title=Learn English online: How the internet is changing language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/lingua-franca.html|title=English - the universal language on the Internet?|quote=English essentially is the universal language of the Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[File:Grass Mud Horse Seal.svg|thumb|Chinese seal carving work. The character is a combination of three characters, which is done by Chinese [[netizen]]. This is a satire of [[Chinese Internet censorship]]. See [[Grass Mud Horse]].]]

The Internet has helped people from all over the world to become connected to one another, enabling "global" relationships to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman (2004). "The Glocal Village: Internet and Community." ''Ideas&amp;s'' Vol 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is important for the various types of slang used online to be recognizable for everyone. It is also important to do so because of how other languages are quickly catching up with English on the Internet, following the increase in Internet usage in predominantly non-English speaking countries. In fact, as of May 31, 2011, only approximately 27% of the online population is made up of English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm |title=Internet World Stats |publisher=Internet World Stats |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different cultures tend to have different motivations behind their choice of slang, on top of the difference in language used. For example, in [[Chinese Internet Slang|China]], because of the tough Internet regulations imposed, users tend to use certain slang to talk about issues deemed as sensitive to the government. These include using symbols to separate the characters of a word to avoid detection from manual or automated text pattern scanning and consequential [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Shuguang (2008). "Notes On The Net." ''Index on Censorship'' Vol 37:2&lt;/ref&gt; An outstanding example is the use of the term [[river crab (Internet slang)|&lt;code&gt;river crab&lt;/code&gt;]] to denote censorship. River crab (hexie) is pronounced the same as "harmony"—the official term used to justify political discipline and censorship. As such Chinese netizens reappropriate the official terms in a sarcastic way.&lt;ref&gt;Nordin, Astrid and Richaud, Lisa (2014), "Subverting official language and discourse in China? Type river rrab for harmony," ''China Information'' 28, 1 (March): 47–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abbreviations]] are popular across different cultures, including countries like [[Japan]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], etc., and are used according to the particular language the Internet users speak. Significantly, this same style of slang creation is also found in non-alphabetical languages&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt; as, for example, a form of "&lt;code&gt;e gao&lt;/code&gt;" or alternative political discourse.&lt;ref name=mud&gt;Meng Bingchun (2011) "From Steamed Bun to Grass Mud Horse: E Gao as alternative political discourse on the Chinese Internet." ''Global Media and Communication'' April 2011 vol. 7 no. 1 33–51&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in language often results in miscommunication, as seen in an [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] example, "&lt;code&gt;555&lt;/code&gt;", which sounds like "crying" in Chinese, and "laughing" in Thai.&lt;ref name=lovelovechina.com&gt;{{cite web |author=Crystal Tao |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |title=Why Thai Laugh When Chinese Cry? |publisher=Lovelovechina.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420091421/http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example is between the English "&lt;code&gt;haha&lt;/code&gt;" and the Spanish "&lt;code&gt;jaja&lt;/code&gt;", where both are onomatopoeic expressions of laughter, but the difference in language also meant a different consonant for the same sound to be produced. For more examples of how other languages express "laughing out loud", see also: [[LOL]]

In terms of culture, in Chinese, the numerically based onomatopoeia "&lt;code&gt;770880&lt;/code&gt;" ({{Zh|c = |s = 亲亲你抱抱你|t = 親親你抱抱你|p = qīn qīn nǐ bào bào nǐ}}), which means to 'kiss and hug you', is used.&lt;ref name=lovelovechina.com /&gt; This is comparable to "&lt;code&gt;XOXO&lt;/code&gt;", which many Internet users use. In French, "&lt;code&gt;pkoi&lt;/code&gt;" is used in the place of pourquoi, which means 'why'. This is an example of a combination of onomatopoeia and shortening of the original word for convenience when writing online.

In conclusion, every different country has their own language background and cultural differences and hence, they tend to have their own rules and motivations for their own Internet slang. However, at present, there is still a lack of studies done by researchers on some differences between the countries.

On the whole, the popular use of Internet slang has resulted in a unique online and offline community as well as a couple sub-categories of "special internet slang which is different from other slang spread on the whole internet… similar to jargon … usually decided by the sharing community".&lt;ref name=miao&gt;Wei Miao Miao (2010) "Internet slang used by online Japanese anime fans." ''3PM Journal of Digital Researching and Publishing''. Session 2 2010 pp 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led to virtual communities marked by the specific slang they use&lt;ref name=miao /&gt; and led to a more homogenized yet diverse online culture.&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt;&lt;ref name=miao /&gt;

The '''Laboratory of Analysis-Research in Quantitative Economics''' ({{lang-fr|Laboratoire dAnalyse-Recherche en Economie Quantitative}}, LAREQ) is a project created in 2012 at the initiative of Jean-Paul K. Tsasa to propose a new order in research in economics departments of the [[List of universities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|congolese universities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congoopportunities.net/les-jeunes-economistes-congolais-creent-le-lareq/ Congo Opportunities Media: "Les jeunes économistes congolais créent le LAREQ", Kinshasa, April 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
LAREQ is composed of academics and researchers from three main Congolese universities including: [[University of Kinshasa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unikin.cd/  University of Kinshasa {{lang-fr|Université de Kinshasa}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant University at Congo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upc.ac.cd/ Université Protestante au Congo {{lang-fr|Protestant University at Congo}}]&lt;/ref&gt; and Catholic University of Congo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ac.cd/ Catholic University of Congo {{lang-fr|Université Catholique du Congo]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is directed by a Resident Coordinator and a Deputy Coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congoopportunities.net/lareq-plus-dun-an-de-dynamisme-bilan-et-perspectives/ : "LAREQ, plus d’un an de dynamisme : Bilan et Perspectives", Kinshasa, September 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lareq.com/?lg=En Laboratory of Analysis-Research in Quantitative Economics (LAREQ)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208230643/http://www.lareq.com/?lg=En |date=2014-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general objective of LAREQ is to play an active role in the development and application of modern [[macroeconomic model]]ing in [[Developing country|developing countries]] in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lareq.com/statuts-lareq.ws The Statutes of LAREQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

This general goal can be broken down into two more specific objectives:
* The production and diffusion of research
* The coaching and training of students

===The production and diffusion of research===
LAREQ publishes papers, under the rubric of "One pager" for undergraduate and graduate students, and belongs to the Congolese research network in quantitative economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groupemegc.com/ Groupe MEGC (Computable general equilibrium Modeling)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, LAREQ began publish the Makroeconomica Review, a journal devoted to the development and applications of [[Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium]] [[Economic model|models]] in developing countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makroeconomica.org Makroeconomica Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202164445/http://www.makroeconomica.org/ |date=2014-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The coaching and training of students===
LAREQ organizes training, workshops and seminars and participates in the supervision of master and PhD dissertations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lareq.com/recherche_-_discussions.ws Research, Discussions and Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808184006/http://www.lareq.com/recherche_-_discussions.ws |date=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LAREQ Medal of Excellence==
The LAREQ awards annually the [[LAREQ Medal of Excellence]] for outstanding research accomplishments in economics to an African mathematician or economist under the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afriquinfos.com/archivos/2014/2/13/Meedaille%20LAREQ%202014.pdf LAREQ Medal of Excellence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045227/http://www.afriquinfos.com/archivos/2014/2/13/Meedaille%20LAREQ%202014.pdf |date=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this award is to encourage research at an early age. The winner for 2014 is the Ivorian economist engineer Kone N'Gole.

'''Mechanobiology''' is an emerging field of science at the interface of biology and engineering that focuses on how physical forces and changes in the mechanical properties of cells and tissues contribute to development, cell differentiation, [[physiology]], and disease.&lt;ref name="ICMM"/&gt;  A major challenge in the field is understanding [[mechanotransduction]]—the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to mechanical signals.
 
While medicine has typically looked for the genetic and biochemical basis of disease, advances in mechanobiology suggest that changes in cell mechanics, [[extracellular matrix]] structure, or mechanotransduction may contribute to the development of many diseases, including [[atherosclerosis]], [[fibrosis]], [[asthma]], [[osteoporosis]], [[heart failure]], and [[cancer]].  There is also a strong mechanical basis for many generalized medical disabilities, such as lower back pain, foot and postural injury, deformity, and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].

The effectiveness of many of the mechanical therapies already in clinical use shows how important physical forces can be in physiological control. For example, [[pulmonary surfactant]] promotes lung development in premature infants; modifying the tidal volumes of mechanical ventilators reduces morbidity and death in patients with acute lung injury; expandable [[stents]] physically prevent coronary artery constriction; tissue expanders increase the skin area available for reconstructive surgery;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buganza Tepole | first1 = A | last2 = Ploch | first2 = CJ | last3 = Wong | first3 = J | last4 = Gosain | first4 = AK | last5 = Kuhl | first5 = E | year = 2011 | title = Growing skin - A computational model for skin expansion in reconstructive surgery | url = | journal = J. Mech. Phys. Solids | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 2177–2190 | doi=10.1016/j.jmps.2011.05.004| pmc = 3212404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and surgical tension application devices are used for bone fracture healing, orthodontics, cosmetic breast expansion and closure of non-healing wounds. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation may also lead to development of improved medical devices, [[biomaterials]], and engineered tissues for tissue repair and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ingber | first1 = DE | year = 2003 | title = Mechanobiology and diseases of mechanotransduction | doi = 10.1080/07853890310016333 | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 564–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stretch-activated [[ion channels]], [[caveolae]], [[integrins]], [[cadherins]], growth factor receptors, myosin motors, [[cytoskeletal]] filaments, [[Nucleus (cell)|nuclei]], extracellular matrix, and numerous other molecular structures and signaling molecules have been shown to contribute to cellular mechanotransduction.  In addition, [[endogenous]] cell-generated traction forces contribute significantly to these responses by modulating tensional prestress within cells, tissues, and organs that govern their mechanical stability, as well as mechanical signal transmission from the macroscale to the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ingber | first1 = DE | year = 1997 | title = Tensegrity: the architectural basis of cellular mechanotransduction | url = | journal = Annu. Rev.

It is claimed all cells are mechanosensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kung|first1=C|title=A possible unifying principle for mechanosensation.|journal=Nature|date=4 August 2005|volume=436|issue=7051|pages=647–54|pmid=16079835|doi=10.1038/nature03896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively cells respond to perturbations to their local mechanical environment resulting in tissue-level observations. For example, at the tissue-level an artery will either thicken or thin in response to changes in blood pressure above or below the healthy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayenga|first1=HN|last2=Hu|first2=JJ|last3=Meyer|first3=CA|last4=Wilson|first4=E|last5=Hein|first5=TW|last6=Kuo|first6=L|last7=Humphrey|first7=JD|title=Differential progressive remodeling of coronary and cerebral arteries and arterioles in an aortic coarctation model of hypertension.|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|date=2012|volume=3|pages=420|pmid=23162468|doi=10.3389/fphys.2012.00420|pmc=3495262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=JD|title=Mechanisms of arterial remodeling in hypertension: coupled roles of wall shear and intramural stress.|journal=Hypertension|date=August 2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=195–200|pmid=18541735|doi=10.1161/hypertensionaha.107.103440|pmc=2753501}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, in the case of increased blood pressure ([[Hypertension]]) individual arterial cells experience greater circumferential stress (or tension). In order to alleviate this tension, they produce growth factors, which in turn stimulates proliferation. The net result is increased arterial wall thickness but the stress levels in the artery are restored to the normal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorne|first1=BC|last2=Hayenga|first2=HN|last3=Humphrey|first3=JD|last4=Peirce|first4=SM|title=Toward a multi-scale computational model of arterial adaptation in hypertension: verification of a multi-cell agent based model.|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|date=2011|volume=2|pages=20|pmid=21720536|doi=10.3389/fphys.2011.00020|pmc=3118494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using mankind as a macroscopic example, in closed chain function, ground reactive forces, a dynamic architecture and a dynamic equilibrium of forces around joint axes impact the posture to produce tissue stress.  This tissue stress can be both beneficial or harmful. Since gravity, hard, unyielding ground surfaces and other factors such as activity level, body weight and health state impact each of us differently there is no one plan of care that will work for every individual.  This results in a lifetime of adaptation of tissues via Wolff's and Davis' Laws of Bone and Soft Tissue respectively that can unless compensated and/or corrected lead to breakdown, injury and reduced quality of life on a case to case basis.

As a further example, the foot has an inherited functional shape which when used will remodel and adapt in predictable manners. Theoretically programs can be establishing for prevention, performance enhancement and quality of life upgrading in addition to the treatment of pathology and pain. These interventions, some day, will cause positive remodeling of bone and soft tissue that will extend and possibly improve the mechanobiological timeline of mankind.

{{God |isms}}

'''Monism''' attributes oneness or singleness (Greek: μόνος) to a concept e.g., existence. Various kinds of monism can be distinguished:
* ''Priority monism'' states that all existing things go back to a source that is distinct from them; e.g., in [[Neoplatonism]] everything is derived from [[Neoplatonism#The One|The One]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} In this view only one thing is ontologically basic or prior to everything else.
* ''Existence monism'' posits that, strictly speaking, there exists only a single thing, the [[Universe]], which can only be artificially and arbitrarily divided into many things.&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, G. (2014 in press): "Nietzsche's metaphysics?". In: Dries, M. &amp; Kail, P. (eds): "Nietzsche on Mind and Nature". Oxford University Press. [http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30981598/Nietzsches_Metaphysics_June_2012_Strawson_draft_-libre.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1396293668&amp;Signature=Bji6%2FSyzFKV1jkuZRJfnLSB0Qko%3D PDF of draft]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Substance monism'' asserts that a variety of existing things can be explained in terms of a single reality or substance.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|1974}} Substance monism posits that only one kind of stuff exists, although many things may be made up of this stuff, e.g., matter or mind.

==Definitions==
There are two sorts of definitions for monism:
# The wide definition: a philosophy is monistic if it postulates unity of origin of all things; all existing things return to a source that is distinct from them.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# The restricted definition: this requires not only unity of origin but also unity of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]].{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}

Although the term "monism" is derived from Western philosophy to typify positions in the [[mind–body problem]], it has also been used to typify religious traditions. In modern Hinduism, the term "absolute monism" is being used for [[Advaita Vedanta]].{{sfn|Chande|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Dasgupta|1992|p=70}}

==History==
The term "monism" was introduced in the 18th century by [[Christian von Wolff]]&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt; in his work ''Logic'' (1728),&lt;ref name="jrank"&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7886/Monism.html jrank.org, ''Monism'']&lt;/ref&gt; to designate types of philosophical thought in which the attempt was made to eliminate the dichotomy of body and mind&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and explain all phenomena by one unifying principle, or as manifestations of a single substance.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/monism.aspx#4 "monism"], Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition. Retrieved 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mind–body problem]] in philosophy examines the relationship between [[mind]] and matter, and in particular the relationship between [[consciousness]] and the brain. The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book  |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title= Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year= 1996 |pages= 702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind-body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author= Robert M.

It was later also applied to the theory of absolute identity set forth by [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]].{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} Thereafter the term was more broadly used, for any theory postulating a unifying principle.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} The opponent thesis of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] also was broadened, to include pluralism.{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} According to Urmson, as a result of this extended use, the term is "systematically ambiguous".{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}

According to Jonathan Schaffer, monism lost popularity due to the emergence of [[Analytic philosophy]] in the early twentieth century, which revolted against the neo-Hegelians. Carnap and Ayer, who were strong proponents of [[positivism]], "ridiculed the whole question as incoherent [[mysticism]]".{{sfn|Schaffer|2010}}

The mind–body problem has reemerged in social psychology and related fields, with the interest in mind–body interaction{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195}} and the rejection of Cartesian mind–body dualism in the ''[[Type physicalism|identity thesis]]'', a modern form of monism.{{sfn|Fiske|2010|p=195-196}} Monism is also still relevant to the [[philosophy of mind]],{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}} where various positions are defended.{{sfn|Mandik|2010}}{{sfn|McLaughlin|2009}}

===Types===
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|300px|A diagram with neutral monism compared to Cartesian dualism, physicalism and idealism.]]
Different types of monism include:{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}&lt;ref name=Schaffer&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, Monism: The Priority of the Whole, http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/monism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Substance theory|Substance]] monism, "the view that the apparent plurality of substances is due to different states or appearances of a single substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Attributive monism, "the view that whatever the number of substances, they are of a single ultimate kind"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Partial monism, "within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Existence monism, "the view that there is only one concrete object [[Type–token distinction|token]] (The One, "Τὸ Ἕν" or the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]])"&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, "Monism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/monism/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Priority monism, "the whole is prior to its parts" or "the world has parts, but the parts are dependent fragments of an integrated whole"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;
# Property monism, "the view that all properties are of a single type (e.g., only physical properties exist)" 
# Genus monism, "the doctrine that there is a highest category; e.g., being"&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;

Views contrasting with monism are:
* Metaphysical dualism, which asserts that there are two ultimately irreconcilable substances or realities such as Good and Evil, for example, [[Manichaeism]],{{sfn|Brugger|1972}} 
* [[Pluralism (philosophy)|Metaphysical pluralism]], which asserts three or more fundamental substances or realities.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
* [[Nihilism|Metaphysical nihilism]], negates any of the above categories (substances, properties, concrete objects, etc.).

Monism in modern [[philosophy of mind]] can be divided into three broad categories:
# [[Idealism|Idealist]], mentalistic monism, which holds that only mind or spirit exists. {{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# [[Neutral monism]], which holds that one sort of thing fundamentally exists,{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}} to which both the mental and the physical can be reduced&lt;ref name="mastin"&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_monism.html Luke Mastin (2008), "Monism"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Material monism]] (also called [[Physicalism]] and [[materialism]]), which holds that the material world is primary, and consciousness arises through the interaction with the material world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Materialism and Empirio-criticism|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|year=1909|isbn=|location=World Socialist Web Site|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::a. [[Eliminativism|Eliminative Materialism]], according to which everything is physical and mental things do not exist{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::b. [[Reductive physicalism]], according to which mental things do exist and are a kind of physical thing{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}{{refn|group=note|Such as [[Behaviourism]],&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; [[Type-identity theory]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt;}}

Certain positions do not fit easily into the above categories, such as [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[anomalous monism]], and [[reflexive monism]]. Moreover, they do not define the meaning of "real".

===Monistic philosophers===

====Pre-Socratic====
While the lack of information makes it difficult in some cases to be sure of the details, the following [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]] thought in monistic terms:{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.1-7}}
* [[Thales]]: Water.
* [[Anaximander]]: Apeiron (meaning 'the undefined infinite'). Reality is some, one thing, but we cannot know what.
* [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]: Air.
* [[Heraclitus]]: Change, symbolized by fire (in that everything is in constant flux).
* [[Parmenides]] argued that Being or Reality is an unmoving perfect sphere, unchanging, undivided.{{sfn|Abernethy|Langford|pp.8,9}}

====Post-Socrates====
* Neopythagorians such as [[Apollonius of Tyana]] centered their cosmologies on the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] or One.
* [[Stoics]] taught that there is only one substance, identified as God.{{Citation needed|reason=This is a very broad generalization over a very diverse school of thought. Someone with time should seriously consider whether it is justified.|date=January 2018}}
* Middle Platonism under such works as those by [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]] taught that the Universe emanates from the Monad or One.
* [[Neoplatonism]] is monistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent god, 'The One,' of which subsequent realities were emanations. From The One emanates the Divine Mind ([[Nous]]), the Cosmic Soul ([[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]), and the World ([[Cosmos]]).

====Modern====
* [[Giordano Bruno]]&lt;ref&gt;''De la causa, principio e Uno, London, 1584''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''De monade (De monade, numero et figura liber consequens quinque de minimo magno et mensura), Frankfurt, 1591''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Baruch de Spinoza]]

==Religion==

===Pantheism===
{{Main article|Pantheism}}
Pantheism is the belief that everything composes an all-encompassing, [[immanence|immanent]] God,&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy ed. Paul Edwards |publisher=Macmillan and Free Press |year = 1967 |location = New York|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the [[universe]] (or [[nature]]) is identical with [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford | pages = 1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheists thus do not believe in a [[personal god|personal]] or [[anthropomorphic]] god, but believe that interpretations of the term differ.

Pantheism was popularized in the modern era as both a theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th century philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=Picton&gt;{{cite book|last=Picton|first=James Allanson|title=Pantheism: its story and significance|year=1905|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; CO LTD.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1419140082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_yjarZwEhoC&amp;pg=PP8}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' was an answer to [[Descartes]]' famous dualist theory that the body and spirit are separate.&lt;ref name=Plumptre /&gt; Spinoza held that the two are the same, and this monism is a fundamental quality of his philosophy. He was described as a "God-intoxicated man," and used the word God to describe the unity of all substance.&lt;ref name=Plumptre&gt;{{cite book|last=Plumptre|first=Constance|title=General sketch of the history of pantheism, Volume 2|year=1879|publisher=Samuel Deacon and Co|location=London|isbn=9780766155022|pages=3–5, 8, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term pantheism was not coined until after his death, Spinoza is regarded as its most celebrated advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoham|first=Schlomo Giora|title=To Test the Limits of Our Endurance|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=1443820687|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Huw Owen|H. P. Owen]] claimed that
{{quote|Pantheists are "monists" ... they believe that there is only one Being, and that all other forms of reality are either modes (or appearances) of it or identical with it.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Owen, 1971, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pantheism is closely related to monism, as pantheists too believe all of reality is one substance, called Universe, God or Nature. [[Panentheism]], a slightly different concept (explained below), however is dualistic.&lt;ref&gt;Crosby, Donald A. (2008). Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil. New York: State University of New York Press. pp. 124. {{ISBN|0-7914-7519-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous pantheists are the [[Stoics]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

===Panentheism===
{{Main article|Panentheism}}
Panentheism (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πᾶν}} (pân) "all"; {{lang|grc|ἐν}} (en) "in"; and {{lang|grc|θεός}} (theós) "God"; "all-in-God") is a belief system that [[postulate|posits]] that the divine (be it a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[God]], [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[gods]], or an eternal cosmic animating force) interpenetrates every part of nature, but is not one with nature. Panentheism differentiates itself from [[pantheism]], which holds that the divine is synonymous with the universe.&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sCY4sAjTGIYC&amp;pg=PA21|title= The Encyclopedia of Christianity pg. 21|publisher= Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|author1=Erwin Fahlbusch |author2=Geoffrey William Bromiley |author3=David B. Barrett |year = 1999|isbn = 0-8028-2416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In panentheism, there are two types of substance, "pan" the [[universe]] and God. The universe and the divine are not [[ontology|ontologically]] equivalent. God is viewed as the eternal animating force within the universe. In some forms of panentheism, the [[cosmos]] exists within God, who in turn "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]]", "pervades" or is "in" the cosmos.

While pantheism asserts that 'All is God', panentheism claims that God animates all of the universe, and also transcends the universe. In addition, some forms indicate that the universe is contained within God,&lt;ref name="Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, David B. Barrett 1999"/&gt;  like in the concept of [[Tzimtzum]]. Much [[Hindu thought]] is highly characterized by panentheism and pantheism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441533/pantheism/38168/Pantheism-and-panentheism-in-non-Western-cultures] Britannica - Pantheism and Panentheism in non-Western cultures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Robert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_UfRgCZThWYC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=shakti+panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jz7nT6-kF8P3rQejn_GDCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shakti%20panentheism&amp;f=false Religions for Today] Stanley Thomes (Publishers) Ltd. P. VIII. {{ISBN|0-7487-0586-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hasidic Judaism]] merges the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical transcendent Divine Panentheism, through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of [[Kabbalah]], with the populist emphasis on the panentheistic [[Divine immanence]] in everything and deeds of kindness.

[[Paul Tillich]] has argued for such a concept within Christian theology, as has [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] biblical scholar [[Marcus Borg]] and [[Christian mysticism|mystical]] theologian [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], an Episcopal priest.{{refn|group=note|See [[Creation Spirituality]]}}

===Pandeism===
{{Main article|Pandeism}}
Pandeism or pan-deism (from {{lang-grc|πᾶν|pan|[[The All|all]]}} and {{lang-la|[[deus]]}} meaning "[[god]]" in the sense of [[deism]]), is a term describing beliefs coherently incorporating or mixing [[logic]]ally reconcilable elements of pantheism (that "God", or a metaphysically equivalent [[creator deity]], is identical to [[Nature]]) and [[Deism#History of classical deism|classical deism]] (that the creator-god who designed the universe no longer exists in a status where it can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason). It is therefore most particularly the belief that the creator of the universe actually became the universe, and so ceased to exist as a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The History of Science: A Beginner's Guide p. 90 |author = Sean F. Johnston |year = 2009 |ISBN = 1-85168-681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Ashman, ''[[BBC News]]'', "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A25172309 Metaphysical Isms]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this [[synergy]] pandeism claims to answer primary objections to deism (why would God create and then not interact with the universe?) and to pantheism (how did the universe originate and what is its purpose?).

===Brahmanic faiths===

====Characteristics====
The central problem in Asian (religious) philosophy is not the body-mind problem, but the search for an unchanging Real or Absolute beyond the world of appearances and changing phenomena,{{sfn|Nakamura|1991}} and the search for liberation from [[dukkha]] and the liberation from the [[Reincarnation|cycle of rebirth]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997}} In Hinduism, [[Substance theory|substance-ontology]] prevails, seeing [[Brahman]] as the unchanging real beyond the world of [[Maya (illusion)|appearances]].{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} In Buddhism [[process ontology]] is prevalent,{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=50}} seeing reality as [[sunyata|empty]] of an unchanging essence.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}

Characteristic for various Asian religions is the discernment of levels of truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}} an emphasis on [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|intuitive-experiential understanding]] of the Absolute{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}{{sfn|Hawley|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|renard|2010|p=59}} such as [[jnana]], [[bodhi]]  and [[kensho]], and an emphasis on the integration of these levels of truth and its understanding.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=31}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007}}

====Hinduism====

=====Vedanta=====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|''[[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples'', by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904)|right|thumb|x216px]]
{{Main article|Vedanta}}
Vedanta is the inquiry into and systematisation of the Vedas and Upanishads, to harmonise the various and contrasting ideas that can be found in those texts. Within Vedanta, different schools exist:&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1995), Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425824}}, pages 137-143&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Advaita Vedanta]], absolute monism, of which [[Adi Shankara]] is the best-known representative;{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=239}}
* [[Vishishtadvaita]], qualified monism, is from the school of [[Ramanuja]];&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, page xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shuddhadvaita]], in-essence monism, is the school of [[Vallabha]]; 
* [[Dvaitadvaita]], differential monism, is a school founded by [[Nimbarka]]; 
* [[Dvaita]], dualism, is a school founded by [[Madhvacharya]] is probably the only Vedantic System that is opposed to all types of monism. It believes that God is eternally different from souls and matter in both form and essence.
* [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]], a school of [[Vedanta]] representing the philosophy of ''inconceivable one-ness and difference''.

=====Advaita Vedanta=====
{{main article|Advaita Vedanta}}
Monism is most clearly identified in [[Advaita Vedanta]],{{sfn|Momen|2009|p=191}} though Renard points out that this may be a western interpretation, bypassing the intuitive understanding of a nondual reality.{{sfn|renard|2010}}

In Advaita Vedanta, [[Brahman]] is the eternal, unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all matter, energy, time, space, being, and everything beyond in this Universe. The nature of Brahman is described as transpersonal, personal and impersonal by different philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="Brodd, Jefferey 2003"&gt;Brodd, Jefferey (2003). World Religions. Winona, MN: Saint Mary's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88489-725-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta gives an elaborate path to attain moksha. It [[logical consequence|entails]] more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature. Practice, especially Jnana Yoga, is needed to "destroy one’s tendencies [[Vāsanā|(vAasanA-s)]]" before real insight can be attained.&lt;ref name="Swartz"&gt;[http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/trad_neo/neo_vedanta_swartz.htm James Swartz, ''What is Neo-Advaita?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}} Usually two levels are being mentioned,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} but Shankara uses [[Advaita vedanta#Criterion of Sublation|sublation]] as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}&lt;ref name=Discrimination&gt;[http://www.advaita-vision.org/discrimination/ advaita-vision.org, ''Discrimination'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IAST|Pāramārthika}} (paramartha, absolute), the absolute level, "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved".&lt;ref name=Discrimination /&gt; This experience can't be sublated by any other experience.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}
* {{IAST|Vyāvahārika}} (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} (empirical or pragmatical), "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake".&lt;ref name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true.
* {{IAST|Prāthibhāsika}} (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), "reality based on imagination alone".&lt;ref  name=Discrimination /&gt; It is the level in which appearances are actually false, like the illusion of a snake over a rope, or a dream.

=====Vaishnava=====
{{Main article|Vaishnavism}}
All [[Vaishnava]] schools are [[panentheistic]] and view the universe as part of [[Krishna]] or [[Narayana]], but see a plurality of souls and substances within [[Brahman]]. Monistic theism, which includes the concept of a personal god as a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], [[omnipotent]] [[Supreme Being]] who is both [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], is prevalent within many other schools of Hinduism as well.

=====Tantra=====
{{Main article|Tantra}}
[[Tantra]] sees the Divine as both immanent and transcendent. The Divine can be found in the concrete world. Practices are aimed at transforming the passions, instead of transcending them.

=====Modern Hinduism=====
{{Main article|Hindu reform movements}}
The colonisation of India by the British had a major impact on Hindu society.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} In response, leading Hindu intellectuals started to study western culture and philosophy, integrating several western notions into Hinduism.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} This modernised Hinduism, at its turn, has gained popularity in the west.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

A major role was played in the 19th century by [[Swami Vivekananda]] in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called [[Neo-Vedanta]].{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}} In Advaita, Shankara suggests meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of ''Brahman'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'',{{sfn|Comans|1993}} not the highest goal itself:
{{quote|[Y]oga is a meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness. This approach is different from the classical Yoga of complete thought suppression.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}}}

Vivekananda, according to [[Gavin Flood]], was "a figure of great importance in the development of a modern Hindu self-understanding and in formulating the West's view of Hinduism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=257}} Central to his philosophy is the idea that the divine exists in all beings, that all human beings can achieve union with this "innate divinity",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} and that seeing this divine as the essence of others will further love and social harmony.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Vivekananda, there is an essential unity to Hinduism, which underlies the diversity of its many forms.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=258}} According to Flood, Vivekananda's view of Hinduism is the most common among Hindus today.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=259}} This monism, according to Flood, is at the foundation of earlier Upanishads, to theosophy in the later Vedanta tradition and in modern Neo-Hinduism.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=85}}

====Buddhism====
{{Main article|Buddhism}}
According to the [[Pāli Canon]], both pluralism (''nānatta'') and monism (''ēkatta'') are speculative [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. A [[Theravada]] commentary notes that the former is similar to or associated with [[nihilism]] (''ucchēdavāda''), and the latter is similar to or associated with eternalism (''[[sassatavada]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kalupahana]], ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, page 88. The passage is SN 2.77.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[middle way]].

In the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], the ultimate nature of the world is described as ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' or "emptiness", which is inseparable from sensorial objects or anything else. That appears to be a monist position, but the Madhyamaka views - including variations like ''[[rangtong]]'' and ''[[shentong]]'' - will refrain from asserting any ultimately existent entity. They instead deconstruct any detailed or conceptual assertions about ultimate existence as resulting in absurd consequences. The [[Yogacara]] view, a minority school now only found among the Mahayana, also rejects monism.

=====Levels of truth=====

Within Buddhism, a rich variety of philosophical{{sfn|Williams|1994}} and pedagogical models{{sfn|Buswell|1994}} can be found. Various schools of Buddhism discern levels of truth:
* The [[Two truths doctrine]] of the [[Madhyamaka]]
* The [[Three natures|Three Natures]] of the [[Yogacara]]
* [[Essence-Function]], or [[Chinese Chán#Absolute-relative|Absolute-relative]] in Chinese and Korean Buddhism
* The [[Trikaya]]-formule, consisting of 
** The ''[[Dharmakāya]]'' or ''Truth body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries;
** The ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is a body of bliss or clear light manifestation;
** The ''Nirmāṇakāya'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space.&lt;ref name="Welwood, John 2007"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). [http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''], accessed January 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]] and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: "form is emptiness, emptiness is form", as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} In Chinese Buddhism this was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as Nagarjuna does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}
This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]],{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]], and [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Hakuin's Four ways of knowing]].{{sfn|Low|2006}}

==== Sikhism ====
{{Main|God in Sikhism}}
Sikhism complies with the concept of Priority&amp;nbsp;Monism. Sikh philosophy advocates that all that our senses comprehend is an illusion; God is the sole reality.

===Abrahamic faiths===

====Judaism====
{{Main article|Judaism}}
Jewish thought considers God as separate from all physical, created things ([[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]) and as existing outside of time (eternal).{{refn|group=note|For a discussion of the resultant [[paradox]], see ''[[Tzimtzum]]''.}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition|Negative theology]].}}

According to [[Hasidic philosophy|Chasidic Thought]] (particularly as propounded by the 18th century, early 19th century founder of [[Chabad]], [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]]), God is held to be [[Immanence|immanent]] within [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] for two interrelated reasons:
# A very strong Jewish belief is that "[t]he Divine life-force which brings [the universe] into existence must constantly be present ... were this life-force to forsake [the universe] for even one brief moment, it would revert to a state of utter nothingness, as before the creation ..."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive2.asp?AID=7988&lt;/ref&gt;
# Simultaneously, Judaism holds as [[axiom]]atic that [[Jewish principle of faith#God is One|God is an absolute unity]], and that he is [[Divine simplicity#In Jewish thought|Perfectly Simple]]—thus, if his sustaining power is within nature, then his essence is also within nature.

The [[Vilna Gaon]] was very much against this philosophy, for he felt that it would lead to pantheism and [[heresy]]. According to some this is the main reason for the Gaon's ban on Chasidism.

According to [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''Foundations of the Law'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; God is an incorporeal being that caused all other existence.  In fact, God is defined as the necessary existent that caused all other existence. According to Maimonides, to admit corporeality to God is tantamount to admitting complexity to God, which is a contradiction to God as the First Cause and constitutes heresy.  While Hasidic mystics considered the existence of the physical world a contradiction to God's simpleness, Maimonides saw no contradiction.{{refn|group=note|See the "Guide for the Perplexed", especially chapter I:50.}}

====Christianity====
{{See also|Christian anthropology}}

=====Creator–creature distinction=====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
[[Christianity]] strongly maintains the creator–creature distinction as fundamental. Christians maintain that God created the universe ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and not from his own substance, so that the creator is not to be confused with creation, but rather [[transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it (metaphysical dualism) (cf. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]). Although, there is growing movement to have a "Christian Panentheism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53880197|title=In whom we live and move and have our being : panentheistic reflections on God's presence in a scientific world|last=1956-|first=Clayton, Philip,|last2=Robert)|first2=Peacocke, A. R. (Arthur|date=2004|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Pub|isbn=0802809782|oclc=53880197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more immanent concepts and theologies are to be defined together with God's omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience, due to God's desire for intimate contact with his own creation (cf. Acts 17:27). Another use of the term "monism" is in [[Christian anthropology]] to refer to the innate nature of humankind as being [[holistic]], as usually opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] and [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] views.

=====Rejection of radical dualism=====
In ''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|On Free Choice of the Will]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] argued, in the context of [[the problem of evil]], that evil is not the opposite of good, but rather merely the absence of good, something that does not have existence in itself. Likewise, [[C. S. Lewis]] described evil as a "parasite" in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', as he viewed evil as something that cannot exist without good to provide it with existence. Lewis went on to argue against dualism from the basis of [[moral absolutism]], and rejected the dualistic notion that God and [[Satan]] are  opposites, arguing instead that God has no equal, hence no opposite. Lewis rather viewed Satan as the opposite of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the archangel]]. Due to this, Lewis instead argued for a more limited type of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C.S, "God and Evil" in "God in the Dock: Essays in Theology and Ethics", ed. W. Hooper (Grand Rapids, Mich, Eerdsmans, 1970), p. 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; Other theologians, such as [[Greg Boyd (theologian)|Greg Boyd]], have argued in more depth that the Biblical authors held a "limited dualism", meaning that God and Satan do engage in real battle, but only due to free will given by God, for the duration God allows.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Gregory. A, "God at War" (Downers Grove, IL, InterVarsity Press, 1971) p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah 45:5-7
5 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else.
7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

=====Theosis=====
In [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], while human beings are not ontologically identical with the Creator, they are nonetheless capable with uniting with his Divine Nature via [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]], and especially, through the devout reception of the [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is a supernatural union, over and above that natural union, of which [[St. John of the Cross]] says, "it must be known that God dwells and is present substantially in every soul, even in that of the greatest sinner in the world, and this union is natural." [[Julian of Norwich]], while maintaining the orthodox duality of Creator and creature, nonetheless speaks of God as "the true Father and true Mother" of all natures; thus, he indwells them substantially and thus preserves them from annihilation, as without this sustaining indwelling everything would cease to exist.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] creation is united to God by grace and not by nature. This is what is known as the [[Essence-Energies distinction]], while in union with God, Orthodox Christians believe, the human person retains its individuality and is not swallowed up by the Monad.

=====Christian Monism=====
Some Christian theologians are avowed monists, such as [[Paul Tillich]]. Since God is he "in whom we live and move and have our being" ([[Book of Acts]] 17.28), it follows that everything that has being partakes in God.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Islam====
{{See also|Tawhid}}

=====Quran=====
[[Vincent Cornell]] argues that the [[Quran]] provides a monist image of God by describing reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things. But most argue that Semitic religious scriptures, especially the Quran, see creation and God as two separate existences. It explains that everything has been created by God and is under his control, but at the same time distinguishes creation as being dependent on the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yusuf |first1=Hamza |title=The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi |date=2009 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Creed-Imam-al-Tahawi-Hamza-Yusuf/dp/097028439X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
{{See also|Sufism}}
Sufi mystics advocate monism. One of the most notable being the 13th-century Persian poet [[Rumi]] (1207–73) in his didactic poem ''[[Masnavi]]'' espoused monism.&lt;ref name="nicholson"&gt;[http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html Reynold Nicholson ''Rumi''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017141204/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/rumi/intro_nicholson.html |date=2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rumi.org.uk/sufism/persian_sufism.htm Cyprian Rice (1964) ''The Persian Sufism'' George Allen, London]&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi says in the [[Masnavi]],
{{quote|In the shop for Unity (wahdat); anything that you see there except the One is an idol.&lt;ref name="nicholson" /&gt;}}

The most influential of the [[Islam|Islamic]] monists was the Sufi philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240). He developed the concept of 'unity of being' (Arabic: ''[[Sufi metaphysics|waḥdat al-wujūd]]''), a pantheistic monoist philosophy. Born in [[al-Andalus]], he made an enormous impact on the Muslim world, where he was crowned "the great Master". In the centuries following his death, his ideas became increasingly controversial.

===Bahá'í===
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
Although the [[Bahá'í teachings]] have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, there exist a number of foundational texts that have been described as mystical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year = 1992|contribution = The Bahá'í Faith|title = Britannica Book of the Year
|isbn = 0-85229-486-7|editor1=Daphne Daume |editor2=Louise Watson |publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica|location = Chicago | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include statements of a monist nature (e.g., ''[[The Seven Valleys]]'' and the ''[[Hidden Words]]''). The differences between dualist and monist views are reconciled by the teaching that these opposing viewpoints are caused by differences in the observers themselves, not in that which is observed. This is not a 'higher truth/lower truth' position. God is unknowable. For man it is impossible to acquire any direct knowledge of God or the Absolute, because any knowledge that one has, is relative.&lt;ref name="momen1988"&gt;{{cite book | last =Momen | first = Moojan |year = 1988 | title = Studies in the Bábí and Bahá’í Religions vol. 5, chapter: A Basis For Bahá’í Metaphysics | publisher = Kalimat Press | pages = 185–217 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_relativism_bahai_metaphysics | isbn = 0-933770-72-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-dualism===
{{Main article|Nondualism}}
According to nondualism, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of "the Real".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}} Nondualism, a modern reinterpretation of these religions, prefers the term "nondualism", instead of monism, because this understanding is "nonconceptual", "not graspable in an idea".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|In Dutch: "Niet in een denkbeeld te vatten".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Renard, [[Alan Watts]] has explained the difference between "non-dualism" and "monism" in ''The Supreme Identity'', Faber and Faber 1950, p.69 and 95; ''The Way of Zen'', Pelican-edition 1976, p.59-60.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59, p.285 note 17}} According to Renard, Alan Watts has been one of the main contributors to thepopularisation of the notion of "nondualism".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=59}}}}

To these nondual traditions belong [[Hinduism]] (including [[Vedanta]], some forms of [[Yoga]], and certain schools of [[Shaivism]]), [[Taoism]], [[Pantheism]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and similar systems of thought.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the name "Muhammad Shafi" ({{lang|ur|محمد شفيع}}) by his father's ''shaikh'', [[Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi]], though he was originally named "Muhammad Mubin" ({{lang|ur|محمد مبین}}) by his grandfather, Khalifah Tahsin Ali.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi grew up in a religious environment. As a child he played in the courtyard of Darul Uloom Deoband and sat in the company of his father, who was a teacher at the school.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

==Education==
At about the age of five, Shafi began ''nazirah'' (reading of the [[Qur'an]]) with Hafiz Muhammad Azim at the Darul Uloom.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After reading the Qur'an, he did ''[[hifz]]'' (memorization of the Qur'an) with Hafiz Abdul Azim and Hafiz Namdar Khan.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi&gt;

{{cite book|title=معارف القرآن / Ma‘āriful-Qur’ān|volume=Volume 1|pages=59–71|chapter=تمہید / Tamhīd|trans-chapter=Introduction|author=Muhammad Shafi Deobandi|language=Urdu|publisher=Idāratul-Ma‘ārif|location=Karachi|date=April 2008|origyear=Cited chapter written October 1972}}

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1325 AH (1907/1908) he commenced the study of Urdu, Persian, mathematics and other subjects at Darul Uloom Deoband, which he completed within the next five years under the supervision of his father.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; He studied arithmetic and Euclid from his uncle Munshi Manzur Ahmad and ''[[tajwid]]'' from Qari Muhammad Yusuf Miruthi. Along with teaching Shafi the Persian books, Maulana Yasin also instructed him in the elementary [[Arabic]] books of ''sarf'' (morphology), ''nahw'' (grammar), and ''[[fiqh]]'' (jurisprudence), up to ''Fusul-i Akbari'', ''Hidayat an-Nahw'', and ''Munyat al-Musalli''.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

In 1330 AH (1912)&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; or 1331 AH (1913)&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; Shafi was formally enrolled in the upper level Arabic classes of Darul Uloom Deoband. He did Daurah Hadith in 1335 AH (1916/1917) under the supervision of Anwar Shah Kashmiri, and completed his education in 1336 AH (1917/1918).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; The teachers under whom Shafi formally studied included:&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

*[[Allamah Anwar Shah Kashmiri]]
*[[Allamah Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]]
*Maulana Mufti Azizur Rahman Usmani
*Maulana Sayyid Miyan Asghar Husain Deobandi
*Maulana Muhammad Izaz Ali Amrohi
*Maulana Muhammad Rasul Khan
*Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim Balliyawi
*Maulana Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi
*Maulana Muhammad Ahmad ibn [[Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi]]
 
Foremost among his teachers was Anwar Shah Kashmiri, who was the school's Sadr Mudarris (head teacher). Some of the books Shafi studied with him were ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'', ''[[Jami' at-Tirmidhi]]'' (with the exception of a small part), [[at-Tirmidhi]]'s ''[[Shama'il Muhammadiyah|Shama'il]]'' and '''Ilal'', ''al-Falsafah al-'Arabiyah'' on modern philosophy, and ''Sharh an-Nafisi'' on medicine (''tibb''). Shafi was among Kashmiri's closest students, and Kashmiri would later select Shafi for assistance in refuting the [[Ahmadiyya Movement]]. Shafi studied ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' and half of ''[[al-Hidayah (book)|Hidayah]]'' with Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, whom he would later accompany in the movement to create Pakistan. With Maulana Asghar Husain he studied the hadith collections ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'', ''[[Sunan an-Nasa'i]]'', and the remainder of ''Jami' at-Tirmidhi''. With Azizur Rahman, head of the Darul Uloom's [[Fatwa]] Department, Shafi studied the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]] of [[Imam Malik]] in the transmission of [[Yahya al-Laithi|Yahya ibn Yahya]] and the transmission of [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|ash-Shaybani]], [[at-Tahawi]]'s ''Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar'', ''[[Tafsir al-Jalalayn]]'', ''[[Mishkat al-Masabih]]'', [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]]'s ''Sharh Nukhbat al-Fikar'', and ''Hisn-i Hasin''. He studied ''Sunan Ibn Majah'' with Ghulam Rasul Hazarwi. With Izaz Ali he studied all the books of literature, [[Maibazi]]'s ''Sharh Hidayat al-Hikmah'', [[at-Taftazani]]'s ''Sharh al-'Aqa'id al-Nasafiyah'', Ubayd Allah al-Mahbubi's ''Sharh al-Wiqayah'', and some other treatises. With Maulana Muhammad Ibrahim he studied ''[[Mulla Sadra|Sadra]]'' and ''[[Shams al-Bazighah]]''.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

After Daurah a few books still remained, including ''Qazi'', ''Mir Zahid'', and ''Umur-i 'Ammah''—these were completed in 1336 AH (1917/1918).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; In that year Shafi was also appointed to teach some lessons.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

==Teaching career==
Maulana Shafi was formally appointed as a teacher in Darul Uloom Deoband in 1337 AH (1918/1919).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt; He began teaching the elementary level books of the curriculum and eventually reached the level of Daurah Hadith.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; The first book of Daurah level that he was given was ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik]]'', and he later taught other books. In 1354 AH (1935/1936) he was entrusted with teaching ''[[Sunan Abu Dawud]]'' for some time in place of Maulana Asghar Husain. On Husain's request he was given this lecture permanently, and he taught it until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in 1362 AH (1943). Shafi was regarded as an exceptional lecturer on many subjects, but two of his lessons were most famous—one was ''Sunan Abu Dawud'', and the other was ''Maqamat al-Hariri'' in Arabic literature.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt; After leaving Darul Uloom Deoband, he taught ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' for three months at [[Jamiah Islamiyah Dabhel]], filling in for [[Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

Shafi established [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in Shawwal 1370 AH (1951). There he taught ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' for several years, as well as ''Muwatta Malik'' and ''[[Shama'il at-Tirmidhi]]''. Whenever due to health or other responsibilities he was unable to teach the whole of ''Bukhari'', then those years he would teach until the Book of Wudu, and other teachers would cover the remainder. In the last four years of his life, he was bedridden and thus unable to teach regularly. However, on the insistence of students and teachers, every year he taught the first lesson of ''Sahih al-Bukhari'' and the last lessons of the [[Sihah Sittah]].&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Issuance of fatawa==
From the beginning of his teaching career Maulana Shafi frequently assisted Mufti Azizur Rahman, then head of the school's [[fatwa]] department.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt; Azizur Rahman resigned from the Darul Uloom in 1344 AH (1925/1926). Others occupied the post of Sadr Mufti (Chief Mufti) until the Majlis-e-Shura of Darul Uloom Deoband appointed Shafi to the post on 28 Rabi al-Awwal 1350 AH (c. 13 August 1931).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Mufti Muhammad Shafi writes in the introduction to ''Ma'ariful Qur'an'' that he occupied the post from 1349 AH.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;|group="note"}} In additions to undertaking the duties of fatwa-writing, Shafi also continued to teach some books of hadith and tafsir.&lt;ref name=shafi/&gt;

In Rajab 1351 (November 1932) Shafi published a tract entitled ''Nihayat al-arab fi ghayat an-nasab'' on [[Caste system among Muslims#In South Asia|caste]]. The weavers of the Deoband area (who were regarded as a lower caste) revolted against the fatwa, and from early 1353 AH (1934/1935) to late 1354 AH (1935/1936) rallies were held and threats were made against Shafi, in response to which a group of teachers took to acting as his bodyguards. Several scholars wrote or spoke in defense of the fatwa, including Shafi's shaikh Ashraf Ali Thanawi, Sayyid Asghar Husain, and Husain Ahmad Madani. Due to the controversy, Shafi asked to be transferred to the teaching department, a request that was eventually granted by the Majlis-e-Shura in Sha'ban 1354 AH (c. November 1935).&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Arthur F.|title=Sayyids and Sharifs in Muslim Societies: The Living Links to the Prophet|editor-last=Morimoto|editor-first=Kazuo|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203123157|page=239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VnmEMh0MF4C&amp;pg=PA239|chapter=Trends of ashrāfization in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafi remained in the teaching department over the next few years, during which two other ulama held the post of Sadr Mufti. On 25 Safar 1359 AH (c. 4 April 1940), Shafi was appointed to the office a second time.&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; He held the post until he left Darul Uloom Deoband in Rabi al-Awwal 1362 AH (March 1943).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Rizvi writes that Shafi occupied the post until 1361 AH (1942).&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt;|group="note"}}

Estimates of the number of fatwas that he issued while at Darul Uloom Deoband range from 26,000&lt;ref name=rizvi/&gt; to over 40,000. Some of Muhammad Shafi's fatwas have been published in eight large volumes titled ''Imdad al-Muftin'', while the majority remain unpublished.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Sufism==
From an early age, Shafi frequently attended the gatherings of [[Maulana Mahmud Hasan]]. Then when Mahmud Hasan was [[Malta exiles|imprisoned in Malta]], Shafi consulted [[Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanawi]]. Mahmud Hasan returned to Deoband on 20 Ramadan 1338 AH (June 1920). In 1339 AH (1920) Shafi gave ''bay'at'' (allegiance) at his hand. However, Mahmud Hasan died a few months later on 18 Rabi al-awwal AH (November 1920). Shafi returned to Thanawi after Mahmud Hasan's death. In Rabi ath-thani 1349 AH (1930) he received ''ijazat-i bay'at'' (permission to take disciples) and ''khilafah'' (spiritual successorship).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rafi/&gt;

==Pakistan Movement==
At the time Muhammad Shafi was teaching at Darul Uloom Deoband, Indians were struggling for independence from the British. When the [[All-India Muslim League]] was formed to campaign for the creation of a separate Muslim state, [[Ashraf Ali Thanvi]] instructed all ''[[ulama]]'' and Muslims in general to support this campaign. Muhammad Shafi, with other scholars including Zafar Ahmad Usmani, joined the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]], a council of Islamic scholars formed by [[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani]] to campaign for the creation of Pakistan. In 1363 AH (1944) Muhammad Shafi resigned from teaching and issuing fatwas at Darul Uloom Deoband in order to devote his time to the movement for the creation of Pakistan. He toured India, gave speeches, and issued ''fatwas'' for this purpose.&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Migration to Pakistan==
After [[Pakistan Movement|independence]], in 1367 AH (1948), Muhammad Shafi left his hometown of Deoband and immigrated to Pakistan. He founded [[Darul Uloom Karachi]] in 1370 AH (1950/1951). Muhammad Shafi died on 10 Shawwal 1396 (6 October 1976).&lt;ref name=taqi/&gt;

==Works==
He wrote around one hundred books [[Exegesis#Islam|explaining]] the [[Quran]] and interpreting [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. His best-known and most widely translated work is the ''[[Ma'ariful Qur'an]]'' ("The Wisdom of the Quran"), which he finished (in Urdu) four years before his death.&lt;ref name="ibid"&gt;''Ma'ariful Qur'an: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Holy Qur'an'' (Karachi: Mataba-e-Darul-Ulomm Karachi, 2008 ed.), Volume 1. p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; This work, a commentary on the entire Quran, began as a series of weekly lectures on [[Radio Pakistan]] that ran for ten years.&lt;ref name="ibid" /&gt;

[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A [[coal mining|coal mine]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]. [[Coal]], produced over millions of years, is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale.]]

A '''non-renewable resource''' (also called a '''finite resource''') is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames. An example is carbon-based, organically-derived fuel. The original organic material, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. [[Earth]] [[mineral]]s and [[metal]] [[ore]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s ([[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]]) and [[groundwater]] in certain [[aquifer]]s are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual [[Chemical element|element]]s are almost always conserved.

On the other hand, resources such as [[timber]] (when [[Sustainable forest management|harvested sustainably]]) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered [[renewable resource]]s, largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans.

== Earth minerals and metal ores ==
{{Main article|Mineral|Ore}}
{{Further information|Mining}}

[[Earth]] minerals and [[metal]] ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by [[Ore genesis|natural geological processes]] (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through [[plate tectonics]], [[tectonic subsidence]] and [[crustal recycling]].

The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain [[rare earth mineral]]s and [[rare earth element|elements]] that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in [[manufacturing]], particularly for the [[electronics industry]].

Most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels, because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the Earth's near-surface environment, than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish, die, and are quickly buried.

== Fossil fuels ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}
{{Further information|Oil depletion}}

Natural resources such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]] take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see [[renewable energy]].

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/methane-hydrates/ |title=Methane hydrates |website=Worldoceanreview.com |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable [[fossil fuels]].  Since the dawn of [[internal combustion engine]] technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand.  As a result, conventional [[infrastructure]] and [[transport]] systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.  The continual use of fossil fuels at the current rate is believed to increase [[global warming]] and cause more severe [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council|title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change |year=2010|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-14588-0|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Nuclear fuel}}
{{Further information|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Peak uranium}}

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED) an organization set up by but independent from the [[United Nations]] classified fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] nuclear fuel than they consume -i.e. [[breeder reactor]]s, and when it is developed, [[fusion power]], among conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|work=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ("breeders") and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but that [[breeder reactor]] nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, before explaining that radioactive waste from used [[spent fuel]] rods remains radioactive, and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/classroom/curricula/nonrenew-resources.cfm|title=Key Characteristics of Nonrenewable Resources|author=American Petroleum Institute|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/geothermal.html Geothermal Energy Production Waste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[nuclear technology]] relying on [[Nuclear fission|fission]] requires [[Naturally occurring radioactive material]] as fuel. [[Uranium]], the most common fission fuel, and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and [[uranium mining|mined]] in 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with [[Fissile|fissionable]] [[uranium-235]] which generates heat that is ultimately used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/uran.html|title=What is uranium? How does it work?|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in [[pilot program]]s and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater — Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of ''Marine Science &amp; Engineering'' suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be [[economy of scale|economically competitive if implemented on a large scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/2/1/81 Development of a Kelp-Type Structure Module in a Coastal Ocean Model to Assess the Hydrodynamic Impact of Seawater Uranium Extraction Technology.

Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]]. [http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=27665 Another drop in nuclear generation] ''World Nuclear News'', 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous [[radioactive contamination]] as it relies upon unstable elements.  In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of [[low and intermediate level waste]] (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of [[high level waste]] (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |title=Factsheets &amp; FAQs |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125062648/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is [[Acute radiation syndrome|highly hazardous]] to people and wildlife.   The United Nations ([[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]]) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 [[millisievert]] (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from [[cosmic ray]]s; all exposures [[Background radiation|vary by location]].&lt;ref name = UNSCEAR&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.

[[Natural resource]]s, known as renewable resources, are replaced by [[Natural phenomenon|natural processes and forces]] persistent in the [[natural environment]]. There are [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] and reoccurring renewables, and [[Recycling|recyclable material]]s, which are utilized during a [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]] across a certain amount of time, and can be harnessed for any number of cycles.

The production of goods and services by [[manufacturing]] [[Product (business)|product]]s in [[economic system]]s creates many [[List of waste types|types of waste]] during production and after the [[consumer]] has made use of it. The material is then either [[Incineration|incinerated]], buried in a [[landfill]] or [[recycled]] for reuse.  Recycling turns materials of value that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources again.

The natural environment, with [[soil]], [[water]], [[forest]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are all renewable resources, as long as they are adequately [[Conservation biology|monitored, protected and conserved]]. [[Sustainable agriculture]] is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal [[ecosystem]]s over the long term. The [[overfishing]] of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem, endanger [[endangered species|species]] and possibly even determine whether or not a [[fishery]] is sustainable for use by humans. An unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing In Small-Scale Marine and Inland Capture Fisharies|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y3274E/y3274e09.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewable energy from the [[sun]], [[wind]], [[surface wave|wave]], [[biomass]] and [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] energies are based on renewable resources. Renewable resources such as the movement of [[water]] ([[hydropower]], [[tidal power]] and [[wave power]]), [[wind power|wind]] and [[radiant energy]] from geothermal heat (used for [[geothermal power]]) and solar energy (used for [[Solar energy|solar power]]) are practically infinite and cannot be depleted, unlike their non-renewable counterparts, which are likely to run out if not used sparingly.

The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over, wind power could power all of humanity's needs alone. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs, but there is enough out there to power humanity's needs 4,000 times over, the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eisenberg and D. Nocera, "Preface: Overview of the Forum on Solar and Renewable Energy," Inorg. Chem. 44, 6799 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. V. Kamat, "Meeting the Clean Energy Demand: Nanostructure Architectures for Solar Energy Conversion," J. Phys. Chem. C 111, 2834 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy and [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] are no longer niche [[Economic sector|sector]]s that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors, both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production, as non-renewable resources decline. This is reinforced by [[climate change]] concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, [[2000s energy crisis|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]] and increasing government support for renewable energy. These factors are [[renewable energy commercialization|commercializing renewable energy]], enlarging the market and growing demand, the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energy-base.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEFI-Global-Trends-in-Sustainable-Energy-Investment-2007.pdf |title=Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries (PDF), p. 3. |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic models==
In economics, a non-renewable resource is defined as [[Good (economics)|goods]], where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Cremer and Salehi-Isfahani 1991:18&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]] in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources, where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by [[Hotelling's rule]], which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable [[resource management]] by [[Harold Hotelling]]. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a [[resource depletion|depletion]] of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "[[Hotelling rent]]" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the [[rate of interest]], reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources.
The [[Hartwick's rule]] provides an important result about the [[sustainability]] of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source.

'''Peace and conflict studies''' is a [[social science]] field that identifies and analyzes [[violence|violent]] and [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] behaviours as well as the structural mechanisms attending [[Conflict (process)|conflicts]] (including [[social conflict]]s), with a view towards understanding those processes which lead to a more desirable [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Dugan, 1989: 74&lt;/ref&gt; A variation on this, peace studies ('''irenology'''), is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] effort aiming at the prevention, de-escalation, and solution of conflicts by peaceful means, thereby seeking "victory" for all parties involved in the conflict. This is in contrast to [[military studies]], which has as its aim on the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts, primarily by violent means to the satisfaction of one or more, but not all, parties involved. Disciplines involved may include [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[geography]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[religious studies]], and [[gender studies]], as well as a variety of others. Relevant sub-disciplines of such fields, such as [[peace economics]], may be regarded as belonging to peace and conflict studies also.

==Historical background==
{{See also|Peace movement#History}}
Peace and conflict studies is both a pedagogical activity, in which teachers transmit knowledge to students; and a research activity, in which researchers create new knowledge about the sources of conflict. Peace and conflict studies entails understanding the concept of peace which is defined as political condition that ensures justice and social stability through formal and informal institutions, practices, and norms.Addo's con firmament

===As pedagogical activity===
Academics and students in the world's oldest universities have long been motivated by an interest in [[peace]]. American student interest in what we today think of as peace studies first appeared in the form of campus clubs at United States colleges in the years immediately following the [[American Civil War]]. Similar movements appeared in Sweden in the last years of the 19th century, as elsewhere soon after. These were student-originated discussion groups, not formal courses included in college curricula.

The [[First World War]] was a turning point in Western attitudes to war. At the 1919 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace of Paris]]—where the leaders of France, Britain, and the United States, led by [[Georges Clemenceau]], [[David Lloyd George]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]] respectively, met to decide the future of Europe—Wilson proposed his famous [[Fourteen Points]] for peacemaking. These included breaking up European empires into nation states and the establishment of the [[League of Nations]]. These moves, intended to ensure a peaceful future, were the background to a number of developments in the emergence of Peace and Conflict Studies as an academic discipline (but they also, as [[Keynes]] presciently pointed out, laid the seeds for future conflict).&lt;ref&gt;Keynes 1920&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of the first chair in International Relations at [[Aberystwyth University]], [[Wales]], whose remit was partly to further the cause of peace, occurred in 1919.

[[File:Manchester College Administration Building.jpg|thumb|left|Indiana's [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester College]] was one of the first institutions to offer a [[Major (academic)|major]] in peace studies]] 
After [[World War II]], the founding of the [[UN system]] provided a further stimulus for more rigorous approaches to peace and conflict studies to emerge. Many university courses in schools of higher learning around the world began to develop which touched upon questions of peace, often in relation to war, during this period.  The first undergraduate academic program in peace studies in the United States was developed in 1948 by Gladdys Muir, at [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester University]] a liberal arts college located in [[North Manchester, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=jg&gt;{{cite news|first=Holly |last=Abrams |title=Peace studies pioneer dies at 77

Work by academics such as [[Johan Galtung]] and [[John Burton (diplomat)|John Burton]], and debates in fora such as the ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'' in the 1960s reflected the growing interest and academic stature of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Wallensteen 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in the number of peace studies programs around the world was to accelerate during the 1980s, as students became more concerned about the prospects of nuclear war. As the [[Cold War]] ended, peace and conflict studies courses shifted their focus from international conflict&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"&gt;Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and towards complex issues related to political violence, [[human security]], [[democratisation]], [[human rights]], [[social justice]], [[welfare]], [[Social development|development]], and producing sustainable forms of peace.  A proliferation of international organisations, agencies and international NGOs, from the UN, [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[European Union]], and [[World Bank]] to [[International Crisis Group]], [[International Alert]], and others, began to draw on such research.&lt;ref name="Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005"&gt;Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Agendas relating to positive peace in European academic contexts were already widely debated in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1971&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s peace studies curricula in the United States had shifted "...from research and teaching about negative peace, the cessation of violence, to positive peace, the conditions that eliminate the causes of violence."&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt; As a result, the topics had broadened enormously. By 1994, a review of course offerings in peace studies included topics such as: "north-south relations"; "development, debt, and global poverty"; "the environment, population growth, and resource scarcity"; and "feminist perspectives on peace, militarism, and political violence."&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt;

There is now a general consensus on the importance of peace and conflict studies among scholars from a range of disciplines in and around the social sciences, as well as from many influential policymakers around the world. Peace and conflict studies today is widely researched and taught in a large and growing number of institutions and locations. The number of universities offering peace and conflict studies courses is hard to estimate, mostly because courses may be taught out of different departments and have very different names. The [http://ipra.terracuranda.org/ International Peace Research Association website] gives one of the most authoritative listings available. A 2008 report in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' mentions over 400 programs of teaching and research in peace and conflict studies, noting in particular those at the [[United World Colleges]], [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], [[Universitat Jaume I]] in [[Castellón de la Plana|Castellón de la Plana/Spain]], the [https://edu.mah.se/en/Course/FK110L?v=3&amp;full=true Malmö University of Sweden], the [[American University]], [[University of Bradford]], the UN mandated Peace University [[UPEACE]] in [[Ciudad Colón]]/[[Costa Rica]], [[School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution|George Mason University]], [[Lund]], [[Michigan]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], [[Queensland]], [[Uppsala]], [[Innsbruck]]/[[Austria]], [[Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]]. The [[Rotary Foundation]] and the [[UN University]] supports several international academic teaching and research programs.

A 1995 survey found 136 United States colleges with peace studies programs: "Forty-six percent of these are in church related schools, another 32% are in large public universities, 21% are in non-church related private colleges, and 1% are in community colleges. Fifty-five percent of the church related schools that have peace studies programs are [[Roman Catholic]]. Other denominations with more than one college or university with a peace studies program are the [[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Church of the Brethren]], and [[United Church of Christ]]. One hundred fifteen of these programs are at the undergraduate level and 21 at the graduate level. Fifteen of these colleges and universities had both undergraduate and graduate programs."&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt;

Other notable programs can be found at the [[University of Manitoba]], [[Lancaster University]], [[Hiroshima University]], [[University of Innsbruck]], [[Universitat Jaume I]], [[University of Sydney]], [[University of Queensland]], [[King's College (London)]], [[Sault College]], [[London Metropolitan University|London Metropolitan]], [[Sabancı University|Sabanci]], [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], [[Sciences Po]], [[Université Paris Dauphine]] [[University of Amsterdam]], [[University of Otago|Otago]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], and [[University of York|York]]. Perhaps most importantly, such programs and research agendas have now become common in institutions located in conflict, post-conflict, and developing countries and regions such as (e.g., National Peace Council), [[Centre for Human Rights]], [[University of Sarajevo]], [[Chulalongkorn University]], [[National University of East Timor]], [[University of Kabul]],

===As research activity===
[[File:JohanGaltung-Genève-1992.jpg|thumb|right|Norwegian academic [[Johan Galtung]] is widely regarded as a founder of peace and conflict studies]]
Although individual thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] had long recognised the centrality of peace (see [[Perpetual Peace]]), it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that peace studies began to emerge as an academic discipline with its own research tools, a specialized set of concepts, and forums for discussion such as journals and conferences. Beginning in 1959, with the founding of the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]]- PRIO&amp;nbsp;– (associated with [[Johan Galtung]]), a number of research institutes began to appear.&lt;ref name="Harris, Fisk, and Rank 1998"/&gt;

In 1963, [[Walter Isard]], the principal founder of [[Regional science]] assembled a group of scholars in [[Malmö]], Sweden, for the purpose of establishing the Peace Research Society.  The group of initial members included [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[Anatol Rapoport]]. In 1973, this group became the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110413215748/http://pss.la.psu.edu/ Peace Science Society].

In 1964, the [[International Peace Research Association]] was formed at a conference organized by [[Quaker]]s in Clarens, Switzerland. Among the original executive committee was [[Johan Galtung]]. The IPRA holds a biennial conference. Research presented at its conferences and in its publications typically focuses on institutional and historical approaches, seldom employing quantitative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soc.kuleuven.be/pol/ipra/about/history.html|title=KU Leuven Faculteit Sociale Wetenschappen - Centrum Voor Politicologie - Algemeen|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203152016/http://soc.kuleuven.be/pol/ipra/about/history.html|archivedate=3 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Peace and Justice Studies Association]] (PJSA) was formed as a result of a merger of two precursor organisations. The PJSA is the North American affiliate of IPRA and includes members from around the world with a predominance from the United States and Canada. The PJSA publishes a regular newsletter (''The Peace Chronicle''), and holds annual conferences on themes related to the organization's mission "to create a just and peaceful world" through research, scholarship, pedagogy, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacejusticestudies.org/about.php|title=About the Peace and Justice Studies Association|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Strategic Foresight Group]] presented its report on an innovative mechanism to find sustainable solution to conflicts in the Middle East. It also developed a new Water Cooperation Quotient,&lt;ref&gt;http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28799WCQ-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which is a measure of active cooperation by riparian countries in the management of water resources using 10 parameters including legal, political, technical, environmental, economic and institutional aspects.

==Description==
Peace studies can be classified as:
*  Multidisciplinary, encompassing elements of [[Politics]] and [[International Relations]] (particularly [[critical international relations theory]]), [[Sociology]], [[Psychology]], [[Anthropology]] and [[Economics]]. [[Critical theory]] is also widely used in peace and conflict studies.
*  Multilevel.  Peace studies examines intrapersonal peace, peace between individuals, neighbours, ethnic groups, marriages, states and civilisations.
*  Multicultural. [[Gandhi]] is often cited as a paradigm of Peace Studies.  However, true multiculturalism remains an aspiration as most Peace Studies centres are located in the West.
*  Both [[Analytic induction|analytic]] and [[norm (sociology)|normative]].  As a normative discipline, Peace Studies involves value judgements, such as "better" and "bad".
*  Both theoretical and applied.&lt;ref name="Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005"/&gt;

There has been a long-standing and vibrant debate on [[disarmament]] issues, as well as attempts to investigate, catalogue, and analyse issues relating to arms production, trade, and their political impacts.&lt;ref&gt;SIPRI 2007: Cooper, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been attempt to map the economic costs of war, or of relapses into violence, as opposed to those of peace.

Peace and conflict studies is now well established within the [[social sciences]]: it comprises many scholarly journals, college and university departments, peace research institutes, conferences, as well as outside recognition of the utility of peace and conflict studies as a method.

Peace Studies allows one to examine the causes and prevention of war, as well as the nature of violence, including social oppression, discrimination and marginalization.  Through peace studies one can also learn peace-making strategies to overcome persecution and transform society to attain a more just and equitable international community.

==Ideas==

===Conceptions of peace===
{{see also|Peace#Theories}}
[[File:General W. K. Harrison, Jr., signs armistice ending 3-year Korean conflict. Genearl Harrison, left table, and North... - NARA - 520995.tif|thumb|left|Delegates at the 1953 [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] achieved negative peace, ending [[Korean War|the war]] but not [[Korean conflict|the wider conflict]]]]
The negative and positive peace framework is the most widely used today. Negative peace refers to the absence of direct violence. Positive peace refers to the absence of indirect and [[structural violence]], and is the concept that most peace and conflict researchers adopt. This is often credited to Galtung&lt;ref name="Galtung &amp; Jacobsen 2000"&gt;Galtung &amp; Jacobsen 2000&lt;/ref&gt; but these terms were previously used by Martin Luther King in the [[q:Martin Luther King, Jr.|Letter from a Birmingham Jail in 1953]], in which he wrote about "negative peace which is the absence of tension" and "positive peace which is the presence of justice." These terms were perhaps first used by Jane Addams in 1907 in her book [https://books.google.ca/books?id=gVwrAVfjYJMC&amp;dq=william+james+positive+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Newer Ideals of Peace].

Several conceptions, models, or modes of peace have been suggested in which peace research might prosper.&lt;ref&gt;among many, Richmond 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

*The crux of the matter is that peace is a natural social condition, whereas war is not.  The premise is simple for peace researchers: to present enough information so that a rational group of decision makers will seek to avoid war and conflict.
*Second, the view that violence is sinful or unskillful, and that non-violence is skillful or virtuous and should be cultivated. This view is held by a variety of religious traditions worldwide: Quakers, Mennonites and other [[Peace churches]] within Christianity; [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Satyagraha|the Satyagraha tradition in Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and other portions of [[Indian philosophy|Indian religion and philosophy]]; as well as certain schools of [[Islam]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}.
*Third is [[pacifism]]: the view that peace is a prime force in human behaviour.
* A further approach is that there are multiple modes of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Daniela Ingruber, Josefina Echavarría, Gustavo Esteva and Norbert Koppensteiner (eds.): The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies: A Cultural Perspective, London, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many offerings on these various forms of peace. These range from the well known works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Rousseau]], [[Thomas Paine|Paine]], on various liberal international and constitutional and plans for peace. Variations and additions have been developed more recently by scholars such as Raymond Aron, Edward Azar, John Burton, Martin Ceadal, [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/w.dietrich/php/cms/ Wolfgang Dietrich], Kevin Dooley, [[Johan Galtung]], Michael Howard, [[Vivienne Jabri]], John-Paul Lederach, Roger Mac Ginty, Hugh Miall, David Mitrany, [http://www.bradford.ac.uk/acad/confres/html/oramsbotham.html Oliver Ramsbotham], [[Anatol Rapoport]], [http://polsci.ku.dk/english/staff/detaljer/?id=29769 Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen], [https://manchester.academia.edu/OliverRichmond Oliver Richmond], [[S. P. Udayakumar|S.P. Udayakumar]], [http://www.brad.ac.uk/peace/academic/proftomwoodhouse/ Tom Woodhouse], others mentioned above and many more. [[Democratic peace]], liberal peace, sustainable peace, civil peace, hybrid peace, post-liberal peace, trans-rational peace(s)and other concepts are regularly used in such work.

===Sustainable peace===
Under the conceptions of peace, sustainable peace must be regarded as an important factor for the future of prosperity. Sustainable peace must be the priority of global society where state actors and non-state actors do not only seek for the profits in a near future that might violate the stable state of peace. For a sustainable peace, nurturing, empowerment, and communications are considered to be the crucial factors throughout the world. Firstly, nurturing is necessary to encourage psychological stability and emotional maturity. The significance of social value in adequate nurturing is important for sustainable peace. Secondly, in order to achieve real security, inner security must be secured along with arranged social systems and protection based on firm foundation. Lastly, communications are necessary to overcome ignorance and establish a community based on reliable and useful information. It will prevents isolation to take place which is critical to bring sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gilman, Sustainable Peace putting the pieces together, The Foundations of Peace (IC#4)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict triangle===
[[Johan Galtung]]'s [[Violence Peace and Peace Research|conflict triangle]] works on the assumption that the best way to define peace is to define violence, its opposite.  It reflects the normative aim of preventing, managing, limiting and overcoming violence.&lt;ref name="Galtung &amp; Jacobsen 2000"/&gt;

* Direct (overt) violence, e.g., direct attack, massacre.
* Structural violence.  Death by avoidable reasons such as malnutrition.  Structural violence is indirect violence caused by an unjust structure and is not to be equated with an [[act of God]].
* Cultural violence.  Cultural violence occurs as a result of the cultural assumptions that blind one to direct or structural violence.  For example, one may be indifferent toward the homeless, or even consider their expulsion or extermination a good thing.
Each corner of Galtung's triangle can relate to the other two. [[Ethnic cleansing]] can be an example of all three.

To simply understand these three

• Direct violence = harming or hurting body &amp; mind
• Structural violence= economic exploitation &amp; political repression
• Cultural violence = underlying values &amp; epistemic models that legitimize direct &amp; structural violence

===Cost of conflict===

[[Cost of conflict]] is a tool which attempts to calculate the price of conflict to the human race. The idea is to examine this cost, not only in terms of the deaths and casualties and the economic costs borne by the people involved, but also the social, developmental, environmental and strategic costs of conflict. The approach considers direct costs of conflict, for instance human deaths, expenditure, destruction of land and physical infrastructure; as well as indirect costs that impact a society, for instance migration, humiliation, growth of extremism and lack of civil society.

[[Strategic Foresight Group]], a think tank in [[India]], has developed a Cost of Conflict Series for countries and regions involved in protracted conflicts. This tool is aimed at assessing past, present and future costs looking at a wide range of parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/|title=Strategic Foresight Group - Anticipating and Influencing Global Future|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative aims==
[[File:Pak-Uvira-32 (8137982111).jpg|thumb|right|[[Peacekeeping]] efforts by [[armed forces]] can provide one means to limit and ultimately resolve conflict]]
The normative aims of peace studies are [[conflict transformation]] and [[conflict resolution]] through mechanisms such as [[peacekeeping]], peacebuilding (e.g., tackling disparities in rights, institutions and the distribution of world wealth) and peacemaking (e.g., mediation and conflict resolution).  Peacekeeping falls under the aegis of negative peace, whereas efforts toward positive peace involve elements of peace building and peacemaking.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching peace and conflict studies to the military==

One of the interesting developments within peace and conflict studies is the number of military personnel undertaking such studies.  This poses some challenges, as the military is an institution overtly committed to combat.  In the article "Teaching Peace to the Military", published in the journal [[Peace Review]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00007876/ Page, James S. 2007. 'Teaching Peace to the Military'. [[Peace Review]], 19(4):571–577].&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Smith Page|James Page]] argues for five principles that ought to undergird this undertaking, namely, respect but do not privilege military experience, teach the just war theory, encourage students to be aware of the tradition and techniques of nonviolence, encourage students to deconstruct and demythologize, and recognize the importance of military virtue.

== Critical peace and conflict studies: hybridity, trans-rational peace, and elicitive conflict transformation ==
Scholars working in the areas of peace and conflict studies have made significant contributions to the policies used by non-governmental organisations, development agencies, international financial institutions, and the UN system, in the specific areas of conflict resolution and citizen diplomacy, development, political, social, and economic reform, peacekeeping, mediation, early warning, prevention, peacebuilding, and statebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Wallensteen, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a shift in interest from conflict management approaches oriented towards a "negative peace" to conflict resolution and peacebuilding approaches aimed at a "positive peace". This emerged rapidly at the end of the Cold War, and was encapsulated in the report of then-UN Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], ''[[An Agenda for Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Boutros Ghali 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it might be said that much of the machinery of what has been called "liberal peacebuilding" by a number of scholars&lt;ref&gt;Duffield, 2001, Paris, 2004, Richmond, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and "statebuilding" by another&lt;ref&gt;Caplan 2005, Chandler, 2006, Fukuyama, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; is based largely on the work that has been carried out in this area. Many scholars in the area have advocated a more "emancipatory" form of peacebuilding, however, based upon a "[[Responsibility to Protect]]" (R2P),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org|title=International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect (ICRtoP)|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; human security,&lt;ref&gt;Tadjbakhsh &amp; Chenoy 2006&lt;/ref&gt; local ownership and participation in such processes,&lt;ref&gt;Chopra &amp; Hohe 2004&lt;/ref&gt; especially after the limited success of liberal peacebuilding/ statebuilding in places as diverse as [[Cambodia]], the [[Balkans]], [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Nepal]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. This research agenda is in the process of establishing a more nuanced agenda for peacebuilding which also connects with the original, qualitatively and normatively oriented work that emerged in the peace studies and conflict research schools of the 1960s (e.g. see the Oslo Peace Research Institute research project on "Liberal Peace and the Ethics of Peacebuilding" and the "Liberal Peace Transitions" project at the University of St Andrews)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burgess|first=Peter|title=Liberal Peace and the Ethics of Peacebuilding|url=http://www.prio.no/Projects/Project/?x=810|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more critical ideas about peacebuilding that have recently developed in many European and non-western academic and policy circles.&lt;ref&gt;Jabri 2007: Richmond &amp; Franks 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have pointed towards the hybrid outcomes that have arisen in practice, indicating both the potential and problems of hybrid forms of peace, with an everyday orientation, and suggestive of the emergence of a post-liberal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richmond|first=Oliver|title=A Post-Liberal Peace|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-66784-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNESCO Chair for Peace Studies at the University of Innsbruck/Austria proposed in 2008 a culture-based classification of peace interpretations: energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Variationen über die vielen Frieden; Wiesbaden [VS Verlag], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The trans-rational approach unites existing spiritual interpretations of society and relation&lt;ref&gt;Samrat Schmiem Kumar: Bhakti&amp;nbsp;– the yoga of love. Trans-rational approaches to Peace Studies; [LIT] Münster, Vienna, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with the mechanistic methods of modern peace. Hence this school prefers the strictly relational and systemic method of elicitive conflict transformation (Lederach)&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, John Paul: Preparing for Peace; Syracuse [Syracuse University Press], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to the prescriptive approaches of modern conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Koppensteiner, Norbert: Tha Art of the Transpersonal Self. Transformation as Aesthetic and Energetic Practise; [ATROPOS] New York, Dresden, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
{{Image frame|width=375|content=[[File:Roger Scruton (2015), Prague.jpg|225x225px]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:David Horowitz by Gage Skidmore.jpg|225x225px]]
|caption=Conservative writers [[Roger Scruton]] (left) and [[David Horowitz]] (right) are among the critics of peace and conflict studies|align=right}}
A serious number of well established criticisms have been aimed at peace and conflict studies, often but not necessarily from outside the realms of university system, including that peace studies:

*do not produce practical prescriptions for managing or resolving global conflicts because "[[ideology]] always trumps [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[pragmatism]]";{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}
*are focused on putting a "respectable face on Western [[self-loathing]]";{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
*are hypocritical because they "tacitly or openly support [[terrorism]] as a permissible strategy for the 'disempowered' to redress real or perceived grievances against the powerful" (i.e. ideological anti-Western concepts developed by social scientists such as [[Johan Galtung]] which arguably add a sense of unjustified acceptability which is used in support of radicalism)
*have curricula that are (according to human rights activist [[Caroline Cox]] and philosopher [[Roger Scruton]]) "intellectually incoherent, riddled with bias and unworthy of academic status...";&lt;ref name=barbarians&gt;"[http://www.barbarakay.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20 Barbarians within the gate]" by Barbara Kay, National Post, February 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*have policies proposed to "eliminate the causes of violence" are uniformly [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] policies, and not necessarily policies which would find broad agreement among social scientists.&lt;ref name="Bawer 2007"&gt;Bawer 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a columnist for the ''[[National Post]]'', specifically criticized the views of Norwegian professor [[Johan Galtung]], who is considered to be a leader in modern peace research. Kay wrote that Galtung has written on the "structural fascism" of "rich, Western, Christian" democracies, admires [[Fidel Castro]], opposed resistance to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Invasion of Hungary in 1956]], and has described [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] as "persecuted elite personages." Galtung has also praised [[Mao Zedong]] for "endlessly liberating" China. Galtung has also stated that the United States is a "killer country" that is guilty of "neo-fascist state terrorism" and has reportedly stated that the destruction of Washington, D. C., could be justified by America's foreign policy. He has also compared the United States to Nazi Germany for bombing Kosovo during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=barbarians/&gt;

In the Summer 2007 edition of ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'', [[Bruce Bawer]] sharply criticized Peace Studies. He noted that many Peace Studies programs in American Universities are run by Marxist or far-left Professors. More broadly, he argued that Peace Studies are dominated by the belief that "America ... is the wellspring of the world’s problems" and that while Professors of Peace Studies argue "that terrorist positions deserve respect at the negotiating table," they "seldom tolerate alternative views" and that "(p)eace studies, as a rule, rejects questioning of its own guiding ideology."&lt;ref name=Bawer&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_3_peace_racket.html The Peace Racket] by Bruce Bawer, City Journal, Summer 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his claim that Peace Studies supports violence in the pursuit of leftist ideology, Bawer cited a quote from ''[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Peace-and-Conflict-Studies/Charles-P-Webel/e/9780761925071/?itm=4 Peace and Conflict Studies]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Peace-and-Conflict-Studies/Charles-P-Webel/e/9780761925071/?itm=4 Peace and Conflict Studies] by Charles P. Webel and [[David P. Barash]], Textbook (Hardcover&amp;nbsp;– Older Edition), SAGE Publications, March 2002, 592pp, {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2507-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1021115/asp/opinion/story_1382074.asp Take a Break from War] by Kaushik Roy, The Telegraph (Calcutta, India),  November 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; a widely used 2002 textbook written by Charles P. Webel and [[David P. Barash]] which praised [[Vladimir Lenin]] because he “maintained that only revolution—not reform—could undo capitalism’s tendency toward imperialism and thence to war."&lt;ref name=Bawer/&gt;

[[David Horowitz]] has argued that Webel and Barash's book implicitly supports violence for socialist causes, noting that the book states "the case of Cuba indicates that violent revolutions can sometimes result in generally improved living conditions for many people." Horowitz also argued that the book "treats the Soviet Union as a sponsor of peace movements, and the United States as the militaristic, imperialist power that peace movements try to keep in check" and that "the authors justify Communist policies and actions while casting those of America and Western democracies in a negative light." Horowitz also claimed that the authors discuss the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] without mentioning its cause (i.e. the placement of the Soviet missiles in Cuba) and blame [[John F. Kennedy]] while praising Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for "be[ing] willing to back down." Finally, Horowitz criticized the author's use of Marxist writers, such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Frances Moore Lappe]], as the sole basis on which to study "poverty and hunger as causes of human conflict."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org/news/581/BSUonemansterroristDHarticle110804.htm "One Man's Terrorist Is Another Man's Freedom Fighter"] by David Horowitz, (website of Students for Academic Freedom), November 08, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay and Bawer also specifically criticized Professor [http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/sociology/fellman.html Gordon Fellman], the Chairman of [[Brandeis University]]'s Peace, Conflict, and Coexistence Studies Program, whom they claimed has justified Palestinian suicide-bombings against Israelis as "ways of inflicting revenge on an enemy that seems unable or unwilling to respond to rational pleas for discussion and justice."&lt;ref name=Bawer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peaceworkmagazine.org/pwork/0210/021020.htm September 11 and the Field of Peace Studies] by Gordon Fellman, Peacework, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katherine Kersten]], who is a senior fellow at the Minneapolis-based conservative think tank [[Center of the American Experiment]], believes that Peace Studies programs are "dominated by people of a certain ideological bent, and [are] thus hard to take seriously." [http://www.stthomas.edu/cathstudies/faculty/kennedy.htm Robert Kennedy], a professor of Catholic studies and management at the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]], criticized his university's Peace Studies Program in an interview with ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' in 2002, stating that the program employs several adjunct professors "whose academic qualifications are not as strong as we would ordinarily look for" and that "The combination of the ideological bite and the maybe less-than-full academic credentials of the faculty would probably raise some questions about how scholarly the program is."&lt;ref&gt;"For Young Activists, Peacemaking 101", by Tom Ford and Bob von Sternberg, ''Minneapolis Star Tribune'', December 17, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===

Such views have been strongly opposed by scholars who claim that these criticisms underestimate the development of detailed interdisciplinary, theoretical, methodological, and empirical research into the causes of violence and dynamics of peace that has occurred via academic and policy networks around the world.&lt;ref name="Miall, Ramsbotham, &amp; Woodhouse 2005"/&gt;

In reply to [[Barbara Kay]]'s article, a group of Peace Studies experts in Canada responded that "Kay's...argument that the field of peace studies endorses terrorism is nonsense" and that "(d)edicated peace theorists and researchers are distinguished by their commitment to reduce the use of violence whether committed by enemy nations, friendly governments or warlords of any stripe." They also argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...Ms. Kay attempts to portray advocates for peace as naive and idealistic, but the data shows that the large majority of armed conflicts in recent decades have been ended through negotiations, not military solutions. In the contemporary world, violence is less effective than diplomacy in ending armed conflict. Nothing is 100% effective to reduce tyranny and violence, but domestic and foreign strategy needs to be based on evidence, rather than assumptions and misconceptions from a bygone era."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=1325511 In defence of peace studies] by Catherine Morris, director, Peacemakers Trust, Victoria; Ben Hoffman, president and CEO, Canadian International Institute of Applied Negotiation, Ottawa; Dean E. Peachey, visiting professor in transitional justice, Global College, University of Winnipeg, National Post, February 25, 2009. ([http://peacemakers.ca.etherwork.net/bulletins/2009/02/in-defence-of-peace-studies-letter-to-the-national-post/ Full letter is available here])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most academics in the area argue that the accusations that peace studies approaches are not objective, and derived from mainly leftist or inexpert sources, are not practical, support violence rather than reject it, or have not led to policy developments, are clearly incorrect. They note that the development of UN and major donor policies (including the EU, US, and UK, as well as many others including those of Japan, Canada, Norway, etc.) towards and in conflict and post-conflict countries have been heavily influenced by such debates. A range of key policy documents and responses have been developed by these governments in the last decade and more, and in UN (or related) documentation such as "Agenda for Peace", "Agenda for Development", "Agenda for Democratization", the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[Responsibility to Protect]], and the "High Level Panel Report".&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Secretary- General’s High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change, United Nations, 2004: Boutros Boutros Ghali, An Agenda For Peace: preventative diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping, New York: United Nations, 1992; An Agenda for Development: Report of the Secretary-General, A/48/935, 6 May 1994; “Supplement to An Agenda for Peace” A/50/60, S.1995/1, 3 January 1995; An Agenda for Democratization, A/50/332 AND A/51/512, 17 December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been significant for the work of the World Bank, International Development Agencies, and a wide range of Non Governmental Organisations.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. for the World Bank, see, "Breaking the Conflict Trap: Civil War and Development Policy" [http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTPRRS/EXTBCTCWDP0,,menuPK:477815~pagePK:64168092~piPK:64168088~theSitePK:477803,00.html]: For DFID see [http://www.dfid.gov.uk/aboutdfid/performance/files/ev646s.pdf]; e.g. see also [[International Crisis Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been influential in the work of, among others, the UN, UNDP, [[UN Peacebuilding Commission]], [[UNHCR]], [[World Bank]], [[European Union|EU]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], for national donors including USAID, DFID, CIDA, NORAD, DANIDA, Japan Aid, GTZ, and international NGOs such as [[International Alert]] or [[International Crisis Group]], as well as many local NGOs. Major databases have been generated by the work of scholars in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Correlates of War at Harvard University [http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/cow]: PRIO/ Uppsala University Data on Armed Conflict [http://www.prio.no/CSCW/Datasets/Armed-Conflict/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, peace and conflict studies debates have generally confirmed, not undermined, a broad consensus (western and beyond) on the importance of [[human security]], human rights, development, democracy, and a rule of law (though there is a vibrant debate ongoing about the contextual variations and applications of these frameworks).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle and Nicolas Sambanis, Making War and Building Peace, (Princeton University Press, 2006); Charles T. Call and Elizabeth M. Cousens, “Ending Wars and Building Peace: International Responses to War-Torn Societies,” International Studies Perspectives, 9 (2008): Stephen D. Krasner, “Sharing Sovereignty. New Institutions for Collapsed and Failing States,” International Security, 29, 2 (2004); Roland Paris, At War’s End, (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the research field is characterized by a number of challenges including the tension between "the objective of doing critical research and being of practical relevance".&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13755">'''Phytosociology''' is the branch of science which deals with [[plant communities]], their composition and development, and the relationships between the [[species]] within them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; A phytosociological system is a system for classifying these communities. 

== History ==
Rooted in [[phytogeography]] and as such considered sometimes a field of [[geobotany]], phytosociology emerged simultaneously in Poland ([[Józef Paczoski|Paczoski]]), France ([[Josias Braun-Blanquet|Braun-Blanquet]]) and Sweden (Du Rietz), but hardly penetrated in Anglo-Saxon world, where prevailed the [[Community_(ecology)#Individualistic_theory|continuum concept of community]], opposed to the concept of [[plant association]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Decocq, G. (2016). Moving from Patterns to Processes: A Challenge for the Phytosociology of the Twenty-First Century? In: Box, E. O. (Ed.). ''Vegetation Structure and Function at Multiple Spatial, Temporal and Conceptual Scales''. Springer. pp. 407-424, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LwHNCwAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "phytosociology" was coined in 1896 by Paczoski.&lt;ref&gt;Rabotnov TA. 1970-1979. Phytocoenology. In: The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd ed. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Phytocoenology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The aim of phytosociology is to achieve a sufficient empirical model of [[vegetation]] using [[plant]] ''[[taxa]]'' combinations that characterize univocally vegetation units. Vegetation units as understood by phytosociologists may express largely abstract vegetation concepts (e.g. the set of all hard-leaved [[evergreen forest]]s of western [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] area) or actual readily recognizable vegetation types (e.g. cork-oak oceanic forests on [[Pleistocene]] dunes with dense canopy in SW-[[Iberian Peninsula]]). Such conceptual units are called "syntaxa" (singular "syntaxon") and can be set in a hierarchy system called "synsystem" or syntaxonomic system. The act of creation, amelioration or adjusting the synsystem is called "syntaxonomy". Therefore, the syntaxonomic system is putatively a sufficient empirical representation of vegetation of a given territory. An ''International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iavs.org/Resources/Classification/International-Code-of-Phytosociological-Nomenclatu.aspx |title=The International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt;, issuing the rules for naming "syntaxa" exists and its use has increased among vegetation scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=H E |last2=Moravec |first2=J |last3=Theurillat |first3=J-P |date=Oct 2000 |title=International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature |journal=Journal of Vegetation Science |volume=11 | issue=5| pages=739–768|jstor=3236580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association model==
The basic unit of syntaxonomy is the "[[Association (ecology)|association]]", defined by its characteristic combination of plant taxa, [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] features, physiognomy, biogeographical area, role in ecological succession, historical (e.g. history of use by humans) and paleo-biogeographical relationships. The association is sometimes viewed as a concrete phytocoenosis (the plant component of a [[biocoenosis]]). Associations with floristic and territorial affinities{{what?|reason=what does that mean?|date=December 2016}} can be grouped in larger ecological conceptual units (i.e. syntaxa) called "alliances". Similar alliances may be grouped in "orders" and orders in vegetation "classes". The setting of syntaxa in such a hierarchy makes up the syntaxonomical system, or the reference model of the given vegetation and territory.

This science began with [[Charles Flahault]] and continued in earnest with the work of [[Josias Braun-Blanquet]] (1884–1980).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Vegetation complexes==
Nowadays, phytosociologists try to include higher levels of complexity in the perception of vegetation, namely by describing whole successional units (vegetation series) or, in general, vegetation complexes. These lie in the scope of Landscape Phytosociology. Other developments include the use of [[multivariate statistics]] for the definition of "syntaxa" and their environmental interpretation.

On the one hand, some authors consider phytosociology to be in the scope of contemporary vegetation science, a successful approach because of its highly descriptive and predictive powers, and its usefulness in nature management issues. On the other hand, there are numerous critics who have focused on several methodological limitations: the absence of statistical approaches, the complexity and non-stability of the nomenclatural system, the mistakes in the predictive models, and certain basic assumptions.

==Habitat-type classification==
Even if in continental Europe, a complete synsystem describing vegetation types has been developed and it is a basis for habitat-type classification (e.g. NATURA 2000 typology and habitat network), there are numerous scientific experts who do not have a positive opinion about the suitability for phytosociology to be the main [[geobotany|geobotanical]] approach for managing vegetation systems. An important point of disagreement is the floristic-phytosociological assumption that the forest patches of the Mediterranean species of pines mainly derived from afforestations, non-stables and incidentals.

==Data collections==
Phytosociological data contain information collected in relevés (or plots) listing each species cover-abundance values and the measured environmental variables. This data is conveniently databanked in a program like TURBOVEG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hennekens | first1 = SM | last2 = Schaminée | first2 = JHJ | year = 2001 | title = TURBOVEG, a comprehensive data base management system for vegetation data | url = | journal = Journal of Vegetation Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 589–591 | doi=10.2307/3237010| jstor = 3237010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for editing, storage and export to other applications.

Data is usually classified and sorted using TWINSPAN&lt;ref&gt;Hill MO (1979) TWINSPAN: A FORTRAN Programme for arranging multivariate data in an ordered two-way table by classification of the individuals and attributes. Ecology and Systematics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; in host programs like [[JUICE (software)|JUICE]] to create realistic species-relevé associations. Further patterns are investigated using clustering and resemblance methods, and [[Ordination (statistics)|ordination techniques]] available in software packages like CANOCO&lt;ref&gt;ter Braak CJF, Šmilauer P (2002) CANOCO Reference manual and CanoDraw for Windows User’s guide: Software for Canonical Community Ordination (version 4.5). Microcomputer Power, Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[R (programming language)|R]]-package vegan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Oksanen |first=J.

'''Pleistocene Park''' ({{lang-ru|Плейстоценовый парк}}) is a [[nature reserve]] on the [[Kolyma River]] south of [[Chersky (settlement)|Chersky]] in the [[Sakha Republic]], [[Russia]], in northeastern [[Siberia]], where an attempt is being made to recreate the [[Mammoth steppe|northern subarctic steppe grassland ecosystem]] that flourished in the area during the [[last glacial period]].&lt;ref name="natgeo2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eli Kintisch: Born to Rewild. 2015" /&gt;

The project is being led by [[Russia]]n scientists [[Sergey Zimov]] and [[Nikita Zimov]],&lt;ref name="meyer2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiegogo 2018, update 30 May 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anna Stroganova: Bison for Siberia. 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp materials diary-nikita-wrangel-2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zoologist 84" /&gt; testing the [[hypothesis]] that repopulating with large herbivores (and predators) can restore rich grasslands ecosystems, as expected if [[Quaternary extinction event#Hunting hypothesis|overhunting]], and not [[Quaternary extinction event#Climate change hypothesis|climate change]], was primarily responsible for the extinction of wildlife and the disappearance of the grasslands at the [[Quaternary extinction event|end of the Pleistocene epoch]].&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;

The aim of the project is to research the climatic effects of the expected changes in the ecosystem. Here the hypothesis is that the change from [[tundra]] to grassland will result in a raised ratio of energy emission to energy absorption of the area, leading to less thawing of permafrost and thereby less emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt; It is also thought that removal of snow by large herbivores will further reduce the permafrost's insulation.

To study this, large [[herbivore]]s have been released, and their effect on the local fauna is being monitored. Preliminary results point at the ecologically low-grade tundra [[biome]] being converted into a productive grassland biome, and at the energy emission of the area being raised.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;

A documentary is being produced about the park by an American journalist and filmmaker.&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis 2013: Pleistocene Park pt.1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis: Pleistocene Park Movie. fb" /&gt;

== Goals ==

=== Researching the effects of large herbivores on the arctic tundra/grasslands ecosystem ===
The primary aim of Pleistocene Park is to recreate the mammoth steppe (ancient [[taiga]]/[[tundra]] grasslands that were widespread in the region during the last ice age). The key concept is that animals, rather than climate, maintained that ecosystem. Reintroducing large herbivores to Siberia would then initiate a positive feedback loop promoting the reestablishment of grassland ecosystems. This argument is the basis for [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] Pleistocene Park's landscape with [[megafauna]] that were previously abundant in the area, as evidenced by the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;

The [[Mammoth steppe|grassland-steppe ecosystem]] that dominated Siberia during the [[Pleistocene]] disappeared 10,000 years ago and was replaced by a mossy and forested [[tundra]] and [[taiga]] ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;  Concurrently, most of the large herbivores that roamed Siberia during the Pleistocene have vanished from the region.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt; The mainstream explanation for this used to be that at the beginning of the [[Holocene]] the arid steppe climate changed into a humid one, and when the steppe vanished so did the steppe's animals.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt; Sergei Zimov points out that in contradiction to this scenario:
* Similar climatic shifts occurred in previous interglacial periods without causing such massive environmental changes,&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;
* Those large herbivores of the former steppe that survived until today (e.g. [[Muskox|musk oxen]], [[bison]], [[Equus ferus|horses]]) thrive in humid environments just as well as in arid ones,&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;
* The climate (both temperatures and humidity) in today's northern Siberia is in fact similar to that of the [[mammoth steppe]]. The radiation aridity index for northern Siberia on [[Mikhail Budyko]]'s scale is 2 (= steppe bordering on semi-desert).&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt; [[Aridity index#Budyko's index|Budyko's scale]] compares the ratio of the energy received by the earth's surface to the energy required for the evaporation of the total annual precipitation. The 'humid climate' argument was based on [[Aridity index|other scales]], which compare precipitation to [[potential evapotranspiration]]. Moss has a very low transpiration rate and thus causes humidity without necessarily needing humidity for its establishment. Using these other scales as a proof for humidity being the cause of the disappearance of the grasslands therefore constitutes a [[begging the question|circular argument]], which is not scientifically viable.
Zimov and colleagues argue for a reversed order of environmental change in the mammoth steppe. Humans, with their constantly improving technology, overhunted the large herbivores and led to their extinction and extirpation.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem.

=== Researching the effects of large herbivores on permafrost and global warming ===
{{See also|Permafrost#Climate change effects}}
A secondary aim is to research the climatic effects of the expected changes in the ecosystem. Here the key concept is that some of the effects of the large herbivores, such as eradicating trees and shrubs or trampling snow, will result in a stronger cooling of the ground in the winter, leading to less thawing of [[permafrost]] during summer and thereby less emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis 2013: Pleistocene Park pt.1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon.

{{wikinews|Scientists warn thawing Siberia may trigger global meltdown}}
Permafrost is a large global carbon reservoir that has remained frozen throughout much of the Holocene.&lt;ref name="Zimov, Schuur, Chapin 2006: Permafrost and Global" /&gt;  Due to recent [[global warming|climate change]], the permafrost is beginning to thaw, releasing stored carbon and forming [[Thermokarst|thermokarst lakes]].&lt;ref name="Zimov, Schuur, Chapin 2006: Permafrost and Global" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimes 2007: lakes a major source" /&gt;  When the thawed permafrost enters the thermokarst lakes, its carbon is converted into [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gases|carbon dioxide and methane]] and released into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Walter et al 2007: Thermokarst Lakes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter et al 2006: Methane bubbling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 1997: North Siberian Lakes" /&gt; [[Atmospheric methane#Methane as a greenhouse gas|Methane is a potent greenhouse gas]] and the methane emissions from thermokarst lakes have the potential to initiate a [[positive feedback|positive feedback cycle]] in which increased atmospheric methane concentrations lead to amplified global climate change, which in turn leads to more permafrost thaw and more methane and carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name="Walter et al 2006: Methane bubbling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 1997: North Siberian Lakes" /&gt;

As the combined carbon stored in the world's permafrost (1670 [[Gigatonne|Gt]])&lt;ref name="Tarnocai et al (2009): Soil organic" /&gt; equals about two times the amount of the carbon currently released in the atmosphere (720 Gt),&lt;ref name="Falkowski et al 2000: Global Carbon Cycle" /&gt; the setting in motion of such a positive feedback cycle could potentially lead to [[runaway climate change]] scenario. Even if the ecological situation of the arctic were as it was 400,000 years ago (i.e., grasslands instead of tundra), a global temperature rise of 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (2.7&amp;nbsp;°F) relative to the pre-industrial level would be enough to start the thawing of permafrost in Siberia.&lt;ref name="Fiona Harvey 2013 / Vaks et al 2013: Speleothems" /&gt;  An increased cooling of the ground during winter would raise the current [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]], potentially delaying such a scenario.

== Implementation ==

=== Background: regional Pleistocene ecoregions ===
It has been proposed that the introduction of a variety of large herbivores will recreate their ancient [[ecological niche]]s in Siberia and regenerate the Pleistocene terrain with its different ecological habitats such as [[taiga]], [[tundra]], [[steppe]] and [[alpine-steppe|alpine terrain]].

The main object, however, is to recreate the extensive grasslands that covered the [[Beringia|Beringia region]] in the late Pleistocene. This form of grassland (also known as [[mammoth steppe]]) was inhabited by a diverse set of large and medium herbivores. Back in the Pleistocene the area was populated by many species of [[grazers]] that assembled in large herds similar in size to those in Africa today. Species that roamed the great grasslands included the [[woolly mammoth]], [[woolly rhino]], [[steppe wisent]], [[Lena horse]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer]].

Another herbivore that was abundant in this region during the Pleistocene but now faces possible extinction in its remaining habitats is the [[saiga antelope]], which can form massive herds that keep the vegetation down.

At the edges of these large stretches of grassland could be found more shrub-like terrain and dry conifer forests (similar to taiga). In this terrain the [[browsing (predation)|browsers]] of the Pleistocene were to be found. This group of megafauna included [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[moose]], [[wapiti]], [[Equus lambei|Yukon wild ass]], and [[camel]]s. The more mountainous terrain was occupied by several species of mountain-going animals like the [[snow sheep]].

Back in the Pleistocene there was also a great variety of carnivorous mammals as well. On the plains there were prides of [[Beringian cave lion]]. These large cats were the apex predators of the region, but also shared their habitat with other predators such as [[grey wolf]], [[cave hyena]], ''[[Homotherium]]'', [[brown bear]], [[wolverine]], and [[Arctic fox]], which all occupied a distinct ecological niche essential for the balance of their respective ecosystems.

On the edges of the grasslands (in the shrubs and forests) there were also [[brown bear]]s, [[wolverine]]s, [[cave bear]]s, [[lynx]]es, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[red fox]]es. The [[Siberian tiger]] and [[Amur leopard]] occupied the southern part of the steppe biome and surviving populations are still found along the present Russian-Sino border in the [[Amur region|Amur]] and [[Primorye|Primorye region]]s.

=== Proposed procedure ===
In present-day Siberia only a few of the former species of megafauna are left, and their population density is extremely low, too low to affect the environment. To reach the desired effects, the density has to be raised artificially by fencing in and concentrating the existing large herbivores. A large variety of species is important as each species affects the environment differently and as the overall stability of the ecosystem increases with the variety of species&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt; (compare ''[[Biodiversity#Biodiversity and ecological services]]''). Their numbers will be raised by reintroducing species that went locally extinct (e.g., [[muskox]]en). For species that went completely extinct, suitable replacements will be introduced if possible (e.g., [[wild Bactrian camel]]s for the extinct Pleistocene camels of the genus [[Paracamelus]]). As the number of herbivores increases, the enclosure will be expanded.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Scientific background" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt;

While this is taking place, the effects will be monitored. This concerns for example the effects on the flora (are the mosses being replaced by grasses, etc.), the effects on the atmosphere (changes in levels of methane, carbon dioxide, water vapor) and the effects on the [[permafrost]].&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sakha news" /&gt;

Finally, once a high density of herbivores over a vast area has been reached, predators larger than the wolves will have to be introduced to keep the megafauna in check.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem. Science Mag." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt;

=== Progress and plans ===
;1988–1996
The first grazing experiments began in 1988 at the [[Northeast Science Station (Russia)|Northeast Science Station]] in Chersky with [[Yakutian horse]]s.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;

;1996–2004
In 1996 a 50 [[Hectare|ha]] (125 [[acre]]) enclosure was built in Pleistocene Park.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2007: Mammoth Steppes and Future Climate" /&gt; As a first step in recreating the ancient landscape, the Yakutian horses were introduced, as horses had been the most abundant [[ungulate]]s on the northeastern Siberian mammoth steppe.&lt;ref name="Gennady: The North of Eastern Siberia, 2004" /&gt; Of the first 40 horses, 15 were killed by predators and 12 died of eating poisonous plants. More horses were imported, and they learned to cope with the environment.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt; In 2006 approximately 20 horses lived in the park,&lt;ref name="Radio Svoboda, Zimov interview, 2006" /&gt; and by 2007 more horses were being born annually than died.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt; By 2013, the number had risen to about 30.&lt;ref name="zoologist 78" /&gt; Moose, present in the area, were also introduced.&lt;ref name="pp Pleistocene Park" /&gt; The effects of large animals (mammoths and wisents) on nature were artificially created by using an [[Military engineering vehicle|engineering tank]] and an 8-wheel drive [[ARGO (ATV manufacturer)|Argo all-terrain vehicle]] to crush pathways through the willow shrub.&lt;ref name="Wolf 2008: Big Thaw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark Paricio: Polaris Project. 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp machinery 62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanny Kittler: Summer Blog: Chersky 2013 - Pleistocene Park" /&gt;

[[File:Pleistocene Park.jpg|thumb|Restored grasslands in Pleistocene Park]]The vegetation in the park started to change. In the areas where the horses grazed, the soil has been compacted&lt;ref name="sakha news" /&gt; and mosses, weeds and willow shrub were replaced by grasses.&lt;ref name="meyer2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Terry Chapin pp site: Pleistocene Park Concept" /&gt; Flat grassland is now the dominating landscape inside the park.&lt;ref name="Fanny Kittler: Summer Blog: Chersky 2013 - Pleistocene Park" /&gt; The permafrost was also influenced by the grazers. When air temperature sank to –40&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] (–40&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) in winter, the temperature of the ground was found to be only –5&amp;nbsp;°C (+23&amp;nbsp;°F) under an intact cover of snow, but –30&amp;nbsp;°C (–22&amp;nbsp;°F) where the animals had trampled down the snow. The grazers thus help keep permafrost intact, thereby lessening the amount of methane released by the tundra.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimov et al 2012: Mammoth steppe: a high-productivity phenomenon. QSR" /&gt;

;2004–2011
In the years 2004–2005 a new fence was erected, creating an enclosure of 16 [[Square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (6 [[Square mile|sq mi]]).&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Homepage" /&gt;

The new enclosure finally allowed a more rapid development of the project.&lt;ref name="Good fence, Russian, 2006" /&gt; After the fence was completed, reindeer were brought into the park from herds in the region and are now the most numerous ungulates in the park.&lt;ref name="pp Pleistocene Park" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp Reindeer" /&gt; To increase moose density in the park, special constructions were added to the fence in several places that allow animals outside the fenced area to enter the park, while not allowing them to leave. Besides that, wild moose calves were caught in other regions and transported to the park.&lt;ref name="pp Moose" /&gt;

In 2007 a 32-meter (105-foot) high tower was erected in the park that constantly monitors the levels of methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor in the park's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp pleistocene park 10" /&gt;

In September 2010 the [[muskox]] was reintroduced. Six male animals were imported from [[Wrangel Island]],&lt;ref name="pp materials diary-nikita-wrangel-2010" /&gt; two of which died in the first months.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp news 13" /&gt; Seven months later, in April 2011, six [[Altai wapiti]]s and five [[wisent]]s arrived at the park, the wapitis originating from the [[Altai mountains]] and the wisents from [[Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve]] near Moscow.&lt;ref name="pp news 6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="БезФормата.Ru 2011" /&gt; But the enclosing fence proved too low for the wapitis, and by the end of 2012 all six wapitis had jumped the fence and run off.&lt;ref name="Griswold-Tergis 2013: Pleistocene Park pt.2" /&gt;

;2011–2016
In the years 2011 to 2016 progress slowed down as most energy was put into the construction of a 150 [[Hectare|ha]] (370 [[Acre|ac]]) branch of Pleistocene Park near the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] in [[Tula Oblast]] in Europe,&lt;ref name="zoologist 78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp news 22" /&gt; see below ([[#Southern branch of Pleistocene Park: The Wild Field wilderness reserve|Wild Field]] section). A few more reindeer and moose were introduced into Pleistocene Park during this time,&lt;ref name="pp news 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp news 10" /&gt; and a monitoring system for measuring the [[energy balance (disambiguation)|energy balance]]&lt;!-- for reason why link leads to disambiguation page see following note (ref group=note name="energy balance") --&gt; (ratio of energy emission and energy absorption)&lt;ref group=note name="energy balance"&gt;Wikipedia has no good basic article or at least article section on the energy balance (ratio of energy emission and energy absorption) of land surfaces – what it is, what affects it, etc. Some information may be gleaned from the articles

;2017–
Attention has now been shifted back to the further development of Pleistocene Park. A successful [[crowdfunding]] effort in early 2017 provided funding for further animal acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adele Peters: … on the ферма. 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="David Addison: A steppe towards a new age. 2017" /&gt;  Later that year twelve domestic yak&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 13 June 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 24 June 2017" /&gt; and 30 domestic sheep&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 8 September 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pl.Park fcbk: 7 October 2017" /&gt; were brought to the park. The introduction of a herd of 12 plains bison is planned for May 2018,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PleistocenePark/posts/440201056399594|title=Pleistocene Park|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PleistocenePark/videos/vb.271986773221024/461247900961576/?type=3&amp;theater|title=Pleistocene Park|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of more muskoxen is planned for 2019.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PleistocenePark/posts/441396572946709|title=Pleistocene Park|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the near future the focus in animal introductions will generally be placed on browsers, not grazers, i.e., bison, muskoxen, moose and wapiti. Their role in this phase will be to diminish the amount of shrubs and trees and enlarge the grassy areas. Only when these areas have sufficiently increased will grazers like saiga and kiang be introduced.&lt;ref name="RIA Novosti" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zoologist 37" /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Controversial aspects ===
Critics admonish that introducing alien species could damage the fragile ecosystem of the existing tundra. To this criticism [[Sergey Zimov]] replied: "Tundra – that is not an ecosystem. Such systems had not existed on the planet [before the disappearance of the megafauna], and there is nothing to cherish in the tundra. Of course, it would be silly to create a desert instead of the tundra, but if the same site would evolve into a steppe, then it certainly would improve the environment. If deer, foxes, bovines were more abundant, nature would only benefit from this. And people too. However, the danger still exists, of course, you have to be very careful. If it is a revival of the steppes, then, for example, small animals are really dangerous to release without control. As for large herbivores – no danger, as they are very easy to remove again."&lt;ref name="Полiт.ру 2006: Siberian park ‘mammoth period'" /&gt;

Another point of concern is doubt that the majority of species can be introduced in such harsh conditions. For example, according to some critics, the Yakutian horses, although they have been living in the park for several generations, would not have survived without human intervention. They normally tolerate –60&amp;nbsp;°C, but are said to cope poorly with an abundance of snow and possibly would have died within the first snowy winter of starvation. However, horses of much less primitive stock abandoned by the Japanese Army have been living feral on some uninhabited Kuril Islands since 1945. Despite the deep snows (two to three times deeper than in Yakutia), they have successfully survived all the winters without feeding. And in Pleistocene Park, while some of the Yakutian horses accept supplementary feeding, others keep away and survive on their own.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2010: Russian Scientist Working To Recreate Ice Age Ecosystem" /&gt;

=== Positive reception ===
The Zimov’s concept of Pleistocene Park and repopulating the mammoth steppe is listed as one of the “100 most substantive solutions to global warming” by [[Project Drawdown]].&lt;ref name="Drawdown-mammoth steppe" /&gt;  The list, encompassing only technologically viable, existing solutions, was compiled by a team of over 200 scholars, scientists, policymakers, business leaders and activists;&lt;ref name="Book Passage-drawdown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drawdown" /&gt; for each solution the carbon impact through the year 2050, the total and net cost to society, and the total lifetime savings were measured and modelled.&lt;ref name="Drawdown-solutions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenBiz 2014" /&gt;

== Visitors ==
The park is a hub for international scientists and students, who come from around the world to conduct their own ecological research and experiments.&lt;ref name="OttawaLife 2013: The Zimovs" /&gt; The Polaris Project was a yearly visitor from 2009 to 2015, sending US-American students on excursions to the park each summer.&lt;ref name="Polaris Project: Blog" /&gt;

Another group of visitors are journalists. The park is steadily gaining more media attention and while most journalists do not come to the park itself the number of visitors is increasing. In 2016 for example, the park was visited by a filmmaker, two print media (Swiss ''[[24 heures (Switzerland)|24 Heures]]'' and American ''[[The Atlantic]]''), and two TV broadcasting companies (German ''[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]'' and American ''[[Vice on HBO|HBO]]'').&lt;ref name="pp news 24" /&gt;

The total of visitors for 2016 (summer months only) was 45.&lt;ref name="pp news 23" /&gt;

== Size and administration ==
Pleistocene Park is a 16&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; scientific [[nature reserve]] (''[[zakaznik]]'') consisting of [[Shrubland|willow brush]], [[Grassland#Tundra|grasslands]], [[Wetland|swamps]], [[forest]]s and a multitude of [[lake]]s.&lt;ref name="Zimov 2005: Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem.

Pleistocene Park is owned and administered by a non-profit corporation, the Pleistocene Park Association, consisting of the [[ecologist]]s from the [[Northeast Science Station (Russia)|Northeast Science Station]] in Chersky and the [[Grassland Institute]] in [[Yakutsk]].&lt;ref name="Re-Establishment FES" /&gt; The present park area was signed over to the association by the state and is exempt from land tax.&lt;ref name="Anna Stroganova: Bison for Siberia. 2018" /&gt; The reserve is surrounded by a 600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; buffer zone that will be added to the park by the regional government once the animals have successfully established themselves.&lt;ref name="Re-Establishment FES" /&gt;

In July 2015 the [http://pleistocenepark.org/ Pleistocene Park Foundation] was founded, a non-profit organization (registered in Pennsylvania, USA, with [[501(c)(3)]] status)&lt;ref name="PPF" /&gt; dedicated to acquiring private donations for funding Pleistocene Park.&lt;ref name="pp news 20" /&gt;  Hitherto Pleistocene Park had been financed solely through the funds of the founders, a practice that grew increasingly insufficient.&lt;ref name="pp news 20" /&gt;

== Animals ==

'''Animals already present in the park:'''

[[File:Лошади темная 3 малень wiki.jpg|thumb|[[Yakutian horse]]s]]
* [[Reindeer]] (''[[Rangifer tarandus]]''):&lt;ref name="pp Reindeer" /&gt; Present before the project started (although more are being brought to help simulate Pleistocene conditions). They mainly graze in the southern highlands of the park. This territory is not affected by spring flooding and dominated by larch forests and shrubland. Reindeer rarely visit the flood plain. Besides actively grazing (especially in winter) they browse on willow shrubs, [[tree moss]], and [[lichen]]s.

Despite their size, they proved to be dominant over the wisents, who often fled from them. Yakutian horses are purely grazing animals – they eat only [[Graminoid|grass species]], and visit the park's forests only during the spring flood. In the spring of 2015, ten more Yakutian horses were acquired to increase genetic diversity.&lt;ref name="Jake Kong 11 April 2015" /&gt; (Numbers in park in May 2018: approximately 30)&lt;ref name="Anna Stroganova: Bison for Siberia. 2018" /&gt;

A study on the distribution of these two species in the Urals, the Caucasus and Western Europe found that population replacements between steppe bison and wisent occurred regularly in correlation “with major palaeoenvironmental shifts”, with the wisent being “associated with colder, more tundra-like landscapes and absence of a warm summer” while the steppe bison dominated during the warmer [[interstadial]]s.  During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] the steppe bison disappeared from all of the area covered by the study, leaving only the wisent.&lt;ref name="Soubrier et al. 2016: Early cave art and ancient DNA" /&gt;}}  Their dietary needs are very different from the American bison.

[[File:Awesome PBL group.jpg|thumb|A PBL group at [[Sydney Dental Hospital]]]]
'''Problem-based learning''' ('''PBL''') is a [[Student-centred learning|student-centered]] [[pedagogy]] in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem found in trigger material. The PBL process does not focus on [[problem solving]] with a defined solution, but it allows for the development of other desirable skills and attributes. This includes knowledge acquisition, enhanced group collaboration and communication.  The PBL process was developed for medical education and has since been broadened in applications for other programs of learning. The process allows for learners to develop skills used for their future practice. It enhances critical appraisal, literature retrieval and encourages ongoing learning within a team environment.

The PBL tutorial process involves working in small groups of learners. Each student takes on a role within the group that may be formal or informal and the role often alternates. It is focused on the student's reflection and [[reasoning]] to construct their own learning. The Maastricht seven-jump process involves clarifying terms, defining problem(s), brainstorming, structuring and hypothesis, learning objectives, independent study and synthesis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In short, it is identifying what they already know, what they need to know, and how and where to access new information that may lead to the resolution of the problem. The role of the tutor is to facilitate learning by supporting, guiding, and monitoring the learning process.&lt;ref name=Schmidt_2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2011.04035.x |title=The process of problem-based learning: What works and why |year=2011 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Henk G |last2=Rotgans |first2=Jerome I |last3=Yew |first3=Elaine HJ |journal=Medical Education |volume=45 |issue=8 |pages=792–806 |pmid=21752076}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tutor aims to build students' confidence when addressing problems, while also expanding their understanding.  This process is based on constructivism. PBL represents a paradigm shift from traditional teaching and learning philosophy,&lt;ref name=Hung2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11423-011-9198-1 |title=Theory to reality: A few issues in implementing problem-based learning |year=2011 |last1=Hung |first1=Woei |journal=Educational Technology Research and Development |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=529–552}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is more often [[lecture]]-based. The constructs for teaching PBL are very different from traditional classroom or lecture teaching and often requires more preparation time and resources to support small group learning.

==Meaning==
Wood (2003) defines problem-based learning as a process that uses identified issues within a scenario to increase knowledge and understanding.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7384.328 | volume=326 | title=ABC of learning and teaching in medicine: Problem based learning | journal=BMJ | pages=328–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of this process are listed below: 
# Learner-driven self-identified goals and outcomes
# Students do independent, self-directed study before returning to larger group 
# Learning is done in small groups of 8–10 people, with a tutor to facilitate discussion 
# Trigger materials such as paper-based clinical scenarios, lab data, photographs, articles or videos or patients (real or simulated) can be used
# The Maastricht 7 jump process helps to guide the PBL tutorial process
# Based on principles of adult learning theory
# All members of the group have a role to play
# Allows for knowledge acquisition through combined work and intellect
# Enhances teamwork and communication, problem-solving and encourages independent responsibility for shared learning - all essential skills for future practice
# Anyone can do it as long it is right depending on the given causes and scenario
# We can be champions and holders of a vocational degree
# It depends upon the cases and the scenario the building of curriculum lesson

==History==
The PBL process was pioneered by [[Howard Barrows|Barrows]] and Tamblyn at the [[medical school]] program at  [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Barrows" /&gt; Traditional medical education disenchanted students, who perceived the vast amount of material presented in the first three years of medical school as having little relevance to the practice of medicine and clinically based medicine.&lt;ref name=Barrows&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/tl.37219966804 |title=Problem-based learning in medicine and beyond: A brief overview |year=1996 |last1=Barrows |first1=Howard S. |journal=New Directions for Teaching and Learning |volume=1996 |issue=68 |pages=3–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PBL curriculum was developed in order to stimulate learning by allowing students to see the relevance and application to future roles. It maintains a higher level of motivation towards learning, and shows the importance of responsible, professional attitudes with teamwork values.&lt;ref name=Barrows /&gt; The motivation for learning drives interest because it allows for selection of problems that have real-world application.

Problem-based learning has subsequently been adopted by other medical school programs&lt;ref name=Barrows /&gt; adapted for undergraduate instruction,&lt;ref name=ChallengeofPBL&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Boud |editor2-first=Grahame |editor2-last=Feletti |first1=Elizabeth G |last1=Armstrong |title=The challenge of problem-based learning |chapter=A Hybrid Model of Problem-based Learning |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-7494-2560-9 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvyBq6k6tWUC&amp;pg=PA137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duch|first=Barbara J.|title=The power of problem-based learning : a practical "how to" for teaching undergraduate courses in any discipline.|year=2001|publisher=Stylus Pub.|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=1579220371|edition=1st|author2=Groh, Susan |author3=Allen, Deborah E. }}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=José A.

==Advantages==
There are advantages of PBL. It is student-focused, which allows for [[active learning]] and better understanding and retention of knowledge. It also helps to develop life skills that are applicable to many domains.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7384.328 |title=ABC of learning and teaching in medicine |year=2003 |last1=Wood |first1=Diana |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=326 |pages=328–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to enhance content knowledge while simultaneously fostering the development of communication, [[problem-solving]], critical thinking, collaboration, and self-directed learning skills.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14703291003718901 |title=The problem‐based learning process as finding and being in flow |year=2010 |last1=Barrett |first1=Terry |journal=Innovations in Education and Teaching International |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=165–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5172/conu.2009.33.2.191 |title=Problem based learning (PBL): A conundrum |year=2009 |last1=Wells |first1=Samantha H |last2=Warelow |first2=Philip J |last3=Jackson |first3=Karen L |journal=Contemporary Nurse |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=191–201 |pmid=19929163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
PBL may position students to optimally function using real-world experiences. By harnessing collective [[collective intelligence|group intellect]], differing perspectives may offer different perceptions and solutions to a problem. Following are the advantages and limitations of problem-based learning.

=== Fosters student-centred learning ===

In problem-based learning the students are actively involved and they like this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antepohl|first1=W|last2=Herzig|first2=S.|date=1999|title=Problem-based learning versus lecture-based learning in a course of basic pharmacology: a controlled, randomized study|journal=Medical education|volume=33|pages=106–113|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.1999.00289.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It fosters active learning, and also retention and development of lifelong learning skills. It encourages self-directed learning by confronting students with problems and stimulates the development of deep learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=J.A.|last2=Jordan|first2=R.K.|date=1999|title=Learner-centred approach in medical education|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=318|pages=1280–1283|doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7193.1280|pmc=1115656|pmid=10231266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001221/122102Eo.pdf

=== Upholds lifelong learning ===

Problem-based learning gives emphasis to lifelong learning by developing in students the potential to determine their own goals, locate appropriate resources for learning and assume responsibility for what they need to know.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-direction for lifelong learning: A comprehensive guide to theory and practice.|last1=Candy|first1=P. C.|date=1991|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Candy PC. Self-direction for lifelong learning: a comprehensive guide to theory and practice. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1991.). It also greatly helps them better long term knowledge retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norman|first1=G.|last2=Schmidt|first2=H.|date=1992|title=The psychological basis of problem-based learning: A review of the evidence|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=67|pages=557–565|doi=10.1097/00001888-199209000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prominence on comprehension not facts ===

Problem-based learning focuses on engaging students in finding solutions to real life situations and pertinent contextualized problems. In this method discussion forums collaborative research take the place of lecturing.

=== In-depth learning and constructivist approach ===

PBL fosters deep learning by involving students with the interaction of learning materials. They relate the concept they study with everyday activities and enhance their knowledge and understanding. Students also activate their prior knowledge and build on existing conceptual knowledge frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood  F.|first1=Diana|date=8 February 2003|title=ABC of learning and teaching in medicine Problem based learning|url=http://cet.usc.edu/resources/teaching_learning/docs/Problembased.pdf|journal=BMJ|volume=326|pages=328–330|doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7384.328|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augments self-learning ===

Students themselves resolve the problems that are given to them, they take more interest and responsibility for their learning. They themselves will look for resources like research articles, journals, web materials etc. for their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=D.T.|last2=Blake|first2=R. L.|date=1993|title=Does problem-based learning work? A meta-analysis of evaluative research|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=68|pages=550–563|doi=10.1097/00001888-199307000-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it equips them with more proficiency in seeking resources in comparison to the students of traditional learning methods.

=== Better understanding and adeptness ===

By giving more significance to the meaning, applicability and relevance to the learning materials it leads to better understanding of the subjects learnt. When students are given more challenging and significant problems are given it makes them more proficient.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albanese|first1=MA|last2=Mitchell|first2=S.|date=1993|title=Problem-based learning: a review of literature on its outcomes and implementation issues|journal=Acad Med|volume=68|pages=52–81|doi=10.1097/00001888-199301000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real life contexts and problems makes their learning more profound, lasting and also enhance the transferability of skills and knowledge from the classroom to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallagher|first1=S. A.|last2=Stepien,|first2=W. J.|last3=Rosenthal|first3=H.|date=1992|title=The effects of problem-based learning on problem solving|journal=Gifted Child Quarterly|volume=36|pages=195–200|doi=10.1177/001698629203600405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is more scope for application of knowledge and skills the transferability is increased. It will be also very helpful to them not only to visualise what it will be like applying that knowledge and expertise on their field of work or profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridges|first1=E.M.|date=1992|title=Problem Based Learning for Administrators|journal=ERIC Clearinghouse on Educational Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinforces interpersonal skills and teamwork ===

Project based learning is more of teamwork and [[collaborative learning]]. The teams or groups resolve relevant problems in collaboration and hence it fosters student interaction, teamwork and reinforces interpersonal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon,|first1=D. T.|date=1995|title=Attitudes and opinions of faculty tutors about problem-based learning|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=70|pages=216–223|doi=10.1097/00001888-199503000-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt; like peer evaluation, working with group dynamic etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delafuente|first1=J. C.|last2=Munyer|first2=T. O|last3=Angaran|first3=D. M|last4=Doering|first4=P. L.|date=1994|title=A problem solving active learning course in pharmacotherapy|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume=58|pages=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also fosters in them the leadership qualities, learn to make decision by consensus and give constructive feed back to the team members etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tricia|first1=S.|last2=Moore|first2=R.D.H.|date=2007|title=Implementation of Problem-Based Learning in a Baccalaureate Dental Hygiene Program|journal=Journal of Dental Education|volume=71|pages=1058–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-motivated attitude ===

Researchers say that students like problem-based learning classes rather than the traditional classes. The increase in the percentage of attendance of students and their attitude towards this approach itself makes it very clear that they are self-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=D. T.|last2=Blake|first2=R. L.|date=1993|title=Does problem-based learning work? A meta-analysis of evaluative research|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=68|pages=550–563|doi=10.1097/00001888-199307000-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact it is more fascinating, stimulating and one of the good learning methods because it is more flexible and interesting to students.  They enjoy this environment of learning for it is less threatening and they can learn independently. All these aspects make students more self-motivated and they pursue learning even after they leave the school or college.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=D. T.|date=1995|title=Attitudes and opinions of faculty tutors about problem-based learning|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=70|pages=216–223|doi=10.1097/00001888-199503000-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enriches the teacher-student relationship ===

Since the students are self-motivated, good teamwork, self-directed learning etc. the teachers who have worked in both traditional and project based learning formats prefer project based learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; They also feel that problem-based learning is more nurturing,  significant curriculum and beneficial to the cognitive growth of the student.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

=== Higher level of learning ===

The PBL students score higher than the students in traditional courses because of their learning competencies, problem solving, self-assessment techniques, data gathering, behavioral science etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albanese ,|first1=MA|last2=Mitchell|first2=S.|date=1993|title=Problem-based learning: a review of literature on its outcomes and implementation issues|journal=Acad Med|volume=68|pages=52–81|doi=10.1097/00001888-199301000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because they are better at activating prior knowledge, and they learn in a context resembling their future context and elaborate more on the information presented which helps in better understanding and retention of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridges|first1=E. M.|last2=Hallinger|first2=P.|date=1991|title=Problem-based learning in medical and managerial education|journal=Paper presented for the Cognition and School Leadership Conference of the National Center for Educational Leadership and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, Nashville, TN.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medical education, PBL cases can incorporate dialogue between patients and physicians, demonstrate the narrative character of the medical encounter, and examine the political economic contributors to disease production. PBL can serve as a platform for a discursive practices approach to culture that emphasizes the emergent, participant-constructed qualities of social phenomena while also acknowledging large-scale social forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamada|first=Seiji|last2=Maskarinec|first2=Gregory|date=|title=Strengthening PBL Through a Discursive Practices Approach to Case-Writing|url=http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/13576280310001656150&amp;magic=crossref%7C%7CD404A21C5BB053405B1A640AFFD44AE3|journal=Education for Health: Change in Learning &amp; Practice|volume=17|issue=1|pages=85–92|doi=10.1080/13576280310001656150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
According to Wood (2003), the major disadvantage to this process involves the utilization of resources and tutor facilitation. It requires more staff to take an active role in facilitation and group-led discussion and some educators find PBL facilitation difficult and frustrating. It is resource-intensive because it requires more physical space and more accessible computer resources to accommodate simultaneous smaller group-learning.&lt;ref name="Wood_2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Diana.|year=2003|title=ABC of learning and teaching in medicine: Problem based learning|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=326|pages=328–330|doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7384.328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students also report uncertainty with information overload and are unable to determine how much study is required and the relevance of information available. Students may not have access to teachers who serve as the inspirational role models that traditional curriculum offers.&lt;ref name="Wood_2003"/&gt;

=== Time-consuming ===

Although students generally like and gain greater ability to solve real-life problems in problem-based learning courses, instructors of the methodology must often invest more time to assess student learning and prepare course materials, as compared to LBL instructors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Part of this frustration also stems from the amount of time dedicated to presenting new research and individual student findings regarding each specific topic, as well as the disorganised nature of brain-storming&lt;ref name="Gillian W 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clough|first1=Joanne|last2=Shorter|first2=Gillian W.|title=Evaluating the effectiveness of problem-based learning as a method of engaging year one law students|journal=The Law Teacher|date=2015|volume=49|issue=3|pages=277–302|doi=10.1080/03069400.2015.1011926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional assumptions of the students ===

The problem of the problem-based learning is the traditional assumptions of the students. Most of the students might have spent their previous years of education assuming their teacher as the main disseminator of knowledge. Because of this understanding towards the subject matter students may lack the ability to simply wonder about something in the initial years of problem-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reithlingshoefer|first1=S. J.|date=1992|journal=The future of Nontraditional/Interdisciplinary Programs: Margin or mainstream? Selected Papers from the Tenth Annual Conference on Nontraditional and Interdisciplinary Programs, Virginia Beach, VA, 1-763.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of the instructor ===

The instructors have to change their traditional teaching methodologies in order to incorporate problem-based learning. Their task is to question students' knowledge, beliefs, give only hints to correct their mistakes and guide the students in their research. All these features of problem-based learning may be foreign to some instructors; hence they find it difficult to alter their past habits.

=== Pupil's evaluation ===

The instructors have to adapt new assessment methods to evaluate the pupils' achievement.  They have to incorporate written examinations with modified essay questions, practical examinations, peer and self assessments etc. Problem-based has also been considered more favourable to female participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McParland|first1=Monica|last2=Noble|first2=Lorraine M.|last3=Livingston|first3=Gill|title=The effectiveness of problem-based learning compared to traditional teaching in undergraduate psychiatry|journal=Medical Education|date=2004|volume=38|pages=859–867|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2929.2004.01818.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst having equivocal impacts on their male counterparts when compared to lecture based learning.&lt;ref name="Gillian W 2015"/&gt;

===Cognitive load===
Sweller and others published a series of studies over the past twenty years that is relevant to problem-based learning, concerning [[cognitive load]] and what they describe as the guidance-fading effect.&lt;ref name="Sweller_2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweller|first1=John|year=2006|title=The worked example effect and human cognition|journal=Learning and Instruction|volume=16|issue=2|pages=165–169|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2006.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweller et al. conducted several classroom-based studies with students studying algebra problems.&lt;ref name="Sweller_1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweller|first1=J|year=1988|title=Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=12|issue=2|pages=257–285|doi=10.1016/0364-0213(88)90023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have shown that active problem solving early in the learning process is a less effective instructional strategy than studying [[Worked-example effect|worked examples]] (Sweller and Cooper, 1985; Cooper and Sweller, 1987). Certainly active problem solving is useful as learners become more competent, and better able to deal with their working memory limitations. But early in the learning process, learners may find it difficult to process a large amount of information in a short time. Thus the rigors of active problem solving may become an issue for novices.  Once learners gain expertise the [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]] inherent in problem-based learning helps learners avoid these issues.  These studies were conducted largely based on individual problem solving of well-defined problems.

Sweller (1988) proposed [[cognitive load]] theory to explain how novices react to problem solving during the early stages of learning.&lt;ref name=Sweller_1988 /&gt; Sweller, et al. suggests a worked example early, and then a gradual introduction of problems to be solved. They propose other forms of learning early in the learning process (worked example, goal free problems, etc.); to later be replaced by completions problems, with the eventual goal of solving problems on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweller|first1=John|last2=Van Merrienboer|first2=Jeroen J. G.|last3=Paas|first3=Fred G. W. C.|year=1998|title=Cognitive Architecture and Instructional Design|journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]]|volume=10|issue=3|pages=251–296|doi=10.1023/A:1022193728205}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem-based learning becomes very useful later in the learning process.

Many forms of scaffolding have been implemented in problem-based learning to reduce the cognitive load of learners. These are most useful to enable decreasing ("fading") the amount of guidance during problem solving. A gradual fading of guidance helps learners to slowly transit from studying examples to solving problems.  In this case backwards fading{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=The Hmelo-Silver reference is hidden behind a paywall, so checking the reference to decipher "backwards fading" is forbidden to most Wikipedia readers.}} was found to be quite effective and assisting in decreasing the cognitive load on learners.&lt;ref name="Hmelo2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hmelo-Silver|first1=Cindy E.|year=2004|title=Problem-Based Learning: What and How Do Students Learn?|journal=Educational Psychology Review|volume=16|issue=3|pages=235–266|doi=10.1023/B:EDPR.0000034022.16470.f3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluation of the effects of PBL learning in comparison to traditional instructional learning have proved to be a challenge.  Various factors can influence the implementation of PBL: extent of PBL incorporation into curriculum, group dynamics, nature of problems used, facilitator influence on group, and the motivation of the learners.  There are also various outcomes of PBL that can be measured including knowledge acquisition and clinical competence.&lt;ref name="Neville_PBLmedicaledu40yrs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neville|first1=Alan J.|year=2009|title=Problem-Based Learning and Medical Education Forty Years on|journal=Medical Principles and Practice|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1159/000163038|pmid=19060483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hac-uARBrdgC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Factors+affecting+small-group+tutorial+learning:+a+review+of+research.+|title=Problem-based learning : a research perspective on learning interactions|last=Schmidt|first=H.

===Demands of implementing===

Implementing PBL in schools and Universities is a demanding process that requires resources, a lot of planning and organization.&lt;ref name="Azer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azer|first1=Samy A.|year=2011|title=Introducing a problem-based learning program: 12 tips for success|journal=Medical Teacher|volume=33|issue=10|pages=808–13|doi=10.3109/0142159X.2011.558137|pmid=21942480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructivism==
Problem-based learning addresses the need to promote lifelong learning through the process of inquiry and [[constructivist learning]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt_2011" /&gt; PBL is considered a constructivist approach to instruction because it emphasizes collaborative and self-directed learning while being supported by tutor facilitation.&lt;ref name="Schmidt_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00461520701263350 |title=Problem-Based LearningisCompatible with Human Cognitive Architecture: Commentary on Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) |year=2007 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Henk G. |last2=Loyens |first2=Sofie M.

J. |last2=Schmidt |first2=Henk G. |journal=Instructional Science |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=371–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt, and Hung elaborate on the cognitive constructivist process of PBL:&lt;ref name="Schmidt_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hung2011" /&gt;
#Learners are presented with a problem and through discussion within their group, activate their prior knowledge.
#Within their group, they develop possible theories or hypotheses to explain the problem. Together they identify learning issues to be researched. They construct a shared primary model to explain the problem at hand. Facilitators provide [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], which is a framework on which students can construct knowledge relating to the problem.
#After the initial teamwork, students work independently in self-directed study to research the identified issues.
#The students re-group to discuss their findings and refine their initial explanations based on what they learned.

[[File:PBL group at Gadjah Mada University.jpg|thumb|A PBL group at [[Gadjah Mada University]]]] PBL follows a constructivist perspective in learning as the role of the instructor is to guide and challenge the learning process rather than strictly providing knowledge.&lt;ref name="HmeloSilver_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7771/1541-5015.1004 |title=Goals and Strategies of a Problem-based Learning Facilitator |year=2006 |last1=Hmelo-Silver |first1=Cindy E. |last2=Barrows |first2=Howard S. |journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-based Learning |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2929.2005.02205.x |title=Problem-based learning: Future challenges for educational practice and research |year=2005 |last1=Dolmans |first1=Diana H J M |last2=De Grave |first2=Willem |last3=Wolfhagen |first3=Ineke H A P |last4=Van Der Vleuten |first4=Cees P M |journal=Medical Education |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=732–41 |pmid=15960794}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, feedback and reflection on the learning process and group dynamics are essential components of PBL. Students are considered to be active agents who engage in social knowledge construction. PBL assists in processes of creating meaning and building personal interpretations of the world based on experiences and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hmelo |first1=C.E. |last2=Evensen |first2=D.H. |year=2000 |chapter=Problem-based learning:  Gaining insights on learning interactions through multiple methods of inquiry |editor1-first=Dorothy H. |editor1-last=Evensen |editor2-first=Cindy E. |editor2-last=Hmelo |editor3-first=Cindy E. |editor3-last=Hmelo-Silver |title=Problem-Based Learning: A Research perspective on learning interactions |pages=1–18 |isbn=978-0-8058-2644-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBL assists to guide the student from theory to practice during their journey through solving the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/87567550009595813 |title=Preparing Problem Solvers for the 21st Century through Problem-Based Learning |year=2000 |last1=Edens |first1=Kellah M. |journal=College Teaching |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=55–60 |jstor=27558988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting evidence==
Several studies support the success of the constructivist problem-based and inquiry learning methods.&lt;ref name="Hmelo_Response" /&gt; One example is a study on a project called GenScope, an [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based]] science software application, which found that students using the GenScope software showed significant gains over the control groups, with the largest gains shown in students from basic courses.&lt;ref name="Hmelo_Response"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00461520701263368 |title=Scaffolding and Achievement in Problem-Based and Inquiry Learning: A Response to Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark (2006) |year=2007 |last1=Hmelo-Silver |first1=Cindy E. |last2=Duncan |first2=Ravit Golan |last3=Chinn |first3=Clark A. |journal=Educational Psychologist |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=99–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One large study tracked middle school students' performance on high-stakes standardized tests to evaluate the effectiveness of inquiry-based science.&lt;ref name="Hmelo_Response" /&gt; The study found a 14 percent improvement for the first cohort of students and a 13 percent improvement for the second cohort.&lt;ref name="Hmelo_Response" /&gt; The study also found that inquiry-based teaching methods greatly reduced the achievement gap for African-American students.&lt;ref name="Hmelo_Response" /&gt;

A systematic review of the effects of problem-based learning in medical school on the performance of doctors after graduation showed clear positive effects on [[physician]] competence. This effect was especially strong for social and cognitive competencies such as coping with uncertainty and communication skills.&lt;ref name="Koh"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.070565 |title=The effects of problem-based learning during medical school on physician competency: A systematic review |year=2008 |last1=Koh |first1=G.

Another study from [[Slovenia]] looked at whether students who learn with PBL are better at solving problems and if their attitudes towards mathematics were improved compared to their peers in a more traditional curriculum.  The study found that students who were exposed to PBL were better at solving more difficult problems; however, there was no significant difference in student attitude towards mathematics.&lt;ref name="Cotic_PBLandMath" /&gt;

==Examples in curricula==

===Malaysia and Singapore===
In [[Malaysia]], an attempt was made to introduce a problem-based learning model in secondary mathematics, with the aim of educating citizens to prepare them for decision-making in sustainable and responsible development.  This model called [https://pbl4c.wordpress.com/ Problem-Based Learning the Four Core Areas (PBL4C)] first sprouted in [[SEAMEO RECSAM]] in 2008, and as a result of training courses conducted, a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teoh|first=B.T.|author2=Preechaporn, W. |author3=Leong, C.

This model was introduced to the field of education management, Education for International and Intranational Understanding (EIU), and human resource management, among educators from countries, in and beyond Malaysia, affiliated with SEAMEO RECSAM. Several Malaysian universities had begun implementing PBL in their curricula in an effort to improve the quality of their education. In collaboration with [[Aalborg University]] of Denmark, PBL was introduced at [[University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia]] (UTHM). Since then the PBL was widely used among engineering and as well as humanities lecturers at UTHM{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--
 (Berhannudin, 2007) - This suggests plagiarism rather than a source. --&gt;. In [[Universiti Malaya]], the [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] and [[Bachelor of Dental Surgery]] courses included several sessions of problem-based learning in their curriculum as a way of teaching interactions between students.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In [[Singapore]], the most notable example of adopting PBL pedagogy in curriculum is [[Republic Polytechnic]], the first polytechnic in Singapore to fully adopt PBL across all diploma courses.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Medical schools===
Several medical schools have incorporated problem-based learning into their curricula following the lead of [[McMaster University Medical School]], using real patient cases to teach students how to think like a clinician. More than eighty percent of medical schools in the United States now have some form of problem-based learning in their programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/55419.php |title=Problem-Based Learning Curriculum A Success For Medical School |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research of 10 years of data from the [[University of Missouri School of Medicine]] indicates that PBL has a positive effect on the students' competency as physicians after graduation.&lt;ref name="Koh" /&gt;

[[Monash University]] was the second institution to adopt PBL within a medical school environment and continues to apply this within the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences for the Bachelor of Medicine / Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) programs delivered in Australia and Malaysia.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

[[Maastricht University]] offers its whole program in PBL format only, as does St. George's University of London, another pioneer in the PBL format. The [[University of Limerick]] graduate entry medical school in Ireland followed by adapting the SGUL program as well as other programs to also provide its program in PBL format only.
In 1983 the college of medicine and medical sciences was founded in Bahrain as part of the Arabian Gulf University. It adopts a problem-based learning curriculum from the beginning and offers its MD program in PBL only.
In 1998, [[Western University of Health Sciences]] opened its [[Western University College of Veterinary Medicine|College of Veterinary Medicine]], with curriculum based completely on PBL.&lt;ref name="VetMed_Western"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18723806 |year=2008 |last1=Schmidt |first1=PL |last2=Trevejo |first2=RT |last3=Tkalcic |first3=S |title=Veterinary public health in a problem-based learning curriculum at the Western University of Health Sciences |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=212–8 |doi=10.3138/jvme.35.2.212 |journal=[[Journal of Veterinary Medical Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[UC Berkeley – UCSF Joint Medical Program]] (JMP), an accredited five year Master of Science/Medical Doctorate Program housed at [[University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health]], began offering a 100% case based curriculum to their students in their pre-clerkship years.
The curriculum integrates the basic and preclinical sciences while fostering an understanding of the biological, social, and moral contexts of human health and disease. The students spend their last two clerkship years at [[University of California, San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sph.berkeley.edu/jmp|title=UC Berkeley School of Public Health |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry (South West England), set up its medical BMBS course based around PBL in 2002. Peninsula offered a fully integrated course that prepared students for life as a doctor, with early exposure to clinical experiences and opportunities to discuss them through their PBL and small-group programme. In 2010 PCMD was divided to create [https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/peninsula-school-of-medicine Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry] and Exeter Medical School. The PBL courses of each school continues to develop and now uses an 8 step process, which is an evolution of the Maastricht 7 jump process.

[[Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine]] (LECOM) offers a PBL pathway at the main campus in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Pennsylvania]]. In 2004, LECOM founded a branch campus in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], [[Florida]], using an entirely PBL format.  A satellite campus in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]], [[Pennsylvania]] is also exclusively PBL.

In 2002, [[Gadjah Mada University]] of [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]] began offering an International Medicine program based on problem-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medialux.com.my/nugrahan/partnersgadjah.html |title=Nugrahan - Our Partners - Gadjah Mada |publisher=Medialux.com.my |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gazeira University in Sudan was the first in the country to adopt PBL in its medical college, a trend that was followed by some of the newer medical colleges. In 2008 the famous Faculty of Medicine of the University of Khartoum, which was following a traditional curriculum since its foundation in 1924 made a being change in curriculum structure by adopting a blend curriculum that incorporate problem solving learning strategies.

In 2008 [http://www.ju.edu.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx Aljouf University] of [[Sakakah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Alfaisal University]] [Riyadh], [Saudi Arabia]and [[Sulaiman Al Rajhi Colleges]][Qassim],[Saudi Arabia]  started using PBL for all of their medical programmes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ju.edu.sa/encolleges/medicine/Documents/College%20of%20Medicine%20_Study%20plan.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deakin University School of Medicine]], which opened in [[Waurn Ponds, Victoria]] in 2008 uses the PBL format as part of its Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Vision Science/Master of Optometry courses.

In 2009, [[Libyan International Medical University]] of [[Benghazi]], [[Libya]] started using PBL for all of its medical programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://limu.edu.ly/newlimu/PBL%20guide%20En.pdf |title=Problem-based learning at the Libyan International Medical University |publisher=limu.edu.ly |date=2009 |accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High schools===
In 2008, [[Parramatta Marist High School]], a secondary Catholic school in Australia, employed the methods of PBL in their teaching for year 9 and 10 boys. The learning system was a great success and since has been expanded to lower grades to challenge students to think outside of the box and relate content drive courses to problems in the real world.

[[North Lawndale College Prep High School]] (NLCP), on Chicago's west side, continues to refine its very high expectations [http://www.nlcphs.org/interdisciplinaryprojects/ Interdisciplinary Projects, or I-Projects]. As they progress freshman through senior year, these vertically aligned projects involve increasingly rigorous [[Common Core|Common Core State Standards]] in research, close reading, quantitative reasoning, argumentation, writing, and presentation skills. Each NLCP Junior and Senior Project derives itself from the student's own driving question (examples of driving questions include "How can genocide be stopped globally?" and "Does making obesity a disease help or harm obese people?"). Additionally and starting in 2014, all NLCP Senior Project Presentations will include the senior's creation of an artistic element that somehow expresses his/her argument, e.g., a documentary film, a website, a business proposal, a literary portfolio, a visual art portfolio, a unique oratory, or performative debate. [http://www.noodletools.com/ Noodletools], "a powerful, integrated platform for research and literacy", is the assistive technology for North Lawndale's endeavor.

[[Sir John Deane's College]], a sixth form college in England, in 2013 offered an extracurricular PBL Course in Medicine positioned towards students studying A-Level Biology and Chemistry who are aspiring to medicine, dentistry, veterinary science degrees or biological sciences at Oxford or Cambridge. The course (developed by Dr. Vimalan Jesudason) successfully served 85 students, before being offered independently in late 2014, [http://pblcourse.co.uk/ PBL Cheshire].

In Canada, [[North Peace Secondary School#Energetic Learning Campus|North Peace Secondary School's Energetic Learning Campus (ELC)]] is based on this philosophy. It takes grade 10 and 11 students, and work through the core courses based on the Prescribed Learning Outcomes for the province of British Columbia. The ELC is a sub-campus of the secondary school and is located inside the Pomeroy Sports Centre. Students are guided through English, Math, Sciences, and Social Studies, along with physical activity.

===Ecological economics===
The transdisciplinary field of [[ecological economics]] has embraced problem-based learning as a core pedagogy. A workbook developed by Joshua Farley, [[Jon David Erickson|Jon Erickson]], and [[Herman Daly]] organizes the problem-solving process into (1) building the problem base, (2) analyzing the problem, (3) synthesizing the findings, and (4) communicating the results. Building the problem base includes choosing, defining, and structuring an ecological economic problem.  Analysis is breaking down of a problem into understandable components.  Synthesis is the re-integration of the parts in a way that helps better understand the whole.  Communication is the translation of results into a form relevant to stakeholders, broadly defined as the extended peer community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farley|first=Joshua|last2=Erickson|first2=Jon D.|last3=Daly|first3=Herman|title=Ecological Economics: a Workbook for Problem-Based Learning|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|url=http://islandpress.org/ip/books/book/islandpress/E/bo3560882.html|authorlink2=Jon David Erickson|authorlink3=Herman Daly}}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other outcomes==
One of the aims of PBL is the development of self-directed learning (SDL) skills. In Loyens, Magda &amp; Rikers' discussion, SDL is defined as "a process in which individuals take the initiative...in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating goals, identifying human and material resources, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10648-008-9082-7 |title=Self-Directed Learning in Problem-Based Learning and its Relationships with Self-Regulated Learning |year=2008 |last1=Loyens |first1=Sofie M. M. |last2=Magda |first2=Joshua |last3=Rikers |first3=Remy M. J.

In Severiens and Schmidt's study of 305 first year college students, they found that PBL and its focus on SDL led to motivation for students to maintain study pace, led to social and academic integration, encouraged development of cognitive skills, and fostered more study progress than students in a conventional learning setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10734-008-9181-x |title=Academic and social integration and study progress in problem based learning |year=2008 |last1=Severiens |first1=Sabine E. |last2=Schmidt |first2=Henk G. |journal=Higher Education |volume=58 |pages=59–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PBL encourages learners to take a place in the academic world through inquiring and discovery that is central to problem-based learning.

PBL is also argued as a learning method that can promote the development of critical thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.01.008 |title=Effects of an online problem based learning course on content knowledge acquisition and critical thinking skills |year=2009 |last1=Şendağ |first1=Serkan |last2=Ferhan Odabaşı |first2=H. |journal=Computers &amp; Education |volume=53 |pages=132–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In PBL learning, students learn how to analyze a problem, identify relevant facts and generate hypotheses, identify necessary information/knowledge for solving the problem and make reasonable judgments about solving the problem.

Employers have appreciated the positive attributes of communication, teamwork, respect and collaboration that PBL experienced students have developed.  These skills provide for better future skills preparation in the ever-changing information explosion.  PBL curriculum includes building these attributes through knowledge building, written and interpersonal interactions and through the experience of the problem solving process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14703290802377190 |title=Overcoming problems in problem‐based learning: A trial of strategies in an undergraduate unit |year=2008 |last1=Vardi |first1=Iris |last2=Ciccarelli |first2=Marina |journal=Innovations in Education and Teaching International |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=345–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer-supported collaborative learning ==
Comparing face-to-face setting with strict online PBL, the group activities play the key role in the success of the social interaction in PBL. Online PBL is also seen as more cost-effective.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"NMC Horizon Report 2017 Higher Education Edition". (n.d.). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2017-nmc-horizon-report-he-EN.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative PBL has been shown to improve critical thinking scores as compared with individual PBL, and increased students’ achievement levels and retention scores.&lt;ref&gt;Şendağ, S., &amp; Ferhan Odabaşı, H. (2009). Effects of an online problem-based learning course on content knowledge acquisition and critical thinking skills. Computers &amp; Education, 53(1), 132–&lt;/ref&gt;

For the instructors, instructional design principles for the instructors regarding the design and development of online PBL must include collaborative characteristics. For example, the scheduling must be conducive to collaborative activities. Additionally, instructors should ensure that the problems should be relevant to real-life experiences, and the nature of solutions and problem contexts. Furthermore, a sound technological infrastructure is paramount.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== History of online PBL ===
The establishment and application of PBL in teaching and training started as early as in the 1960s. As instructional technology developed over time coupled with the emergence of the internet in the mid-1990s, online education became popular gaining huge attention from organizations and institutions. However, the use of PBL in complete online education does not seem as established based on the relatively scarce references available in the literature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brodie, L. (n.d.). "Problem Based Learning In The Online Environment – Successfully Using Student Diversity and e-Education." &lt;nowiki&gt;https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11036091.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) was one of the first few faculties that utilized a learning management system (LMS) to facilitate collaboration and group problem-solving. The result showed the significant impact of online PBL on the learning outcomes of students in many aspects including enhancing their communication skills, problem-solving skills and ability to work as a team.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most successful feature of the LMS in terms of user rate was the discussion boards where asynchronous communications took place. Technology has advanced for another decade since then and it should help us take online PBL to a greater height as many more activities such as synchronous online meetings have been made readily available today on numerous platforms. The key focus here is to examine how technology can further facilitate the effective use of PBL online by zooming into the learner needs in each phase of PBL.

===Tools===
==== Collaborative tools ====
The first, and possibly most crucial phase in PBL, is to identify the problem. Before learners can begin to solve a problem, all members must understand and agree on the details of the problem. This consensus forms through collaboration and discussion. With online learning on the rise, it is important that learners can engage in collaborative brainstorming and research through the use of technology. Technology allows for groups to collaborate synchronously or asynchronously from anywhere in the world; schedules and geography no longer prevent collaboration in PBL. Today, there is a plethora of tools available to promote group collaboration online, each with unique strengths and limitations. Learning management systems and cloud-based solutions are the two most popular and accessible technological solution for online collaboration. Learning management systems, such as [[Instructure|Canvas]], [[Edmodo]], [[Moodle]], [[Schoology]], and [[itslearning]], provide schools and classrooms collaborative tools to support synchronous and asynchronous communication and learning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Digital Tools for Problem-Based Learning" EDTECHNEXT: Emerging technology for K-12 education. Winter 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; These learning management systems (LMS) allow for supervision and support by the course administrator or professor. One limitation of these systems is their availability; most LMS are restricted by course enrollment. Students must be enrolled in a particular course or subscribe to a specific class to gain access to the tools and content stored in the system. Cloud-based solutions on the other hand, such as Google Apps, OneNote, and the Office 365 suit offer collaborative tools outside the traditional education setting. Educators of all kinds (K-12 schools, colleges, and universities, vocational training, HR training teams, etc.) can access these cloud-based solutions and collaborate with anyone around the world by simply sharing a link.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These tools range in availability from free with an email account to subscription costs based on the suit purchased. In addition to potential financial limitations, these cloud-based systems are always as secure or private as an LMS that requires course enrollment. Both LMS and cloud-based solutions present learners with opportunities to collaborate in a variety of ways while brainstorming the meaning of the problem and developing a plan for research and future collaboration.

==== Research tools ====
Once the problem has been identified, learners move into the second step of PBL: the information gathering phase. In this phase, learners research the problem by gathering background information and researching potential solutions. This information is shared with the learning team and used to generate potential solutions, each with supporting evidence.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;"Steps to a Problem-Based Learning Approach." (n.d.). Center for Teaching. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://teach.its.uiowa.edu/sites/teach.its.uiowa.edu/files/docs/docs/Steps_of_PBL_ed.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular online tool for gathering information today is Google, but there are many other search-engines available online. Free search engines, such as [[Google Search|Google]], [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo]], or [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], offer access to seemingly countless links to information. While these research tools provide ample sources of potential information, the quantity can be overwhelming. It also becomes difficult to identify quality sources without adding filters and higher-level search strategies when using these broad search-engines. Libraries are a more selective option and often offer online-databases, but typically require an account or subscription for online access to articles and books. [[Wolframalpha.com]] is a smart search-engine with both free and subscription level access options. Wolfram claims to be more than a platform for searching the web, rather, "getting knowledge and answers... by doing dynamic computations based on a vast collection of built-in data, algorithms, and methods." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/ "Wolfram|Alpha: Computational Knowledge Engine"]. ''www.wolframalpha.com''. Retrieved 2017-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Presentation tools ====
The third most important phase of PBL is resolving the problem, the critical task is presenting and defending your solution to the given problem.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, J. (4 November 2016). "Google Slides". &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.pcmag.com/review/349166/google-slides&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Students need to be able to state the problem clearly, describe the process of problem-solving considering different options to overcome difficulties, support the solution using relevant information and data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;"Problem-based learning". (n.d.). Study Guides and Strategies. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.studygs.net/pbl.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to communicate and present the solution clearly is the key to the success of this phase as it directly affects the learning outcomes. With the help of technology, presentation has been made much easier and more effective as it can incorporate visual aids of charts, pictures, videos, animations, simulations etc. Ideas and connections between ideas can be clearly demonstrated using different tools. Microsoft PowerPoint 2016, Apple Keynote, Prezi, and Google Slides are among the top-rated presentation applications of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, J. (14 February 2017). "The Best Presentation Software of 2017". &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/351652/the-best-presentation-software&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Retrieved 8 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

These popular presentation tools have their distinctive features and advantages over one another and can be summarized into three broad types. The first type has almost everything a presenter needs, ranging from tables, charts, picture tools, animations, video tools, add in functions and so forth. Such tools can replace many authoring tools as more complicated functions such as creating simulations, drag and drop etc. are all made possible. Hence, the presentation can be made highly interactive, engaging and compatible with most devices. The best examples are Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote.&lt;ref&gt;Read, G. (19 April 2016). "Pros and Cons of PowerPoint, Keynote, and Prezi". &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.ethos3.com/2016/04/pros-and-cons-of-powerpoint-keynote-and-prezi/&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one drawback is that such tools often come at a subscription charge and need to be installed locally on devices. Both PowerPoint and Keynote point more towards the standard form of slide by slide presentations. Prezi represents the second major type of tools with a storytelling style and less traditional or structured form of presentation that allows one to zoom in and out of any part of the screen. These tools are generally web-based and have collaborative functions of value-add for the PBL process. Nevertheless, this type of tools also charge subscription fees based on privilege levels. The third broad type of tools would be the web-based ones free of charge with less fanciful effects, allowing access to presentations collaboratively online anytime. Google Slides is such an option which is easy to use.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Though it has less functions, it offers the convenience of being available anytime anywhere on any online device. This type can be effective when students have limited time to prepare for their presentations as it removes many technical difficulties such as arranging for face-to-face meetings, installing the presentation tool or the time needed to learn to create the presentation. Students can spend more time on meaningful discussions about their problem and solution instead of the presentation itself.

== P&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;BL approach ==

P&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;BL stands for '''P'''eople, '''P'''roblem, '''P'''rocess, '''P'''roduct and '''P'''roject '''B'''ased '''L'''earning.

The '''P&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;BL approach''' was a learning strategy introduced in [[Stanford School of Engineering]] in their P&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;BL laboratory in 1993 as an initiative to offer their graduate students from the engineering, architecture and construction disciplines to implement their skills in a "cross-disciplinary, collaborative and geographically distributed teamwork experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fruchter|first1=Renate|last2=Lewis|first2=Sarah|title=Mentoring and Reverse Mentoring in P5BL|journal=International Journal of Engineering Education (IJEE)|date=2003|volume=19|issue=5|page=663|url=http://www.ijee.ie/articles/Vol19-5/IJEE1438.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, which was pioneered by Stanford Professor Fruchter, an environment across six universities from Europe, the United States and Japan along with a toolkit to capture and share project knowledge was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Melzner|first1=Jürgen|last2=Merz|first2=Kathrin|last3=Holliger|first3=Christoph|last4=Bargstädt|first4=Hans-Joachim|title=TEACHING CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MANAGEMENT WITHIN AN INTERNATIONAL AND TRANS-DISCIPLINARY LEARNING PLATFORM|url=http://itc.scix.net/data/works/att/w78-2013-paper-126.pdf|website=ITC Digital Library|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students (people) from the three disciplines were assigned a team project that works on solving a problem and delivering an end-product to a client.

The main stress of this approach is to have an inter-disciplinary integrated development of deliverables, in order to improve the overall competency and skills of the students. P&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;BL mentoring is a structured activity that involves [[situated learning]] and [[constructivist learning]] strategies to foster the culture of practice that would extend beyond the university campus to real life. P&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;BL is all about encouraging teaching and learning teamwork in the information age, by facilitating team interaction with professors, industry mentors and owners who provide necessary guidance and support for the learning activity.

Key advantages of this method are that it familiarizes students with real world problems and improves their confidence in solving these. It also improves their networking skills, thereby establishing rapport with key persons of the industry. They also learn the value of teamwork. The method also creates in them an appreciation of interdisciplinary approach.

The approach however needs due consideration of the mentoring provided to the students. Appropriate scaffolding should be done by the mentors to ensure that students are successful in attaining their project goals to solve the problem. Communication between the team should also be open and constructive in nature for achieving the necessary milestones.

A '''shared universe''' or '''shared world''' is a set of creative works where more than one writer (or other artist) independently contributes a work that can stand alone but fits into the joint development of the storyline, characters, or world of the overall project. It is common in genres like [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name="Nielsen1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|title=Multimedia and Hypertext: The Internet and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|accessdate=5 August 2015|year=1995|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-518408-3|pages=120–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324122455/https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZXCCfP0rQC&amp;pg=PA120|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from [[collaborative writing]] where multiple artists are working together on the same work and from [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] where the works and characters are independent except for a single meeting.

The term ''shared universe'' is also used within comics to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

A specific kind of shared universe that is published across a variety of media (e.g. novels, films, role-playing games, etc.), each of them contributing to the growth, history, and status of the setting is called an "imaginary entertainment environment."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel.

The term has also been used in a wider, non-literary sense to convey [[interdisciplinary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Contingencies of Professional Differentiation |author=Smith, Harvey L. |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |date=Jan 1958 |volume=63 |issue=4 |page=410 |doi=10.1086/222264}}&lt;/ref&gt; or social commonality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Repetition in Conversation: Toward a Poetics of Talk |author=Tannen, Deborah |year=1987 |journal=Language |issue=63 |volume=63 |pages=574–605 |doi=10.2307/415006 |jstor=415006 |publisher=Language, Vol. 63, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; often in the context of a "shared universe of discourse".&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Blumenthal|first=David R.|title=Facing the Abusing God: A Theology of Protest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNKpfyAOH0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=5 August 2015|year=1993|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25464-3|pages=34–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324122455/https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNKpfyAOH0C&amp;pg=PA34|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}

== Definitions ==
Fiction in some [[Mass media|media]], such as most [[television programs]] and many [[comic book]] titles, is understood{{By whom|date=December 2017}} to require the contribution of multiple authors and does not by itself create a shared universe and is considered a collaborative art form. Incidental appearances, such as that of [[d'Artagnan]] in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', are considered literary [[cameo appearance]]s. More substantial interaction between characters from different sources is often marketed as a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. While crossovers occur in a shared universe, not all crossovers are intended to merge their settings' [[back-stories]] and are instead used for marketing, parody, or to explore [[Alternate history|"what-if" scenarios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date=Mar 1994 |title=Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology |author=Reynolds, Richard |isbn=978-0-87805-694-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comics &amp; Culture: analytical and theoretical approaches to comics |author=Magnussen, Anne and Hans-christian Christiansen, eds. |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |date=Apr 2000 |isbn=978-87-7289-580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can become difficult for writers contributing to a shared universe to maintain consistency and avoid contradicting details in earlier works, especially when a shared universe grows to be very large. The version deemed "official" by the author or company controlling the setting is known as [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Not all shared universes have a controlling entity capable of or interested in determining canonicity, and not all fans agree with these determinations when they occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers |author=Pustz, Matthew |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]] may instead find some degree of consensus within the setting's [[fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=All Shapes of Hunger: Teenagers and Fanfiction |journal=Voya |author=Moore, Rebecca C. |date=Apr 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers, in an effort to ensure that a canon can be established and to keep details of the setting believable, employ tools to correct contradictions and errors that result from multiple contributors working over a long period of time. One such tool is [[retcon]]ning, short for "retroactive continuity", which resolves errors in continuity that came about through previously-written conflicting material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Retcon Tricks |journal=Star Trek Monthly Magazine |author=Jones, Nick |date=Feb 2002 |pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readers may also object when a story or series is integrated into a shared universe, feeling it "requir[es] one hero's fans to buy other heroes' titles".&lt;ref name="BurtCL"&gt;{{cite journal |title="Blown To Atoms or Reshaped At Will": Recent Books About Comics |author=Burt, Stephen |journal=College Literature |date=Winter 2005 |volume=32 |page=166 |doi=10.1353/lit.2005.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Larry Niven]] opened his [[Known Space]] setting to other writers initially because he considered his lack of military experience prevented him from adequately describing the wars between mankind and the [[Kzinti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scribner, Ted|title=Novel Collaborations |url=http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110055400/http://www.larryniven.org/collaborations.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which he has made the setting available for other writers became a topic of controversy, when [[Elf Sternberg]] created an [[erotic literature|erotic short story]] set in Known Space following an author's note from Niven indicating that "[i]f you want more Known Space stories, you'll have to write them yourself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ringworld Engineers |author=Niven, Larry |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niven has since clarified that his setting is still to be used only "under restricted circumstances and with permission",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Dr. Larry Niven |publisher=Slashdot |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2007-01-13 |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/10/167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110227/http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F03%2F10%2F167206&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134&amp;tid=192 |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Niven granted to the several authors of the [[Man-Kzin Wars]] series. By contrast, author [[Eric Flint]] has edited and published collaborations with fan fiction writers directly, expanding his [[1632 series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1632: About this Site |author=Eves, David |date=Sep 2005 |url=http://1632.org/About.html |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A setting may also be expanded in a similar manner after the death of its creator, although this posthumous expansion does not meet some strict definitions of a shared universe. One such example is [[August Derleth]]'s development of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] from the writings of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], an approach whose result is considered by some to be "completely dissimilar" to Lovecraft's own works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tierney |first=Richard L. |title=The Derleth Mythos |publisher=Nightscapes |date=2004-09-09 |url=http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |accessdate=2007-01-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209052219/http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less controversial posthumous expansions include [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]]'s and later authors' sequels to [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[Land of Oz|Oz]]'' stories and the further development of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' universe by [[Greg Bear]], [[Gregory Benford]], and [[David Brin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Following Asimov's Foundation |publisher=Cyberhaven |year=1999 |url=http://www.cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html |accessdate=2007-06-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811055828/http://cyberhaven.com/books/sciencefiction/bear.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other published works of this nature take the form of a series of short-story [[anthologies]] with occasional standalone novels. Examples include [[Robert Lynn Asprin]]'s [[Thieves' World]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Conversation with Lynn Abbey |author=Silver, Steven H. |publisher=SF Site |url=http://www.sfsite.com/11a/la139.htm |date=Oct 2002 |accessdate=2007-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426102845/http://www.sfsite.com/11a/la139.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[C.

=== Originating in comics/based upon comics ===
{{Main|List of fictional universes in animation and comics}}
[[File:MasterComicsNo21.jpg|thumb|Early example: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman]] join forces to battle [[Captain Nazi]], thereby establishing a shared continuity within the [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]] "universe".]]
Within comics, the term ''shared universe'' has been used to reflect the overall milieu created by the comic book publisher in which characters, events, and premises from one product line appear in other product lines in a [[media franchise]].

By 1961, [[Marvel Comics]] writer and editor [[Stan Lee]], working with artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], merged the bulk of the publisher's comics characters into the [[Marvel Universe]].&lt;ref name="BurtCL" /&gt; Marvel sets its stories in an increasing number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate realities]], each with an assigned number in a greater "[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]".&lt;ref name="MarvMulti"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marvel Encyclopedia Volume 6: Fantastic Four |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=2004-11-24 |isbn=978-0-7851-1480-2 |author=writer, Kit Kiefer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DC Comics]] and Marvel have also periodically co-published series in which their respective characters meet and interact. These [[intercompany crossovers]] have typically been written as self-limiting events that avoid implying that the DC Universe and Marvel Universe co-exist. Exceptions include the twenty-four comics released under the [[metafiction]]al [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Amalgam Comics]] in 1996, depicting a shared universe populated by hybridizations of the two companies' characters. Marvel has since referred to this as part of its setting's greater multiverse by labeling it Earth-692.&lt;ref name="MarvMulti" /&gt;

Although DC and Marvel's shared universe approaches to comics have set them apart from competitors in the industry,&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Brant W. |title=Myth Conceptions: 'Summer Blockbusters' |publisher=Silver Bullet Comics |date=2006-06-05 |url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026024638/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=1719 |archivedate=October 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; other companies have attempted similar models. [[Valiant Comics]] and [[Crossgen]] both produced titles primarily set from their inception in a single, publisher-wide shared universe, known respectively as [[Unity (comics)|Unity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Andy |title=The Valiant Comics F.A.Q. |publisher=Sequart |url=http://www.sequart.com/articles/index.php?article=1294 |date=2006-07-10 |accessdate=2007-01-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061023211507/http://www.sequart.com/articles/index.php?article=1294 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sigilverse]].&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lander |first=Randy |title=Negation War #1 |publisher=The 4th Rail |url=http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/snapjudgments/032904/negationwar1.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120030556/http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/snapjudgments/032904/negationwar1.shtml |archivedate=November 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universes in films and television ==
{{Main|List of fictional shared universes in film and television}}
Universes in films (or television) mostly consist of a franchise featuring an umbrella of multiple franchises (film or television) set within the same continuity, each franchise within telling its own stand-alone story focusing on a different character (or group of characters), as well as featuring its own cast, of directors, writers, while also being part of a coherent, non-contradictory continuity shared with the other works. Fictional universes with major presence in films are referred to as '''cinematic universes''', while fictional universes with major presence in television are refereed to as '''television universes'''. Universes with major presence in films and television, generally are refereed as cinematic universes as that's the medium that reaches the most audiences. Some film and television universes are accompanied by video games, and print works such as novels or comics, telling additional canonical stories set within the same continuity.

Later films would also tie in [[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man|The Invisible Man]], [[Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde]] and [[Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy|The Mummy.]]

An early universe in cinema history was the ''[[Universal Monsters#Recurring cast and characters|Universal Monsters]]'' series of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', which ran from 1931 to 1951 and featured recurring cast and characters.

Some universes in film have originated as film adaptations of novels, such as the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]] based on the spy novels by [[Ian Fleming]]. The films adapt some elements from the novels, however they are not direct adaptations, additionally they were not adapted in the same order as the books released. The first film in the series is ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), and has produced 23 sequels, with the most recent one being ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015). Due to the series spanning more than 50 years, [[James Bond]] has been portrayed by six actors, all the other frequent cast of characters has also gone through replacements, additionally after all Fleming's novels were adapted the series shifted towards original scripts. However, all films are set within a single, coherent fictional continuity, even if the writers, directors and cast change between films. Aspects of the fictional universe are retained between films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|title=Every James Bond Movie Ever, Ranked Worst To Best|date=April 16, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717200714/http://screenrant.com/every-james-bond-movie-ranked-worst-best/|archivedate=July 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' film series also originated as a film adaptation of the novel of the same name, taking many creative liberties. The original film titled ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) focused on present-day astronaut George Taylor landing on a mysterious planet ruled by apes, which is revealed to be a future planet Earth at the end of the film. The sequel ''Beneath'' focused on Brent, an astronaut sent on a rescue mission to save Taylor. The third film ''Escape'' introduced [[time travel]] and shifted the focus towards the apes Zira and Cornelius, who appeared as supporting characters in the previous films, as they travel to the past in Taylor's spaceship. The fourth and fifth films, ''Conquest'' and ''Battle'', focus on Zira and Cornelius' son Cesar leading the up-rise against the humans and to the future depicted in the original film. A television series and an animated series are also considered part of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|title=Planet of the Apes: A Timeline and an Explanation|first=Annalee|last=Newitz|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713112149/http://io9.gizmodo.com/planet-of-the-apes-a-timeline-and-an-explanation-1603218068|archivedate=July 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the ''Planet of the Apes'' in the original timeline before the time travel occurred was explained in a prequel-reboot film series with the ape Cesar becoming the main protagonist again, with the story focused on his life from childhood to an old ape, and how the conflict between the apes and the humans, started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|title=The Planet of the Apes series is quietly showing the world how to reboot a franchise right|publisher=The Verge|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610123359/https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/12/9/13899502/planet-of-the-apes-series-war-dawn-rise-reboot-franchise-right|archivedate=June 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series was created by [[George Lucas]], produced by his self-funded production company Lucasfilm. It originated with the film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' (1977), followed by two sequels under the subtitles ''[[Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983); together, those three films are known as the original trilogy and focuses on [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia]]. The prequel trilogy composed of ''[[Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) expanded the series into a Saga, and focused on Luke Skywalker's father [[Anakin Skywalker]], new cast members portrayed younger versions of characters from the Original trilogy, while other actors returned to their original trilogy roles. On television, the lore was expanded through animation, the animated film titled ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' (2008) served as the pilot of an [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|animated series of the same name]] (2008-2014). Lucas was deeply creatively involved in the previously mentioned works, but he ceased creative involvement with the ''Star Wars'' franchise in 2014. Lucasfilm announced that from April 2014, only such previously mentioned works would be considered canonical, along all of the fictional works released after such date. The animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' (2014-2018), was the first work released after. A sequel trilogy formed by ''[[Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|Episode VIII: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017) and the upcoming ''[[Star Wars: Episode IX|Episode IX]]'' (2019) featured many returning cast members along newcomers. The films’ main saga is conformed of the original, prequel, and sequel trilogies. A concurrent spin-off film series, known as the anthology films, expands the stories of plot points and characters from the main series. Additionally the series expanded into video games, comics, and novels, telling original stories based on the franchise, classifying it as an imaginary entertainment environment,&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel. [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fantasy-role-playing-game-a-new-performing-art/oclc/45575501 ''The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art''] (Jefferson, NC: McFarland. 2001) pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; where the films share the same [[Star Wars canon|continuity]] as all the other media formats, regardless of the different media formats. Lucasfilm's "Story Group" coordinates a cohesive story-telling and ensures consistency and synergy by avoiding plot holes between all the film and non-film works. The ''[[Star Wars Legends]]'' brand is used to brand all the re-prints of non-canonical works (television films, animated series, video-games, comics, and novels) of the franchise which were produced and/or ceased production before April 2014. Lucas himself considered the ''Legends'' works as non-canonical because considered them to diminish his films meaning by not adhering to his vision. Albeit, Lucas did include a few of the ''Legends'' elements that he supported within his works, such as characters and places which made those included elements canonical. Storytellers after Lucas have also incorporated ''Legends'' elements in their stories, sometimes with the help of the original creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|title=How Star Wars Mastered the Shared Universe|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517220938/http://screenrant.com/star-wars-story-group-shared-universe/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for comic book based films, there are two cinematic universes based on [[Marvel Comics]] characters, both set within a different continuity. The [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], which originated in 2000, is the longest-running superhero film franchise to be set within the same continuity. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has the most films, as well as [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|multiple TV shows]] and a separate run of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]] that co-exist and share the same continuity, making the MCU an imaginary entertainment environment. The [[DC Extended Universe]] is a movie franchise that encompasses different movies series based on the [[DC Comics]] characters, all of them sharing a continuity.

Writer/director [[Kevin Smith]] created a fictional universe used in several of his films, as well as comics and a television series:  the [[View Askewniverse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The View Askewniverse | url=http://www.viewaskew.com | website=[[View Askewniverse|The View Askewniverse]] | access-date=December 29, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216205425/http://www.viewaskew.com/ | archivedate=December 16, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is named for Smith's production company, [[View Askew Productions]]. The characters [[Jay and Silent Bob]] (played by Smith) appear in almost all the View Askewniverse media, and characters from one story often reappear or are referred to in others.  Recurring characters, settings, and motifs of the View Askewniverse first appeared in Smith's debut film, [[Clerks]], in 1994.

Among the most successful novel-to-film adaptations are the film trilogies of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' (2012–2014) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (2001–2003), all of which were directed by [[Peter Jackson]], while serving as faithful adaptations of the novels by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] (especially ''The Lord of the Rings''). The first work in the series was ''[[The Hobbit (novel)|The Hobbit novel]]'' published in 1937. The novels focused on the hobbits [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his nephew [[Frodo Baggins]], as well as the wizard [[Gandalf]], among other species such as dwarves and elves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|title=Looking back on what made the Lord of the Rings trilogy special, 15 years later|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826115748/https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/23/14055580/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-movies-peter-jackson-15th-anniversary|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videogames taking place between the films of the saga have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|title=Middle-earth: Shadow of War - PlayStation 4 - www.GameInformer.com|website=www.gameinformer.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826123803/https://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/default.aspx|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Universes in television ====
This refers to universes that are based on television shows without any films. Television series may lead to a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off series]] set in the same universe, often focusing on a single character from the original. The American sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' led to two spin-off series based on its characters, in the form of ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[The Tortellis]]''.

A significant example of shared universes among television shows is the [[Tommy Westphall#The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis|Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis]], which suggests that hundreds of American television series take place in the same universe. It builds from the assumption that when an actor playing a character from one series guest-stars in a second series, in character, both of those series must take place in the same universe. The theory takes its name from a character in the final episode of ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', where the common interpretation of the events of that finale is that the entire ''St. Elsewhere'' universe – including all connected series – exist only within Westphall's imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Gravely|first1=Gary|title=A Multiverse of Narratives: Possible Worlds Theory and Authorship From the Lone Artist to Corporate Authors|date=August 2015|institution=[[Middle Tennessee State University]]|via=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|location=Murfreesboro, TN|pages=166-167|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718228166|degree=Ph.D.|id=No.3719757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'', known as the "[[Whoniverse]]", has relatively little consistency given its division into [[audio play]]s produced by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] and the BBC, the [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventures]] universe novel, or a universe based on comics published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary Russell two |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721053617/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/01/01/13770.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universes in animated films and animated series ===
{{Main|List of fictional universes in animation and comics}}
The [[Mickey Mouse universe]] dates back to the 1930s when the animated cartoon was expanded into a newspaper strip. Although the characters occasionally portray other roles and with other names, the writers address this discrepancy by thinking of the characters as being "employed" by Disney as actors. [[Walt Disney]], when asked whether or not [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] were married, replied that the mice were indeed married in their "private li[ves]", but that they sometimes appeared as boyfriend and girlfriend for "screen purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Pixar universe]] is an elaborate [[fan theory]] suggesting that all [[Pixar]] animated movies take place in the same universe. At the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]], during the "Pixar Secrets Revealed" panel, director [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] rejected the theory, with ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' co-director [[Ronnie del Carmen]] adding "Do you know what kinds of meetings we'd have to have to make sure all our movies line up?!"&lt;ref name=Disney&gt;{{cite news|title=10 Things We Learned from the 'Pixar Secrets Revealed' Panel|url=http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|accessdate=August 17, 2015|newspaper=Oh My Disney|date=August 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817120038/http://blogs.disney.com/oh-my-disney/2015/08/16/10-things-we-learned-from-the-pixar-secrets-revealed-panel/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Originating in video games and the internet ==
The influence of the [[Internet]] on [[collaborative fiction|collaborative]] and [[interactive fiction]] has also resulted in a large number of amateur shared universe settings. Amateur authors have created shared universes by contributing to [[mailing lists]], story [[archive]]s and [[Usenet]]. One of the earliest of these settings, [[SFStory]], saw its spin-off setting [[Superguy]] cited as illustrative of the potential of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Engst, Adam C. |author2=William Dickson |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Internet Explorer Kit |publisher=Hayden Books |date=1994-01-15 |isbn=978-1-56830-089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[furry fandom|furry]]-themed Tales from the Blind Pig created at the [[Transformation Story Archive]] which some limited publication.&lt;ref name="AnthroIndex"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Index |journal=Anthro |url=http://www.anthrozine.com/site/everything.html |accessdate=2006-12-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426163814/http://www.anthrozine.com/site/everything.html |archivedate=April 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAT21"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stories |journal=TSAT: Transformation Stories, Art, Talk |issue=21 |url=http://tsat.transform.to/i.21/index.21.html |date=Apr–May 2002 |accessdate=2006-12-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908060758/http://tsat.transform.to/i.21/index.21.html |archivedate=September 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples include the [[DargonZine|Dargon Project]], Devilbunnies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=alt.pave.the.earth |author=Miller, Steve |journal=Wired |issue=2.07 |date=Jul 1994 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.07/alt.pave.html |accessdate=2007-05-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134303/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.07/alt.pave.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SCP Foundation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

One of the lesser known, but still widely popular shared universes is the [http://whateleyacademy.net/index.php Whateley Academy stories], a series set in a fictional superhero-themed universe detailing the events occurring at the titular mutant school Whateley Academy. The shared universe of these stories originated in 2004, and has attracted a dedicated fanbase from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whateleyacademy.net/index.php|title=Site - Whateley Academy - Home|last=Darken|first=Kristin|website=whateleyacademy.net|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106032929/http://whateleyacademy.net/index.php/|archivedate=January 6, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other media ==
The 2000 musical ''[[Seussical]]'' presented several works of [[Dr. Seuss]] as taking place in the same fictional world.

[[Hasbro]] toy products including [[G.I. Joe]] and [[Transformers]] are considered by their manufacturer to exist fictionally within the [[Hasbro Universe]].

A '''spatial relation''',&lt;ref&gt;J Freeman (1975), "The modelling of spatial relations", Computer Graphics and Image Processing,  Elsevier. DOI: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0146-664X(75)80007-4 10.1016/S0146-664X(75)80007-4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;D. M. Mark and M. J. Egenhofer (1994), "Modeling Spatial Relations Between Lines and Regions: Combining Formal Mathematical Models and Human Subjects Testing". [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.25.9493&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies how some object is located in space in relation to some reference object. When the reference object is much bigger than the object to locate, the latter is often represented by a point. The reference object is often represented by a [[bounding box]]&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5 

Spatial Behaviour Modelling of Unauthorised Housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka | Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Anatomical terms of location|Anatomy]] it might be the case that a spatial relation is not fully applicable. Thus, the degree of applicability is defined which specifies from 0 till 100% how strongly a spatial relation holds. Often researchers concentrate on defining the applicability function for various spatial relations.

In [[spatial database]]s and [[Geospatial topology]] the ''spatial relations'' are used for ''spatial analysis'' and constraint specifications.

In [[cognitive development]] for walk and for catch objects, or [[Water-level task|for understand objects-behaviour]]; in [[Automated Guided Vehicle#Natural Features Navigation|robotic Natural Features Navigation]]; and many other areas, ''spatial relations'' plays a central role.

Commonly used types of ''spatial relations'' are: ''topological'', ''directional'' and ''distance'' relations.

== Topological relations ==
[[File:TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png|thumb|400px|Examples of topological spatial relations.]]
:&lt;small&gt;Main article [[DE-9IM#Spatial predicates|DE-9IM]].&lt;/small&gt;

The [[DE-9IM]] model expresses important ''space relations'' which are invariant to [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] transformations.

For any two spatial objects ''a'' and ''b'', that can be points, lines and/or polygonal areas, there are 9 relations derived from ''DE-9IM'':
{| class="wikitable"
!valign="top"|''Equals''
| ''a'' = ''b''&lt;br/&gt;Topologically [[Equality (relational operator)|equal]].  Also (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a'') ∧ (''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b'')

|-
!valign="top"|''Disjoint''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ∅ &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' and ''b'' are disjoint, have no point in common. They form a set of  [[Disconnected (topology)#Disconnected spaces|disconnected]] geometries.

|-
!valign="middle"|''Intersects'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅

|-
!valign="top"|''Touches''
|(''a'' ∩ ''b'' ≠ ∅) ∧ (''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; = ∅) &lt;br/&gt; ''a'' touches ''b'', they have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points.

|-
!valign="top"|''Contains''
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''b''

|-
!valign="top"|''Covers''
|''a''&lt;sup&gt;ο&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''b'' = ''b'' &lt;br/&gt; ''b'' lies in the interior of ''a'' (extends ''Contains''). Other definitions: "no points of ''b'' lie in the exterior of ''a''", or "Every point of ''b'' is a point of (the interior of) ''a''".

|-
!valign="middle"|''CoveredBy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
|''Covers(b,a)''

|-
!valign="top"|''Within'' 
|''a'' ∩ ''b'' = ''a''
|}

== Directional relations ==
Directional relations can again be differentiated into external directional relations and internal directional relations. An internal directional relation specifies where an object is located inside the reference object while an external relations specifies where the object is located outside of the reference objects.

*Examples for internal directional relations: left; on the back; athwart, abaft
*Examples for external directional relations: on the right of; behind; in front of, abeam, astern

== Distance relations ==
Distance relations specify how far is the object away from the reference object.
*Examples are: at; nearby; in the vicinity; far away

== Relations by class ==
Reference objects represented by a [[bounding box]] or another kind of "spatial envelope" that encloses its borders, can be denoted with the maximum number of [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] of this envelope:  &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Point (geometry)|punctual objects]], &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; for [[Line (geometry)|linear objects]], &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; for [[area|planar objects]], &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt; for [[volume|volumetric objects]]. So, any object, in a [[2D geometric model|2D modeling]], can by  classified as ''point'', ''line'' or ''area'' according to its delimitation. Then, a ''type of spatial relation'' can be expressed by the class of the objects that participate in the relation:

* [[Spatial relation/point-point|point-point relations]]: ...
* [[Spatial relation/point-line|point-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/point-area|point-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-line|line-line relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/line-area|line-area relations]]:
* [[Spatial relation/area-area|area-area relations]]:

More ''complex'' modeling schemas can represent an object as a composition of ''simple sub-objects''. Examples: represent in a [[astronomical map]] a star by a ''point'' and a [[binary star]] by ''two points'';  represent in [[geographical map]] a river with a ''line'', for its  [[river source|source]] [[stream]], and with an strip-''area'', for the rest of the river.  These schemas can use the above classes, uniform composition classes (''multi-point'', ''multi-line'' and ''multi-area'') and heterogeneous composition (''points''+''lines'' as "object of dimension 1", ''points''+''lines''+''areas'' as "object of dimension 2").

Two internal components of a ''complex object'' can express (the above) [[Binary operation|binary relations]] between them, and [[Ternary operation|ternary relations]], using the  whole object as a [[frame of reference]]. Some relations can be expressed by an abstract component, such the [[center of mass]] of the binary star, or a center line of the river.

== Temporal references ==
For human thinking, spatial relations include qualities like size, distance, volume, order, and, also, time:
{{Quotation|
Time is spatial: it requires understanding ordered sequences such as days of the week, months of the year, and seasons. A person with spatial difficulties may have problems understanding “yesterday,” “last week,” and “next month”. 
Time expressed digitally is just as spatial as time expressed by moving clock hands, but digital clocks remove the need to translate the hand position into numbers.
|Stockdale and Possin}}
Stockdale and Possin&lt;ref&gt;C. Stockdale and C. Possin (1998) [http://impactofspecialneeds.weebly.com/uploads/3/4/1/9/3419723/spatial.pdf Spatial Relations and Learning].&lt;/ref&gt;  discusses the many ways in which people with difficulty establishing spatial and temporal relationships can face problems in ordinary situations.

To become a professional [[securities broker]] in the United States, an individual must take and pass the [[General Securities Representative Exam]] (Series 7) and in most states, the [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination]] (Series 63). To take the test, you must be sponsored by "a member firm, a self-regulatory organization (SRO), or an exchange." This requirement, as well as the administration of the test, is under the jurisdiction of FINRA, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]].&lt;ref name="Investo"&gt;{{cite web |title = Investopedia FAQs | url =http://www.investopedia.com/professionals/FAQs/series7/260304_1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals who are interested only in managing their own investments, several options exist to obtain a [[stock market]] education:

* Traditional classroom setting
* Non-traditional classroom settings
* Self-education
* Mentor/[[apprentice]]ship relationship

== Traditional classroom settings ==
Many colleges and universities offer courses of study in business, economics, and finance. However, the coursework is aimed at preparing the student for the professional world. They are not designed or intended to teach a student how to trade in the stock market, although the introductory/basic courses would provide a good basic foundation of knowledge. Those intending to follow the professional stockbroker career path usually begin their education by obtaining a degree in business, economics, or finance.

Some of the core subjects covered by an [[undergraduate|undergraduate education]] during the course of a financial/business college education are:

* Basic marketing
* Business communication
* [[Business ethics]]
* Financial accounting
* [[Macroeconomics]]
* Mathematics
* [[Microeconomics]]
* Real estate
* [[financial risk management|Risk management]]
* [[Statistics]]
&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web |title = Florida State University, College of Business undergraduate course requirements | url =http://cob.fsu.edu/fin/fin_ba_curriculum.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calif"&gt;{{cite web |title = University of California, Haas School of Business undergraduate course requirements |url = http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202052836/http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |archivedate = 2010-02-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-traditional classroom settings ==
Non-traditional classroom settings are offered by:

* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material
* Stock market organizations that offer stock market educational material
* For-profit businesses

For-profit financial education companies exist that offer programs of study (also referred to as "systems" or "courses" &amp;ndash; the terminology varies) on stock market education. Unlike colleges that prepare students for working in the financial arena, these companies educate students with a more narrow focus &amp;ndash; how to trade [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] for the purpose of personal investing. Examples of such companies are [[thinkorswim]] (formerly Investools), Invested Central, [[Trading Advantage]], Global Finance School, and Rich Dad's Education (based on the "[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]" book by [[Robert Kiyosaki]]). These types of companies offer both classroom settings for learning and [[distance education]] programs.

Another aspect that differentiates for-profit stock market education companies from traditional colleges is the commercialization factor. For-profit stock market education companies frequently develop other products &amp;ndash; such as software and newsletters &amp;ndash; that they market to their students. Colleges and universities, frequently founded for the purpose of providing education and established as non-profit organizations, do not follow this business model.

== Mentor/apprentice relationship ==
Also referred to as "personal coaches," [[mentor]]s work one-on-one with a student, In this situation, the student receives more personal attention from the instructor than from a classroom or distance learning education. Some mentors offer their services for a fee.&lt;ref name="Mentor_1"&gt;{{cite web |title = Boris Gurevich, Ph.D. #1 Education Partner with InteractiveBrokers, AskTradeMentor.com | url =http://www.AskTradeMentor.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mentor_2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chicago School of Trading | url =http://www.thechicagoschooloftrading.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-taught ==
The following resources exist in libraries and on the Internet for an individual to learn about investing in the stock market:

* A [[stock market simulator]] allows one to trade without using real funds (also referred to as "[[paper trading]]"). These simulators are offered by organizations associated with the stock market (such as the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]) and the types of [[for-profit education]] companies mentioned in [[#Non-traditional_classroom_settings|Non-traditional classroom settings]].
* Articles
** Financial magazines like ''[[Money (magazine)]]'',''[[Kiplinger]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' provide investing articles, though their target market is aimed at more general investors. Magazines that focus on trading derivatives are ''Active Trader'' and ''Tradersworld''. Magazines with an online presence also offer access to some, if not all, of their articles online.
** Web sites devoted to the stock market or trading arena post articles online or send them via email to subscribers. These web sites can be free, non-profit, or for-profit.
* Books written by investors and traders.
* Online forums that discuss subjects related to the stock market and trading derivatives.
* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material:    
** [[American Association of Individual Investors]]   
** [[Alliance for Investor Education]]    
** BetterInvesting Community    
** Investor Protection Trust   
** National Endowment for Financial Education    
** [[North American Securities Administrators Association]]    
** Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Investor Education and Assistance
* Stock market organizations that offer stock market educational material:    
** [[American Stock Exchange]]    
** [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] (CBOE)    
** [[Council for Economic Education]]    
** [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]    
** [[NASDAQ Educational Foundation]]    
** [[New York Stock Exchange]]

== Stock market subjects to learn ==
Whether an individual chooses a traditional or non-traditional education to learn how the stock market works, the following basic subjects are covered:

* How the stock market [[stock exchange]] works
* Live trading on various trading terminals
* Risks Management which can be managed by learning Derivatives( [[Futures contract]] and [[Option contract]] and Portfolio Management
* Money Management
* Behavioral Finance
* How to interpret financial or economic news
* What to look for in a broker or brokerage firm

'''More advanced topics would include:'''

* Trading strategies
* [[Fundamental analysis]]
* [[Technical analysis]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">'''Superslow processes''' are processes in which values change so little that their capture is very difficult because of their smallness in comparison with the measurement error.&lt;ref name="supersl"&gt;{{citation |first=Vladimir M. |last=Miklyukov |url=http://www.uchimsya.info/SuperslowPrAbstract.pdf |title=Abstract|periodical=uchimsya.info |accessdate=10/25/09;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the time, the superslow processes lie beyond the scope of investigation due to the reason of their superslowness.  Multiple gaps can be easily detected in [[biology]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[mechanics]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[ecology]], [[gerontology]], etc.&lt;ref name="supersl" /&gt;

Traditional scientific research in this area was focused on the describing some brain reactions.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;See N.A.Aladjanova ({{lang-ru|Н.А. Аладжанова}}, 1979), V.A.Ilyukhina ({{lang-ru|В.А.Илюхина}}, 1982), Z.G.Khabaeva ({{lang-ru|З.Г.Хабаева}}, L.I.Nikitina {{lang-ru|Л.И.Никитина}}, 1986), I.B.Zabolotskih ({{lang-ru|И.Б.Заболотских}}, A.

In 2003, the term ''superslow processes'' was brought to wide attention by Russian mathematician [[Vladimir Miklyukov]] who founded ''Superslow Processes laboratory'' on the base of the [[Volgograd State University]] ([[Russia]]).  Reports of seminar members are published yearly in ''Notes of the Seminar 'Superslow Processes'''.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

In [[mathematics]], when the fluid flows through thin and long tubes it forms [[Stagnation point|stagnation zones]] where the flow becomes almost immobile.  If the ratio of tube length to its diameter is large, then the potential function and stream function are almost invariable on very extended areas.  The situation seems uninteresting, but if we remember that these minor changes occur in the extra-long intervals, we see here a series of first-class tasks that require the development of special mathematical methods.

[[A priori and a posteriori|Apriori]] information regarding the [[Stagnation point|stagnation zones]]  contributes to optimization of the [[computational process]] by replacing the unknown functions with the corresponding constants in such zones.  Sometimes this makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of computation, for example in approximate calculation of [[conformal map]]ings of strongly elongated rectangles.

The obtained results are particularly useful for applications in [[economic geography]].  In a case where the function describes the intensity of [[Commodity#Commodity trade|commodity trade]], a theorem about its stagnation zones gives us (under appropriate restrictions on the selected  model) [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing|geometric dimensions]] estimates of the stagnation zone of the world-economy (for more information about a ''stagnation zone of the world-economy'', see [[Fernand Braudel]], Les Jeux de L'echange).&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], ''Civilisation matérielle, économie et capitalisme, XV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;-XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle'': ''Les jeux de l'échange'', Civilisation Paris, 1979, {{ISBN|2-253-06456-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if the subarc of a domain boundary has zero transparency, and the flow of the [[gradient vector field]] of the function through the rest of the boundary is small enough, then the domain for such function is its stagnation zone.

Stagnation zones [[theorem]]s are closely related to pre-[[Liouville's theorem (disambiguation)|Liouville's theorem]]s about evaluation of solutions fluctuation, which direct consequences are the different versions of the classic [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville theorem]] about conversion of the entire [[doubly periodic function]] into the identical constant.

Identification of what parameters impact the sizes of stagnation zones opens up opportunities for practical recommendations on targeted changes in configuration (reduction or increase) of such zones.

The '''University of Costa Rica''' (Spanish: ''Universidad de Costa Rica,'' abbreviated '''UCR''') is a [[public university]] in the Republic of [[Costa Rica]], in [[Central America]].  Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria Rodrigo Facio,  is located in [[San Pedro, Costa Rica|San Pedro Montes de Oca]], in the province of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].  It is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious{{cn|date=July 2018}} institution of higher learning in Costa Rica, originally established as the ''Universidad de Santo Tomás'' in 1843. It is also the most important research university in the country, and Central America. Approximately 45,000 students attend UCR throughout the year.

Within the [[Webometrics]] ranking, the UCR ranks at #501 worldwide, and at #18 in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/Latin_America|title=Latin America - Ranking Web of Universities|publisher=|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first institution dedicated to higher education in Costa Rica was the ''University of Saint Thomas'' (''Universidad de Santo Tomás''), which was established in 1843.  That institution maintained close ties with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and [[anti-clerical]] government of President [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] as part of a campaign to modernize public education.  The schools of [[law]], [[agronomy]], [[fine arts]], and [[pharmacy]] continued to operate independently.  In 1940, those four schools were re-united to establish the modern UCR, during the reformist administration of President [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia]].

The UCR remained the country's sole university until the [[Costa Rica Institute of Technology]] (''Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica'') and the [[National University of Costa Rica]] (''Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica'') were opened by the government in 1972 and 1973, respectively.  Years later, in 1979, another public university opened: the [[Distance State University]] (''Universidad Estatal a Distancia''), modeled after the British [[Open University]]. Today, Costa Rica has five public universities (the fifth being the newly created National Technical University), and approximately fifty three small private ones, but the UCR remains the largest and most well funded institution.

==Application==
Costa Rican applicants to the UCR must take an admission test. This test is similar to the [[SAT]] in the United States. The score of this test is used along with the grades from the student's last years in high school to determine the student's admission score, which is later used to determine admission to a specific major and financial aid. 800 is the highest possible score on the admission test and 442 is the minimum score required for admission. Students who score 800 usually appear in the front pages of Costa Rican newspapers.

[[Undergraduate]] Admission is highly selective, having an acceptance rate of approximately 25%. In 2009, out of the 31.042 that completed the admission test, only 16.593 got above the necessary 442 points to be admitted into the university.  However, being admitted to the university doesn't assure admission to a chosen departmental program, or major. In 2007, only 60% of those admitted to the university got accepted into their chosen major.  The remaining 40% have to take classes that may not work for their major, hoping it will lift their grade point average to the level necessary to be admitted to the program of their liking.

International applicants must revalidate their high school certificate and grades from their country of origin at the Ministry of Public Education (''Ministerio de Educación Pública'') in order to apply and take the admission test. [[Graduate school]] applicants must revalidate their undergraduate certificate also.

==Campuses and local branches==
[[Image:Biblioteca-Carlos-Monge-UCR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Carlos Monge]] Library, a library on the main campus in San Pedro.]]

The main campus is located on a {{convert|100|ha|sing=on|abbr=on}} campus in San Pedro, San Jose ([[Rodrigo Facio]] campus). Other regional campuses are located throughout the country to reach rural Costa Ricans. The regional options are:

* Western Campus (In the city of [[San Ramón, Costa Rica|San Ramon]], [[Alajuela Province|Alajuela]]): includes a local branch in [[Tacares]], [[Grecia (canton)|Grecia]]
* Atlantic Campus (In the city of [[Turrialba]] , [[Cartago Province|Cartago]]): includes a local branch in [[Paraíso, Costa Rica|Paraíso]], [[Cartago Province|Cartago]] and another one in [[Guápiles]], [[Limón Province|Limón]]
* Guanacaste Campus (In the city of [[Liberia, Costa Rica|Liberia]] , [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]): includes a local branch in [[Santa Cruz Canton, Costa Rica|Santa Cruz]]
* Limon Campus (In the City of [[Limón|Port Limón]], [[Limon Province|Limon)]].
* Pacific Campus (In the city of [[Puntarenas]], [[Puntarenas Province|Puntarenas]]).
* The [[Golfito]] Campus (Southern Pacific coast) (in the City of [[Golfito]], [[Puntarenas Province|Puntarenas]]). 

The main campus in San Pedro offers the most diverse{{what|date=July 2018}} course curricula of any other campus, in addition to hosting the Medical School, and graduate programs.

==Social relevance==

The University, while neutral on most aspects of Costa Rican life, defines itself as a secular and humanist institution.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The university encourages social work and research activities and in order to graduate most students must work in the {{lang|es|Trabajo Comunal Universitario}} (University Community Service), which is organized by the University.  The University maintains a prestigious position in Costa Rican society{{cn|date=July 2018}} and is the most often cited governmental institution in Costa Rican [[News media|media]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}  Opinions generated   in scientific, [[ethical]] and economic matters strongly influence Costa Rican policies and public sentiment. Costa Rican law requires the Costa Rican Congress to request from the UCR (amongst other institutions) for its opinion on whether a new law should be approved or not.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

UCR counts Costa Rica's [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Oscar Arias]], ex-Presidents, many ministers, and many heads of the country's public institutions as alumni.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The UCR is also part of the {{lang|es|Consejo Nacional de Rectores}} (National Council of University Chairpersons), a watchdog body that overviews higher education quality, and recognition of university-level degrees from foreign countries.

For many years, UCR grew in close partnership with public action of the State, forming the professional staff necessary for the growth of new public institutions such as the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), the Costa Rican Social Security Fund may Social (CCSS) and the State Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.cr/2015/05/06/rector-reitera-compromiso-de-la-universidad-con-costa-rica/|title=Rector reitera compromiso de la Universidad con Costa Rica – Diario Digital Nuestro País|first=Ucr|last=Odi|publisher=|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International cooperation==

The University maintains international cooperation alliances with the [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] (the [[Germany|German]] Academic Trust), the governments of Japan, France, Mexico, Spain, [[Taiwan]] (R.O.C.), the [[European Union]], the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] and United States research institutions such as the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]], whose headquarters in Costa Rica are located within UCR's central campus (Rodrigo Facio campus). Other Universities with ties to the University of Costa Rica are: [[University of Florida]], [[University at Albany, SUNY|State University of New York at Albany]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[University of Illinois]], [[University of Maryland]], [[Rutgers University]] and the [[University of Kansas]], which is the oldest standing agreement between two universities in the Western Hemisphere.

Academic cooperation agreements have been signed with the governments of the following countries (in alphabetical order): [[Argentina]], Austria, Belgium, [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], Canada, [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], Denmark, the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Finland]], France, Germany, [[Honduras]], [[Iceland]], Israel, Italy, Japan, [[Jamaica]], Mexico, the [[Netherlands]], [[Nicaragua]], Norway, [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Portugal]], [[Puerto Rico]], Russia, [[South Korea]], Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, [[Taiwan]] (R.O.C.), [[Uruguay]], the United Kingdom, the United States, and [[Venezuela]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Organization==
[[Image:Edificio ing elect.jpg|thumb|School of Electrical Engineering]]

The UCR is divided into six major academic areas: Agricultural Sciences, Arts and Letters, Basic Sciences, Engineering, Health and Social Sciences. These areas are divided into Colleges, Schools and Departments, Research Centers and Institutes. The Graduate Studies System offers masters and doctorate degrees in a variety of academic fields.

The '''University of Texas School of Information''' is a [[graduate school]]  at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], offering master's and doctoral degrees in information studies, as well as certificates of advanced study and an undergraduate minor. UT iSchool graduates find careers in [[Archival science|archival enterprise]], [[information architecture]], [[information policy]], [[information systems]] design and management, [[User experience|information usability]], [[librarianship]], multimedia design, [[Museum informatics|museum work]], [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]], and [[records management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vision and Mission |url=https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/about/vision/|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more than twenty faculty, a range of joint appointees from across the university, and numerous adjunct faculty selected for their expertise in information studies, the School of Information balances the values of information access as a human and social benefit, with the intellectual and technical skills needed to lead developments in the information age. The Austin program is unique among the information schools for its emphasis on the full lifecycle of information.

==History==

The school was founded in 1948 as a part of the [[University of Texas at Austin Graduate Studies|UT Graduate School]] as the '''Graduate School of Library Science''', offering a Master of Library Science (MLS) degree as well as certification for school librarianship, an offering which has been continually provided to this day. In 1967 the school initiated a Certificate of Advanced Study followed in 1969-70 by a doctoral program, leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

The school's name was changed in 1980 to '''Graduate School of Library and Information Science''' in recognition of the increased emphasis on information science in the curriculum as it had evolved since the late 1960s. At the same time, the name of the master's degree became [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (MLIS). Change has continued into this century with the master's degree name changed again to Master of Science in Information Studies (MSIS) in 2000. In 2002 the faculty voted unanimously to change the school name to School of Information. The new name took effect in 2003 to better reflect the diversity of issues and the multidisciplinary nature of the studies in the information field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Tradition |url=https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/about/history_tradition|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is a founding member of the [[List of information schools|iCaucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iCaucus Members|url=http://ischools.org/members/icaucus-members/|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban acupuncture''' is a [[environmentalism|socio-environmental]] theory that combines contemporary [[urban design]] with [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese]] [[acupuncture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamparsonsdesignthesis.blogspot.com/2010/12/urban-acupuncture-marco-casagrande.html Parsons, Adam. (2010, December). "Urban Acupuncture: Marco Casagrande."] University of Portsmouth.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} using small-scale interventions to transform the larger urban context. Sites are selected through analysis of aggregate social, economic and ecological factors, and are developed through a dialogue between designers and the community. Just as the practice of acupuncture is aimed at relieving stress in the human body, the goal of urban acupuncture is to relieve stress in the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ "Urban Acupuncture,"] ''Urban Applications,'' 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} In Taipei, there was an urban acupuncture workshop that aimed to "produce small-scale but socially catalytic interventions" into the city's fabric.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.dk/books?id=QbY7on6asu8C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=urban+acupuncture+casagrande&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gd8ozw3OLd&amp;sig=D0C58eXMpJuOZzsLtp6XftKyqnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mZxxUcu4C8HRtQbIsICoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=urban%20acupuncture%20casagrande&amp;f=false Ruin Academy – Casagrande Lab.] In ''Architectural Theories of the Environment: Posthuman Territory,'' ed.

==Urban organism==
Originally coined by Barcelonan architect and urbanist, Manuel de Sola Morales,&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, Kenneth. Megaform as urban landscape. University of Michigan, A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture+ Urban Planning, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;i Rubió, Manuel de Solà-Morales. Progettare città. Vol. 23.

Structure Fabric and Topography Conference, Nanjing University. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|reason=Conference paper.|date=October 2016}} the term has been recently championed and developed further by Finnish architect and [[Social theory|social theorist]] [[Marco Casagrande]], this school of thought eschews massive urban renewal projects in favour of a more localised and community approach that, in an era of constrained budgets and limited resources, could democratically and cheaply offer a respite to urban dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/urban-acupuncture-community-localised-renewal-projects Could cities' problems be solved by urban acupuncture?] – ''Leon Kaye, The Guardian'' 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=This is an op-ed written by a proponent of the subject.|date=October 2016}}
Casagrande views cities as complex energy organisms in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city. By mixing environmentalism and urban design Casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd Generation City (postindustrial city). The theory is developed in the [[Tamkang University]] of [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbandevelopmentbergen.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-witm-m-casagrande-on-urban.html INTERVIEW WITH M. CASAGRANDE ON URBAN ACUPUNTURE]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – ''Laurits Elkjær, Bergen School of Architecture'' 4/2010{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} and at independent multidisciplinary research center [[Ruin Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/ruin-academy/docs/anarchist_gardener_issue_two_hk_special Anarchist Gardener Issue Two HK special 安那其建築園丁港深建築雙城雙年展特別版] – ''Nikita Wu, Ruin Academy'' 2/2012&lt;/ref&gt; With focus on environmentalism and urban design, Casagrande defines urban acupuncture as a design tool where punctual manipulations contribute to creating sustainable urban development, such as the community gardens and urban farms in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/65227327/ParticipativeDesign_Planning.pdf PARTICIPATIVE DESIGN &amp; PLANNING IN CONTEMPORARY URBAN PROJECTS] – '' Christina Rasmussen, Urban Planning &amp; Management, Aalborg University'' 6/2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This is an undergraduate thesis.|date=December 2016}}

Casagrande describes urban acupuncture as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[a] cross-over architectural manipulation of the collective sensuous intellect of a city. City is viewed as multi-dimensional sensitive energy-organism, a living environment. Urban acupuncture aims into a touch with this nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ "Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal,"] – Kyle Miller, MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sensitivity to understand the energy flows of the collective [[Qi|chi]] beneath the visual city and reacting on the hot-spots of this chi. Architecture is in the position to produce the acupuncture needles for the urban chi.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html "Ruin Academy,"] – Marco Casagrande, Epifanio 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''A weed will root into the smallest crack in the asphalt and eventually break the city.  Urban acupuncture is the weed and the acupuncture point is the crack. The possibility of the impact is total, connecting human nature as part of nature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture: treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body. More immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs, but do so with a knowledge of how citywide systems operated and converged at that single node. Release pressure at strategic points, release pressure for the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Urban Applications'' 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory planning==

In theory, urban acupuncture opens the door for uncontrolled creativity and freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Citizens are enabled to join the creative [[participatory planning]] process, feel free to use city space for any purpose and develop their environment according to their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadsbyggnad.lth.se/fileadmin/stadsbyggnad/images/_1_Sudes_Book/_1_B5_webversion1.pdf Compost City] – Guoda Bardauskaite'' p. 30-31, Sustainable Urban Design Journal 1 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This "new" post-industrialized city Casagrande, dubbed the Third Generation City, is driven by people who are concerned about the destruction that the modern machine is causing to nature including human nature. They want sustainable co-operation with the rest of the nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbaninteraction.net/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Raune Frankjær, Rethink: Urban Interaction'' 10/2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger context, a site of urban acupuncture can be viewed as communicating to the city outside like a natural sign of life in a city programmed to subsume it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/37444/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Kelly Chan, Architizer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban acupuncture bears some similarities to the [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] concept of Tactical Urbanism. The idea focuses on local resources rather than capital-intensive municipal programs and promotes the idea of citizens installing and caring for interventions. These small changes, proponents claim, will boost community morale and catalyze revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newurbannetwork.com/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] – ''David West, New Urban Network'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016}} Boiled down to a simple statement, "urban acupuncture" means focusing on small, subtle, bottom-up interventions that harness and direct community energy in positive ways to heal urban blight and improve the cityscape. It is meant as an alternative to large, top-down, mega-interventions that typically require heavy investments of municipal funds (which many cities at the moment simply don't have) and the navigation of yards of bureaucratic [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisoldstreet.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/londons-urban-acupuncture-the-urban-physic-garden/ London’s Urban Acupuncture: The Urban Physic Garden] – '' This Old Street'' 8/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=December 2016}} The micro-scale interventions targeted by "urban acupuncture" appeal to both citizen-activists and cash-strapped communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415165829/http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities |date=15 April 2012 }} – '' David West, Better Cities &amp; Towns'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]] urban acupuncture converts temporary housing, like sheds in the slums, to simple homes that allow for "add-ons" later, based on need and affordability. This strategy transforms the slum zone, without relocating families that have been living together for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodtimes.my/index.php/Community/volunteer-group-builds-free-orang-asli-homes.html Star architect leaves it all to build homes for the poor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112060231/http://www.goodtimes.my/index.php/Community/volunteer-group-builds-free-orang-asli-homes.html |date=12 January 2012 }} – ''  Yam Phui Yee, Good Times – The Conscience of the Nation''&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa Urban Acupuncture is viewed as a possibility to provide a means for people to unlock their creativity and the advantages thereof, for example, innovation and entrepreneurship concentrating on parts of the city, i.e. communities thereby providing opportunities to those areas which do not have the sort of infrastructure that is found in mainstream cities.  This approach can provide a more realistic and less costly method for city planners and citizens as an effective way to make minor improvements in the communities in order to achieve a greater good in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fluxtrends.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=111&amp;limitstart=5 Urban Acupuncture] – ''  Mariam Mahomed, Urban Spaces 
Review'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jaime Lerner]], the former mayor of [[Curitiba]], suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; by focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, we{{Who|date=July 2012}} can initiate positive ripple effects for the greater society. Urban acupuncture reclaims the ownership of land to the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.davidson.edu/anthro16/space/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152838/http://forum.davidson.edu/anthro16/space/urban-acupuncture/ |date=25 April 2012 }} – '' Understanding Space'' 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It involves pinpointed interventions that can be accomplished quickly to release energy and create a positive ripple effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazilmax.com/news.cfm/tborigem/pl_south/id/10 Curitiba: Jaime Lerner’s Urban Acupuncture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204151632/http://www.brazilmax.com/news.cfm/tborigem/pl_south/id/10 |date=4 December 2011 }} – ''Bill Hinchberger, Brazilmax'' 2/2006&lt;/ref&gt;
He described in 2007:&lt;br /&gt;
"I believe that some medicinal "magic" can and should be applied to cities, as many are sick and some nearly terminal. As with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient, in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react; to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal, improve, and create positive chain reactions. It is indispensable in revitalizing interventions to make the organism work in a different way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese architect and academic Ti-Nan Chi is looking with micro urbanism at the vulnerable and insignificant side of contemporary cities around the world identified as micro-zones, points for recovery in which micro-projects have been carefully proposed to involve the public on different levels, aiming to resolve conflicts among property owners, villagers, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16364 Chi Ti-Nan develops a project to preserve Hong Kong coastline Tai Long Sai Wan] – '' World Architecture News'' 4/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A loosely affiliated team of architects [[Wang Shu]], Marco Casagrande, [[Hsieh Ying-chun]] and [[Roan Ching-yueh]] (sometimes called WEAK! Architecture) are describing the unofficial Instant City, or Instant Taipei, as architecture that uses the Official City as a ''growing platform and energy source, where to attach itself like a parasite and from where to leach the electricity and water… [The Instant City's] illegal urban farms or night markets is so widespread and deep rooted in the Taiwanese culture and cityscape that we could almost speak of another city on top of the "official" Taipei, a parallel city – or a para-city.'' WEAK! is calling urban acupuncture depending on the context as Illegal Architecture, Orchid Architecture, the People's Architecture, or Weak Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ Illegal Architecture in Taipei] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526043446/http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ |date=26 May 2012 }} – Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan'' Architizer 3/2011&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of urban acupuncture suggests that scores of small-scale, less costly and localized projects is what cities need in order to recover and renew themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberly Mok'' Treehugger 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award==
The winner of the Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award (DBUAA) Cape Town 2012 is the neighbourhood project "Mothers Unite" demonstrating the power of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mothersunite.org.za/2012/04/deutsche-bank-urban-age-award-19-april-2012/ Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award – 19 April 2012] – '' Mothers Unite'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers Unite was founded in 2007 and provides a safe haven from the gangsterism, drugs and violence that are part and parcel of street and home life in the area. Built with donated shipping containers, the village is made up of a library, kitchen, office, sheltered area, playground and food garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db.com/csr/en/social_investments/deutsche_bank_urban_age_award_2012_winner_announced.html Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award 2012 – winner announced] – '' Deutsche Bank Corporate Social Responsibility'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edgar Pieterse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Durable urban change is often about carefully targeted micro interventions that can change the energies and dynamics of a surrounding neighbourhood. When one engages with the physical manifestations that the tenacity, blood, sweat, and tears of the protagonists of Mothers Unite and Masiphumelele Library (another of the eight finalists) have created, the power of urban acupuncture is apparent. These projects serve as reminders that through vision, commitment over the long haul, and principle-based partnerships, just about any problem can be confronted and addressed.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown2014.co.za/2012/04/mothers-unite-urban-acupuncture-for-an-urban-age/ Mothers Unite: Urban acupuncture for an urban age] – '' Cape Town 2014 Live Design. Transform Life.'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Urban ecological restoration==
In ecological restoration of industrial cities Urban Acupuncture can take form as spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and [[Community gardening|community gardens]] punctuating the more mechanical city and tuning it towards a more sustainable co-existence with the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 Taipei Organic Acupuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, P2P Foundation'' 12/2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
Urban Acupuncture areas can receive, treat and [[recycle]] the waste from the surrounding city acting as eco-valleys within the urban fabric. In River Urbanism the Urban Acupuncture areas can include underground [[stormwater]] reservoirs and act as [[flood]] relief for the surrounding city as a [[sponge]] and they can act as [[Biofilter|biological filters]] purifying water originated from polluted rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecture.org/internal/content/download.asp?wdoc=urbanecopuncture-marcocasagrande.doc Urban Ecopuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, World Architecture'' 10/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Urban acupuncture is a point by point manipulation of the urban energy to create a sustainable town or city, which Marco Casagrande has dubbed '3rd Generation Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainablecities.dk/en/city-projects/cases/amsterdam-urban-acupuncture-creates-new-life-in-the-suburbs Amsterdam: Urban Acupuncture creates new life in the suburbs] – ''Danish Architecture Centre, Sustainable Cities'' 6/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban acupuncture in art==

American artist [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] is credited with developing a system for identifying pockets of disrepair in the built environment—the first step in the framework of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artist [[Miru Kim]] explores industrial [[ruin]]s and structures making her look at the city as one living organism. She claims to feel not only the skin of the city, but also to penetrate the inner layers of its intestines and veins, which swarm with minuscule life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/zh-tw/miru_kim_s_underground_art.html Miru Kim] – ''TED Talks'' 2/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a public [[environmental art]] work, Cicada, Casagrande explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Cicada is urban acupuncture for Taipei city penetrating the hard surfaces of industrial laziness in order to reach the original ground and get in touch with the collective Chi, the local knowledge that binds the people of [[Taipei basin]] with nature. The [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of Cicada is an accidental mediator between the modern man and reality. There is no other reality than nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberley Mok ''Treehugeer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental art as urban acupuncture is an artistic way of injecting a healthy dose of natural elements and human scale into the mechanized urban grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archetcetera.blogspot.com/2012/01/signs-of-life.html Signs of Life] – Phyllis Richardson ''Archetcetera'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish are an important component of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (WDFW) Toxics in Biota Program, part of the Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program (PSEMP, recently renamed from PSAMP). Since 1989 fish indicator species have been used to monitor contamination of [[Puget Sound]] by chemicals such as poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and metals. English Sole, the first species studied for the Toxics in Biota Program, have been used for monitoring by WDFW since 1989.  As of 2015 the program also monitors copper rockfish, quillback rockfish, brown rockfish, coho salmon, chinook salmon, Pacific herring, and Pacific staghorn sculpin. Exposure and effects of each contaminant are monitored for each species, and more in-depth studies of specific regions are performed if monitoring indicates a contamination problem.

Geographical characteristics making Puget Sound especially susceptible to contaminants include funneling of fish through narrow inlets, restricted exchange of water, shallow sea floor sills, and freshwater inputs from urban sources. One of the largest sources of contaminants is [[stormwater]] runoff. During heavy rain events metals, [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), and pesticides flow untreated into local waterways, streams, and lakes. Impervious surfaces such as roads provide a route for deposition of metals and POPs by cars and industrial emissions, before subsequent discharge into nearby water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Department of Ecology “Water. What is stormwater?”
{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/water/stormwater/overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801105202/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/water/stormwater/overview.html |archivedate=2015-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highly urbanized coastline of southern Puget Sound results in stormwater runoff containing high concentrations of contaminants.

==Three Study Types==

Three types of Toxics in Biota studies are performed by WDFW, usually in sequential order. Baseline Assessment Studies examine temporal tends in contaminants. Focus studies are performed in regions where Baseline Studies indicate contamination. Focus Studies provide specific spatial distributions of contaminants in Puget Sound regions and their effects on biota. Pilot Studies are used to test the assumptions of the two former studies. For example, a Baseline Study indicating high concentrations of PCBs in rockfish may lead to a Focus Study determining that endocrine systems of rockfish in that region may be disrupted by PAHs at these concentrations. Pilot Studies would then examine the extent to which factors like age influence disruption of rockfish endocrine systems. Pilot Studies are only necessary if there is no literature available to address the assumptions of Baseline and Focus Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. “Marine Toxic Contaminants. Study Design.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contaminants and Methods of Analysis==
===Contaminants===
Contaminants monitored in fish include [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), certain chlorinated pesticides, mercury, and lead. PAHs are commonly produced by burning organic matter, and can be carcinogenic. PCBs are highly toxic to aquatic life, persisting for long periods of time in the environment and bioaccumulating in organisms. PCBs are the class of contaminant most often identified in high enough concentrations to cause harm to Puget Sound fish.&lt;ref&gt;West, J. E., &amp; O’Neill, S. M. (1998). Persistent pollutants and factors affecting their accumulation in rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) from Puget Sound, Washington. Puget Sound Research'98 Proceedings. Puget Sound Water Quality Action Team, Seattle, WA, 336-345.
{{cite web |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01037/wdfw01037.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053037/http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01037/wdfw01037.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorinated pesticides like [[DDT]] are toxic to fish and persist for decades in the environment. Metals such as mercury can damage the central nervous system of fish.

===Analysis methods===
Methods used to measure exposure and effects from these contaminants include bioaccumulation in tissue and bile, liver lesions, endocrine disruption in male fish, and abundance of fish populations. The three types of studies performed by Fish and Wildlife examine changes in contaminant exposure over time, their spatial distribution, and the effects of exposure on each species of fish. These data are also used to issue human health advisories on the consumption of fish in Puget Sound based on Department of Health recommendations.

Several different assays are performed to quantify concentrations of these toxicants in fish tissues. Chemicals such as PAHs that are converted to metabolites within the fish are quantified by measuring concentrations of the metabolite using [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] and a quantification method. Metal concentrations in tissues are analyzed using [[atomic absorption]] methods.

===Spawning success===
[[Estrogenic]] substances in the environment can disrupt the sexual development of fish, inhibiting testicular growth and sperm production.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, P., Sumpter, J.P., 1998. Effects of estrogenic substances in the aquatic environment. EXS 86, 319–335&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomarkers]] are often used to monitor concentrations of these [[endocrine disruptors]] in the environment. [[Vitellogenin]], a sex-specific protein, is synthesized in the liver of fish in response to estrogen, a female hormone. This protein is produced when males have high concentrations of estrogens circulating in their bodies, indicating endocrine disruption. Quantification of vitellogenin is performed by measuring competitive binding to an enzyme in the presence of another identifiable protein, usually one that fluoresces.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, L. L., Lomax, D. P., Myers, M. S., Olson, O. P., Sol, S. Y., O’Neill, S. M., ... &amp; Collier, T. K. (2008). Xenoestrogen exposure and effects in English sole (Parophrys vetulus) from Puget Sound, WA. Aquatic Toxicology, 88(1), 29-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Liver disease is examined in English Sole as an indicator of PAH contaminated sediments by removing liver samples and searching for lesions under a microscope. Spawning success is determined by analysis of reproductive organs under a microscope and is compared with bioaccumulation of contaminants for correlation.

==Species Monitored==
WDFW monitors contaminant bioaccumulation and effects in Puget Sound fish that are abundant or ecologically valuable. Bioaccumulation of contaminants for each species is dependent on several factors. Fish that live longer, that do not migrate to other regions, and that live near sediments are more likely to be exposed to toxicants. In addition, fish at higher trophic levels and fish with high fat content accumulate more contaminants. The following species have been studied by WDFW in Puget Sound:

[[English sole]] were the first species monitored in the Toxics in Biota program. They live up to 21 years and are demersal, living close to sediments.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “Species Profiles: Life Histories and Environmental Requirements of Coastal Fishes and Invertebrates (Pacific Northwest). English Sole. “ (July 1989)  {{cite web |url=http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/species_profiles/82_11-101.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051530/http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/species_profiles/82_11-101.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because their movement within Puget Sound is limited and they are in contact with contaminated sediments, bioaccumulation of toxicants is reflective of contamination in regions where they are collected. From 1989 to 1999 English Sole were monitored annually for contaminant bioaccumulation and liver lesions. Since then bi-annual monitoring has occurred throughout Puget Sound, particularly in urban regions like Tacoma and Seattle.&lt;ref name="marine"&gt;Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. “Marine Toxic Contaminants. Species Monitored.”{{cite web |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/research/projects/marine_toxics/species_monitored.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508105253/http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/research/projects/marine_toxics/species_monitored.html |archivedate=2015-05-08 |df= }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockfish, another demersal species, are often in close association with toxic sediments and consume contaminated benthic invertebrates. They have an increased risk of exposure to contaminants because they can dwell within the same contaminated basins and inlets accumulating toxicants their entire lives, particularly in the central and southern Puget Sound basins.&lt;ref name= "marine"/&gt; Three species of rockfish have been monitored bi-annually since 1990. Quillback, copper, and brown rockfish are quite long-lived, with the oldest collected for the Toxics in Biota program estimated at 60, 46, and 27 years respectively.&lt;ref name= "marine"/&gt;

[[Pacific Herring]] are pelagic and have a large home range as adults, but when they spawn on near-shore habitats they become exposed to lipophilic molecules like PCBs. Fertilized herring eggs in contact with sediments during their 14-day incubation period are exposed to persistent bioaccumulative toxins at a particularly vulnerable stage of life. Because their life spans are generally under 6 years, tissue bioaccumulation of contaminants is reflective of recent environmental conditions. Baseline monitoring of herring has been carried out annually since 1999.&lt;ref name= "marine"/&gt;

[[Chinook salmon]] and [[coho salmon]] spend early life in freshwater and adult life in marine waters before returning to freshwater to spawn and die. This migratory life history exposes salmon to a wide variety of contaminants. Biomagnification of toxicants is often a problem in salmon due to a varied diet of benthic invertebrates and fish. The high fat content of salmon muscle tissue also increases accumulation of lipophilic contaminants. Coho and chinook have been monitored since 1990, with samples currently being taken twice each year.&lt;ref name= "marine"/&gt;

Pacific staghorn [[sculpin]] are another demersal species occupying a high trophic level, feeding on other fish and benthic invertebrates like crabs and mollusks. Their eggs are laid on muddy, sandy, or rocky substrates, allowing reproductive impairment studies to be performed on site. Restricted movement and a life span of up to 10 years makes bioaccumulation of toxicants in sculpin indicative of spatial patterns of contamination. The WDFW website does not indicate that Pacific staghorn sculpin are currently monitored however.&lt;ref name= "marine"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5891">The '''wind profile power law''' is a relationship between the wind speeds at one height, and those at another.

==Definition==

The wind profile power law relationship is :

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{u}{u_r} = \bigg(\frac{z}{z_r} \bigg)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the wind speed (in metres per second) at height &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; (in metres), and &lt;math&gt;u_r&lt;/math&gt; is the known wind speed at a reference height &lt;math&gt;z_r&lt;/math&gt;. The exponent (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) is an empirically derived coefficient that varies dependent upon the stability of the atmosphere.  For [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|neutral stability]] conditions, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is approximately 1/7, or 0.143.

In order to estimate the wind speed at a certain height ''z'', the relationship would be rearranged to:

:&lt;math&gt;u = u_r\bigg(\frac{z}{z_r} \bigg)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The value of 1/7 for α is commonly assumed to be constant in wind resource assessments, because the differences between the two levels are not usually so great as to introduce substantial errors into the estimates (usually &lt; 50 m).  However, when a constant exponent is used, it does not account for the roughness of the surface, the displacement of calm winds from the surface due to the presence of obstacles (i.e., zero-plane displacement), or the stability of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Touma, J.S., 1977, ''Dependence of the wind profile power law on stability for various locations'', J. Air Pollution Control Association, Vol. 27, pp. 863-866&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Counihan, J., 1975, ''Adiabatic atmospheric boundary layers: A review and analysis of data from the period 1880-1972'', Atmospheric Environment, Vol.79, pp. 871-905&lt;/ref&gt; In places where trees or structures impede the near-surface wind, the use of a constant 1/7 exponent may yield quite erroneous estimates, and the [[log wind profile]] is preferred. Even under neutral stability conditions, an exponent of 0.11 is more appropriate over open water (e.g., for offshore wind farms), than 0.143,&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, S.A., E.A. Meindl, and D.B. Gilhousen, 1994, ''Determining the power-law wind-profile exponent under near-neutral stability conditions at sea'', J. Appl. Meteor., Vol. 33,  pp. 757-765&lt;/ref&gt; which is more applicable over open land surfaces.

==Limits==

The wind profile of the atmospheric [[boundary layer]] (surface to around 2000 metres) is generally logarithmic in nature and is best approximated using the [[log wind profile]] equation that accounts for surface roughness and atmospheric [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stability]]. The relationships between surface power and wind are often used as an alternative to logarithmic wind features when surface roughness or stability information is not available.

==Applications==

The power law is often used in [[wind power]] assessments&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D.L., C.G. Holladay, W.R. Barchet, H.P. Foote, and W.F. Sandusky, 1986, Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, WA. [http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/ Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, E.W. and J.P. Hennessey, Jr., 1978, ''On the use of power laws for estimates of wind power potential'', J. Appl. Meteorology, Vol. 17, pp. 390-394&lt;/ref&gt; where wind speeds at the height of a turbine (
&lt;math&gt;\ge &lt;/math&gt; 50 metres) must be estimated from near surface wind observations (~10 metres), or where wind speed data at various heights must be adjusted to a standard height&lt;ref&gt;Robeson, S.M., and Shein, K.A., 1997, ''Spatial coherence and decay of wind speed and power in the north-central United States'', Physical Geography, Vol. 18, pp. 479-495&lt;/ref&gt; prior to use. Wind profiles are generated and used in a number of [[List of atmospheric dispersion models|atmospheric pollution dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power density===

Estimates of wind power density are presented as wind class, ranging from 1 to 7. The speeds are average wind speeds over the course of a year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/tables/A-8T.html Classes of wind power density at 10 m and 50 m]&lt;/ref&gt; although the frequency distribution of wind speed can provide different power densities for the same average wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/wind/pubs/atlas/tables/1-2T.html Comparison of annual average wind power at three sites with identical wind speeds.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>There should be another layer beneath the green sulfur bacteria zone which is most anaerobic and highest level of H₂S.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5346">[[Image:Winogradsky Week1.jpg|thumb|300px|right| This picture depicts the initial appearance of three different Winogradsky columns.  They are soil and water samples from a river, the later two columns have been modified with phosphate, nitrate, sulfur and oxygen additives. These additions promote the growth of various bacteria specific to the anaerobic and aerobic regions of the column.]]
[[Image:week7.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Shown above as a result of a 7-week period where the columns have been allowed to grow [[algae]], cyanobacteria and other bacterial colonies.  Of specific interest are the red regions of the middle column, indicative of purple non-sulfur bacteria (e.g. ''[[Rhodospirillaceae]]''). Also, in column three, the red growth along the side of the column: a purple sulfur bacterium, ''[[Chromatium]]''.]]

The '''Winogradsky column''' is a simple device for culturing a large diversity of [[microorganism]]s. Invented in the 1880s by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], the device is a column of pond mud and water mixed with a carbon source such as newspaper (containing [[cellulose]]), blackened marshmallows or egg-shells (containing [[calcium carbonate]]), and a [[sulfur]] source such as gypsum ([[calcium sulfate]]) or egg yolk.  Incubating the column in sunlight for months results in an [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]]/[[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] gradient as well as a sulfide gradient.  These two gradients promote the growth of different microorganisms such as ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'', ''[[Chlorobium]]'', ''[[Chromatium]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', and ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', as well as many other species of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae.

The column provides numerous gradients, depending on additive nutrients, from which the variety of aforementioned organisms can grow.  The aerobic water phase and anaerobic mud or soil phase are one such distinction. Because of oxygen's low solubility in water, the water quickly becomes [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] towards the interface of the mud and water.  Anaerobic phototrophs are still present to a large extent in the mud phase, and there is still capacity for biofilm creation and colony expansion, as shown in the images at right.  Algae and other aerobic phototrophs are present along the surface and water of the upper half of the columns.  Green growth is often attributed to these organisms.

==Construction==

The column is a rough mixture of ingredients – exact measurements are not critical. A tall glass (30&amp;nbsp;cm long, &gt;5&amp;nbsp;cm wide) is filled one third full of pond mud, omitting any sticks, debris, and air bubbles. Supplementation of ~0.25% w/w calcium carbonate and ~0.50% w/w calcium sulfate or sodium sulfate is required (ground eggshell and egg yolk respectively are rich in these minerals), mixed in with some shredded newspaper, filter paper or hay (for cellulose). An additional anaerobic layer, this time of unsupplemented mud, brings the container to two thirds full.  Alternatively, some procedures call for sand to be used for the layer above the enriched sediment as to allow for easier observation and sampling of resulting populations. This is followed by water from the pond to saturate the mud (or sand) and occupy half the remaining volume. The column is sealed tightly to prevent evaporation of water and incubated for several months in strong natural light.

After the column is sealed tightly the anaerobic bacteria will develop first, including ''Clostridium'' spp. These anaerobic bacteria will consume the cellulose as an energy source. Once this commences they create CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is used by other bacteria and thus the cycle begins. Eventually colour layers of different bacteria will appear in the column. At the bottom of the column will be black anaerobic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S dominated zone with sulfur reducing bacteria, the layer above will be green sulfur photosynthetic anaerobic bacteria, then the layer will be purple which is sulphur anaerobic bacteria, followed by another column of purple anaerobic non-sulfur bacteria and at the top will be a layer of Cyanobacteria which is sulphur oxidising bacteria. This top layer of aerobic bacteria, produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which feeds back into the column creating further reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Corner, T. (1992). Ecology in a Jar. The Science Teacher. (59)3, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Winogradsky column is an excellent tool to see whole communities of bacteria, it does not allow one to see the densities or individual bacterial colonies. It also takes a long time to complete its cycle. However its importance in environmental microbiology should not be overlooked and it is still an excellent tool to determine the major bacterial communities in a sample.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarin, G.A. (2006). Winogradsky and Modern Microbiology. Microbiology. (75)3, 501-511&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6367">'''Zhuang studies''' (or Zhuangology; [[Standard Zhuang]]: Cuenghhag; {{zh|t=壯學|s=壮学|p=Zhuàngxué}})  is an [[interdisciplinary]] intellectual field concerned with the [[Zhuang people]]&amp;nbsp;– their history, anthropology, religion, politics, [[Zhuang languages|languages]], and literature. The majority of such research is being carried out in the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Huang Xianfan]] (黄现璠) is considered by many to be the father of Zhuang studies.&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Areas commonly included under this rubric include [[history]] of Zhuang, [[literature]] of Zhuang, [[art]] of Zhuang, [[music]] of Zhuang, [[language]] of Zhuang, [[sociology]] of Zhuang, political science of Zhuang, [[economics]] of Zhuang, [[folklore]] of Zhuang, and ethnomusicology of Zhuang. It may be compared to other ethnic groups studies disciplines, such as Tai studies and Yao studies. Zhuang studies is sometimes included within a broader regional area of focus including: "[[Lingnan]] studies", "[[Baiyue|Yue people]] studies","[[South Asia]] studies", or "[[ASEAN]] Studies".

==History==
Zhuang studies is a relatively new discipline.

Huang Xianfan may be considered as the first Zhuangologist and he did much to make Zhuang known in China. Since 1950, Huang Xianfan led the group making a largest and deepest investigation on ethnic history and traditional [[culture]] in [[Guangxi]] history. They had collected a lot of valuable materials and laid a foundation for further research on Zhuang ethnic social and historical culture.That was a very important beginning for later development of Zhuang ethnic research and establishment of Guangxi institute of ethnic studies. Therefore, the inception of Zhuang studies as an authentic academic discipline is thus associated with the  first  ethnologist Huang Xianfan de Zhuang who is considered as its founder to present day,&lt;ref&gt;Mo jun:《A Master of Zhuang Studies》.Guangxi's daily, on 3 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; the other early zhuang studies of note being Huang Zengqing ([[Huang group]]'s member and the first archaeological researcher of the Guangxi) who in 1957 occupied the first chair for Zhuang's  [[archaeology]] studies in China and Zhou Zuoqiou, who was primarily the pioneering subject of the zhuang literature in [[Guangxi Normal University]].

The [[Huang group|Bagui School]] (The first ethnic school in [[China]] and pioneer is [[Huang Xianfan]]) was particularly significant for the development of the discipline since the early 1950s with Huang Xianfan, Huang Zengqing, Ban Xiouwen, Ou Yang Ruoxiou, Qin Cailuan, Qin Naichang, Qin Shengmin, He Longqun, Yu Shijie, Qin Deqing, Pan Qixu, Huang Hanjin and Zeng Chaoxiong.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTOTAL-HSKX200808010.htm Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology》, Guangxi Social Sciences，7th–11th Issues，2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-405985601120.html  Chen Ji Sheng:《On Bagui School of Chinese Ethnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the Guangxi government established the Guangxi institute of ethnic studies to promote Zhuang studies around China. In 1991 the Guangxi Zhuang Studies Society was established, and in April 1999 the first international Zhuang studies conference was held in Wuming with scholars from 8 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-MZYJ903.012.htm 郭爱民  :《壮学首届国际学术研讨会综述》, 《民族研究》 1999年03期]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last few decades in other countries the studies of the Zhuang have opened towards other disciplines, resulting in works with interdisciplinary approach. As examples of such open-minded Zhuang researcher we might mention the [[United States|American]] anthropologist Jeffrey Barlow, among others, who has done noted research and publications on lexical questions, about Zhuang culture  and the modern history of Zhuang. Others are [[Japanese people|Japanese]] anthropologist Chikada Sigeyuki, [[Australian]] anthropologist David Holm, and many more.

First, it is hoped that Chinese students whose majors are related to Zhuang studies would by reading this book be exposed to academic writing in English on relevant subjects. Second, it may be beneficial to English-speaking people who have an interest in the Zhuang, their history and their culture.
